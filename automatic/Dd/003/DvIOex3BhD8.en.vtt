00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and basically create some different

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.290 
and basically create some different
points<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:27.060> tip

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
points and so this is just a little tip

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.870 
points and so this is just a little tip
a<00:00:27.539> trick<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.109> I've<00:00:28.920> learned<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.490> wanted

attributes<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:59.120> first<00:03:59.360> attribute<00:03:59.960> is<00:04:00.140> max

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
attributes the first attribute is max

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.090 
attributes the first attribute is max
and<00:04:01.070> -<00:04:01.490> height<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.540> now<00:04:03.320> this<00:04:03.590> is<00:04:03.770> where<00:04:03.980> we

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
and - height and now this is where we

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.220 
and - height and now this is where we
establish<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.820> percentage<00:04:05.600> because<00:04:06.050> we're

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
establish a percentage because we're

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.650 
establish a percentage because we're
saying<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.370> maximum<00:04:07.880> height<00:04:08.060> that

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
saying this is the maximum height that

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.780 
saying this is the maximum height that
this<00:04:08.900> image<00:04:09.290> will<00:04:09.500> go<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.920> won't<00:04:10.160> go<00:04:10.310> beyond

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
this image will go it won't go beyond

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.630 
this image will go it won't go beyond
this<00:04:11.030> height<00:04:11.300> now<00:04:11.990> I'm<00:04:12.080> going<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.290> say<00:04:12.440> 90%<00:04:12.980> I

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
this height now I'm going to say 90% I

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.360 
this height now I'm going to say 90% I
don't<00:04:13.850> want<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.150> take<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.510> full<00:04:14.870> screen

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
don't want it to take the full screen

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.010 
don't want it to take the full screen
but<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.400> want<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.730> take<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.299> want<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.810> take

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
but I want to take it I want it to take

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.390 
but I want to take it I want it to take
most<00:04:18.410> of<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.590> screen<00:04:18.890> so<00:04:19.010> I'm<00:04:19.100> going<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.280> go

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
most of the screen so I'm going to go

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.280 
most of the screen so I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:19.520> and<00:04:19.700> say<00:04:19.790> max<00:04:20.090> height<00:04:20.390> that'd<00:04:20.660> be<00:04:20.870> 90%

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
ahead and say max height that'd be 90%

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.130 
ahead and say max height that'd be 90%
the<00:04:22.190> next<00:04:22.460> thing<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.729> max<00:04:23.090> width<00:04:23.600> so<00:04:23.960> I'm<00:04:23.990> going

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
the next thing is max width so I'm going

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.010 
the next thing is max width so I'm going
to<00:04:24.200> go<00:04:24.290> ahead<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.620> select<00:04:24.800> width

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
to go ahead and select width

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.710 
to go ahead and select width
and<00:04:26.490> then<00:04:27.490> I'm<00:04:27.639> going<00:04:27.789> to<00:04:27.819> also<00:04:28.090> have<00:04:28.479> this

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
and then I'm going to also have this

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.950 
and then I'm going to also have this
bead<00:04:29.009> 90%<00:04:30.009> now<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.180> does<00:04:31.419> not<00:04:31.660> mean<00:04:31.930> that

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
bead 90% now this does not mean that

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.050 
bead 90% now this does not mean that
it's<00:04:32.229> going<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.530> distort<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.400> image<00:04:33.430> at<00:04:33.910> all

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
it's going to distort the image at all

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.430 
it's going to distort the image at all
it's<00:04:34.300> actually<00:04:34.720> going<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.020> keep<00:04:35.259> the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
it's actually going to keep the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.499 
it's actually going to keep the
proportions<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.310> image<00:04:36.639> but<00:04:37.270> it's<00:04:37.419> just

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
proportions of the image but it's just

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.629 
proportions of the image but it's just
going<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.780> take<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.169> maximum<00:04:38.740> width<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:39.130> 90%

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
going to take the maximum width of 90%

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.460 
going to take the maximum width of 90%
so<00:04:40.150> it's<00:04:40.240> going<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.419> take<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.780> maximum<00:04:41.110> height

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
so it's going to take the maximum height

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.790 
so it's going to take the maximum height
of<00:04:41.610> 90%<00:04:42.610> as<00:04:42.759> well<00:04:43.240> but<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:43.960> not<00:04:44.229> going<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.590> go

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
of 90% as well but it's not going to go

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.939 
of 90% as well but it's not going to go
beyond<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.789> so<00:04:46.270> now<00:04:46.990> if<00:04:47.169> I<00:04:47.289> come<00:04:47.500> in<00:04:47.650> here

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
beyond that and so now if I come in here

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.279 
beyond that and so now if I come in here
now<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.310> just<00:04:48.430> need<00:04:48.759> to<00:04:48.819> link<00:04:49.449> inside<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.110> my

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
positions in the middle no matter how

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.300

what<00:06:19.180> my<00:06:19.300> size<00:06:19.539> is<00:06:19.810> so<00:06:19.990> if<00:06:20.110> I<00:06:20.169> resize<00:06:20.530> it<00:06:20.770> it's

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
what my size is so if I resize it it's

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.830 
what my size is so if I resize it it's
always<00:06:21.610> going<00:06:21.789> to<00:06:21.849> be<00:06:21.940> centered<00:06:22.449> and<00:06:22.719> it's

always going to be centered and it's

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.260 
always going to be centered and it's
always<00:06:23.020> going<00:06:23.319> to<00:06:23.440> resize<00:06:23.979> there<00:06:24.310> so<00:06:25.090> that's

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
always going to resize there so that's

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.930 
always going to resize there so that's
how<00:06:25.449> you<00:06:25.509> auto<00:06:25.900> size<00:06:26.319> your<00:06:26.620> images<00:06:26.889> inside<00:06:27.880> of

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
HTML which is the stimple was just some

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.810 
HTML which is the stimple was just some
simple<00:06:30.849> CSS<00:06:31.449> tricks
