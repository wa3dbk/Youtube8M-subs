00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.566
 Let us stick to this simple idea, 

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.966
 that we have a gene for the color of the eyes 

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.967
 and he has only two options. 

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.166
 There is a dominant option that 

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.367
 encodes brown color, 

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:15.500
 and a recessive option that 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.833
 encodes blue color. 

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.233
 So if one of your alleles is B, 

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.433
 you will have brown eyes. 

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.367
 The only way to have blue eyes is 

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:29.100
 to be homozygous for the recessive allele. 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.833
 Let's say that in a population, 

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.500
 large population, 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 corresponding to the assumptions of the equation Hardy-Wainberg, 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.900
 you observe that 9 percent 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.833
 of the population is blue. 

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.300
 Now we are talking about the phenotype. 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.633
 You can see that they have blue eyes. 

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:52.700
 Based on this, can we understand how p is, 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.300
 what is the frequency of the dominant allele? 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.833
 Can we understand? 

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:01.433
 Can we understand how q is, which is 

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.833
 the frequency of the recessive allele - can we also find this? 

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.300
 I encourage you to stop the video. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.433
 Based on what we saw about the equation of Hardy-Weinberg, 

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:14.330
 can we understand how many are these? 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.366
 Let's recall the equation. 

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.100
 In the previous video, 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.366
 but let me save it here. 

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:23.633
 It says: the allele frequency, 

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.233
 the dominant allelic square frequency 

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.166
 plus twice the dominant allelic frequency 

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.767
 on the recessive allele frequency 

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.566
 plus the recessive allelic frequency of a square 

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:36.967
 is equal to one. 

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.766
 And we saw that this came from the idea, 

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.600
 that p plus q equals one. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.760
 There is a 100% chance if it is random 

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:47.300
 you choose a gene to be one of these two options. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.833
 Now that we say that nine percent have blue eyes - 

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.166
 what this means? 

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.966
 The only way to have blue eyes 

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:57.700
 your genotype is homozygous recessive. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.330
 Because if you have B here, 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.567
 then you will have brown eyes. 

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:04.167
 So we can say that nine percent have this genotype. 

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:06.166
 Or you can say that the frequency in 

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.330
 the population of this genotype is nine percent. 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.863
 But we have already seen what it is 

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:13.833
 this article here. 

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.700
 This is a q member of a square. 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.966
 This is the probability, a way to think about it ... 

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.500
 q, of course, is the frequency of 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.100
 the recessive allele. Now you can look at this 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.449
 like the chance to get two recessive alleles. 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.566
 In your population it will be 9 percent. 

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:37.700
 We can say that q per square is equal to 9 percent. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.766
 Or seen otherwise, 

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:46.909
 the member here is nine percent or 0.09. 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.766
 Nine percent have this genotype. 

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.966
 This tells us this here. 

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.633
 Then we can understand q. 

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:56.100
 If q is square, write it as 0.09 - 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.634
 that means q will be 

00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:04.300
 0.09 per square - which is 0.3. 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.566
 That's how we got to know 

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.166
 the allelic frequency of the recessive allele. 

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:13.165
 And I could not write this as a percentage. 0.3 or 30 percent. 

00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:15.834
 If you look at the genes in the population, 

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:20.233
 30 percent means our code for 

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:25.033
 the recessive allele or the recessive variant. 

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:26.433
 Based on that, we can understand 

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.833
 what percentage of the dominant version is encoded. 

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.966
 The other genes have to encode 

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.033
 dominant, because 

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.366
 we assume there are only two types. 

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.166
 p plus q is equal to one hundred percent, 

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:37.766
 or p plus q is equal to one. 

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:41.500
 So it should be 70 percent. 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.869
 Based on this we can 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:44.966
 let's take another shot. 

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:46.500
 What is p of a square? 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.633
 p of square will be 70 per square, or 0.7 per square. 

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:57.900
 This here is 0.7 per square, which is 0.49. 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.966
 One way to imagine it is ... 

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:02.566
 Once again, this is just an equation, 

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.100
 but these clear ideas are starting to 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.700
 are cleared of this based on this information. 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.300
 Now we can say that 49 percent 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.756
 of the population will have a genotype 

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:17.033
 of B, will be a homozygous dominant. 

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.500
 And then we can find this here. 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.807
 Twice times per q. This will be 

00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:32.489
 twice 0.7 by 0.3. 

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:36.833
 Let's see this will be 2 by 0.21. 

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:42.166
 So here it will be 0.42. 

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:44.700
 In other words, 42 percent 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.140
 of the population will have 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.660
 genotype Bb. 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.833
 You see that the sum of all is 100. 

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:54.366
 49 percent plus 42 percent is 91 percent. 

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.976
 Plus 9 percent makes 100 percent. 

00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:00.566
 You get some information here 

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.766
 and based on what we know about allelic frequencies, 

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:04.567
 we allow some things and you can 

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.633
 get more knowledge about this population. 

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:10.463
 This really is very useful in real life, 

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:13.966
 when people think of a recessive allele, 

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:16.499
 which can cause some illness, for example. 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.166
 On the basis of the cases of this disease, 

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.366
 people can start thinking 

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:23.900
 "What percentage of the population is a medium?" 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.233
 For example, if they are heterozygotes for this disease. 

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:29.482
 This is really useful in real life.
