manga<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.600> manga

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
manga a manga

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.090 
manga a manga
I<00:02:30.170> think<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.500> Japanese<00:02:31.799> term<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:32.910> manga<00:02:34.100> not

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
I think the Japanese term it's manga not

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.240 
I think the Japanese term it's manga not
manga<00:02:35.549> I<00:02:35.850> think<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> u.s.<00:02:37.230> term<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.829> manga

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.280 

so<00:02:45.910> technically<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:47.380> not<00:02:47.440> wrong<00:02:47.770> either<00:02:48.780> but

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.870 

that<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:54.130> confusing

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
that it's confusing

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.120 
that it's confusing
am<00:02:55.660> i<00:02:55.750> right<00:02:58.500> that's<00:02:59.500> what<00:02:59.650> I'm<00:02:59.740> talking<00:03:00.070> about

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130
