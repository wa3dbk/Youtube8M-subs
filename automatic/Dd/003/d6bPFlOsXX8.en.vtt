00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.670
 is the dark side and this is the novel and 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.410
 Well, an unpublished story based on 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.320
 the novel to the character or someone of ours 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.500

 well as you know then of the trilogy in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.690
 the dark one and I really want to read it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.220
 it's very finite and it's very funny 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.960
 cookie so many thanks 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.970
 vitoria and now what comes to be 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.800
 the package we're going to see what it is that 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.800
 there is inside I think that is what it is 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.560
 you are going to see you and you 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.830
 this column 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.790
 well you see what it is is that non line 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.210
 a new york girl this is cost 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.220
 or whatever it is hardback what not 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.220
 I could wait for montena and 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.160
 he probably knows who the ones from the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.630
 sole is not known by name but is 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.480
 this one here that is a youtuber 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.550
 quite famous British I confess that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.300
 when the book came out I no longer followed the 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.250
 youtubers and I asked him because he called me 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.620
 very much attention the edition of 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.280
 done I did not even know who she was or 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.220
 you can imagine and that was 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.090
 two or three weeks and after ordering it 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.890
 I saw a video in plan in recommendations 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.130
 of this for water and I discovered that it is 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.720
 youtube after ordering the book well 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.090
 that I do not know how this appointment for a 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.010
 youtuber until you see how it's written to 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.790
 know how it is written but you know 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.670
 that are now publishing many 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.230
 youtubers so when I read it I'll tell you 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.700
 Why do not I know what to expect? 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.410
 decided that the attitude on youtube or 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.180
 they have written it to me that I entered because 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.450
 I do not know but as you can see the edition is 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.099
 very cool 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.629
 and the story caught my attention 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.030
 I asked for that and now that I know they're in 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.010
 youtube well I'll read it with more 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.540
 you really want to know how he writes 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 a youtuber or if he has written her and 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.530
 they comment then let's open this 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.530
 package that is the one that touches now 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.300
 so you can see everything with up here 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.590
 this king very well the valley packs are 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.959
 stop in the history or be the great 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.120
 crossing because it is the only publisher 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.970
 that puts the currents 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.740
 Well this is the box and I know what but I think 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.430
 that what I have is very nervous 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.500
 because I'm looking forward to seeing it so if 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.419
 I'm not wrong if a novelty of this 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.150
 month of a book that I have already read your 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.860
 first part and that I loved it I'm going 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.740
 to start attracting and gerardo both and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.830
 because that's not how you can 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.050
 two 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.050
 I thought I had broken myself 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.740
 it's almost there 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.289
 If you want to get me a pair of scissors from him 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.940
 boulou view live com profile 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.880
 or not 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.560
 so that you see it and I do not 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.560
 here is something that does not work 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.150
 this 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.870
 nothing 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.900
 this book I already have it I just opened a 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.020
 both 'csi' 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.090
 well nothing happens this is the second 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.350
 copy that I have of the false side of 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.760
 leave link that you have seen in this 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:41.460
 same video so I have two 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.530
 and this one here is the second part of 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.570
 fallen angels that I die I die 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.950
 I'm dying for the plaza, how good it is 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.260
 here because truth that has many 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.480
 want to read it and this is the cover is 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.140
 just as cool and that the first part 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.350
 the spine and the back cover have flaps 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.290
 has black wings painted here 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.090
 bat or something like that and 400 pages and 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.580
 then you have to put the second part 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.980
 of 'fallen angels' novel that if I 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.690
 you have been since Christmas or since before 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.430
 Christmas you know that I loved that you are 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.870
 in my top of best reading and that is 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.610
 in my books recommended to buy 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.430
 Christmas and they are all mixed because 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.930
 it's fantastic so I have so many 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.040
 desire for the second part of truth that 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.420
 have posted quite fast and of 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.310
 I'm dying to read it, so 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.840
 I'll tell you about it and then 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.960
 nothing has come to me another copy of the 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.630
 fake side of sally greene that I think that 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:35.040
 what I'm going to do with it is give it away 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.720
 or just raffle it or raffle it 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.580
 reflected on the issue of whether 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.050
 raffle not the fake side and I'm going to 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.450
 raffle because they have been commenting 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.460
 that there are not too many copies and for 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.729
 to have them at home I prefer to give it away 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.530
 then this draw is national you can 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.870
 win the copy of the fake that I just 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.479
 to teach you and for that what you have 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.740
 what to do is simply retweet the 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.569
 tweet that I leave in the little box 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.639

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.620
 less to me personally that I'm 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.419
 working on things related to what 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.800
