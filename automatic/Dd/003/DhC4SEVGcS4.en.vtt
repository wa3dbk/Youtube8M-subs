00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.160
 gameplay 1 game for today game under 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.710
 name year rampage 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.380
 This is a goat simulator but not the one we 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.660
 expect on while somewhat simpler but in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.530
 principle and despite being stolen idea 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.020
 to play 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.449
 kill time have fun in this game 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.980
 You can probably the most important thing is the game 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.070
 You can surprise your friends who 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.930
 they don’t know about such a project 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.880
 It is underway that very soon already 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.099
 April will be this awesome 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 simulator for while there will naturally be 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.300
 graphics and physics are much cooler than here 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.399
 but nevertheless, you can also 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.790
 run and have fun in the run-up to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.430
 the release of the main game and so we play for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.620
 the goat itself is the name of the game 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.579
 the goat can justify itself 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.809
 to be able to jump and our task 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.239
 bumped crashing into various objects 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 items and destroy them accordingly 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.199
 as much as possible the more objects you 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.140
 destroy with carry 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 the more points you earn and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 is it probably with me the essence of the game 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.119
 games in principle here can not kill you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.710
 die you can't your goal just 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.880
 have fun arrange destroy and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.409
 satisfy your martin ie 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.229
 the passion for destruction which 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.200
 present in every person but it is not 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.520
 I invented a well-known 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.920
 grandpa sigmund freud 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.390
 the game is called world rally racing and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 let's see what about ourselves 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.140
 imagine how cool she is 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 convenient that there is here 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 different types of cars but on them 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 you need to earn money and for now 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.110
 only the very first trend is available to me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 I only had enough money for him 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.979
 You can also upgrade your machine 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.930
 car 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.899
 on the four main points this 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.750
 move or accelerate the brakes and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.090
 tires well let's look at the game itself 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.909
 one race I already passed won the first 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.299
 place and now we will go perhaps in 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.240
 sweden and try to win here 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.700
 main prize of 5000 dollars and let's 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.320
 get started from the controls here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 there is only a steering wheel but on my 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.760
 glance you had to at least make a pedal 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 gas 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.440
 in order for it to be in the right 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.400
 parts of the screen and here the steering wheel is like 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.890
 would be the gas pedal and at the same time driving 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.410
 have with it you turn it 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.470
 not very convenient but in principle in the first 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 I got used to the race quickly and with this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.690
 could win this race and earn 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.580
 a little bit of money in order to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.320
 future to buy another car 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.630
 or upgrade this one in principle 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.630
 races are not bad but in terms of 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.090
 the controls are certainly not a little pumped up 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.400
 control is not very convenient not quite 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.000
 perfect and it turned out that 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.940
 all the same 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 the pedal to the right of the developers here 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.760
 insert them in no case 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.070
 prevented 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.340
 but in principle you can play the game but 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.070
 Of course I think for a long time she does not attract you 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.840
 because with such management to play 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.930
 far from comme il faut 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.510
 3 gran gas hares racing this race 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.250
 the atmosphere is probably a bit like 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.620
 good old game mafia 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.140
 what is remarkable about these races in the first place 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.630
 first you choose your car all 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.959
 they are free and available and well although not 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.880
 all I lied can choose a color and after 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.730
 this already proceed directly to 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.200
 the game itself what is its main feature 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.510
 the fact that here is present 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.430
 completely open world control in the game 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.700
 real using accelerometer 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.739
 no buttons and here you can say no 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.720
 attend by tapping the screen you 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.940
 slow down if you are too long 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
 to brake you turn on back 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.709
 speed at first I thought and what is it 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.790
 for the game you just need to drive through the open 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.160
 city ​​or what 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.940
 but it turned out not on the card to attend 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.180
 purple dots damn let's 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.610
 turn a little bit and now we’ll quit 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.310
 this gate here is not very good to me 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.410
 now it happened but nonetheless 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.650
 let's get out of here now 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.870
 still come out yes here now I have it 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.269
 turned out to do just believe on 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.850
 the camera is done not quite as easy 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.280
 This is done if I played just like that 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.950
 well so here a purple points if you 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.120
 you get to the purple point then there will be 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.519
 attend the gong and there you will 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.979
 huddle with three rivals that is you 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.389
 will need to take one of the three 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.860
 prizes here actually 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.389
 purple check point 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.970
 we call on him and we start the action 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.310
 respectively the race and so here is the track 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.740
 not allocated ie the world is still the same 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.229
 open even eragon to approximate more 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.360
 to real life you need to watch out for 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.760
 pointers that will be present 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.860
 as big arrows they will be you 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.400
 point where to go here by the way yellow 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.139
 arrow 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.550
 you can come at any time 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.650
 completely strassed and 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.940
 but it's no good will not 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.400
 because you are only 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.940
 and lose and fall behind your 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.710
 rivals here are such gonochki 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.620
 the only thing they lack some 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.350
 intelligible probably a plot of some kind 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.660
 intelligible probably tutorial because 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.160
 at first when only the game run 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.889
 absolutely not at all clear what 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.580
 happening and what do you all here 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.010
 required 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.680
 but I liked the idea of ​​being here 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.870
 there is such a mafia atmosphere 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.200
 I loved her very much probably more 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.840
 even more than gta3 because these games 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.000
 you walked about the same time but the mafia 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.690
 I was fascinated a lot more because 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.490
 she was probably somewhat more real and 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.229
 atmospheres last game will help you 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.690
 relax after a hard day and 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.270
 called on bam killer that is killer 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.940
 for their well then we proceed wait 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.250
 a small mouth load like this and after 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.539
 of this we ourselves will go to one of 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.789
 several worlds that are here 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.770
 are present as you see necessary 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.419
 kill a certain number of birds with one stone 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.280
 to open the next world and 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.349
 Well, let's proceed to the first and 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.780
 the only so far accessible world and 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.729
 try to play it you need 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.550
 click on the hares and then they will not 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:08.440
 just scatter like stuffing like pieces 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.030
 meat and for that you will accordingly 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.400
 receive a reward right now I took 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.229
 by the way a box with rockets and now I have 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.479
 a new type of weapon appeared 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.330
 she let's take guns using 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.830
 pistol shoot hares it too 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.449
 fun enough because they 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.999
 enough to 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:29.930
 hoo cruel very cool fly away 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:32.089
 into different small pieces the same pieces 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.669
 blood fall and on camera if you 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:37.400
 are too close so let's 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:40.490
 take another patron of and run 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.370
 probably another racket in a group of hares 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.199
 If we find them so I will not 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.419
 said but you already knew from a distance 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.370
 that with the accelerometer we can 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.889
 move on this little one 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.800
 the green planet on which these 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.509
 little fluffy cute creatures to all 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.909
 Thank you very much for your attention with you 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:02.680
 was Yuri Aksenov subscribe to the channel
