healthy<00:01:45.900> when<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.650> time<00:01:46.890> or

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
healthy when you don't have the time or

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.310 
healthy when you don't have the time or
the<00:01:47.340> resources<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.180> money<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the resources and the money I actually

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.570 
the resources and the money I actually
find<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.130> raw<00:01:50.700> food<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.960> most

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
find that raw food is the most

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.410 
find that raw food is the most
time-efficient<00:01:53.580> manner<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:54.210> which<00:01:54.240> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
time-efficient manner in which to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.960 
time-efficient manner in which to
prepare<00:01:54.569> food<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.830> most<00:01:56.009> economical<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
prepare food and the most economical and

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.029 
prepare food and the most economical and
I'll<00:01:57.210> explain<00:01:57.569> it<00:01:57.720> like<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.679> food

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
I'll explain it like this all food

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.700 
I'll explain it like this all food
starts<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.610> fresh<00:01:59.880> anyway<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.410> I'm<00:02:01.560> going

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
starts out fresh anyway so if I'm going

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.650 
starts out fresh anyway so if I'm going
to<00:02:01.770> make<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> tomato<00:02:02.460> soup<00:02:02.819> I<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.479> take

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
to make a tomato soup I will take

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.320

gazpacho it's ready to eat right out of

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.590 
gazpacho it's ready to eat right out of
the<00:02:12.960> blender<00:02:13.380> if<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:14.069> want<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.819> then<00:02:15.120> take<00:02:15.420> it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
the blender if I want I can then take it

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.480 
the blender if I want I can then take it
and<00:02:15.750> heat<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.140> up<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.470> saucepan<00:02:16.950> that's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and heat it up in a saucepan that's

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.760 
and heat it up in a saucepan that's
another<00:02:17.790> step<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.480> another<00:02:18.750> saucepan<00:02:19.110> you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
another step that's another saucepan you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.440 
another step that's another saucepan you
have<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.010> wait<00:02:20.220> again<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.000> saucepan<00:02:21.209> to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
have to wait again for the saucepan to

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.260 
have to wait again for the saucepan to
heat<00:02:21.720> up<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:22.230> gonna<00:02:22.380> heat<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.490> soup<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
heat up it's gonna heat up the soup and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.970 
heat up it's gonna heat up the soup and
it's<00:02:24.750> also<00:02:24.870> gonna<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.260> all<00:02:25.380> dry<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.680> crusty

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
it's also gonna get all dry and crusty

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.650 
it's also gonna get all dry and crusty
on<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:26.850> it'll<00:02:27.090> be<00:02:27.150> heated<00:02:27.420> up<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
on there but it'll be heated up and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600 
on there but it'll be heated up and
that's<00:02:27.840> fine<00:02:28.080> because<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.560> actually<00:02:28.980> recommend

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that's fine because I actually recommend

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.699 
that's fine because I actually recommend
that<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.150> want<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.510> warm<00:02:30.720> soup<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.500> much

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
that if you want a warm soup it's much

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.010 
that if you want a warm soup it's much
healthier<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.459> heat<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:33.030> raw<00:02:33.240> soup<00:02:33.569> anyway

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
healthier to heat up a raw soup anyway

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.600 
healthier to heat up a raw soup anyway
because<00:02:34.170> there's<00:02:34.380> no<00:02:34.500> pesticides<00:02:35.160> and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
because there's no pesticides and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.880 
because there's no pesticides and
herbicides<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.300> preservatives<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.560> have

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
herbicides and preservatives that have

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.670 
herbicides and preservatives that have
been<00:02:38.040> put<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:39.060> canned<00:02:39.510> soup<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:40.080> box<00:02:40.380> soups

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
been put into a canned soup or box soups

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.170 
been put into a canned soup or box soups
are<00:02:40.830> still<00:02:41.069> cleaner<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.610> healthier<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:42.150> us

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
are still cleaner and healthier for us

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.880 
are still cleaner and healthier for us
even<00:02:42.480> though<00:02:42.750> we're<00:02:42.900> decreasing<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
even though we're decreasing the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.710 
even though we're decreasing the
nutritional<00:02:44.430> profile<00:02:44.880> by<00:02:45.030> heating<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.540> and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
nutritional profile by heating it up and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.530 
nutritional profile by heating it up and
damaging<00:02:46.170> some<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.470> enzymes<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.160> good

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
damaging some of the enzymes is so good

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.630 
damaging some of the enzymes is so good
but<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.439> like<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> whole<00:02:48.709> nother<00:02:49.040> step<00:02:49.400> of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
but that's like a whole nother step of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.640 
but that's like a whole nother step of
heating<00:02:50.120> waiting<00:02:50.840> for<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.170> heat<00:02:51.349> up<00:02:51.379> and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
heating waiting for it to heat up and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.080 
heating waiting for it to heat up and
then<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.069> have<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.250> whole<00:02:52.370> nother<00:02:52.579> saucepan

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
then you have a whole nother saucepan

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.789 
then you have a whole nother saucepan
that<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.269> have<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.480> wash<00:02:53.659> so<00:02:54.409> in<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.650> example

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
that you have to wash so in that example

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.339 
that you have to wash so in that example
you<00:02:55.159> can<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.579> just<00:02:55.909> putting<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:56.870> things<00:02:57.079> into

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
you can see just putting the things into

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.690 
you can see just putting the things into
the<00:02:57.439> blender<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:58.010> ingredients<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.609> then

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
the blender the ingredients and then

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.880 
the blender the ingredients and then
blending<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.359> ready<00:02:59.689> to<00:02:59.870> go<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.560> find<00:03:00.799> that

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
blending this ready to go so I find that

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.860 
blending this ready to go so I find that
I<00:03:00.980> use<00:03:01.040> my<00:03:01.280> food<00:03:01.549> processor<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.150> use<00:03:02.480> my<00:03:02.599> blender

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
I use my food processor I use my blender

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.199 
I use my food processor I use my blender
first<00:03:03.379> and<00:03:03.620> foremost<00:03:03.980> all<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.370> time<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:04.879> it's

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
first and foremost all the time and it's

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.390 
first and foremost all the time and it's
so<00:03:05.420> fast<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:05.870> easy<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.379> when<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.069> go<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.310> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
so fast and easy and when I go to the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.039 
so fast and easy and when I go to the
farmers<00:03:07.760> market<00:03:07.819> I'm<00:03:08.359> really<00:03:08.629> lucky<00:03:08.810> because

everything in moderation anyway and then
