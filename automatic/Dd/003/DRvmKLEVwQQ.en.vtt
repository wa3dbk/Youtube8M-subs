00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 not very good, how good is your day 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.410
 a little bit because the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.900
 death of a new pilot in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.490
 actually in 2015 actually in the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.970
 history of the dakar the first one in this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.070
 2015 season is about the harnik missal 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.920
 a Polish driver who was debuting in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.330
 this competition that was 39 years old that 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.580
 I had already run some races 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.380
 other continents in abu dhabi also 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 in morocco after we had finished 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.420
 each of the competencies and with the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 intense heat could not meet the stage 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 at kilometer 206 this apparently without 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.620
 no sign of an accident 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.840
 it's probably talking about 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 already dehydrated glass is that the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.770
 life and adding a new victim this 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 competition yes you imagine you can 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.680
 get away with enough 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.010
 bad spine for a situation that returns 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.079
 to take charge of life this race mattia 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 Last night I listened to Miguel in the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.670
 spectacular program that makes the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.330
 Motta people productions on the 12th and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.340
 I listened to him 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.110
 do one give a pretty opinion 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.580
 reasoned that the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 organization should adjust 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.649
 definitely the regulations for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.299
 this test is already 63 dead this 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.619
 boy was the first time 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.580
 participated in the dakar a test that 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.710
 we say that the lizard size in addition 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.679
 of survival be the feeling that of 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 sports competition and anyone who 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.640
 more or less has some power or that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.159
 get some sponsor gets on a motorcycle 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.869
 gets into a car and participates in a 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.100
 so difficult test before a coast of the 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.539
 pilots who really run in the face 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.330
 in a sporty way with men 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.750
 Officials were 20-25 costs 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.730
 30 to 40 motorcycles 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.800
 official truck pilots the 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.250
 quadricycles did diego 15 and the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.270
 the rest are people with economic power 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.740
 millionaires around the world that you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 they like the bikes they like though 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 yes in the ease of paying an artifice 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.729
 to restart people to see can 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.750
 make an event of these characteristics 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.390
 there is a pilot in three years 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.340
 what of Argentina that if I hardly 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.990
 there are a lot of people that actually are 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.150
 entrepreneurs are making their 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.150
 economic activities throughout 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.980
 year and they come to run here if there is 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.810
 most of them maybe in the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.630
 physical preparation 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.099
 percent needed to go through in 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.130
 situations as extreme as those 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.709
 raises the state dakar 25 pilots 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.890
 rooms since the dakar is in 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.950
 South America were 5 200 dead 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.800
 most of them over 35 40 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.209
 years and none professionally and 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.250
 with some viewers it is also 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.290
 you the truth that is very akin to what 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.970
 has said miguel there should be a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.120
 kind of ranking on a question 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.739
 that they can measure the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.790
 sports capabilities of each of 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.769
 the pilots so that they do not happen 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.380
 where these systems continues days 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.000
 look they raised the camp well 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.620
 early the way to say success the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.040
 first motorcycle left four and a half of the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 tomorrow possible 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.780
 44 the last right is six and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.400
 fourth to the cars are 450 kilometers from 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.310
 link being by the glass is 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.049
 francisco at more than 4500 meters above 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.549
 sea level with a lot of cold comes 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.940
 up are going to make these two are happy 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.190
 from achilles 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.010
 from 2 and a half and the first 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.960
 motorcycle will be lengthening as of 320 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.790
 kilometers over the desert in copiapÃ³ 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.740
 in atacama so now spirit 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.990
 thermal radiation important cold 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.420
 at the intersection at dawn and after 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.700
 a lot of heat in the desert so 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.610
 surely you are going to wait for a stage 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.380
 extremely complicated where many of the 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.820
 pilots change me especially they go to 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.950
 It is nearing the end of time 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.020
 news went from 70 degrees in some 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.620
 temperature moment to cold there 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.390
 desert on top in height in 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.030
 atacama and then I go back another 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.490
 Once the high - temperature heat and 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.590
 pilots were with oxygen to be able 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.320
 support another 1500 meters above 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.940
 sea level is also by francisco 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.130
 some with coca leaves and very 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.720
 warm and those clothes after the 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.250
 they have to get out when they write they arrive 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.810
 before the spice the organization 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.360
 he wears the clothes that they have 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.150
 to be able to perform the special test 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.100
 because later it adds up to 30 35 40 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.400
 degrees and much more inside the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.160
 vehicles so you 're in the tests 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.350
 extreme different height awaits us 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.270
 and precisely for what we leave 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.100
 in request nothing else you have to be very 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.410
 well prepared physically but on 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.520
 all mentally to be able to cope 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:53.660
 these things in 2011 a French pilot 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.510
 in 2015 in 2013 sorry 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.370
 thomas burgess crossing the step of jama 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.040
 more than four thousand meters in height 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.639
 He slept because of the situation that 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.669
 why I said for being so high is 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.919
 it happened from the opposite side of the lane 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.660
 and collided head-on with a patrician 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.669
 Carabinier there lost his life already 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.650
 he did running he did it crossing the 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.360
 cordillera good all these things are 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.800
 those that generate this reality have to 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.810
 have a little more care well 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.760
 thank you matias a hug we go back in 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.200
 any thanks to you 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.200
 take it course
