00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.979
 the judge 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.309
 around 8 pm globally the gold that will see how are these 

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:21.279
 a few days in prague he said how many finalists you had 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.339
 been 50 finalists and the challenge that wants dumontier yes 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.480
 because in about forty countries I think 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.579
 it's enormous 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.680
 and yet been spotted when he arrived at this contest m 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 herved photos in 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.470
 classy it's human to go to Lille 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 otherwise present in progress and storms but when we get dirty very quickly 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.410
 it was exhilarating 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 I returned 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.950
 it's about twenty 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.160
 volume 2006 in this case time the elite coat of arms 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 jacques martin is not embarrassed seat I was my 16 years old doing a little more 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.440
 who are you want to live 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 the flop gives cubaynes presenting for the elite 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.380
 and it was very quickly the swell ended the restoration bp 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.960
 operated 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.350
 a movie yes you exercised at Pau during the last one already at the port but 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.190
 municipal 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.550
 at mid-season I started working every weekend 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.820
 so percent and benji I did not say anything 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.190
 annecy the world 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.520
 playing a lot laurent blanc remains present 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.110
 tf1 might think it's not bluff 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.670
 so that's what happened last year instead of saying 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490
 how did you live that 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.530
 the mayor 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.500
 he passed passed just history to get away 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.069
 but finally done 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.560
 oh yes no really I never talked about these images 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.669
 it troubles you 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.250
 you did parades% and so for jean-paul gautier I think 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.799
 yes the pictures of you 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.070
 but yes I had done since 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.539
 not necessarily when it's big opportunity that 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.709
 kiss comes we can not miss them 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.089
 so for others other designers and if it was that happiness 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.809
 what was she doing winning this contest brings you 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:28.599
 concretely 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.849
 a two-year contract with the Shiites 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.289
 so a just stable 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.289
 it's a small amount of money we shared with 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.769
 with the other two 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.039
 and if you have the assurance to do 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.789
 1 the shopkeeper of prestigious euros magazine 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.879
 I do not know either was pomp not marked against after his customers who 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.159
 decide but 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.709
 to arrange too much for me 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.769
 for today's days will be charged 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.510
 many yes it seems a day a lot of casino going through 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.989
 castings that you are selected by a pigment it's real competition 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.009
 recruit 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.479
 Well, as it is very recent I think we are selected a little more 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.819
 quickly 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.179
 but percent but I think I still cast for those who 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.719
 like to have the real end 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.319
 the person actually 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.529
 there you are tourcoing where you go 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.079
 that's why you changed your way of life 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.809
 I think people forget quickly 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.109
 but a goal and a bull by the horns a bet 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.029
 governed only one day 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:25.299
 and what attracts you 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.449
 in this job 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.329
 I spent these pictures sc 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.980
 at the end of June the deficit I like to look at magazines at the layout 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.789
 of time in general 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.560
 so it was going to challenge 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 but it does not matter i think what wimille and traveling 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.119
 Ammann does not have much time either to watch but 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.629
 travel and travel 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.669
 but for a little bit of people 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.289
 that's what these after cinema like 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.369
 I do not know yet 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.489
 good it is necessary to save to apply this world of sharks 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.219
 the picture is accompanied so it goes 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.669
 no yes yes 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.930
 what about the concrete impact
