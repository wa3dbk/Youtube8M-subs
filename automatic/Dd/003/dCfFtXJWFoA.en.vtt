00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940
 of the republic macky sall photo will be 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:11.330
 the texier so came out not frankly 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.280
 the meeting was not for 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.780
 the hearing with the president of the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.289
 republic it's true that the president 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.769
 received me but it was a threat and a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.320
 meeting of mobilization especially 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.180
 troops in preparation for the elections 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
 upcoming municipal 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109
 as you have seen 1 there has been 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.870
 a strong one that carries a strong 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.800
 mobilization that once demonstrates 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.379
 more than the shovel 3 I have a good presence 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.649
 as long as I 'd say it's even 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.780
 knows the first political force of the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.410
 pikine department and maybe even 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 from the department of katie white and well 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.930
 as you may have heard us maybe 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.579
 have received many solicitations 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.410
 from several parties 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.830
 policies it's not just two 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.590
 parts of the president madam this moment in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.369
 working on the modalities 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.479
 practices that we are going to put in 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.630
 work to join a coalition for 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 to make a covenant with another with my 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 gone then let's study this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.770
 are there several proposals 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.229
 it's not just the proposal of the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 head of state but what I can already 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.810
 tell you the head of state first 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.230
 he's a very long time friend 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.910
 and it's someone who has 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.210
 I knew in the party 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.390
 Senegalese democracy with whom I 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.120
 shares liberalism and with which 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.120
 I also share this social fiber 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.820
 very strong dakar he is in the process of 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.520
 work on the social plane there are 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.770
 many things we share 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.710
 but I'm not saying we're going to go 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.920
 with the apn muse we are in the process 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.840
 to study the proposals made by 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.380
 all parties and after we go 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.390
 formalize our our choice and we 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.550
 let's take the militant left hand 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.290
 they have museum class as a candidate for 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.950
 the city hall of pikine is what in 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.930
 this alliance 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.850
 you will put yourself out at best 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.560
 you have in any case anyway 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.180
 as you said besides the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.810
 responsible come to invest me 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.620
 as candidate for mayor of that 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.650
 I accepted 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.500
 so I can not afford 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.140
 today to say I 'll be behind 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.320
 whoever it is I am party leader and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.190
 to finish long is a list and 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.280
 earned the department my department that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.350
 I love that I love and for which I have 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.840
 many projects where material fact 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.830
 not wanting to be in front to be 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.320
 before I want I have a great ambition 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.250
 cooking and the pikinois and I dream of 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.560
 materialize this year 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.880
 then you are proclaimed in August in 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.790
 the political arena in the suburbs 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.380
 France emond inevitably so promised that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.510
 we will take in thinking but by 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.910
 three months we will see what are the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.910
 responsible who nickname me fear 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.310
 water because in politics 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.530
 so I said to myself since karen water 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.990
 at the level of the fight 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.750
 it's something smart and 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.850
 sublime and he's doing the fight with 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.450
 a lot of finesse and so it's a bit 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.850
 on our makes us happy but we 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.050
 let's continue anyway you know 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.420
 politics is a lot of 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.010
 negotiations we are in the process of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.140
 negotiate we will continue the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.390
 negotiations but what can I do you 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.180
 to say is that my great ambition my 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.650
 love my ambition for pikine 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:01.270
 I'm not going I'm never going 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:03.790
 give up listen listen we live we live 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.000
 this management anyway I can not 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.580
 I do not speak to you that we live this 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.430
 management since pikine deserves more 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.160
 that that's me I think that more than he 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.140
 deserves more consideration 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.120
 I had to have it right away then 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.459
 to be a new city 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.860
 but for it to be bad 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.350
 new you still need to g new 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.630
 hospitals whose program will run 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.699
 around the youth the friend a 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.979
 better support for problems 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.760
 young people a program that will turn 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.370
 around the care of health 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.410
 kindergarten of the same way health 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.620
 general would only put samu 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.840
 social to pikine already for that I lived 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.740
 all black who have a lot of 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.810
 are difficult to access 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.500
 also youth unemployment which is 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.720
 problematic also the floods 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.940
 and duchamp there is better there is 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.820
 really work to do and my 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.460
 team is determined to do this job 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.530
 because we have solutions to 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.039
 problems of the Chinese and that's it 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.039
 the essential
