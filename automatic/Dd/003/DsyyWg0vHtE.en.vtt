00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.920
 Hello, friends, how are you all going? 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.170
 really that they are all very well 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.809
 first of all we want to thank you for 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.250
 whole heart as we always do 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.349
 really to support us and that we 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.939
 accompany as always the other side today 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.710
 the truth that for us is one day 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.619
 very sad we did not feel absolutely 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.840
 for nothing well is not what we 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.170
 we preach daily but it's the one 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.109
 it touched us today as you know 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.340
 It has been more than three years since 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.610
 working with our neighbors 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.530
 perfect since November 2011 for 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.480
 be a little more exact that we come 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.670
 working tirelessly with this 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.519
 absolutely paddling all kinds of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.110
 situation that this has been overcome we have 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.150
 past needs we have passed 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.760
 really difficult situations for 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.170
 to be able to hold it and to be able to 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.909
 implement this engine that grows day to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.890
 day and that just our visions 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.140
 of the world to bring you this perfect style 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.540
 everyone is willing for all 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.220
 you all did that because 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.930
 we trust in our dream because 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.720
 perfect destination is the dream in our 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.060
 lives and we really want to get to it 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.580
 We will work very hard as 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.890
 we have been doing for three years 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.560
 what happened to us because it gave us 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.120
 a letter informing us that 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.150
 we can not continue using 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.400
 our perfect destination brand 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.980
 legally we can not continue doing it 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.530
 because there is a program that is broadcast by 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.690
 telefÃ© a program that shows different 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.060
 parts of the world is a program of 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.640
 marley the program is called destiny 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.620
 perfect we advise you legally by 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.170
 a lot of ways finished defining 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.260
 we can not do anything and no longer 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.720
 we can continue to use this brand is 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.760
 a sad news for us because 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.250
 we register this brand in 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.979
 November 2013 we are in April of the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.740
 2015 and this program takes us more than 5 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.530
 months in the air 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.049
 in this case the truth is that we can not 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.329
 be more saddened you know what 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.520
 which means destiny for us and what 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.189
 what does our philosophy of life mean? 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.920
 it is law but optimism and we 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.360
 we want to show it in that way that 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.160
 we feel that our 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.099
 optimism was put to the test all that 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.810
 we preach every day and the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.239
 truth is that we feel very 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.849
 devastated today we try for 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.390
 all means and today we accept to 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.340
 you because the perfect destiny has 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.530
 what to do with something very important 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.269
 at the beginning it has to do with our 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.099
 identity the rooms at the moment 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.489
 We decided to call more of perfect style 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.569
 because this concept encompasses 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.879
 absolutely all our essence 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.950
 our way of thinking our way of 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.319
 dress our attitude our 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.319
 songs what we're wanting in 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.790
 this situation is to be able to approach the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.860
 Marley production or talk 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.410
 directly with magnet so we can 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.209
 understand us and we're going to explain to you that 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.040
 we are a pop band that does not 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.260
 we are going to harm your work in what 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.569
 absolute but in our name that 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.910
 we love each other like this a very long time ago 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.190
 and this form to our work would be 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.950
 completely thrown in the trash for 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.239
 an institution a name nothing but for 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.519
 people who come from below as 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.459
 we who had it in the way nice as 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.410
 we are really very difficult them 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.450
 we want to ask for the opportunity to be able 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.220
 talk about being able to tell what happened 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.870
 to be able to show what it is that we 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.299
 do we are artists do 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.819
 many years and what we do in the 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.080
 Today is all our work from 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.300
 we are chiquititos 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.160
 the truth is that having this conflict 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.720
 with more hair with telefe is not something that 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.630
 we had in plan really 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.190
 neither do we have a conflict 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.630
 because we do not want to have any 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.220
 problem with nobody we only want 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.900
 keep working doing our 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.240
 music our folios and be able to live 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.160
 but that we love that is the art 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.860
 it's only the opportunity to be able 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.140
 talk for a while to see if 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.060
 we can reach an agreement and have one 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.160
 of us leave damaged destination 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.090
 perfect thanks them wholeheartedly what 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.070
 what can they do for us 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.790
 share it with us is a lot of help 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.790
 much
