00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello here is the voice loud city 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.180
 insert and welcome to 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.859
 a 103 gameplay on the parade yes it 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.240
 is right again but I can you 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.370
 I will not say in the near future 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.080
 So much is uploading from this web only 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.089
 I do not think this gameplay is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.250
 as standard as it might be 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.539
 in the first moment left because I have 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.400
 not played here with dogs or swan 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.320
 but someone has something else for me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.369
 wants to come up with a combination of that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.619
 is also what I lately 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 actually most often do because it is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.529
 Somehow in black ops 2 it is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 really nothing special with two 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.740
 dogs and all the tricks gameplays 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.540
 to earn 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.930
 there are so many people the first 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.370
 create and overall too 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.379
 many of these gameplays already 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.730
 now on youtube and therefore 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.350
 I will not because I somehow with 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.149
 the broad mass but identify 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.950
 I have always been his somehow 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.079
 own gone is also in mw3 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.910
 I never really have tomorrow 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.379
 simply do not happen so yes it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.699
 was not who I lovely thing 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 but I have it next to it today 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.390
 played and that was somehow that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.010
 me in call of duty always the most 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 It was just fun 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.250
 to go to gravel , however, I think 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 it just personal black ops 2 too 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 easy and if something somehow 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.520
 I'm a little undemanding 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 I do not really feel like it either 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 time to invest and a brand as 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.460
 also recently in one of his committees 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.990
 He said he does not want to break 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.560
 the whole time only 100 plus 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.119
 Upload 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.110
 simply because you did not say so 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.570
 from the broad masses with these 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.280
 Gameplay does not really stand out like that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.680
 in which youtube standard sinks 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.110
 and just mark james actually one 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.430
 player is not in any way 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.869
 can identify and I am 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.250
 I do not really want to 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.549
 not always identify with him 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.600
 everyone else is doing and therefore 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.619
 I try them other case mix 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.960
 out and here I have one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.720
 bit the on the rated killstreaks 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 taken away because these killstreaks the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.810
 Here she was really extreme 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.729
 strong but really extreme 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.829
 set low so one of the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.840
 Lightning strike that certainly almost everyone 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.030
 meanwhile, he knows that he is extremely good 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.670
 the other is a helicopter of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.960
 his medium high gets then is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.460
 where you have to be careful where 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.990
 So they placed him on a straight 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.280
 yes, the sports website really can 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.780
 flipping very fast and then if you can 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.520
 the telecom for example at as 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.979
 laage has placed where the opponents first 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.209
 then were my own rows for it 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.679
 the against it cs bonn 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.849
 then the thani is somehow almost 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.380
 useless I would recommend you 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.780
 always somehow put him in the 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.980
 the card works because of trade 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.360
 actually pretty good but there are 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.920
 also cards where the heli then really 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.540
 no gravel, for example, opens up 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.560
 the new map in iran stands that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.330
 not if you 're right there in the middle 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.980
 just can not place myself then 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.600
 shoot down because of this roof of 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.130
 the house, so to speak, the ones themselves 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.630
 blocked so there you have a bit 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.890
 watch out here on raid works 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.120
 but wonderful if you are here 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.040
 never really right in the middle of the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.330
 card last is really totally off 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.490
 and then at the end I had that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.820
 lothar so a little higher 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.920
 blooms then and yes must say also the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.500
 Crate is actually for the height 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.180
 a bit too low because 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.590
 if you go with the dogs 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.760
 then compares the dogs are 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.360
 actually much weaker than that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.920
 loud star 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.330
 even if you have the term , so to speak 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.640
 The dogs have to control themselves 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.310
 Hold your own thing like that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.900
 but I still think that the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.670
 dogs actually were too weak 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.230
 look at two and the volume too 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.720
 clearly in relation to the vital unit 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.460
 stronger is in any case the 3 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.250
 Strikes that you can really recommend 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.410
 I really have others now too 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.420
 Combinations that I am there with those of me 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.950
 few gameplay plays have also partially 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.630
 have torn nokias tricks 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.760
 for example, I still have a 92 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.770
 Gameplay with drone hunter killer and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.270
 So lightning he thus plays that 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.160
 the lowest kinski combination the 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.560
 actually possible except me 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.060
 still packed the remote sensing but 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.550
 so that's 92 ps that's somehow 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.380
 yes quite blatantly and let's see if 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.460
 i will upload that i will have 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.990
 really many gameplay 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.800
 meanwhile also from others 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.270
 call of duty 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.220
 That's why I had to watch what I did 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.760
 because then upload at the very end 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.250
 will 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.450
 And yes, I wanted to have one like that today 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.709
 a lot of people talk about that 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.030
 you always ask me here you can not 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.500
 time with the weapons in the gameplay 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.340
 you can not or do not even play that 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.660
 Try it for us 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.770
 For me it 's just like that with case 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.690
 I do not think tricks are that bad 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.950
 I really like to go 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.840
 by also between that I have also in 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.890
 other cod then share quite happy 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.170
 that made me something else 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.370
 tried but the problem s.der 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.780
 thing is weapons I have there 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.720
 Somehow my own opinion 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.010
 that's what I am for example 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.120
 I have a very long time on one 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.500
 bad connection played and there 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.020
 It was always that anyway 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.270
 best if you take something better weapon 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.650
 and, so to speak, the connection disadvantages 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.910
 to be able to compensate a little bit 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.109
 but there are others 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.810
 Why do I prefer much more? 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.760
 with strong first with weak leave 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.110
 because if I'm weak with 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.280
 I said weak already now 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.200
 weak weapons games then I have 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.580
 always the feeling when I cash in dead 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.440
 that it was not my own fault 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.510
 but my weapon and with this 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.220
 feeling or knowing with this i can 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.150
 somehow not working properly and me 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.669
 I want you very quickly 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.990
 motivation on these weapons and will 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.310
 if it is so if I am strong 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.600
 weapons games then I know exactly mister 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.460
 I have the strongest weapon I have 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.870
 it is in the game so it must be up to me 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.300
 lie when I ruin the gameplay 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.800
 and it can not speak to the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.780
 the opponent or my weapon 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.220
 lie or something else but lie 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.260
 it is up to me if I the the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.760
 For example, lose a fight and 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.139
 that's why this is a reason, for example 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.610
 why I have the strong weapons 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.780
 mostly use and why to me 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.280
 really the most fun with 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.870
 to play strong weapons and to 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.620
 other that it so i like the weapons 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.050
 are constant 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.580
 I hate guns that way 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.020
 Feel like that on many but me 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.360
 I'm the weapon I have exactly 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.120
 knows that you are always on the point 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.710
 will bring what you expect from her 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.240
 and that's one reason why 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.740
 I hate playing with shotguns 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.240
 simply because you have this 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.370
 weapons can be very difficult because 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.600
 they are very unpredictable and you just 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.150
 can never say exactly how many shots 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.620
 you get the opponent now and take 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.419
 That's why I'm somebody, somehow 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.979
 shotgun's player for his gameplay 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.990
 but this will probably never be the weapons group 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.490
 I'm the one I favor 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.229
 Actually, he's always the assault rifle 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.590
 player even if black ops 2 actually 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.669
 so the weapons group really everyone 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.169
 situation can actually dominate 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.400
 more or less the machine pistols 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.930
 are and not the storm rifles anymore 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.450
 what is now not necessarily making it what 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.350
 I wish but did it 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.700
 but once again fun with 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.650
 to play machine pistols and of 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.090
 So I take what it is I hope 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.650
 that you liked and liked comments 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.039
 that 's what i say in the place of the to 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.039
 next time
