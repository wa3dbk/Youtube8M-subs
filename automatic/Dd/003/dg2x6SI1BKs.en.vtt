for<00:00:00.269> a<00:00:00.329> cloak<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:00.659> think<00:00:00.960> flashes<00:00:01.709> rush<00:00:01.949> has

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
for a cloak I think flashes rush has

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.249 
for a cloak I think flashes rush has
basically<00:00:02.850> not<00:00:03.090> succeeded<00:00:03.659> in<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:03.870> game<00:00:04.080> so

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
basically not succeeded in this game so

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.220 
basically not succeeded in this game so

energy<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.520> cloak<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.970> wonder<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.360> flash<00:01:15.540> has

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
energy for cloak I wonder if flash has

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
energy for cloak I wonder if flash has
an<00:01:15.930> academy<00:01:16.350> at<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.590> right<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:16.950> he's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
an academy at all right now he's

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.590 
an academy at all right now he's
actually<00:01:17.640> building<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> engineering<00:01:18.479> Bay

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
actually building the engineering Bay

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
actually building the engineering Bay
and<00:01:18.810> he<00:01:19.470> actually<00:01:19.619> does<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> Academy<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and he actually does have the Academy so

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.880 
and he actually does have the Academy so
he<00:01:20.759> will<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.330> some<00:01:21.479> concept<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.110> he's<00:01:22.770> not

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
he will get some concept but he's not

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.350 
he will get some concept but he's not
gonna<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.159> much<00:01:23.400> energy<00:01:23.610> built<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
gonna have that much energy built up and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690 
gonna have that much energy built up and

think<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.090> might<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.450> been<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> little

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
think what might have been a little

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
think what might have been a little
mistake<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> dropship<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
mistake not to go for the dropship I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
mistake not to go for the dropship I
thought<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.240> flash<00:01:30.479> she's<00:01:30.659> going

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
thought that was what flash she's going

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.660 
thought that was what flash she's going
to<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:32.159> Ruby<00:01:32.430> would<00:01:32.579> have

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to do and I don't think Ruby would have

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219 
to do and I don't think Ruby would have
been<00:01:32.790> able<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> counter<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.570> early<00:01:33.810> drop<00:01:34.020> very

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
been able to counter an early drop very

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.740 
been able to counter an early drop very
well<00:01:34.490> flash<00:01:35.490> getting<00:01:35.820> engineering<00:01:36.479> day<00:01:36.600> now

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
well flash getting engineering day now

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.910 
well flash getting engineering day now
actually<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.619> Ruby's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
actually I think I was Ruby's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.069 
actually I think I was Ruby's
engineering<00:01:38.340> Bay<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> saw<00:01:38.670> before<00:01:38.900> Ruby<00:01:39.900> with

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
engineering Bay I saw before Ruby with

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.569 
engineering Bay I saw before Ruby with
five<00:01:40.500> tanks<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.009> front<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.430> don't<00:01:41.549> think

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
five tanks in front I don't think

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.940 
five tanks in front I don't think
punishes<00:01:42.030> any<00:01:42.240> tanks<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:43.890> he

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
punishes any tanks right now I think he

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.819 
punishes any tanks right now I think he
lost<00:01:44.100> his<00:01:44.310> tanks<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> early<00:01:45.360> push<00:01:45.829> and

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
lost his tanks at that early push and

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.090 
lost his tanks at that early push and
Ruby<00:01:47.790> actually<00:01:48.090> building<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.450> turn

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
Ruby actually building a turn

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
Ruby actually building a turn
overlooking<00:01:50.100> his<00:01:50.130> his<00:01:50.790> cliff<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> that's<00:01:51.899> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
overlooking his his cliff and that's I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.080 
overlooking his his cliff and that's I
think<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.470> good<00:01:52.560> idea<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.100> think

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
think that's a good idea I think

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
think that's a good idea I think
basically<00:01:54.689> denying<00:01:55.170> drops<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.619> would<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
basically denying drops there would be a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.190 
basically denying drops there would be a
very<00:01:56.130> good<00:01:56.250> idea<00:01:56.369> Ruby<00:01:56.729> without<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.509> idle<00:01:57.840> SCV

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
very good idea Ruby without for idle SCV

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.490 
very good idea Ruby without for idle SCV
so<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.189> bit<00:01:59.399> poor<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> Ruby<00:02:01.350> with

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so that's a little bit poor so Ruby with

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
so that's a little bit poor so Ruby with
a<00:02:01.530> significant<00:02:02.130> economic<00:02:02.250> edge<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
a significant economic edge here I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.639 
a significant economic edge here I
wonder<00:02:03.869> where<00:02:03.960> flash<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.619> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
wonder where flash is going to do to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.170 
wonder where flash is going to do to
pull<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.070> off<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.340> mean<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> wouldn't<00:02:06.090> say

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
pull it off I mean I wouldn't say

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.370 
pull it off I mean I wouldn't say
flashes<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> game<00:02:06.930> yet<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> can

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
flashes out of the game yet you can

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.350 
flashes out of the game yet you can
never<00:02:07.560> count<00:02:07.799> flash<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.580> he<00:02:09.179> certainly

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
never count flash out but he certainly

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
never count flash out but he certainly
is<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.140> some

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
is going to have to do some

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.350 
is going to have to do some
to<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.310> back<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.730> flash<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.120> three

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
to get back in here flash the three

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.449 
to get back in here flash the three
tanks<00:02:12.720> ruby's<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> probably<00:02:14.220> have

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
tanks ruby's is going to probably have

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.630 
tanks ruby's is going to probably have
an<00:02:14.550> aerial<00:02:14.910> advantage<00:02:15.810> prune<00:02:16.080> soon<00:02:16.550> i'm<00:02:17.550> not

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
an aerial advantage prune soon i'm not

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.309 
an aerial advantage prune soon i'm not
sure<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:17.910> flash<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.270> even<00:02:18.480> pumping<00:02:18.720> gas<00:02:18.959> just

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
sure if flash is even pumping gas just

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.320 
sure if flash is even pumping gas just
yet<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.650> ruby<00:02:20.489> might<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:20.730> pushing<00:02:20.880> down<00:02:21.120> here

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
yet and ruby might be pushing down here

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.850 
yet and ruby might be pushing down here
with<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> three<00:02:21.930> rates<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.380> think<00:02:22.770> it's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
with the three rates I think it's

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.559 
with the three rates I think it's
three-on-three<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:23.700> now<00:02:23.910> in<00:02:24.120> terms<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.420> the

them maneuverability of the rates to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.020 
them maneuverability of the rates to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
deal with the anti-air flash with only

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.420 
deal with the anti-air flash with only
one<00:02:33.330> factory<00:02:33.780> though<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.170> Ruby<00:02:35.130> getting<00:02:35.340> a

one factory though and Ruby getting a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.890 
one factory though and Ruby getting a
lot<00:02:35.670> more<00:02:35.700> factories<00:02:36.150> down<00:02:36.330> he's<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.810> be

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
lot more factories down he's going to be

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.449 
lot more factories down he's going to be
up<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.110> four<00:02:37.530> factories<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.190> that's<00:02:38.310> what

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
up to four factories I think that's what

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.710 
up to four factories I think that's what
the<00:02:38.550> observers<00:02:39.030> trying<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.269> show<00:02:39.420> us<00:02:39.569> that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the observers trying to show us that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.960 
the observers trying to show us that
flash<00:02:40.650> only<00:02:40.890> has<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.160> factory<00:02:41.519> it's<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.790> even

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
flash only has one factory it's not even

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.880 
flash only has one factory it's not even
producing<00:02:42.360> right<00:02:42.510> now<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.870> flash<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.709> going<00:02:43.800> to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
producing right now so flash is going to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.320 
producing right now so flash is going to
be<00:02:43.980> insignificant<00:02:44.190> trouble<00:02:44.819> if<00:02:44.910> he<00:02:44.940> doesn't

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
be insignificant trouble if he doesn't

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.790 
be insignificant trouble if he doesn't

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.650 
manage to get as a some kind of attack

up to the damage Ruby's economy and

up to the damage Ruby's economy and

five tanks I think Ruby with eight or

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.509 
more and flash out getting a second
expansion<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:14.069> could<00:04:14.280> be<00:04:14.370> what

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.870

that's<00:04:41.590> very<00:04:41.770> interesting<00:04:41.950> for<00:04:42.370> me<00:04:43.140> basically

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140

I<00:04:44.170> think<00:04:44.470> they're<00:04:44.650> just<00:04:44.980> going<00:04:45.220> for<00:04:45.400> the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
I think they're just going for the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.610 
I think they're just going for the
ground<00:04:45.730> pushes<00:04:46.090> with<00:04:46.300> some<00:04:46.540> air<00:04:46.750> cover<00:04:46.960> some

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
clothes air cover from the rates and I

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.030 
clothes air cover from the rates and I
think<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.200> will<00:04:50.290> be<00:04:50.350> basically<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.890> eunuch

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040
