00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you you know get a visual of not only

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
you you know get a visual of not only
what<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> end<00:01:09.900> result<00:01:10.229> looks<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.590> but

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
what the end result looks like but

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
what the end result looks like but
what's<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> process<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.030> doing<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
what's the process in doing the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
what's the process in doing the
technique<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> long<00:01:13.830> process<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
technique is it a long process or a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.310 
technique is it a long process or a
short<00:01:14.880> process<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.479> wanted<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> put<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.200> all

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
short process so I wanted to put it all

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
short process so I wanted to put it all
sort<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.799> place<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.460> package<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
sort of in one place one package so that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.249 
sort of in one place one package so that
you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.750> video<00:01:22.080> where<00:01:22.200> he

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you can see so in this video where he

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.130 
you can see so in this video where he
was<00:01:22.350> talking<00:01:22.650> about<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.220> main<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.930> sort

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
was talking about the main like my sort

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.289 
was talking about the main like my sort
of<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.290> main<00:01:25.670> recommendations<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.150> give

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
of my main recommendations just to give

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.999 
of my main recommendations just to give
you<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.170> framework<00:01:28.470> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you a little bit of a framework in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
you a little bit of a framework in
choosing<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:29.820> technique<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
choosing the right technique for you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.780 
choosing the right technique for you
because<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.860> times<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.220> look<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:32.490> videos

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
because a lot of times we look at videos

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.920 
because a lot of times we look at videos
and<00:01:32.820> say<00:01:33.090> oh<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.329> want<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.659> hair<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> look

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and say oh I just want my hair to look

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
and say oh I just want my hair to look
like<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:35.159> try<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.820> either<00:01:35.970> it's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
like that and we try it and either it's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330 
like that and we try it and either it's
really<00:01:36.900> time<00:01:37.110> intensive<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.040> very

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
really time intensive or it's very

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.420 
really time intensive or it's very
difficult<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.000> us<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.150> master<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.920> get

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
difficult for us to master or we get

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
difficult for us to master or we get
distracted<00:01:41.729> by<00:01:42.060> every<00:01:42.570> other<00:01:42.750> YouTube<00:01:43.380> video

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
distracted by every other YouTube video

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.639 
distracted by every other YouTube video
or<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.210> gets<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.140> frustrating

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
or and it just gets really frustrating

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.499 
or and it just gets really frustrating
and<00:01:46.710> overwhelming<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.820> why<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.060> wanted

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
and overwhelming so that's why I wanted

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
and overwhelming so that's why I wanted
to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.750> sort<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.439> an<00:01:49.560> overall<00:01:50.090> kind

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
to do just sort of like an overall kind

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.139 
to do just sort of like an overall kind
of<00:01:51.210> mindset<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.320> comes<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.680> approaching

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
of mindset when it comes to approaching

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.190 
of mindset when it comes to approaching
finding<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> right<00:01:54.360> technique<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
finding the right technique for you the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
finding the right technique for you the
first<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> be

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
first one is that it's going to be

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.630 
first one is that it's going to be
something<00:01:57.060> realistic<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.430> takes

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
something realistic so if if it takes

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.080 
something realistic so if if it takes
you<00:01:59.790> four<00:02:00.119> hours<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> style<00:02:02.090> that's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you four hours to do a style that's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330 
you four hours to do a style that's
probably<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.020> sustainable<00:02:04.439> if

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
probably not going to be sustainable if

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.179 
probably not going to be sustainable if
you're<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.509> school<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:06.840> you're

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
you're going to school if you're

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.680 
you're going to school if you're
if<00:02:07.429> you're<00:02:07.549> busy<00:02:07.700> if<00:02:07.909> you<00:02:07.969> have<00:02:08.119> kids<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.569> mean

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
if you're busy if you have kids I mean

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.779 
if you're busy if you have kids I mean
you<00:02:08.780> want<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.050> have<00:02:09.140> something<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:10.489> can

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
you want to have something that you can

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.000 
you want to have something that you can
pretty<00:02:11.629> much<00:02:11.720> put<00:02:12.080> in<00:02:12.200> your<00:02:12.319> hair<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.920> a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
pretty much put in your hair on a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.970 
pretty much put in your hair on a
consistent<00:02:13.459> basis<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:15.379> won't<00:02:15.620> take<00:02:15.799> you

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
consistent basis and it won't take you

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.710 
consistent basis and it won't take you
all<00:02:16.190> afternoon<00:02:16.519> because<00:02:17.120> again<00:02:17.360> that's<00:02:17.510> not

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
all afternoon because again that's not

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.509 
all afternoon because again that's not
going<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:18.019> really<00:02:18.349> sustainable<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.190> for<00:02:19.370> me

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
going to be really sustainable so for me

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.930 
going to be really sustainable so for me
my<00:02:19.700> foundation<00:02:21.370> technique<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.610> always<00:02:22.819> going

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
my foundation technique is always going

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.520 
my foundation technique is always going
to<00:02:23.000> be<00:02:23.060> roller<00:02:23.330> wrapping<00:02:23.780> because<00:02:23.959> takes<00:02:24.319> me

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
to be roller wrapping because takes me

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.250 
to be roller wrapping because takes me
half<00:02:24.950> an<00:02:25.129> hour<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.370> put<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.760> an<00:02:26.239> hour<00:02:26.690> and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
half an hour to put it in an hour and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.690 
half an hour to put it in an hour and
half<00:02:27.470> under<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.769> dryer<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.220> then<00:02:28.370> I'm<00:02:28.489> done

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
half under the dryer and then I'm done

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.449 
half under the dryer and then I'm done
for<00:02:28.879> the<00:02:28.940> week<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.660> that's<00:02:29.930> been<00:02:30.260> my

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
for the week and so that's been my

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.000 
for the week and so that's been my
foundation<00:02:31.459> technique<00:02:31.849> for<00:02:32.620> six<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:33.769> seven

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.199 
foundation technique for six or seven
years<00:02:34.220> now<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.330> that's<00:02:36.319> my<00:02:36.650> biggest

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
years now so that's my biggest

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.520

minimal<00:03:18.500> heat<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.220> in<00:03:19.730> addition<00:03:20.180> minimal

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
minimal heat and in addition minimal

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.250 
minimal heat and in addition minimal

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
manipulation so if it's gonna be I mean

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.020 
manipulation so if it's gonna be I mean
some<00:03:24.889> people<00:03:24.980> say<00:03:25.220> Roller<00:03:25.430> settings<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.819> lot<00:03:25.910> of

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
some people say Roller settings a lot of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.759 
some people say Roller settings a lot of
manipulation<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.750> don't<00:03:26.930> think<00:03:27.109> so<00:03:27.260> because<00:03:27.560> I

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
manipulation I don't think so because I

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.129 
manipulation I don't think so because I
do<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.310> very<00:03:28.400> carefully<00:03:28.910> but<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.810> other<00:03:29.959> words

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
do it very carefully but in other words

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.140 
do it very carefully but in other words
you<00:03:30.230> don't<00:03:30.380> want<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.560> be<00:03:30.620> constantly<00:03:31.150> pulling

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
you don't want to be constantly pulling

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.420 
you don't want to be constantly pulling
your<00:03:32.239> hair<00:03:32.419> out<00:03:32.450> with<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.620> with<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.160> style

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
your hair out with this with this style

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.909 
your hair out with this with this style
so<00:03:34.549> just<00:03:35.329> you<00:03:35.450> know<00:03:35.569> those<00:03:35.720> are<00:03:35.840> two<00:03:35.989> kind<00:03:36.829> of

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
so just you know those are two kind of

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.699 
so just you know those are two kind of
sub<00:03:37.220> components<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:39.019> finding<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.440> style

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
sub components of just finding a style

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.800 
sub components of just finding a style
that<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.370> healthy<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.180> your<00:03:41.299> hair<00:03:41.510> again

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
that is healthy for your hair again

minimizing heat and minimizing

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.370 
minimizing heat and minimizing
manipulation<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:44.180> then<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.450> third<00:03:44.630> style<00:03:44.989> of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
manipulation and then the third style of

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.750 
manipulation and then the third style of
the<00:03:45.500> third<00:03:45.680> recommendation<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.609> that<00:03:46.639> you

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
the third recommendation is that you

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.580 
the third recommendation is that you
want<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.060> have<00:03:47.150> something<00:03:47.419> that's<00:03:47.599> gonna<00:03:47.780> that

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.670 
during the week and restyle and reset

a little<00:04:15.890> bit<00:04:16.009> dry<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.340> could<00:04:16.789> put<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.329> lot<00:04:17.630> of

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
a little bit dry it could put a lot of

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
stress on your temple so you know just

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.510

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
because something is easy or something

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.909 
because something is easy or something
is<00:04:23.000> seems<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.050> make<00:04:24.199> sense<00:04:24.410> or<00:04:24.650> it's<00:04:24.770> what

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
is seems to make sense or it's what

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.950 
is seems to make sense or it's what
everybody<00:04:25.250> else<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.639> doing<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:26.479> know<00:04:26.600> really

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
everybody else is doing you know really

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.240 
everybody else is doing you know really
think<00:04:27.199> about<00:04:27.289> what<00:04:27.740> are<00:04:27.860> going<00:04:27.949> to<00:04:28.009> be<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
think about what are going to be the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.680 
think about what are going to be the
long-term<00:04:28.669> effects<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:29.300> style<00:04:29.539> because

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
long-term effects of this style because

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.600 
long-term effects of this style because
that's<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.440> whole<00:04:30.590> point<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.949> this<00:04:31.100> it's<00:04:31.400> to

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
that's the whole point of this it's to

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.909 
that's the whole point of this it's to
help<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.449> achieve<00:04:32.780> healthier<00:04:33.410> hair<00:04:33.620> over

time<00:04:34.190> so<00:04:34.520> again<00:04:35.229> picking<00:04:36.229> a<00:04:36.440> style<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:37.160> will

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
time so again picking a style that will

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.070 
time so again picking a style that will
help<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.120> see<00:04:38.419> progress<00:04:39.320> right<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:41.750> those

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
help you see progress right and so those

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.409 
help you see progress right and so those
are<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.289> main<00:04:42.470> three<00:04:42.800> takeaways<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:44.180> I

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
are the main three takeaways that I

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.600 
are the main three takeaways that I
think<00:04:45.139> about<00:04:45.380> when<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.680> came<00:04:46.039> up<00:04:46.100> with<00:04:46.220> a

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
think about when I came up with a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.070 
think about when I came up with a
foundation<00:04:47.180> technique<00:04:47.570> which<00:04:47.750> again<00:04:47.930> is

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
foundation technique which again is

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.219 
foundation technique which again is
roller<00:04:48.289> wrapping<00:04:48.740> for<00:04:48.889> me<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:51.050> main

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
roller wrapping for me so the main

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.029 
roller wrapping for me so the main
concept<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:52.270> you<00:04:53.270> know<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.900> try<00:04:54.080> things<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.889> to

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
concept is you know to try things and to

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.510 
concept is you know to try things and to
try<00:04:55.190> new<00:04:55.490> things<00:04:55.520> but<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.889> you<00:04:57.889> know<00:04:58.009> not<00:04:58.280> get

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
try new things but to you know not get

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.089 
try new things but to you know not get
swept<00:04:58.910> up<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.300> what<00:04:59.660> you<00:05:00.650> think<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.919> should

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
swept up and what you think you should

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.409 
swept up and what you think you should
be<00:05:01.190> doing<00:05:01.520> or<00:05:01.639> what<00:05:01.669> everybody<00:05:02.090> else<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.389> doing

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
be doing or what everybody else is doing

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.300 
be doing or what everybody else is doing
and<00:05:02.840> really<00:05:03.440> really<00:05:03.620> find<00:05:03.889> something<00:05:04.130> that

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
and really really find something that

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.640 
and really really find something that
works<00:05:04.490> for<00:05:04.610> your<00:05:04.820> hair<00:05:05.030> because<00:05:05.479> as<00:05:05.780> some<00:05:06.110> and

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
I'm only giving this as wisdom because

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.210 
I'm only giving this as wisdom because
I've<00:05:08.330> done<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.630> all<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:08.870> I've<00:05:09.259> gotten<00:05:10.009> swept

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
I've done it all and I've gotten swept

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.650 
I've done it all and I've gotten swept
up<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.639> I've<00:05:10.729> bought<00:05:10.880> tons<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.389> tons<00:05:11.419> and

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
up and I've bought tons and tons and

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.230
