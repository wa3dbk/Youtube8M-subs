dots<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.650> put<00:01:35.040> anything<00:01:35.460> there

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
dots there I just put anything there

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.520 
dots there I just put anything there
yeah<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.770> must<00:01:37.979> type<00:01:38.370> a<00:01:38.490> file<00:01:38.700> name<00:01:38.810> -<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
yeah you must type a file name - so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.580 
yeah you must type a file name - so
basically<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.490> ensure<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:43.140> create

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
basically to ensure that you can create

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.120 
basically to ensure that you can create
a<00:01:43.680> folder<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.400> if<00:01:45.330> you<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.810> error<00:01:46.229> what

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
a folder here if you get that error what

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.359 
a folder here if you get that error what
you<00:01:47.280> need<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.550> do<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.170> guess<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.470> put<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.070> dot

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you need to do I guess is put a dot

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
you need to do I guess is put a dot
anywhere<00:01:51.000> else<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> name<00:01:53.509> what<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> did

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
anywhere else in in the name what I did

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.560 
anywhere else in in the name what I did
to<00:01:54.990> create<00:01:55.229> these<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.550> put<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> dot<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.300> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
to create these is I put a dot at the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.960 
to create these is I put a dot at the
end<00:01:57.780> after<00:01:58.290> typing<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.220> all<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.700> put<00:01:59.909> a

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
end after typing in all of this I put a

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.450 
end after typing in all of this I put a
dot<00:02:00.180> at<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> end<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> worked<00:02:02.190> fine

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
dot at the end and then it worked fine

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.889 
dot at the end and then it worked fine
