so<00:00:00.960> now<00:00:01.110> let's<00:00:01.319> have<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.500> look<00:00:01.680> at<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:01.949> network

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so now let's have a look at the network

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.510 
so now let's have a look at the network
and<00:00:02.460> protocol<00:00:02.850> architecture<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.750> LTE<00:00:04.520> when

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
and protocol architecture for LTE when

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.099 
and protocol architecture for LTE when
it<00:00:05.609> comes<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.120> network<00:00:06.450> architecture<00:00:07.049> of

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
it comes to the network architecture of

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.530 
it comes to the network architecture of
LTE<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.770> will<00:00:07.950> often<00:00:08.130> hear<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.730> abbreviation

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
LTE you will often hear the abbreviation

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.320 
LTE you will often hear the abbreviation

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
s AE which stands for system

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.419 
s AE which stands for system
architecture<00:00:12.990> evolution<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.740> which

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429

indicates that also the overall system

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.800 
indicates that also the overall system
