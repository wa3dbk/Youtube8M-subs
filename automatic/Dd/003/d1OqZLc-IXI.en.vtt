guys<00:00:00.149> its<00:00:00.390> collinear<00:00:00.840> I'm<00:00:01.709> super<00:00:02.129> excited<00:00:02.220> and

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
guys its collinear I'm super excited and

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.700 
guys its collinear I'm super excited and
you<00:00:02.820> wanna<00:00:02.970> know<00:00:03.030> why<00:00:03.120> because<00:00:04.020> for<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.680> first

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
you wanna know why because for the first

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.340 
you wanna know why because for the first
time<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.400> six<00:00:05.670> months<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.210> have<00:00:06.750> finally<00:00:07.140> found

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
time in six months I have finally found

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.190 
time in six months I have finally found
a<00:00:07.680> converter<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.670> will<00:00:09.269> actually<00:00:09.480> convert

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
a converter that will actually convert

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.259 
a converter that will actually convert
10<00:00:10.920> bit<00:00:11.250> shows<00:00:11.610> from<00:00:12.269> 10<00:00:12.570> bit<00:00:13.009> MKV<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.759> 10<00:00:15.059> bit

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
10 bit shows from 10 bit MKV to 10 bit

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.240 
10 bit shows from 10 bit MKV to 10 bit
mp4<00:00:16.160> that's<00:00:17.160> 10<00:00:17.640> bit<00:00:17.850> files<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.890> literally

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
mp4 that's 10 bit files so for literally

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.580 
mp4 that's 10 bit files so for literally
six<00:00:20.670> months<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.600> been<00:00:21.810> able<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.109> do

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
six months I have not been able to do

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.250 
six months I have not been able to do
anything<00:00:23.039> basically<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.840> God<00:00:25.050> forbid

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
anything basically because God forbid

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.279 
anything basically because God forbid
anyone<00:00:25.800> update<00:00:26.490> their<00:00:26.779> freaking<00:00:27.779> converters

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
anyone update their freaking converters

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.439 
anyone update their freaking converters
to<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.710> 10<00:00:29.010> bit<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.400> everything's<00:00:29.939> basically

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
to do 10 bit and everything's basically

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.940 
to do 10 bit and everything's basically
starting<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> move<00:00:31.920> into<00:00:32.130> 10<00:00:32.430> bit<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.950> it's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
starting to move into 10 bit now so it's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.160 
starting to move into 10 bit now so it's
probably<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> good<00:00:36.329> idea<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:37.050> yourself

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
probably a good idea to get yourself

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
probably a good idea to get yourself
this<00:00:37.710> converter<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:39.000> you're<00:00:39.120> looking<00:00:39.450> for

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this converter or if you're looking for

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.430 
this converter or if you're looking for
anyway

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
anyway

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
anyway
so<00:00:41.370> basically<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.030> see<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.329> using

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
so basically as you can see I'm using

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510 
so basically as you can see I'm using
handbrake<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.649> there's<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.309> trick

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
handbrake but there's actually a trick

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.459 
handbrake but there's actually a trick
to<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.899> official

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
to this this is not the official

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
to this this is not the official
handbrake<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.730> beta<00:00:48.360> released

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
handbrake this is the beta released

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.770 
handbrake this is the beta released
handbrake<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.649> Google<00:00:50.420> nightly<00:00:51.420> build

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
handbrake so if you Google nightly build

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.220 
handbrake so if you Google nightly build
which<00:00:52.440> basically<00:00:52.829> stands<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:54.230> development

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
which basically stands for a development

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.660 
which basically stands for a development
build<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> um<00:00:56.300> you'll<00:00:57.300> basically<00:00:57.480> find<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
build is um you'll basically find the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.770 
build is um you'll basically find the
handbrake<00:00:59.670> check<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> date<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.480> video

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
handbrake check the date on this video

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
handbrake check the date on this video
because<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.230> might<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> come<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.219> was

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
because it might have come out I was

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.889 
because it might have come out I was
like<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.730> illegitimate<00:01:03.030> version<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
like an illegitimate version of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.039 
like an illegitimate version of
handbrake<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.159> far<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
handbrake now but as far as I know it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
handbrake now but as far as I know it
hasn't<00:01:07.409> been<00:01:07.470> released<00:01:07.650> yet<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.180> new

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
hasn't been released yet so in this new

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.320 
hasn't been released yet so in this new
version<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.900> basically<00:01:10.049> convert<00:01:10.680> 10<00:01:11.070> bit

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
version you can basically convert 10 bit

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.429 
version you can basically convert 10 bit
shows<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.780> thank<00:01:13.229> God<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.290> here<00:01:16.290> I'll<00:01:16.380> just

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
shows so thank God so here I'll just

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.960 
shows so thank God so here I'll just
pull<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:18.049> random<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.340> subtitle

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
pull up random one and in the subtitle

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.270 
pull up random one and in the subtitle
and<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> found<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.080> before<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and you know I found this before but I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
and you know I found this before but I
couldn't<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> work<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> maybe<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.330> just

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
couldn't get to work and maybe I just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.149 
couldn't get to work and maybe I just
 up<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> subtitles<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
 up the subtitles because the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
 up the subtitles because the
subtitles<00:01:29.729> weren't<00:01:30.090> coming<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.479> correctly

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
subtitles weren't coming up correctly

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350 
subtitles weren't coming up correctly
but<00:01:31.590> they're<00:01:31.950> working<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.030> maybe<00:01:33.210> I'm

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
but they're working now so maybe I'm

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
but they're working now so maybe I'm
just<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.659> idiot<00:01:34.159> distinct<00:01:35.159> possibility<00:01:35.700> there

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
just an idiot distinct possibility there

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.990 
just an idiot distinct possibility there
anyway<00:01:36.650> unknown<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.610> want<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> click

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
anyway unknown and you want to click

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.850 
anyway unknown and you want to click
burned<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.500> click<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.270> then

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
burned in so click that and then

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.960 
burned in so click that and then
everything's<00:01:43.860> fine<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.640> said<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
everything's fine here you just said to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.899 
everything's fine here you just said to
em<00:01:45.090> before<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:45.840> set<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.790> gonna

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
em before it's all set up so it's gonna

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.700 
em before it's all set up so it's gonna
burst<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> first<00:01:48.810> 10<00:01:49.049> seconds<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> I'll

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
burst in the first 10 seconds and I'll

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.300 
burst in the first 10 seconds and I'll
show<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.909> end<00:01:51.060> result<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:55.009> but

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
show you the end result is but

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.370 
show you the end result is but
the<00:01:56.490> greatest<00:01:56.970> irony<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.900> course<00:01:57.930> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the greatest irony to this of course is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.620 
the greatest irony to this of course is
that<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.820> finally<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.360> convert

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that you know you finally can convert

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.530 
that you know you finally can convert
videos<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.700> yeah<00:02:02.700> mega<00:02:03.330> video<00:02:03.869> mega<00:02:04.619> upload

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
videos but yeah mega video mega upload

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.990 
videos but yeah mega video mega upload
pretty<00:02:06.540> much<00:02:06.750> 80%<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.250> file-sharing

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
pretty much 80% of all of file-sharing

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.100 
pretty much 80% of all of file-sharing
sites<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.630> pretty<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:10.410> down<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> moment

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
sites are pretty much down at the moment
