this power cord bracelet ass and make it

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.640 
this power cord bracelet ass and make it
tight<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> ends<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.240> make<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.840> little

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
tight at the ends and make it a little

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.070 
tight at the ends and make it a little
less<00:00:20.189> tight<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.000> well<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> middle

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.870 

either<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.350> was<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> pretty<00:00:25.710> good<00:00:25.890> idea<00:00:26.369> tight

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
either that was a pretty good idea tight

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.410 
either that was a pretty good idea tight
pants<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.710> thicker<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.949> middle<00:00:29.420> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
pants and thicker in the middle the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.080 
pants and thicker in the middle the
trial<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.050> did<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.230> another<00:00:32.219> vid<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
trial of like I did a another vid on the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.020 
trial of like I did a another vid on the
trial<00:00:33.300> by<00:00:33.510> pattern<00:00:33.960> only<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.610> asked

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
trial by pattern only this time I asked

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.540 
trial by pattern only this time I asked
him<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> put<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:37.320> extra<00:00:37.500> cords<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> middle

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
him to put two extra cords in the middle

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
him to put two extra cords in the middle
so<00:00:39.360> typically<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.960> would<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.260> only<00:00:40.290> two

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
so typically you would have only two

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.310 
so typically you would have only two
here<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.550> now<00:00:41.940> there's<00:00:42.149> an<00:00:42.660> extra<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.230> if

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
here and now there's an extra one so if

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
here and now there's an extra one so if
it's<00:00:43.440> wrapped<00:00:43.739> around<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.370> course<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.670> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it's wrapped around of course it's a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.869 
it's wrapped around of course it's a
cords<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.440> hoping<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
cords and what I was hoping for is a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.100 
cords and what I was hoping for is a
little<00:00:48.570> thicker<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> spine<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.960> guess

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
little thicker in the spine and I guess

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.020 
little thicker in the spine and I guess
because<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> power<00:00:52.649> cords<00:00:52.860> compressible<00:00:53.489> too

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
because the power cords compressible too

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.880 
because the power cords compressible too
is<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.449> enough<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.320> I'll<00:00:55.500> ask<00:00:55.620> him<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
is not enough so I think I'll ask him to

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.060 
is not enough so I think I'll ask him to
make<00:00:55.980> me<00:00:56.129> another<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:57.559> with<00:00:58.559> maybe<00:00:58.739> four

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
make me another one with with maybe four

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.000 
make me another one with with maybe four
cords<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> middle<00:01:00.559> just<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> make<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
cords in the middle just to make this

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.560 
cords in the middle just to make this
part<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> little<00:01:02.640> thicker<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.790> he<00:01:05.790> put<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
part a little thicker and he put in a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
part a little thicker and he put in a
couple<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> beads<00:01:07.080> from<00:01:07.290> me<00:01:07.520> looks<00:01:08.520> pretty

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
couple of beads from me looks pretty

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.380 
couple of beads from me looks pretty
cool<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.689> look<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.650> job<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> did<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
cool and look at this job so I did a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.920 
cool and look at this job so I did a
previous<00:01:12.570> video<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.290> tanto<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it and make me a handle and you put a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.310

a skull be there alright and only

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.120

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
because the lanyard was not you know we

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.539 
because the lanyard was not you know we
use<00:01:41.340> even<00:01:41.880> use<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> same<00:01:42.210> amount<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:43.369> on<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
use even use the same amount on on the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.859 
use even use the same amount on on the
wrap<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.600> more<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
wrap here there was a little more of

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.330 
wrap here there was a little more of
this<00:01:46.759> digital<00:01:47.759> urban<00:01:48.360> camel<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.159> versus<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
this digital urban camel one versus the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.789 
this digital urban camel one versus the
toxic<00:01:50.850> green<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.630> ended<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.590> big

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
toxic green so I ended up with this big

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.280 
toxic green so I ended up with this big
loop<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> good<00:01:54.119> idea<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.630> tie

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
loop and if there was a good idea to tie

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.780 
loop and if there was a good idea to tie
it<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.500> unevenly<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> loop<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> always

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it up unevenly so the loop is always

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.840 
it up unevenly so the loop is always
open<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.350> fishing<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
open you don't have to go fishing for it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.990 
open you don't have to go fishing for it
that's<00:02:00.719> called<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.229> Chinese<00:02:01.950> luck<00:02:02.520> knot<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that's called a Chinese luck knot and I

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.600 
that's called a Chinese luck knot and I
think<00:02:03.180> he<00:02:03.270> said<00:02:04.219> or<00:02:05.219> snake<00:02:05.579> not<00:02:07.250> skull<00:02:08.250> bead<00:02:08.459> at

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
think he said or snake not skull bead at

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.699 
think he said or snake not skull bead at
the<00:02:08.640> end<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> hair

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the end with with the hair
