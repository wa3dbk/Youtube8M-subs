00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 I'm here to bring you one more. 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.550
 Crack the spirit this time we're going to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.860
 tourism verses come back what galera 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 was at the request of a travel book let's 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.809
 There's such a good fan that we're going on the show. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 Can not stop if you want to ask. 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.600
 some cracks do not forget you too 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.040
 there in the channel fanpage facebook.com 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.750
 Damn the city, so I came here. 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.940
 remembering that we are playing in this 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.860
 race and this race simply 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.910
 point-to-point ghost let's see what 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.920
 give back, come back, say goodbye 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.510
 despite the volt being an electric car 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.789
 he performed very well 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 contract and we'll see what's going to happen here 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.360
 against tourism then let's go guys 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.880
 accelerating hard as you can 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.549
 follow up and come back again has a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 initial acceleration there too 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.570
 His face is very strong but let's go 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 see if he can keep it there 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.670
 to the end and win and the tourism that is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.439
 thing you just no one is going 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.180
 believe things happen so 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.820
 Come on, I'm back, you 're already losing. 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.290
 At this time, tourism has already 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.299
 is taking the tip so I think 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.619
 will not give back but also pro 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.000
 difference will not be too great 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.759
 remembering that the painting is the most 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 fast and he did not go so far against 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.560
 Until then, let's go there, accelerating hard. 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.840
 here we will see goes will pass beat was 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.810
 so first race was already in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.170
 first here then tourism won with 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.939
 39 seconds 120 thousandths do not see the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.409
 volt time then let's go guys 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.150
 that the show can not stop 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.799
 I wanted already also apologize 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.990
 for some noise there because today it is 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.729
 Saturday the kids here in the yard are 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.610
 frantic and I can not close the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 door because I was finishing up 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.130
 paint the game on here a part 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.899
 Shepherd's pie 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.090
 then it was 39 and 120 from tourism versus 40 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.500
 414 of the volt so I'll get a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.730
 streak 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.910
 I'll get everything ready is to encourage 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.410
 I 'll be right back with you and we'll be back. 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.020
 guys now we're going to here 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.640
 second run of this streak so far 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.190
 I go with volts that right. 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.350
 let's go show you can not stop then 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.600
 let's go here ready to play there one more 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.490
 instead apologizes for noise I left 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.620
 background that engages the screaming kids 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.360
 Because the kids are not in it. 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.970
 Connected child is fucked even more in this 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.830
 phase they are there 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.840
 knowing everything and also has not like me 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.030
 stop the world to be able to record it right 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.560
 I would have to do a studio scheme 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.810
 here but this is not what you can do 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.790
 now let's go we can stop 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.010
 the rush of the volt that despite being a 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.350
 electric car like I've been stressing there 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.510
 in these two streams we had is 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.660
 very good as you can see he leaves 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.850
 back tourism as well as left there 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.580
 much more than half the circuit 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.230
 there is a little more than a mile ago 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.660
 it was simply he starts to lose 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.430
 speed or performance of others 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.190
 cars are much larger than his 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.130
 You can accompany the tourism is 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.780
 passing the car over and we are 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.310
 playing point by point the ghost with 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.790
 it does not have that business is just 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:28.040
 no wako nor you can do things there 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.470
 for you to have a certain kind of going 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.180
 the guys went the same way guys 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.620
 simply the volt is a bit more 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.910
 slower than tourism is not a 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.799
 very big difference 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.299
 although I was surprised that I found 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.760
 that this car does not even smell 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.049
 and if you have enjoyed your home and 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.370
