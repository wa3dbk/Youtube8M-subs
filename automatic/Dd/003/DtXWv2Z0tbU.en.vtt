00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
my you know main classes just because I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490 
my you know main classes just because I

don't want to be impede and then you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.770 
don't want to be impede and then you
know<00:02:07.619> maybe<00:02:07.829> potentially<00:02:08.190> lose<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> clip<00:02:09.119> so

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
good for a montage so that's why I have

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.440

this I have toughness and fast hands I
don't<00:04:13.600> have<00:04:13.750> hardwired<00:04:14.200> here<00:04:14.530> because<00:04:14.890> most

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
don't have hardwired here because most

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.500 
don't have hardwired here because most
of<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.370> time<00:04:15.580> that<00:04:15.790> i'm<00:04:15.880> using<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.299> class

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
of the time that i'm using this class

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.080 
of the time that i'm using this class
i'm<00:04:16.720> using<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.049> in<00:04:17.140> team<00:04:17.350> deathmatch<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:18.070> if<00:04:18.940> i

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
i'm using it in team deathmatch and if i

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.250 
i'm using it in team deathmatch and if i
find<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.450> people<00:04:19.630> are<00:04:19.780> throwing<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.109> MP

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
find that people are throwing the MP

grenades<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:20.859> wish<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.250> hardware<00:04:21.549> class

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 
grenades I just wish to a hardware class

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.500 
grenades I just wish to a hardware class
so<00:04:22.990> this<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.380> really<00:04:23.560> good<00:04:23.830> influence<00:04:24.460> he<00:04:24.850> is

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
so this is a really good influence he is

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.180 
so this is a really good influence he is
this<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.780> hard<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.080> use<00:04:26.260> because<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.980> bolt

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
this is hard to use because to bolt

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.650 
this is hard to use because to bolt
action<00:04:27.490> sniper<00:04:27.550> rifles<00:04:28.030> you're<00:04:28.150> pretty<00:04:28.360> slow

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
action sniper rifles you're pretty slow

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.710 
action sniper rifles you're pretty slow
especially<00:04:28.840> with<00:04:29.230> the<00:04:29.350> dsr-50<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:31.270> class<00:04:31.510> is

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
especially with the dsr-50 this class is

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.510 
especially with the dsr-50 this class is
a<00:04:31.750> little<00:04:32.050> bit<00:04:32.170> easier<00:04:32.290> to<00:04:32.680> use<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:32.980> still<00:04:33.250> fun

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
a little bit easier to use is still fun

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.150 
a little bit easier to use is still fun
and<00:04:34.450> of<00:04:34.720> course<00:04:34.750> if<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.200> get<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.680> nice<00:04:35.890> weapon

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160

I've been using even though i don't have
toughness<00:05:03.580> which<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:03.940> really<00:05:04.150> important<00:05:04.660> when

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
toughness which is really important when

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.070
