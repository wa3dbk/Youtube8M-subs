four yellow coat the first technique

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.570 
four yellow coat the first technique
you're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> figure<00:00:29.429> eight

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
you're going to do is a figure eight

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.209 
you're going to do is a figure eight
with<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.910> outside<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> foot<00:00:31.040> Nikki<00:00:32.040> rate

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
going to do right foot the middle cone

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
going to do right foot the middle cone
is<00:01:26.800> going<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.100> be

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
