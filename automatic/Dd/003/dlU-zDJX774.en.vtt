00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.270
 hello people today is my new one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.900
 keyboard arrived and I noticed 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.250
 shit that has no button 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.230
 Saving energy so this little 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.410
 Crescent that had my old keyboard 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 always and then the pc is not 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 but shut down and so on 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.470
 Everything stayed that way I do not know 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
 do not know me that way at least 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.330
 the fan against for the cpu has it 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.250
 Everything flashed and yes I just have to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 press a button on the keyboard and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.399
 Everything is back , that's the case 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.190
 save energy 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:42.270
 that is great only now I have the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:44.370
 new logitech here buys the ge 105 and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.860
 I think you know the problem if 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.520
 also as a gaming keyboard recently 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.070
 point, except you have the button to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.899
 save energy i dont have it and that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.149
 I found a lot of shit and there are 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.760
 no key combination for the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.830
 how to do it easily 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.430
 yes and that's why I just have one 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.820
 so to speak, what you have invented for it 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.729
 you have to click on it 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.830
 on your state symbol because windows 7 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.630
 Of course only and as you can already see 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.070
 below is energy saving and with me 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.270
 that must be synonymous with you so that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.720
 works and indeed goes here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 right click on properties like that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 and in the grid start menu is here 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.650
 standard action for finish 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.270
 There he goes makes energy saving 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.100
 press ok and it's already down here 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.290
 save energy instead of shutting down 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.540
 that's good so so following 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.869
 if you are on your desktop now 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.810
 and old f4 pushes yes then that comes 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.110
 normally would stand here 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.600
 shut down 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.130
 that's alright so i know 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.869
 not if you knew that mine 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.829
 old four pushes open if now 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.070
 you know it anyway 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.040
 Well anyway that would already be 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.520
 times work but I want that yes 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.960
 everything that goes with one click and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.990
 I do not always want to be on the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.450
 need to switch desktop 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.730
 I could and that's why I have 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.990
 just thought we have ours here 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.360
 gaming software 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:22.750
 yes and then we go to these buttons 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.910
 on m3 just put it here 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.060
 work like that and here you have yours 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.220
 gaming software from logitech or if 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.200
 you have it from another provider 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.050
 I hope that's exactly how it works 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.990
 Here you can have a text block at the moment 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.460
 record several buttons here 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.340
 you can start the recording and 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.450
 then he does all that and one man 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.770
 here draws the following on left 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.790
 Press and hold windows key with de 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.480
 let go again 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.820
 yes, then you press old 4 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.620
 so everything at the same time 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.930
 left windows the same age 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.110
 a lot at the same time and then just 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:13.130
 Let's just enter so now this works 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.660
 unfortunately not yet now if 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.580
 I now press the this button 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.680
 something on what I have put now 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.690
 they would all touch simultaneously 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.380
 so I have to be pressed here 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.870
 It can be quite funny here 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.720
 for records exactly here 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.010
 Just make a right click and a 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.610
 Delay insert 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.530
 I'll tell them that should not be so 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:43.280
 I just do 2 200 for a long time 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:49.090
 So 02 seconds and that must be the same 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.960
 insert here behind the old one 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.960
 edit 2 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.240
 which has now basically made the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.220
 pressing the button will turn left 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.250
 windows button and d pressed thereby 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.810
 that the Scot the key combination 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.510
 to switch to the desktop 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.320
 then directly old four is pressed 0.2 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.480
 seconds later 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.750
 and then directly duck that is called soon 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.680
 I press the button on the me 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.800
 now will lay 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:27.090
 is ok moment I have to do it that way 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:30.630
 as soon as I press 4g five now 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.350
 the pc within 0 4 seconds in the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.169
 Energy saving mode driven 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.090
 it's that easy I hope you came 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.950
 pretty good with I hope you have it 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.720
 does not take too long otherwise you have to 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.730
 imagine 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.000
 well that's it from me then 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.500
 I hope you have your problems with it 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.240
 of course they do not have to be solved 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.680
 Use energy saving if you are there 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.740
 want to have meaningful something else can 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.410
 you do that too 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.040
 you have to do something else 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:05.360
 do that, you were me, I hope so 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.360
 I helped further on
