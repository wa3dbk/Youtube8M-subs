00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
I can then jump to our next track which

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.930 
I can then jump to our next track which
is<00:02:12.379> actually<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.830> same<00:02:13.040> track<00:02:13.280> repeated<00:02:13.760> and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
is actually the same track repeated and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.830 
is actually the same track repeated and
give<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> 5<00:02:15.200> second<00:02:15.739> counting

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
give that a 5 second counting

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.809 
give that a 5 second counting
then<00:02:18.349> I'll<00:02:18.500> set<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.860> play<00:02:19.129> automatically

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
then I'll set it to play automatically

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.740 
then I'll set it to play automatically
by<00:02:20.090> tapping<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.720> autoplay<00:02:21.379> button

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
by tapping the autoplay button

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.110 
by tapping the autoplay button
I<00:02:23.810> can<00:02:24.470> now<00:02:24.560> skip<00:02:24.950> back<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.370> our<00:02:25.490> first<00:02:25.760> track

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
I can now skip back to our first track

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.330 
I can now skip back to our first track
and<00:02:26.300> we're<00:02:26.810> set<00:02:27.020> up<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.230> play<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.590> first<00:02:27.800> 14

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.520 
and we're set up to play the first 14
seconds<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> track<00:02:29.290> followed<00:02:30.290> by<00:02:30.500> a

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
seconds of the track followed by a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.950 
seconds of the track followed by a
five-second<00:02:31.220> pause<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.790> then<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.690> next

five-second pause and then the next
track<00:02:33.170> we'll<00:02:33.410> play<00:02:33.590> through

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
track we'll play through

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.820
