and he is just he is walking out up the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.210 
and he is just he is walking out up the
stairs<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.680> she<00:00:28.830> wrote

stairs and that's all she wrote
I<00:00:29.250> guess<00:00:29.939> Phil<00:00:30.150> Hellmuth<00:00:30.390> I'm<00:00:30.510> not<00:00:30.630> sure<00:00:30.779> if

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
I guess Phil Hellmuth I'm not sure if

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.749 
I guess Phil Hellmuth I'm not sure if
he's<00:00:30.929> coming<00:00:31.080> back<00:00:31.260> or<00:00:31.439> not<00:00:31.560> well<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.489> think

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
he's coming back or not well I think

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.100 
he's coming back or not well I think
that's<00:00:32.940> probably<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.270> best<00:00:33.450> thing<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.719> him<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that's probably the best thing for him I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.450 
that's probably the best thing for him I
think<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.500> stays<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.950> he<00:00:35.070> could<00:00:35.219> end<00:00:35.370> up

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
think if he stays here he could end up

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.270 
think if he stays here he could end up
losing<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.940> lot<00:00:36.270> more<00:00:36.510> money<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.190> course

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
