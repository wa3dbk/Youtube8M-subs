from these wires the insulation that
when<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.560> stripped<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:49.890> too<00:01:50.070> much<00:01:50.220> exposes

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
when it's stripped off too much exposes

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.609 
when it's stripped off too much exposes
too<00:01:50.970> much<00:01:51.119> copper<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> copper<00:01:52.409> wire

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
too much copper and the copper wire

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.499 
too much copper and the copper wire
could<00:01:52.920> touch<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> electrical<00:01:53.759> box<00:01:53.970> creating

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
could touch the electrical box creating

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.080 
could touch the electrical box creating
an<00:01:54.720> electrical<00:01:55.229> problem<00:01:55.579> alright<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.850> what

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
an electrical problem alright so what

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.270 
an electrical problem alright so what
you<00:01:57.119> need<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.570> first<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.140> unwire<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.100> hot

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you need to do first is unwire the hot

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.310 
you need to do first is unwire the hot
wires<00:01:59.520> again<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> wanted<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> show<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
wires again here I wanted to show you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
wires again here I wanted to show you
something<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.040> loop<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> wire<00:02:02.729> loop<00:02:03.060> isn't

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
something the loop the wire loop isn't

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.240 
something the loop the wire loop isn't
properly<00:02:03.899> looped<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:05.009> dangerous

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
properly looped and that's dangerous

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.359 
properly looped and that's dangerous
because

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
because

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.160 
because
the<00:02:06.670> hotline<00:02:07.030> could<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.360> came<00:02:07.570> off<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
the hotline could have came off the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.800 
the hotline could have came off the
terminal<00:02:08.679> screw<00:02:08.950> then<00:02:09.789> undo<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.300> terminal

onto<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.990> outlets<00:02:14.640> there<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.730> go<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.150> then

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
onto the outlets there you go and then

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.030 
onto the outlets there you go and then
the<00:02:16.569> last<00:02:16.780> thing<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.140> want<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.350> do<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.770> wire

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the last thing you want to do is on wire

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.730 
the last thing you want to do is on wire
the<00:02:18.459> ground<00:02:18.850> wire<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
the ground wire again just the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.890 
the ground wire again just the
counterclockwise<00:02:21.340> turn<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.270> screw<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
counterclockwise turn that screw and

then pull the ground wire off the outlet

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.040 
then pull the ground wire off the outlet
the<00:02:27.220> next<00:02:27.520> step<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.000> choose<00:02:28.270> two<00:02:28.569> correct

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
the next step is to choose two correct

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.650 
the next step is to choose two correct
kind<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.130> outlet<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.180> case<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.630> a
