00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
so I'm going to do on top I'm going to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.390 
so I'm going to do on top I'm going to
show<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.589> two<00:00:07.770> different<00:00:07.799> advanced

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
show you two different advanced

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.009 
show you two different advanced
techniques<00:00:08.700> one<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.000> thinning<00:00:09.719> scissor<00:00:09.960> over

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
techniques one is thinning scissor over

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.600 
techniques one is thinning scissor over
comb<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.620> then<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> back<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> be

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
comb and then on the back is going to be

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.060 
comb and then on the back is going to be
straight<00:00:11.820> razor<00:00:12.059> over<00:00:12.240> comb<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.980> I'm

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
straight razor over comb so and I'm

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.010 
straight razor over comb so and I'm
sorry<00:00:14.309> I'm<00:00:14.460> talking<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.849> fast<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.360> only<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:15.660> 60

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
sorry I'm talking so fast I only have 60

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.920 
sorry I'm talking so fast I only have 60
minutes<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.619> get<00:00:17.180> two<00:00:18.180> hours<00:00:18.330> worth<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.750> stuff

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
minutes to get two hours worth of stuff

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.900 
minutes to get two hours worth of stuff
then<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> everybody<00:00:22.920> understands<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.519> far<00:00:23.760> is

I'm going to do three half closes if I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.779 
I'm going to do three half closes if I
close<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> way<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> take

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
the hair I'm going to do one half close

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.869 
the hair I'm going to do one half close
another<00:00:59.399> one

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
another one

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
another one
and<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> end<00:01:00.600> another<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.770> that's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and at the end another one and that's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.470 
and at the end another one and that's
going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> give<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> lot<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> texture<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
going to give me a lot of texture in the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.570 
going to give me a lot of texture in the
hair<00:01:03.510> without<00:01:04.170> cutting<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.830> too<00:01:05.010> short<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
hair without cutting it too short and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.240 
hair without cutting it too short and
making<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> too<00:01:06.150> stringy<00:01:06.680> now<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> speed<00:01:08.100> at

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
making it too stringy now the speed at

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.460 
making it too stringy now the speed at
which<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.549> move<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> comb<00:01:09.119> will<00:01:09.780> determine<00:01:10.140> how

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
which I move the comb will determine how

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
which I move the comb will determine how
much<00:01:10.650> thickness<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> take<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.420> move<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
much thickness I take out if I move the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.080 
much thickness I take out if I move the
comb<00:01:12.930> too<00:01:13.229> fast<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.770> won't<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.100> anything<00:01:14.400> very

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
comb too fast I won't take anything very

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.520 
comb too fast I won't take anything very
little<00:01:15.450> thickness<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.869> if<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.080> move<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.350> too

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
little thickness out if I move a too

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.480 
little thickness out if I move a too
slow<00:01:16.799> man<00:01:16.860> danger<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:18.200> cutting<00:01:19.200> length<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
slow man danger of cutting length so the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.620 
slow man danger of cutting length so the
thickness<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> hair<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
thickness of the hair is going to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
thickness of the hair is going to
determine<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.560> Brian<00:01:22.830> Town<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
determine with Brian Town I'm going to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.469 
determine with Brian Town I'm going to
move<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> comb<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> little<00:01:24.119> bit<00:01:24.240> slower

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
move the comb a little bit slower

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.440 
move the comb a little bit slower
because<00:01:25.080> he<00:01:25.470> has<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:25.680> thick<00:01:26.159> hair<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.000> we're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
because he has very thick hair so we're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.080 
because he has very thick hair so we're
going<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:28.040> three<00:01:29.040> half<00:01:29.189> closes<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.820> two

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
going to do three half closes one two

I'm<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> center<00:01:37.079> section<00:01:40.280> okay<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:42.240> we

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I'm in the center section okay now we

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.260 
I'm in the center section okay now we
got<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> section<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.380> each<00:01:43.439> side<00:01:44.030> one<00:01:45.030> two

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
got to do a section on each side one two

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.960 
got to do a section on each side one two
three<00:01:45.630> two<00:01:46.590> three

blade in it okay and we're just going to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.320 
blade in it okay and we're just going to
go<00:03:02.450> same<00:03:03.260> same<00:03:03.590> rules<00:03:03.800> apply<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.850> faster<00:03:05.239> you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
go same same rules apply the faster you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.850 
go same same rules apply the faster you
move<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.510> comb<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.989> more<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.320> take<00:03:06.500> out<00:03:06.680> the

move the comb the more you take out the
slower<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.250> move<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.550> comb<00:03:10.540> okay<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.570> get

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
slower you move the comb okay so we get

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
the right side okay and then we and then

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.580 
the right side okay and then we and then
we<00:03:18.680> get<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.950> left<00:03:19.160> side

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.230 

we<00:03:24.130> rounded<00:03:24.580> in<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.700> little<00:03:24.850> bit<00:03:24.940> towards<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
we rounded in a little bit towards the
