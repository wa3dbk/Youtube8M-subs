00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
now the aim if the game is to actually

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.689 
now the aim if the game is to actually
stay<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.859> game<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.130> long<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> can

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
stay in the game as long as you can

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.580 
stay in the game as long as you can
that's<00:00:29.970> an<00:00:30.090> elimination<00:00:30.630> game<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.439> do

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that's an elimination game and you do

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.410 
that's an elimination game and you do
that<00:00:31.740> by<00:00:31.920> protecting<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that by protecting your kind so if you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
that by protecting your kind so if you
want<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.630> knock<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:34.020> an<00:00:34.200> opposing<00:00:34.620> player<00:00:34.860> all

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
want to knock out an opposing player all

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.130 
want to knock out an opposing player all
we<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.969> kick<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> ball<00:00:36.450> into

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
we have to do is kick the ball into

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
we have to do is kick the ball into
their<00:00:37.290> cone<00:00:37.530> knock<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> over<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.399> therefore

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
their cone knock it over and therefore

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
their cone knock it over and therefore
out<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.450> game<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.920> just

out of the game so you can see here just

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
out of the game so you can see here just
for<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> ease<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.910> explanation<00:00:42.570> we'll<00:00:42.690> start

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
for the ease of explanation we'll start

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.229 
for the ease of explanation we'll start
with<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.170> ball<00:00:43.219> it's<00:00:44.219> play<00:00:44.399> steps<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.210> the

now<00:01:01.309> elimination<00:01:02.309> games<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.730> ideal<00:01:03.300> for

now elimination games are ideal for

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
now elimination games are ideal for
maximum<00:01:03.750> participation<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:05.159> way<00:01:05.339> we

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
maximum participation the way we

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.219 
maximum participation the way we
improved<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> by<00:01:06.330> making<00:01:06.869> sure<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
improved that is by making sure that the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.690 
improved that is by making sure that the
players<00:01:07.439> who<00:01:07.619> had<00:01:07.740> knocked<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.130> still<00:01:08.549> have
