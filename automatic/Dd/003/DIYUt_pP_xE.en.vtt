different things like that in dungeon

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020 
different things like that in dungeon
beasts<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.290> changed<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.640> way

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

beasts it's really changed the way
battles<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.990> done<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.710> usually<00:01:53.430> if

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
battles are done because usually if

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
battles are done because usually if
there<00:01:53.759> was<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> river<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.570> could<00:01:54.780> be

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
there was like a river that could be

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.010 
there was like a river that could be
used<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.860> advantage<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.600> really

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
used as an advantage now it really

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.230 
used as an advantage now it really
doesn't<00:01:58.409> help<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.430> someone

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
doesn't help as much because someone

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.760 
doesn't help as much because someone
could<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> teleportation<00:02:01.170> metal<00:02:01.590> vessel

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
could have a teleportation metal vessel

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
could have a teleportation metal vessel
or<00:02:02.040> magic<00:02:02.310> weapon<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> able<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> tell<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
teleport across the river and then it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.449 
teleport across the river and then it
could<00:02:06.990> also<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> same<00:02:07.680> done<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
could also be the same done for like it

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.830 
could also be the same done for like it
may<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.849> metal<00:02:09.209> vessel<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.720> can

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
may be a metal vessel that can

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.270 
may be a metal vessel that can
manipulate<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.500> elements<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.190> know

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
manipulate the elements like you know

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.650 
manipulate the elements like you know
volcano<00:02:11.970> water<00:02:12.720> things<00:02:13.260> like

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
volcano water things like

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.680 
volcano water things like
that<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.730> war<00:02:15.730> has<00:02:16.030> been<00:02:16.240> forever<00:02:16.450> changed

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
that so war has been forever changed

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.570 
that so war has been forever changed

the generals were discussing when they

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.010 
the generals were discussing when they

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
frontlines with this entire army just

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.330 
frontlines with this entire army just
meeting<00:02:34.450> them<00:02:34.690> out<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.290> open<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
middle of the desert and so there's a

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.540 
middle of the desert and so there's a
lot<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.470> meaning<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:38.920> battle<00:02:39.250> because

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
kind of ironic how this desert where it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.120 
kind of ironic how this desert where it
kind<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.210> all<00:02:52.360> started<00:02:52.510> will<00:02:53.320> be<00:02:53.470> where<00:02:53.890> it

hockadoo<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.490> vastly<00:03:04.000> outnumbered<00:03:04.570> compared

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
hockadoo is vastly outnumbered compared

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.710 
hockadoo is vastly outnumbered compared
to<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:06.040> western<00:03:06.760> army<00:03:07.180> like<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.420> western

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
to the western army like the western

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.870 
to the western army like the western
army<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.650> ridiculous<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.730> is

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
army is ridiculous like it is

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.550 
army is ridiculous like it is
straight<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.270> ridiculous<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.750> think<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.230> don't

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
straight it ridiculous I think I don't

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.140 
straight it ridiculous I think I don't
know<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.950> exact<00:03:12.250> numbers<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.670> can't<00:03:12.910> remember

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
know the exact numbers I can't remember

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.760 
know the exact numbers I can't remember
the<00:03:13.360> exact<00:03:13.660> numbers<00:03:13.990> on<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.200> top<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.500> my<00:03:14.590> head

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
the exact numbers on the top of my head

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.200 
the exact numbers on the top of my head
so<00:03:14.980> I'm<00:03:15.160> probably<00:03:15.250> gonna<00:03:15.490> be<00:03:15.670> incorrect<00:03:16.060> on

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
so I'm probably gonna be incorrect on

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.050 
so I'm probably gonna be incorrect on
this<00:03:16.330> but<00:03:16.810> if<00:03:16.900> I'm<00:03:16.990> correct<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.890> Western<00:03:18.670> army

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
this but if I'm correct the Western army

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.870 
this but if I'm correct the Western army

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
still doesn't make much

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.710 
still doesn't make much
difference<00:03:38.350> when<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.620> go<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.890> figure<00:03:39.250> that

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
difference when you go to figure that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.900 
difference when you go to figure that
Harker<00:03:40.720> news<00:03:40.870> army<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.530> like<00:03:41.650> only<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:42.070> 100k

that's insane straight up at st. so

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.530 
that's insane straight up at st. so
numbers<00:03:47.310> obviously<00:03:48.310> are<00:03:48.430> might<00:03:48.940> not<00:03:49.150> be<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
numbers obviously are might not be the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.199 
numbers obviously are might not be the
