00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
and if you see these white things across

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.770 
and if you see these white things across
the<00:01:20.750> top<00:01:21.170> here<00:01:21.940> he<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.150> what's<00:01:23.390> called<00:01:23.630> a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
the top here he is what's called a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.100 
the top here he is what's called a
parasitized<00:01:24.710> tomato<00:01:25.430> hornworm<00:01:26.180> there's<00:01:27.020> a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
parasitized tomato hornworm there's a

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.250 
parasitized tomato hornworm there's a
tiny<00:01:27.409> wasp<00:01:27.800> that<00:01:28.670> lays<00:01:28.940> its<00:01:29.150> eggs<00:01:29.420> along<00:01:30.020> the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
tiny wasp that lays its eggs along the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.620 
tiny wasp that lays its eggs along the
spine<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.130> tomato<00:01:31.400> hornworm<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.150> that's

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
spine of the tomato hornworm and that's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.510 
spine of the tomato hornworm and that's
a<00:01:32.750> good<00:01:32.930> thing<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.650> basically<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.250> little

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
a good thing so basically the little

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.570 
a good thing so basically the little
larvae<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.299> wasp<00:01:36.020> hatch<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.430> they

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
larvae of the wasp hatch and then they

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.450 
larvae of the wasp hatch and then they
burrow<00:01:37.850> into<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.750> caterpillar<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:39.470> they<00:01:40.280> eat

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
burrow into the caterpillar and they eat

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.430 
burrow into the caterpillar and they eat
it<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.700> they<00:01:40.820> kill<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:41.990> what<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.200> want<00:01:42.380> to

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
it and they kill it so what you want to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.830 
it and they kill it so what you want to
do<00:01:42.590> here<00:01:42.979> is<00:01:43.100> if<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.640> find<00:01:43.970> tomato<00:01:44.390> hornworm

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
do here is if you find tomato hornworm

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.440 
do here is if you find tomato hornworm
with<00:01:45.049> these<00:01:45.229> white<00:01:45.470> eggs<00:01:45.740> on<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.460> take<00:01:47.240> them

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
with these white eggs on it is take them

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.719 
with these white eggs on it is take them
and<00:01:47.659> move<00:01:48.200> them<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.380> your<00:01:48.530> sacrificial<00:01:49.280> tomato

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and move them to your sacrificial tomato

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.280 
and move them to your sacrificial tomato
plant<00:01:50.060> because<00:01:50.240> one<00:01:50.690> of<00:01:50.720> my<00:01:50.869> plants<00:01:51.200> is

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
plant because one of my plants is

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.440 
plant because one of my plants is
completely<00:01:51.920> almost<00:01:52.250> dead<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:52.790> I'm<00:01:53.119> going<00:01:53.390> to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
completely almost dead so I'm going to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.000 
completely almost dead so I'm going to
move<00:01:53.659> this<00:01:53.990> one<00:01:54.200> over<00:01:54.590> there<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.890> he'll

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
move this one over there and he'll

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.130 
move this one over there and he'll
continue<00:01:55.190> eating<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.940> these<00:01:56.450> wasps<00:01:56.750> will

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
continue eating and these wasps will

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.170 
continue eating and these wasps will
have<00:01:57.290> time<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.890> grow<00:01:58.130> because<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:58.729> want<00:01:58.940> more

this thing for a half an hour so what do
you<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.040> when<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.280> find<00:02:32.519> horn<00:02:32.819> worms<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.800> there

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
you do when you find horn worms on there

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.259 
you do when you find horn worms on there
aren't<00:02:35.190> hundreds<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.760> them<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:36.090> might<00:02:36.239> be

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
aren't hundreds of them there might be

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.180 
aren't hundreds of them there might be
three<00:02:36.630> there<00:02:36.989> might<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.230> five<00:02:37.620> there<00:02:38.010> might<00:02:38.160> be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
three there might be five there might be

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.580 
three there might be five there might be
ten<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.849> if<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.420> take<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.930> couple<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.349> minutes

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
ten but if you take a couple of minutes

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.289 
ten but if you take a couple of minutes
you<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.860> find<00:02:41.129> them<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> best<00:02:41.849> way<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.060> do

being<00:03:13.500> too<00:03:13.590> foliated<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.670> shouldn't<00:03:15.360> go

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
being too foliated you shouldn't go

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.420 
being too foliated you shouldn't go
inside<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.290> have<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> cup<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.980> coffee<00:03:17.130> you

and put them on our sacrificial tomato

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.420 
and put them on our sacrificial tomato
plant<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:34.079> we'll<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.350> lay<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.769> right<00:03:35.040> in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
plant so we'll just lay that right in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.509 
plant so we'll just lay that right in
with<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.670> other<00:03:35.790> guy<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:37.130> let<00:03:38.130> those<00:03:38.250> wasps
