 build and this 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.420

 you will not develop your hearing 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.900
 you will still be in trouble 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.840
 others however tune the guitar this 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.760
 just unfortunately few are born with 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.670
 absolute pitch to tune 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.220
 instrument and by ear 1 everyone else 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 like me and you we can use 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.610
 electronic tuner 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.470
 here this crafter tiji 200h tuner will help 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.559
 you tune your guitar and start playing 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.910
 quick and easy 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.670
 this tuner can be used by two 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.879
 in various ways the first way with 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.280
 using the built-in microphone, pour out 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.530
 string microphone catch sound and tuner 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.729
 shows you whether this string is tuned 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.550
 on the right note 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.590
 if the string is upset is the tuner 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.229
 shows how upset she is 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.780
 bright orange color means what 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.789
 the string is not tuned and the colors are there 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.009
 turns green as you 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.750
 configure strontium 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.450
 another way to use a tuner is 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.759
 hook it to the head of the neck while doing so 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.400
 the tuner works like a pickup 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.189
 again the orange glow shows 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.799
 which strings are not tuned and as 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.630
 how do you tune each string glow 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.630
 will turn green 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.159
 about 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.560
 much better in this tuner mode 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.260
 removes the sound that you extract through 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.420
 guitar vibration instead of using 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.670
 microphone is a useful feature if you 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.120
 want to tune your noisy room guitar 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.640
 where there are external sounds or people play 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.860
 on other instruments with a microphone 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.409
 can not tell where your sound 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.030
 guitar where is stranger 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.430
 another useful feature of this tuner is 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.340
 the fact that he is completely chromatic is 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.530
 means that the tuner recognizes all notes 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.629
 octaves it may be useful 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.849
