00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.429 

I<00:00:04.799> like<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.779> three<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.870> one<00:00:06.899> kind<00:00:07.290> of

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:07.439 
I like to do a three to one kind of

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.470 
I like to do a three to one kind of
balance<00:00:07.680> when<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.859> make<00:00:08.069> my<00:00:08.100> grits<00:00:08.490> whether

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
balance when I make my grits whether

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.560 
balance when I make my grits whether
that<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.930> quick<00:00:10.770> grits<00:00:10.950> or<00:00:11.160> they<00:00:11.969> may<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
that be quick grits or they may be the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.509 
that be quick grits or they may be the
long<00:00:12.750> kind<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.049> style<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.380> grits<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.920> think

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
long kind of style of grits I think

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
long kind of style of grits I think
three<00:00:15.059> parts<00:00:15.420> liquid<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.139> part<00:00:16.410> grit

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
three parts liquid to one part grit

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.999 
three parts liquid to one part grit
works<00:00:16.950> really<00:00:17.220> well<00:00:17.720> and<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.230> back<00:00:19.560> off<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
works really well and I back off the

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.499 
works really well and I back off the
cream<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> little<00:00:20.400> bit<00:00:20.700> only<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.239> the<00:00:21.329> pure

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
cream a little bit only for the pure

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.960 
cream a little bit only for the pure
fact<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.040> add<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.369> much<00:00:23.489> cream<00:00:23.759> to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
fact that if you add so much cream to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.310 
fact that if you add so much cream to
him<00:00:24.090> yeah<00:00:24.239> it<00:00:24.329> does<00:00:24.480> make<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.809> rich<00:00:24.989> but<00:00:25.230> they

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
him yeah it does make them rich but they

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.530 
him yeah it does make them rich but they
tend<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> break<00:00:25.860> sometimes<00:00:26.399> get<00:00:26.669> kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.939> oily

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
tend to break sometimes get kind of oily

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.260 
tend to break sometimes get kind of oily
I<00:00:27.570> guess<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.930> could<00:00:28.079> say<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:29.309> allows<00:00:29.579> more

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
I guess you could say this allows more

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.790 
I guess you could say this allows more
of<00:00:30.360> a<00:00:30.419> pure<00:00:30.660> flavor<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.259> grit<00:00:31.469> to<00:00:31.619> come

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
of a pure flavor of the grit to come

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
of a pure flavor of the grit to come
through<00:00:32.070> rather<00:00:32.820> than<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> cream<00:00:33.329> kind<00:00:33.600> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
through rather than the cream kind of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
through rather than the cream kind of
muddling<00:00:34.050> things<00:00:34.230> over<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> bit<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:35.850> why

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
muddling things over a bit so that's why

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.169 
muddling things over a bit so that's why
I<00:00:36.120> back<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.780> cream<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.190> I've<00:00:38.339> got<00:00:38.550> got<00:00:39.059> my

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
I back off the cream so I've got got my

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:40.729 
I back off the cream so I've got got my
two<00:00:39.239> cups<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.019> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.170> put<00:00:40.500> them<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.679> a

pick up a little bit of a reddish hue

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.080 
pick up a little bit of a reddish hue
but<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.190> really<00:01:43.369> nothing<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.700> be<00:01:43.850> worried

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
but it's really nothing to be worried

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.670 
but it's really nothing to be worried
about<00:01:44.180> they<00:01:44.570> sort<00:01:44.780> of<00:01:44.899> sort<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.410> goes<00:01:45.530> away

about they sort of sort of goes away

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.440 
about they sort of sort of goes away
once<00:01:45.890> you<00:01:46.040> add<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.310> grits<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.300> we're

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
once you add the grits to it and we're

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.520 
once you add the grits to it and we're
using<00:01:47.960> Anson<00:01:48.590> Mills<00:01:48.820> course<00:01:50.290> sorry<00:01:51.290> quick

using Anson Mills course sorry quick

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.290 
using Anson Mills course sorry quick
grits<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:52.250> do<00:01:52.369> use<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.610> quick<00:01:52.759> grits<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.240> we

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
grits we do use the quick grits and we

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.760 
grits we do use the quick grits and we
also<00:01:53.450> use<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.750> coarse<00:01:53.960> ground<00:01:54.200> grits<00:01:54.410> it<00:01:54.649> just

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
also use the coarse ground grits it just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.170 
also use the coarse ground grits it just
depends<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.250> preparation<00:01:55.850> we<00:01:55.940> were<00:01:56.030> going

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
depends on the preparation we were going

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.880 
depends on the preparation we were going
to<00:01:56.240> use<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.660> figured<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:57.350> was<00:01:57.530> great<00:01:57.740> for

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
to use I figured this was great for

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.200 
to use I figured this was great for
class<00:01:58.100> because<00:01:58.369> when<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.550> get<00:01:58.640> them<00:01:58.729> done<00:01:58.940> a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
class because when you get them done a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.059 
class because when you get them done a
lot<00:01:59.540> faster<00:01:59.720> than<00:01:59.930> waiting<00:02:00.080> 45<00:02:00.530> minutes<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:01.009> an

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
lot faster than waiting 45 minutes to an

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.770 
lot faster than waiting 45 minutes to an
hour<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.520> grits<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.819> cook<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.539> should<00:02:02.720> be

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
hour for grits to cook you should be

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.800 
hour for grits to cook you should be
done<00:02:02.929> in<00:02:02.959> about<00:02:03.020> 25-30<00:02:03.590> minutes<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:05.209> top

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
done in about 25-30 minutes so a top

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.490 
done in about 25-30 minutes so a top
just<00:02:06.140> depending<00:02:06.500> on<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.709> on<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.950> temperature

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
just depending on the on the temperature

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.660 
just depending on the on the temperature
and<00:02:09.500> then<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.100> we're<00:02:10.310> going<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.520> add<00:02:10.640> some

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and then to that we're going to add some

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.040 
and then to that we're going to add some
shredded<00:02:11.000> white<00:02:11.330> cheddar<00:02:11.600> because<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:11.990> think

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
shredded white cheddar because I think

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.530

and set them to the side for about five

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.670 
and set them to the side for about five
minutes<00:02:57.180> you'll<00:02:57.780> find<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.320> grits<00:02:58.530> will

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
minutes you'll find that the grits will

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.290 
minutes you'll find that the grits will
release<00:02:58.980> themselves<00:02:59.220> right<00:02:59.610> back<00:02:59.850> into<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
to the bulk of them and then you can put

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.790 
to the bulk of them and then you can put

them right back on the heat and continue
to<00:03:04.890> stir<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:05.970> trick<00:03:06.209> she<00:03:06.390> kind<00:03:06.600> of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
to stir so the little trick she kind of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.220
