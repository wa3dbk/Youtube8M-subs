00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
myself have become obsessed with games

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.910 
myself have become obsessed with games
like<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.599> feel<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.349> should<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
like we feel like we should get a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.179 
like we feel like we should get a
certain<00:00:29.730> amount<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.150> content<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.439> $60

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
certain amount of content out of the $60

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.229 
certain amount of content out of the $60
or<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.090> spend<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.690> video<00:00:34.440> games<00:00:35.239> now

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
or so that we spend on video games now

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
or so that we spend on video games now
it's<00:00:36.480> interesting<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.710> back<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it's interesting because I think back to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979 
it's interesting because I think back to
the<00:00:38.489> experiences<00:00:39.180> I've<00:00:39.270> had<00:00:39.300> over<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> past

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the experiences I've had over the past

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
the experiences I've had over the past
few<00:00:40.200> years<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.820> if<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> games

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
few years and if there is a lot of games

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
few years and if there is a lot of games
because<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.410> think<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> developers<00:00:44.370> feel

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
because I think that the developers feel

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.160 
because I think that the developers feel
pressured<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> give<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> enough<00:00:45.690> content

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
pressured to give you enough content

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650 
pressured to give you enough content
that<00:00:46.860> give<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> bunch<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.879> fetch<00:00:48.149> quests

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that give you a bunch of fetch quests

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.760 
that give you a bunch of fetch quests
and<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> name<00:00:49.320> any<00:00:49.379> games

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and I'm not going to name any games

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.049 
and I'm not going to name any games
because<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.309> don't<00:00:50.430> feel<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> whole

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
because I just don't feel like the whole

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.330 
because I just don't feel like the whole

into<00:01:41.909> games<00:01:42.860> because<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> developers<00:01:44.549> feel

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
into games because the developers feel

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.080 
into games because the developers feel
pressured<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.390> give<00:01:45.720> us<00:01:45.930> enough<00:01:46.880> now<00:01:47.880> there

I've played where you know is this game

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
I've played where you know is this game
was<00:02:04.380> six<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.189> seven<00:02:05.250> hours<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.210> felt<00:02:06.450> great

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
was six or seven hours but it felt great

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
was six or seven hours but it felt great
it<00:02:07.079> felt<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> felt<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.220> got<00:02:08.340> enough

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it felt like I felt like I got enough

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.119 
it felt like I felt like I got enough
out<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> experience<00:02:10.379> I'm<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.830> thinking

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
out of the experience I'm just thinking

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.470 
out of the experience I'm just thinking
of<00:02:11.220> examples<00:02:11.730> love<00:02:11.910> top<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.270> my<00:02:12.330> head<00:02:12.450> right

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
now Castle

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.850 
now Castle
any<00:02:13.510> lords<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:13.990> shadow<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.500> don't<00:02:14.650> know<00:02:14.710> how

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
any lords of shadow I don't know how

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.350 
any lords of shadow I don't know how
long<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.100> game<00:02:15.460> was<00:02:15.700> I'm<00:02:15.850> not<00:02:15.880> saying<00:02:16.210> was

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
long that game was I'm not saying was

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.540 
long that game was I'm not saying was
only<00:02:16.510> five<00:02:16.690> or<00:02:16.870> six<00:02:17.020> hours<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:17.890> pretty<00:02:18.280> I'm

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
only five or six hours I'm pretty I'm

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.160 
only five or six hours I'm pretty I'm
actually<00:02:18.730> fairly<00:02:19.000> sure<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.480> was<00:02:19.630> longer<00:02:19.959> than

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
actually fairly sure it was longer than

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.860 
actually fairly sure it was longer than
that<00:02:20.230> but<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.459> felt<00:02:21.880> like<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.150> pacing<00:02:22.720> was

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
that but it felt like the pacing was

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.120 
that but it felt like the pacing was
right<00:02:23.140> with<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.500> game<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.250> that's<00:02:25.060> where<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
right with that game and that's where I

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.750 
right with that game and that's where I
think<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.880> problem<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:30.040> us<00:02:30.250> as<00:02:30.459> gamers

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
think the problem is with us as gamers

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.750 
think the problem is with us as gamers
is<00:02:31.680> don't<00:02:32.680> worry<00:02:32.920> about<00:02:33.070> how<00:02:33.520> much<00:02:33.700> you're

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
is don't worry about how much you're

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.340 
is don't worry about how much you're
getting<00:02:34.270> because<00:02:34.390> sometimes<00:02:34.840> if<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:35.290> too

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
getting because sometimes if you get too

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.030 
getting because sometimes if you get too
much<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.550> could<00:02:36.730> bore<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.209> shit<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.630> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
much it could bore the shit out of you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.860 
much it could bore the shit out of you
think<00:02:39.040> about<00:02:39.220> how<00:02:39.370> much<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.820> enjoyed<00:02:40.270> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
think about how much you enjoyed the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.020 
think about how much you enjoyed the
experience<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:42.280> I'm<00:02:42.400> not<00:02:42.520> saying<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.910> know

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
experience now I'm not saying you know

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.309 
experience now I'm not saying you know
developers<00:02:43.569> should<00:02:43.690> make<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.870> game<00:02:44.050> it's<00:02:44.200> and

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
developers should make a game it's and

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.840 
developers should make a game it's and
now<00:02:44.380> we're<00:02:44.560> long<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.040> make<00:02:45.160> us<00:02:45.280> pay<00:02:45.459> 60

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850

bucks<00:02:46.030> for<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.410> where<00:02:47.650> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
bucks for it and then that's where you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.050 
bucks for it and then that's where you
kind<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.950> get<00:02:48.070> into<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.310> gray<00:02:48.489> area<00:02:48.520> where

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
kind of get into the gray area where

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.479 
kind of get into the gray area where
there's<00:02:49.209> no<00:02:49.360> exact<00:02:49.780> science<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.380> length<00:02:51.310> of

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
there's no exact science to length of

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.530 
there's no exact science to length of
games<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.890> put<00:02:54.070> aside<00:02:54.190> how<00:02:55.000> much
