flames 33 does the smart cover work with

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.480 
flames 33 does the smart cover work with
the<00:00:16.430> first-generation<00:00:16.820> iPad<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:19.010> answer<00:00:19.340> is

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
the first-generation iPad the answer is

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.220 
the first-generation iPad the answer is
no<00:00:19.760> the<00:00:21.130> ipad<00:00:22.130> 2<00:00:22.400> has<00:00:23.060> magnets<00:00:23.689> built<00:00:23.900> into<00:00:24.140> the

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
no the ipad 2 has magnets built into the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.460 
no the ipad 2 has magnets built into the
frame<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.040> the<00:00:25.630> smart<00:00:26.630> cover<00:00:26.810> will<00:00:26.990> only<00:00:27.170> work

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
frame so the smart cover will only work

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.680 
frame so the smart cover will only work
with<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:28.039> ipad<00:00:28.490> 2<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:28.970> not<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.390> first

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
with the ipad 2 and not the first

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.799 
with the ipad 2 and not the first
generation<00:00:30.170> ipad<00:00:30.760> next<00:00:31.760> question<00:00:32.029> comes<00:00:32.059> from

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.380 
life be affected by the new Intel Sandy
Bridge<00:01:15.979> processors<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.000> answer<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.270> yes

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
Bridge processors and the answer is yes

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.320 
Bridge processors and the answer is yes
the<00:01:18.200> new<00:01:18.350> core<00:01:18.590> i5<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.009> core<00:01:19.190> i7<00:01:19.700> processors

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
the new core i5 and core i7 processors

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.660 
the new core i5 and core i7 processors
use<00:01:21.080> intel<00:01:21.590> turbo<00:01:21.800> boost<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.310> point<00:01:22.550> out

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
use intel turbo boost to point out

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.150 
use intel turbo boost to point out
technology<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.899> boosts<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.560> speed<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:25.130> a

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
technology that boosts the speed to a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.650 
technology that boosts the speed to a
higher<00:01:25.399> gigahertz<00:01:25.849> on<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.270> previous

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
higher gigahertz on the previous

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.900 
higher gigahertz on the previous
generation<00:01:26.830> processors<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.039> draws<00:01:28.700> more

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
generation processors that draws more

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.609 
generation processors that draws more
power<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:29.479> battery<00:01:29.810> life<00:01:29.959> will<00:01:30.140> be<00:01:30.229> reduced

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
power so battery life will be reduced

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.279 
power so battery life will be reduced
but<00:01:31.190> also<00:01:31.369> apple<00:01:31.970> is<00:01:32.090> using<00:01:32.569> a<00:01:32.780> much<00:01:32.990> more

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
but also apple is using a much more

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.699 
but also apple is using a much more
stringent<00:01:34.179> battery<00:01:35.179> testing<00:01:35.630> methodology<00:01:36.349> so

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
stringent battery testing methodology so

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.070 
stringent battery testing methodology so
the<00:01:37.250> battery<00:01:37.729> tests<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.539> are<00:01:38.630> posted<00:01:38.840> on

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
the battery tests that are posted on

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.139 
the battery tests that are posted on
apple's<00:01:39.410> website<00:01:39.470> are<00:01:40.039> going<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.369> be<00:01:40.550> slightly

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
apple's website are going to be slightly

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.570 
apple's website are going to be slightly
lower<00:01:41.509> because<00:01:41.929> they're<00:01:42.050> using<00:01:42.500> much<00:01:43.369> more

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
lower because they're using much more

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.669 
lower because they're using much more
aggressive<00:01:44.060> tests<00:01:44.599> so<00:01:45.590> next<00:01:46.039> question<00:01:47.679> is

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
aggressive tests so next question is

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.730 
aggressive tests so next question is
from<00:01:49.099> Jason<00:01:50.030> studios<00:01:50.599> how<00:01:51.319> did<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.530> get<00:01:51.649> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
from Jason studios how did you get the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.949 
from Jason studios how did you get the
triple<00:01:52.009> monitor<00:01:52.550> setup<00:01:52.910> on<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:53.119> macbook<00:01:53.450> pro

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
triple monitor setup on your macbook pro

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.309 
triple monitor setup on your macbook pro
and<00:01:54.289> are<00:01:54.709> the<00:01:54.860> two<00:01:55.069> displays<00:01:55.399> linked<00:01:56.090> or

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
and are the two displays linked or

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.510 
and are the two displays linked or
separate<00:01:57.700> these<00:01:58.700> three<00:01:59.630> displays<00:02:00.289> are<00:02:00.860> all

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
separate these three displays are all

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.210 
separate these three displays are all
linked<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.390> means<00:02:02.690> there<00:02:02.869> it's<00:02:03.259> one<00:02:03.590> huge
