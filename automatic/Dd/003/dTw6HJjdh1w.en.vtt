application

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.410 

working<00:02:15.130> with<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> game<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.000> get<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.300> in

working with the game and I get it in

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.940 
working with the game and I get it in
there<00:02:16.630> make<00:02:16.810> sure<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.050> all<00:02:17.349> stuck<00:02:17.650> under

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
there make sure it's all stuck under

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.370 
there make sure it's all stuck under

there so the driver can do this all by

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.860 
there so the driver can do this all by
himself

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
himself

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.010 
himself
yeah<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.770> we've<00:02:23.920> got<00:02:24.069> pushrods<00:02:24.730> out<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.150> fully

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
yeah so we've got pushrods out now fully

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.860 
yeah so we've got pushrods out now fully
applied<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:28.000> we're<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.239> just

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
applied and you can see we're just just

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:39.320 
applied and you can see we're just just
at<00:02:29.050> an<00:02:29.200> inch<00:02:31.950> right<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.569> can<00:02:34.750> see<00:02:34.959> that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.009 

yeah<00:02:40.330> good

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
yeah good

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.280 
yeah good
go<00:02:41.590> ahead<00:02:41.860> have<00:02:42.069> another<00:02:42.280> no<00:02:42.850> no<00:02:43.120> that's<00:02:43.780> good

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
go ahead have another no no that's good

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.640 
go ahead have another no no that's good
so<00:02:45.010> typically<00:02:45.580> now<00:02:45.760> you're<00:02:46.000> making<00:02:46.360> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
so typically now you're making a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.479 
so typically now you're making a
probably<00:02:47.650> about<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.980> ninety<00:02:48.340> or<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.459> hundred

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
probably about a ninety or a hundred

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.520 
probably about a ninety or a hundred
twelve<00:02:48.910> service<00:02:49.299> brake<00:02:49.540> application<00:02:50.350> right

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
twelve service brake application right

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.140 
twelve service brake application right
and<00:02:50.830> then<00:02:51.220> you're<00:02:51.370> coming<00:02:51.519> back<00:02:51.790> here<00:02:52.060> and

and then you're coming back here and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.759 
and then you're coming back here and
measuring<00:02:52.510> how<00:02:52.660> much<00:02:52.810> or<00:02:53.019> stroke<00:02:53.260> indicator

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
measuring how much or stroke indicator

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.039 
measuring how much or stroke indicator
came<00:02:54.400> out<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> push<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.239> with<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.630> push<00:02:55.840> rod

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
came out of the push out with a push rod

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.930 
came out of the push out with a push rod

niche and on this is just away the
authorities<00:03:13.239> took<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.720> -<00:03:13.900> if<00:03:14.140> you're

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
authorities took it - if you're

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.410 
authorities took it - if you're
participating<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.370> air<00:03:15.489> air<00:03:15.970> system

participating in the air air system

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.550 
participating in the air air system
check<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.790> maximum<00:03:18.790> on<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.150> regular<00:03:19.989> stroke

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
check the maximum on this regular stroke

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.460 
check the maximum on this regular stroke
30<00:03:21.340> inch<00:03:21.550> chamber<00:03:22.030> would<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.450> two<00:03:22.870> inches<00:03:23.110> and

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
30 inch chamber would be two inches and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.930 
30 inch chamber would be two inches and
then<00:03:23.800> we<00:03:23.890> would<00:03:24.069> start<00:03:24.280> reading<00:03:24.400> into<00:03:24.640> trouble

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
then we would start reading into trouble

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.610 
then we would start reading into trouble
that's<00:03:25.360> right<00:03:25.690> let's<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.080> have<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> look<00:03:26.470> at<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
that's right let's go have a look at the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.160

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.050 

this<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:34.980> how<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.160> driver<00:03:35.490> does<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.910> by

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
this is how the driver does it by

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.480 
this is how the driver does it by
himself<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:37.350> also<00:03:37.530> another<00:03:37.830> way<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.160> check

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
the arrows read them the big lights the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.710

regulates<00:03:43.110> are<00:03:43.290> also<00:03:43.440> on<00:03:43.830> SC<00:03:44.819> we've<00:03:45.300> just<00:03:45.540> got

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
regulates are also on SC we've just got

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.600 
regulates are also on SC we've just got
a<00:03:45.750> keen<00:03:46.050> in<00:03:46.260> there<00:03:46.470> now<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.040> don't<00:03:47.459> use

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
a keen in there now you don't use

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.100 
a keen in there now you don't use
anything<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.120> can<00:03:48.240> break<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> branch<00:03:48.750> off<00:03:49.080> a

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
anything you can break a branch off a

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.680 
anything you can break a branch off a
tree<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:49.770> outside<00:03:50.160> your<00:03:50.400> cap<00:03:50.640> put<00:03:51.540> it

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
tree if it's outside your cap put it

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.590 
tree if it's outside your cap put it
down<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:53.190> then<00:03:53.400> we've<00:03:53.610> got<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> gauge<00:03:54.240> that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
down and then we've got a gauge that

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.410 
down and then we've got a gauge that
says<00:03:54.930> we've<00:03:55.140> got<00:03:55.550> holy<00:03:56.550> crow<00:03:56.940> we're<00:03:57.180> almost

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
says we've got holy crow we're almost

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.160 
says we've got holy crow we're almost
looking<00:03:58.730> we<00:03:59.730> have<00:03:59.850> no<00:04:00.030> application<00:04:00.239> gauge<00:04:00.930> on

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
looking we have no application gauge on

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.340 
looking we have no application gauge on
this<00:04:01.410> tractor<00:04:01.860> no<00:04:02.340> but<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.790> got<00:04:02.820> heard<00:04:03.360> 40<00:04:03.810> psi

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
this tractor no but we got heard 40 psi

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.080 
this tractor no but we got heard 40 psi
so<00:04:04.560> there<00:04:04.739> should<00:04:04.920> be<00:04:04.950> lots<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.400> application

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
so there should be lots of application

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.130 
so there should be lots of application
