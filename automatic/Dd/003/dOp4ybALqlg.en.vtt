00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 Each one disappeared last week but still just returned 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.999
 Feeling that I returned home with the medal lowered 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.120
 That Vancouver Olympics 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.509
 Looking back on what kind of Olympics for me 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.439
 warm 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.509
 It's been a bit dry, and from here last week 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.989
 Do this 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.989
 I'm Kato 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.819
 Come back with a club 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.200
 Well I was weak today and changed and stood for a while 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.920
 But when I got down a minute 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.220
 Welcomed by many people 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.200
 being citic 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.720
 Yeah 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.250
 After all in a great big tournament 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.910
 I say I was able to leave the result 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.990
 thought 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.300
 I think that I was myself about the results in the prefectural university commissioner's association 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.970
 I felt rather frustrated not the result 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.250
 As time goes by 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 After all it's getting bigger 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.960
 I owed the outside of the window 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.940
 I will do my best 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.840
 Tohato 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 You cherish 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.370
 As really 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.640
 This medal 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.850
 I will be back again 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.900
 It is recorded there 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440
 that 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.390
 The time 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.550
 thinking about 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.850
 Especially before, I was not satisfied with my performance 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.010
 Though 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.440
 It is really fulfilling during the Olympics 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.860
 You can spend a good time 4 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.010
 that 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.560
 For my life 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.100
 I have really good memories 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.970
 I think I came 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.970
 It is this site 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.570
 Asao can do it 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.920
 For many people who wrote to Japan from Vancouver 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.049
 The fact that it came out with four balls was very much in addition to being said that 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.239
 now 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.619
 I'm glad I got a medal full of joy 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.079
 What a good feeling 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.889
 Figure skating while parked 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.249
 Penguin and 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.319
 And i am 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.699
 But in the current race three consecutive throws ps3 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.760
 We thought that it was 6 pension medals and the next step 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.269
 I will do my best for the installation 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.459
 I will be Nakajima 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.619
 eh 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.979
 Totopre 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.789
 I think it would be nice to return with a row medal 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.709
 I can get the last time 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.529
 Fun bank ends 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.529
 Olympics 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.409
 I will be another player 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.499
 Thank you very much 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.249
 Come home with a medal 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.779
 And a lot of people from 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.579
 Worked hard 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.719
 Feel free to say that voice 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.560
 I asked the person of the same airport to write that many 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:25.789
 That many people really cheered me up 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.360
 What 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.030
 I realize again 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.099
 I am so excited 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.559
 This Vancouver Olympics 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:34.259
 Then 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.570
 Another one is 7 years 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.410
 It was that fourth Olympics, but with that eye 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.089
 If it was a dream 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.419
 That 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.850
 It was a dream medal 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.329
 I was very happy that I was caught 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.479
 And that 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.869
 Really alone 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:56.299
 I've been able to support that I did not have this until here 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.880
 Many people 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.920
 And not thanks to the people who supported me 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.179
 Really from the heart 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.389
 I think it is full of feeling of great gratitude 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.649
 Thank you very much 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.279
 First in the country 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.589
 This is a movie 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.159
 Town today 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.259
 That return home 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.549
 We are really welcomed by many people 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.750
 People in Japan made a fire on the body and supported me 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.120
 I thought after I was full of conversion feelings 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.830
 The distant Vancouver Olympics 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.080
 Then 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.419
 Three people have power in silver medal in the last trial system 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.039
 I think it might be the result that was full 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.680
 Also in the individual because a little watch is this 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.680
 For this Olympics 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.540
 I want to hit you and I really think to many people 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.960
 Supported by the Vancouver Olympics 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.449
 I am overwhelmed, I am full of gratitude 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.759
 1. I made use of 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.789
 I will be a player 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.020
 Shown in Figure 2 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.950
 It plays a key role in management but the Olympics 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.330
 It became possible of really substantial contents 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.490
 I did not take anything in the personal war 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.270
 At the end of the day the team unites everyone in Chengdu 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.550
 I'm really happy that I was able to win a gold medal 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.539
 I think that thanks to the support of people around 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.200
 If we want to make use of this experience and make use of it in the future, maya and 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.120
 Answered 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.689
 There are people in it 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.539
 Then here's a question from everyone 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.150
 I will total 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
 Please specify your name and name 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.039
 Yes, after clarifying 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.050
 Which face is the question for any player 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.650
 so 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.930
 I think it was not a question 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:55.759
 ToDay 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.759
 The same team doctor's 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.029
 Because many come to the start also here 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:04.090
 If there is a goal, especially a private room, about the causal relationship 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.840
 I will reply from the accused doctor Noo 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.529
 Then please 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:12.529
 i. 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.339
 The TV Asahi will start everyone Thank you very much 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.180
 When it is said that the moment that was most in the heart of this tournament is good 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.490
 It was so heavy in the heart at that time 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.349
 Please tell me what kind of thought it was 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.629
 Each player sleeps 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.629
 Make select sale possible 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.379
 There is a wintering ground 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.379
 The second moment I finished sliding 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:43.339
 When time came out 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.809
 Because it was impossible time by myself 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.990
 I was so happy I can say that it is alive
