00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.080 
middle bit out and suppose you just use
any<00:01:12.619> plastic<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:14.939> because

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
any plastic really this is good because

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.899 
any plastic really this is good because
it's<00:01:15.360> flexible<00:01:16.189> which<00:01:17.189> means<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> shape

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it's flexible which means you can shape

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.179 
it's flexible which means you can shape
it<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.150> bit<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.840> give<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.830> around<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it a bit to like give it around the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.080 
it a bit to like give it around the
corner<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.810> yep<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> yeah<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:23.729> basically

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
going to cut that to the size of how

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.450 
going to cut that to the size of how
deep<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> substrate<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.979> deep<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
deep the substrate is is deep with the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.319 
deep the substrate is is deep with the
back<00:01:29.729> because<00:01:30.420> yeah<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.140> want<00:01:31.350> them<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:32.579> route

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so this is it cut to size hopefully I'm

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
so this is it cut to size hopefully I'm
just<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.110> ahead<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.470> put<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.680> in

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.420 
yeah it goes okay so that worked
reasonably<00:02:08.819> well<00:02:08.910> actually<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
reasonably well actually you can see a

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.760 
reasonably well actually you can see a
little<00:02:11.879> white<00:02:12.150> line<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.750> across<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
little white line going across the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
little white line going across the
had<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.340> trim<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.180> because

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
had to trim it down a little bit because

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.830 
had to trim it down a little bit because
it<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.600> little<00:02:15.780> bit<00:02:15.930> too<00:02:16.110> tall<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:17.660> at<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
it was a little bit too tall but at the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
it was a little bit too tall but at the
moment<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.260> at<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.770> would<00:02:19.890> dent<00:02:20.130> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
moment it's at and it would dent to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.840 
moment it's at and it would dent to
hopefully<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:21.030> few<00:02:21.380> top<00:02:22.380> layers<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.950> sand<00:02:23.430> we'll

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
hopefully a few top layers of sand we'll

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.480 
hopefully a few top layers of sand we'll
go<00:02:24.540> over<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.070> practically<00:02:26.070> cover<00:02:26.310> up

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
go over it in practically cover up

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.350 
go over it in practically cover up
completely<00:02:26.880> um<00:02:28.880> yeah<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.060> worked<00:02:30.270> pretty

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
completely um yeah that worked pretty

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.390 
completely um yeah that worked pretty
well<00:02:30.570> it's<00:02:30.840> also<00:02:30.990> going<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.290> make<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.040> easier

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
well it's also going to make it easier

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
well it's also going to make it easier
to<00:02:33.500> slip<00:02:34.500> off<00:02:35.930> any<00:02:37.100> she<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.340> bit<00:02:38.520> come<00:02:39.180> close

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
to slip off any she just bit come close

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.260 
to slip off any she just bit come close
to<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.800> yeah<00:02:40.920> when<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.550> fill<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.820> tank<00:02:42.060> back

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
to it so yeah when I fill the tank back

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.210 
to it so yeah when I fill the tank back
up<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.750> give<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> view<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.770> what<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:43.980> looks

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
up and give you a view of what it looks

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.360 
up and give you a view of what it looks
like<00:02:44.430> when<00:02:44.760> everything's<00:02:45.180> running<00:02:46.010> okay<00:02:47.010> so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
like when everything's running okay so

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.440 
like when everything's running okay so
we're<00:02:47.520> back<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.940> game<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:49.100> as<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:51.330> can

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
we're back in the game and as you can

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.290 
we're back in the game and as you can
see<00:02:52.250> there<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:55.110> as<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.350> said<00:02:55.410> earlier

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
see there it is but as I said earlier

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.390 
see there it is but as I said earlier
hopefully<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.510> top<00:02:57.840> layer<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.140> sand<00:02:58.380> will<00:02:59.250> go

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
hopefully a top layer of sand will go

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.060 
hopefully a top layer of sand will go
over<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.850> by<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.150> shrimp's<00:03:00.920> picking<00:03:01.920> at<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
over it by the shrimp's picking at it

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.000 
over it by the shrimp's picking at it
picking<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.520> algae<00:03:02.760> off<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.270> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
picking all the algae off it and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.690 
picking all the algae off it and
distributing<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.130> back<00:03:05.310> over<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:07.230> area<00:03:07.700> yeah

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
