00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.360
 hello guys today I 'm going to show you the 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.620
 application of colored pencils to 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.620
 a realistic style drawing 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.600
 As you can see, the drawing is not complete 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.730
 because what really interests me 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.529
 is that you learn the process and the 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.320
 application of various techniques for 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.119
 get a realistic style drawing 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.790
 you do not need to see the whole drawing 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.619
 because it's a pretty complex drawing and 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.050
 in the background very few people are going to 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.160
 can do 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.160
 and that is not the idea 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.210
 as you see in this case in particular I 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.610
 I'm making flower petals like this 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.470
 that in this case we start with the edge 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 we started to trace it in a very 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.739
 soft and well defined with a good pencil 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.739
 sharp 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.080
 then when we have the edge well 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.240
 defined we started to fill it with a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.759
 First layer of very faint coloration 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.860
 it must be a very thin layer because it is the 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.320
 first the measure that we are adding 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.979
 more and more layers we start to exercise 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.979
 more pressure 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.290
 when we have the first layer made 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.500
 we started to apply the second layer that 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.299
 of a purple color unfortunately the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.350
 camera is not able to perceive this 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.619
 subtle variation of hue but then if 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.619
 it looks 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.620
 then the second layer I know it 's from 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.930
 much more pressure 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.580
 and neither is it an extremely drawing 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.530
 complex because there are basically two 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.040
 layers by petals which is quite 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.040
 little bit 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 as you see the process repeats several 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.840
 times and it's basically the same 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.800
 then once you have some 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.540
 petals basically repeat it all 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.860
 as many times as necessary but the process 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.860
 it is not very complex either 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.890
 what must be very careful is 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.980
 tenacity come long 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.470
 all right 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.090
 just the weakness of the pencils 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.920
 prismacolor premier which are the ones 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.870
 I'm using in this case is that it 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.640
 They spend extremely fast because the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.640
 Pigment quality is remarkable 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.860
 in that good sense they have a short 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.830
 cardboard and gradually begin to sharpen the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.209
 pencil and on a sheet next to it 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.190
 begin to stack what they then take out 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.349
 at the bottom of taking out the mine with the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.220
 short canton and start stacking in a 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.220
 sheet next to them 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.130
 obviously in this drawing I do not apply 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.860
 the outline with the colored pencils 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.230
 in a fast way and without so much care 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.100
 but I did it before with a 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.100
 2h pencil 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.599
 the difference of the realistic drawing in the 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.310
 colored pencils and graffiti 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.430
 shades 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.290
 the most important one can be noted with 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.810
 the graphite pencil we can erase 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.270
 certain parts that went wrong 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.540
 while the color pencil does not 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.540
 can 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.240
 In addition, realism with pencils 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.240
 graphite is much faster than 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.770
 Realism with colored pencils 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.930
 basically because with pencil 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.380
 graphite we have a fairly wide range 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.000
 of tonalities that does not change the hue 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.760
 only one that changes is tonality is 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.620
 say darker or lighter while 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.450
 that with the crayons we 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.450
 we have hue and nuance 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.340
 based on my personal experience not 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.330
 I can affirm the realism of colors is 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.330
 much more complex 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.880
 It must be clear to all that 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.160
 I'm saying it applies to the actual drawing 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.500
 and it does not have to be confused with semi 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.500
 realistic or with hyper realism there 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.140
 many that I've seen a lot of people saying 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.050
 that draws hyper realistic I do not know what 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.790
 and it's wrong it's wrong because really I 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.100
 I have seen his works and they have not even 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.290
 come to realism therefore 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.920
 for example this drawing of the flowers I 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.870
 say is between realism and 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.080
 semi realism that is to say it is in a 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.080
 transition 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.339
 well this is another drawing is a deer 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.129
 it's an animal called level eggs 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.749
 the southern zone of chile is an animal 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:15.089
 precious and that I say because basically 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:15.089
 it applies in the same way not the same 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.389
 as in the central figure is the game 

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:41.110
 therefore it is the most detailed and well 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:45.149
 drawn on all the rest is not so 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.149
 detailed and it's pretty general 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.400
 how to see them look like this 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.150
 we could say that they are realistic or 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.550
 Maybe it's real 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.409
 and good as always do not hesitate 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.090
 subscribe remember that I upload videos 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.289
 10 Wednesday so we are the 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.289
 next week chao
