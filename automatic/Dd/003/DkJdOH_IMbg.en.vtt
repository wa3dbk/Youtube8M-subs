00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
once a dig - three blocks away

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:55.180 
once a dig - three blocks away
one<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:45.140> like<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:48.620> tick<00:00:49.620> down<00:00:50.600> down<00:00:51.600> there

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.819

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so left was a little up going bit there

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.630 
so left was a little up going bit there
and<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.299> space<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:08.220> you're<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and a space here now you're going to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.929 
and a space here now you're going to
need<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.850> space<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> note<00:01:10.290> blocks<00:01:10.939> for

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
need a space for the note blocks for

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.410 
need a space for the note blocks for
this<00:01:12.689> doorbell<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.330> want<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.320> channel<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
this doorbell so I want the channel a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:27.830 
this doorbell so I want the channel a
little<00:01:18.420> space<00:01:18.869> here<00:01:24.680> right<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.630> there's<00:01:27.630> space

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
little space here right so there's space

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.010 
little space here right so there's space
for<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.409> load<00:01:28.680> blocks<00:01:29.299> but<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.570> need<00:01:30.750> space

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
for one load blocks but we need space

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.090 
for one load blocks but we need space
for<00:01:31.320> another<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.450> we<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.900> take<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
for another one so we have to take that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.899 
for another one so we have to take that
out<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.439> same<00:01:37.439> other<00:01:37.680> sizes<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.460> needs<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.820> be

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
out and same other sizes so needs to be

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.510 
out and same other sizes so needs to be
symmetrical

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:55.570 

like<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.900> some<00:01:46.229> more<00:01:46.380> lights<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
like so do some more lights and this is

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.429 
like so do some more lights and this is
the<00:01:56.580> template<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.479> where<00:01:57.690> your<00:01:58.080> note<00:01:58.259> box

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
the template to where your note box

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.180 
the template to where your note box
within<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> B<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:01.200> there's<00:02:01.680> no<00:02:01.979> block

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
within the B so now there's no block

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.010 
within the B so now there's no block
there<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.729> they're<00:02:03.200> there<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.649> they're<00:02:06.020> like

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
there and they're there and they're like

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.930 
there and they're there and they're like
so<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.600> will<00:02:09.810> look<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:13.760> go<00:02:14.760> back

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so so it will look like this go back

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.949 
so so it will look like this go back
down<00:02:16.130> please<00:02:17.130> redstone<00:02:17.730> here<00:02:18.650> here<00:02:19.650> here<00:02:20.430> here

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
down please redstone here here here here

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:38.479 
down please redstone here here here here
here<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:23.280> here<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.709> that's<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:37.220> that's<00:02:38.220> one

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
here here here and that's it that's one

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.289 
here here here and that's it that's one
more<00:02:38.610> thing<00:02:38.670> just<00:02:39.290> got<00:02:40.880> there's<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.970> lot<00:02:42.209> of

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
more thing just got there's a lot of

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.130 
more thing just got there's a lot of
people<00:02:43.040> don't<00:02:44.040> actually<00:02:44.250> know<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.970> no<00:02:45.840> blocks

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
people don't actually know is no blocks

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.470 
people don't actually know is no blocks
make<00:02:46.530> different<00:02:46.890> sounds<00:02:47.100> on<00:02:47.519> different

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
make different sounds on different

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.360 
make different sounds on different
materials<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.430> note<00:02:51.360> block<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:52.370> smooth

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
materials so a note block on smooth

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.370 
materials so a note block on smooth
stone<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> bass<00:02:54.840> drum<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:56.750> don't<00:02:57.750> work<00:02:58.049> on

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
stone is a bass drum I don't work on

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.199 
stone is a bass drum I don't work on
powerful<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.700> I<00:03:00.109> think<00:03:01.109> nature<00:03:02.329> correctly<00:03:03.709> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
powerful is I think nature correctly and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.520 
powerful is I think nature correctly and
on<00:03:06.209> dirt<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.290> piano<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.140> simple

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
on dirt it's a piano so it's not simple

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.490 
on dirt it's a piano so it's not simple
enough

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
enough

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.970 
enough
alright<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:15.239> add<00:03:15.450> redstone<00:03:16.380> torch

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
alright so now we add redstone torch

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.190 
alright so now we add redstone torch
right<00:03:17.250> there

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
right there

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.440 
right there
so<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.579> when<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:22.200> circuit<00:03:22.829> turns<00:03:23.130> on<00:03:23.579> it

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
so that when that circuit turns on it

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.009 
so that when that circuit turns on it
will<00:03:24.660> think<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.880> when<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.930> will

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
will think this but when it and it will

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.849 
will think this but when it and it will
turn<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.590> torch<00:03:29.220> off<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.780> when<00:03:30.959> there's<00:03:31.530> no

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
turn that torch off but when there's no

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.729 
turn that torch off but when there's no
power<00:03:32.579> in<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.120> circuit<00:03:33.660> will<00:03:34.320> turn<00:03:34.560> that

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
power in that circuit will turn that

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.789 
power in that circuit will turn that
torch<00:03:35.040> back<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.989> turn<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.200> circuit<00:03:37.650> on

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
torch back on and turn this circuit on

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.300 
torch back on and turn this circuit on
therefore<00:03:39.440> letting<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.620> know<00:03:40.799> blocks<00:03:41.100> off

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
therefore letting you know blocks off

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.900 
therefore letting you know blocks off
right

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:55.110 

we<00:03:45.910> now<00:03:47.790> get<00:03:48.790> got<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.900> wall<00:03:50.140> wire<00:03:50.800> okay<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.850> I'm

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
we now get got to wall wire okay so I'm

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.900 
we now get got to wall wire okay so I'm
just<00:03:55.360> gonna<00:03:55.540> basically<00:03:56.310> loop<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.520> round

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
just gonna basically loop this round

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.980 
just gonna basically loop this round
back<00:03:58.780> up<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.350> button<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.090> need<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
back up to that button so you need to

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:16.560 
back up to that button so you need to
put<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.800> rest<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.250> along<00:04:03.460> here<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:16.330> you<00:04:16.420> put

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
put the rest in along here so you put

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.009 
put the rest in along here so you put
some<00:04:16.720> red<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.739> put<00:04:18.070> some<00:04:18.220> redstone<00:04:18.430> along

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
some red so you put some redstone along

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:36.360 
some red so you put some redstone along
here<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:23.460> put<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.550> up<00:04:24.670> here<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:35.200> it's<00:04:35.920> next

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
here you put it up here and so it's next

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.630 
here you put it up here and so it's next
to<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.610> buses<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:38.080> you<00:04:38.140> can<00:04:38.380> now<00:04:38.530> just<00:04:38.890> copy

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
to the buses so you can now just copy

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.530 
to the buses so you can now just copy
all<00:04:39.970> that<00:04:44.580> excuse<00:04:45.580> me<00:04:45.760> if<00:04:45.850> there's<00:04:46.120> easier

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
all that excuse me if there's easier

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.750 
all that excuse me if there's easier
ways<00:04:46.600> of<00:04:46.990> doing<00:04:47.140> that<00:04:47.410> that's<00:04:47.650> just<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.669> only

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
ways of doing that that's just the only

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.960 
ways of doing that that's just the only
thing<00:04:48.910> I'm<00:04:49.240> sort<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:50.790> so<00:04:51.790> that's

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
thing I'm sort of and so that's

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.500 
thing I'm sort of and so that's
basically<00:04:52.840> all<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:54.340> mechanics<00:04:54.940> sorted<00:04:55.330> out

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
basically all the mechanics sorted out

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.010 
basically all the mechanics sorted out
we<00:04:55.750> just<00:04:55.780> need<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.230> tune<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.680> note<00:04:56.860> blocks

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
we just need to tune the note blocks

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.500 
we just need to tune the note blocks
which<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.380> quite<00:05:00.310> easy<00:05:00.490> enough<00:05:00.820> because<00:05:01.210> all

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
which is quite easy enough because all

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.450 
which is quite easy enough because all
you<00:05:01.810> need<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:02.169> do<00:05:02.350> is<00:05:02.620> click<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:05.220> we<00:05:06.220> are

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
you need to do is click it so we are

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.680 
you need to do is click it so we are
going<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.669> tune<00:05:06.970> these<00:05:07.210> notes<00:05:07.570> blocks<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.710> E

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
going to tune these notes blocks to E

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:25.380 
going to tune these notes blocks to E
and<00:05:10.690> C<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.880> E<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:15.330> 22<00:05:16.360> clicks<00:05:20.340> 22<00:05:21.340> clicks<00:05:24.390> okay

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
and C so E is 22 clicks 22 clicks okay

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.630 
and C so E is 22 clicks 22 clicks okay
so<00:05:26.350> those<00:05:27.100> two<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.730> was<00:05:28.000> tuned<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.480> e<00:05:28.690> now<00:05:29.110> we

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
so those two I was tuned to e now we

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.920 
so those two I was tuned to e now we
need<00:05:30.640> to<00:05:30.760> tune<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.120> other<00:05:31.300> two<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:32.020> C<00:05:35.040> of<00:05:36.040> E<00:05:36.340> and

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
need to tune the other two to C of E and

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.820 
need to tune the other two to C of E and
lower<00:05:37.930> F<00:05:38.290> sharp<00:05:38.800> gray<00:05:40.620> we<00:05:41.620> need<00:05:41.800> to<00:05:41.919> tune<00:05:42.160> these

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
lower F sharp gray we need to tune these

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.980 
lower F sharp gray we need to tune these
C<00:05:45.450> which<00:05:46.450> is<00:05:46.660> 18<00:05:47.140> clicks<00:05:47.700> I'll<00:05:48.700> post<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.480> link<00:05:49.510> on

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
C which is 18 clicks I'll post a link on

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.630 
C which is 18 clicks I'll post a link on
the<00:05:50.650> description<00:05:50.790> to<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:52.660> wiki<00:05:52.990> for<00:05:53.640> note

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
the description to the wiki for note

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.490 
the description to the wiki for note
blocks<00:05:54.970> which<00:05:55.720> tell

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
blocks which tell

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.920 
blocks which tell
you<00:05:56.650> how<00:05:57.310> many<00:05:57.370> click<00:05:57.760> click<00:05:58.330> see<00:05:58.540> these<00:05:58.690> reach

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
you how many click click see these reach

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:10.710 
you how many click click see these reach
now<00:06:05.160> so<00:06:06.270> that<00:06:07.270> those<00:06:07.840> two<00:06:08.310> has<00:06:09.310> been<00:06:09.360> tuned<00:06:10.360> to

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
now so that those two has been tuned to

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.310 
now so that those two has been tuned to
see<00:06:12.390> which<00:06:13.390> is<00:06:13.570> 18<00:06:14.080> clicks<00:06:14.380> and<00:06:14.920> those<00:06:15.160> two<00:06:16.320> to

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
see which is 18 clicks and those two to

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.790 
see which is 18 clicks and those two to
e<00:06:17.560> which<00:06:17.920> is<00:06:18.100> 22<00:06:18.670> clicks<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.390> now<00:06:19.870> when<00:06:20.770> we

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
e which is 22 clicks and now when we

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:28.980 
e which is 22 clicks and now when we
press<00:06:21.130> the<00:06:21.280> button<00:06:23.550> it's<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.820> doorbell<00:06:27.600> and<00:06:28.600> now

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
press the button it's a doorbell and now

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.080 
press the button it's a doorbell and now
you<00:06:29.050> can<00:06:29.650> just<00:06:30.130> basically<00:06:30.640> cover<00:06:31.540> this<00:06:31.720> up<00:06:31.990> and

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:43.050 

put<00:06:37.090> a<00:06:37.120> sign<00:06:38.730> ring<00:06:39.730> this<00:06:39.850> although<00:06:41.760> it's<00:06:42.760> quite

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.060 
put a sign ring this although it's quite

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.240 
put a sign ring this although it's quite
loud
