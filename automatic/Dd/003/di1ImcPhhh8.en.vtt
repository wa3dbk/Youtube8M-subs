enough<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.390> guess<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.989> way<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
enough I guess it's way more of a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.080 
enough I guess it's way more of a
platformer<00:02:11.280> than<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> beat<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:11.910> like

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
platformer than to beat them up like

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.809 
platformer than to beat them up like

lips jumping can be a bit iffy at times
and<00:02:15.340> that's<00:02:15.459> being<00:02:15.730> kind<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.599> that's<00:02:16.749> when

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and that's being kind but that's when

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.449

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
at a certain point that's completely

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.449 
at a certain point that's completely
stupid

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
stupid

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.159 
stupid
I<00:03:09.489> admire<00:03:09.939> the<00:03:10.120> developers<00:03:10.659> for<00:03:10.900> trying

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
I admire the developers for trying

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.289 
I admire the developers for trying
something<00:03:11.469> different<00:03:12.219> but<00:03:12.519> sacrificing<00:03:13.180> your

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
something different but sacrificing your

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.330 
something different but sacrificing your
progress<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.109> really<00:03:14.439> difficult<00:03:14.889> game<00:03:14.919> is

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
progress in a really difficult game is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.500 
progress in a really difficult game is
not<00:03:15.669> a<00:03:15.730> good<00:03:16.090> idea

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
not a good idea

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.059 
not a good idea
have<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.019> mentioned<00:03:17.169> this<00:03:17.379> game<00:03:17.590> as<00:03:17.739> hard<00:03:17.919> as

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
have I mentioned this game as hard as

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.580 
have I mentioned this game as hard as
hell<00:03:18.280> anyway<00:03:19.180> it's<00:03:19.449> tricky<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.930> review<00:03:20.349> a<00:03:20.379> game

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
hell anyway it's tricky to review a game

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.349 
hell anyway it's tricky to review a game
like<00:03:20.769> x-men<00:03:21.129> but<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.609> got<00:03:21.759> to<00:03:21.879> keep<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.150> mind

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
like x-men but you got to keep in mind

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.089 
like x-men but you got to keep in mind
its<00:03:22.569> target<00:03:22.930> audience<00:03:23.349> the<00:03:23.590> gameplay<00:03:23.979> is

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
its target audience the gameplay is

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.920 
its target audience the gameplay is
mediocre<00:03:24.759> nothing<00:03:25.299> going<00:03:25.540> out<00:03:25.659> of<00:03:25.780> your<00:03:25.810> way

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
mediocre nothing going out of your way

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.140 
mediocre nothing going out of your way
to<00:03:26.079> play<00:03:26.379> but<00:03:26.769> if<00:03:26.889> you<00:03:27.009> like<00:03:27.250> x-men<00:03:27.669> you're

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
to play but if you like x-men you're

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.179 
to play but if you like x-men you're
much<00:03:28.359> more<00:03:28.540> likely<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:28.989> forgive<00:03:29.409> that<00:03:29.709> aspect

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
much more likely to forgive that aspect

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.129 
much more likely to forgive that aspect
because<00:03:30.699> the<00:03:30.849> game<00:03:31.000> gets<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.299> presentation

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
because the game gets the presentation

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.499 
because the game gets the presentation
down<00:03:32.319> so<00:03:32.680> well<00:03:32.979> and<00:03:33.310> for<00:03:33.699> that<00:03:33.819> reason<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.299> like

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:34.509 
down so well and for that reason I like

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.210 
down so well and for that reason I like
it<00:03:34.540> slightly<00:03:35.109> better<00:03:35.259> than<00:03:35.409> x-men<00:03:35.949> mutant

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
it slightly better than x-men mutant

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.920 
it slightly better than x-men mutant
apocalypse<00:03:36.310> even<00:03:37.209> if<00:03:37.299> that<00:03:37.509> game<00:03:37.780> is

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
apocalypse even if that game is

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.509 
apocalypse even if that game is
objectively<00:03:38.470> better<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:38.949> terms<00:03:39.129> of<00:03:39.310> gameplay

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
objectively better in terms of gameplay

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.999 
objectively better in terms of gameplay
if<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.180> makes<00:03:40.389> any<00:03:40.569> sense<00:03:40.659> so<00:03:41.169> yeah<00:03:41.620> it's

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:42.009 
if that makes any sense so yeah it's

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.009 
if that makes any sense so yeah it's
pretty<00:03:42.129> simple<00:03:42.669> if<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.180> like<00:03:43.329> x-men<00:03:43.659> check

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
pretty simple if you like x-men check

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.929 
pretty simple if you like x-men check
out<00:03:44.169> x-men<00:03:44.500> for<00:03:44.680> Genesis<00:03:45.099> don't<00:03:45.549> expect<00:03:45.849> to

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
out x-men for Genesis don't expect to

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.520 
out x-men for Genesis don't expect to
get<00:03:46.030> wowed<00:03:46.299> but<00:03:46.689> it's<00:03:46.780> still<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.989> fun<00:03:47.229> time

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
get wowed but it's still a fun time

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.000 
get wowed but it's still a fun time
hanging<00:03:47.949> out<00:03:48.009> with<00:03:48.069> your<00:03:48.310> favorite<00:03:48.609> mutants
