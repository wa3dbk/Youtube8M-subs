00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
done this quest once before so I thought

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.760 
done this quest once before so I thought
I<00:00:32.610> had<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> good<00:00:33.210> idea<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.750> where<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.410> going

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I had a good idea of where I was going

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.049 
I had a good idea of where I was going
and<00:00:34.890> where<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> switches<00:00:35.610> were<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.969> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
and where the switches were that you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
and where the switches were that you
need<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> flip<00:00:36.570> however<00:00:37.469> once<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.860> found<00:00:38.010> myself

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
need to flip however once I found myself

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.229 
need to flip however once I found myself
here<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.730> realized<00:00:39.680> that<00:00:40.680> wasn't<00:00:41.250> exactly<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
here I realized that wasn't exactly the

here I realized that wasn't exactly the

and<00:01:55.520> run<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.810> switch<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.320> flip<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.770> just

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
and run to the switch to flip it just

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:24.040 
and run to the switch to flip it just
take<00:01:58.550> them<00:01:58.760> all<00:01:58.940> out

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.520 

it's<00:02:25.050> good<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.470> note<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.960> go<00:02:28.140> through

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
it's good to note that is to go through

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.040 
it's good to note that is to go through
the<00:02:28.740> caustic<00:02:29.190> caverns<00:02:29.580> all<00:02:30.210> these<00:02:30.600> switches

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the caustic caverns all these switches

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.020 
the caustic caverns all these switches
are<00:02:31.200> pretty<00:02:31.500> much<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.860> order<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.640> explore

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
are pretty much in order as you explore

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.990 
are pretty much in order as you explore
the<00:02:33.270> zone<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:34.710> entire<00:02:34.950> zone<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.490> built<00:02:35.760> pretty

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the zone the entire zone is built pretty

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
the zone the entire zone is built pretty
much<00:02:36.210> like<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> circuit<00:02:37.020> where<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.530> start<00:02:38.070> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
much like a circuit where you start that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.710 
much like a circuit where you start that
each<00:02:38.790> point<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.450> these<00:02:40.370> quests<00:02:41.720> checkmarks

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
each point of these quests checkmarks

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.890 
each point of these quests checkmarks
and<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.310> last<00:02:44.640> one<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.270> at<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.480> very

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
and the so the last one is at the very

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.990 
and the so the last one is at the very
end<00:02:46.200> where<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> ladder<00:02:46.920> will<00:02:47.220> go<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.880> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
end where the ladder will go up to the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.690 
end where the ladder will go up to the
start<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:51.950> got<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:52.980> little<00:02:53.190> bit<00:02:53.400> sidetracked

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
start I got a little bit sidetracked

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.970 
start I got a little bit sidetracked
after<00:02:54.540> finding<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.020> last<00:02:55.200> one<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> couldn't

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
after finding the last one I couldn't

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.150 
after finding the last one I couldn't
quite<00:02:56.160> remember<00:02:56.370> where<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.000> elevator<00:02:57.570> is

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
quite remember where this elevator is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.770 
quite remember where this elevator is
but<00:02:59.160> if<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.370> just<00:02:59.580> exit<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.210> room<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
but if you just exit the room that you

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.100 
but if you just exit the room that you
find<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.170> last<00:03:01.410> part<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.540> go<00:03:03.540> back<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.960> where

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
find the last part and go back to where

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.260 
find the last part and go back to where
I<00:03:04.140> was<00:03:04.260> fighting<00:03:04.770> with<00:03:04.860> those<00:03:04.950> threshers<00:03:05.550> it's

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
I was fighting with those threshers it's

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.030 
I was fighting with those threshers it's
going<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.660> be<00:03:06.810> off<00:03:07.050> towards<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> middle<00:03:07.950> of

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
going to be off towards the middle of
