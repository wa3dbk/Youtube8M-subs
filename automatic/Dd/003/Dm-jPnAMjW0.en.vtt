00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
better and we can do better but at this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.279 
better and we can do better but at this
point<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.879> keep<00:00:57.090> making<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.629> same<00:00:57.870> mistakes

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
point we keep making the same mistakes

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.740 
point we keep making the same mistakes
over<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.949> over<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.309> over<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> something<00:01:00.239> has

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
over and over and over and something has

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.430 
over and over and over and something has
to<00:01:00.780> change

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
to change

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110 
to change
it's<00:01:01.710> probably<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> worst<00:01:02.640> feeling<00:01:03.000> I've<00:01:03.090> had

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it's probably the worst feeling I've had

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.750 
it's probably the worst feeling I've had
all<00:01:03.420> year<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.140> guys<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.549> bad

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
all year the guys are like like so bad

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
all year the guys are like like so bad
maybe<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.720> even<00:01:06.780> matched<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.409> very<00:01:07.619> really

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
maybe I even matched like very really

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.210 
maybe I even matched like very really
like<00:01:08.270> sad<00:01:09.320> we're<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.650> super<00:01:10.950> disciplined

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
like sad we're just a super disciplined

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.190 
like sad we're just a super disciplined
in<00:01:11.430> our<00:01:11.520> performance<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.090> LCS<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.990> like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
in our performance at LCS and so we like

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.679 
in our performance at LCS and so we like
we<00:01:14.100> took<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.400> these<00:01:14.520> extreme<00:01:14.970> measures<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
we took all these extreme measures the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.390 
we took all these extreme measures the
day<00:01:15.869> before<00:01:16.290> our<00:01:16.320> match<00:01:16.680> means<00:01:16.950> Wilkin<00:01:17.280> we

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
day before our match means Wilkin we

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.679 
day before our match means Wilkin we
just<00:01:17.640> snapped<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> us<00:01:18.509> were<00:01:18.630> just

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
just snapped like all of us were just

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
just snapped like all of us were just
like<00:01:18.869> no<00:01:18.990> our<00:01:19.740> strategy<00:01:20.159> sucks<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
like no our strategy sucks we have to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.310 
like no our strategy sucks we have to
rewrite<00:01:21.030> everything<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.259> was

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
rewrite everything but I think it was

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.960 
rewrite everything but I think it was
really<00:01:22.470> dumb<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.100> switch<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> very

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
really dumb to just switch at the very

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
really dumb to just switch at the very
like<00:01:24.240> literally<00:01:24.540> last<00:01:24.840> night<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.229> changed

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like literally last night we changed

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.560 
like literally last night we changed
everything

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
everything

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
everything
we<00:01:27.570> beat<00:01:27.810> everyone<00:01:28.049> standard<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.640> play

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
we beat everyone standard we play

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
we beat everyone standard we play
standard<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.049> scrims<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.799> we're<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.070> used<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
standard in scrims and we're not used to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.969 
standard in scrims and we're not used to
playing<00:01:32.700> special<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.570> LCS<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.259> every<00:01:34.710> time<00:01:34.890> we

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
playing special in LCS and every time we

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.859 
playing special in LCS and every time we
play<00:01:35.100> special<00:01:35.340> LCS<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.240> leads<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> loss

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
play special LCS it just leads to a loss

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.260 
play special LCS it just leads to a loss
I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> better<00:01:38.759> team<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.090> we

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
I think we're a better team than we

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
I think we're a better team than we
showed<00:01:39.450> today<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.079> obviously<00:01:40.560> results

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
showed today but obviously results

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.249 
showed today but obviously results
matter<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.030> today<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.930> didn't<00:01:43.079> come<00:01:43.200> out

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
matter and so today we didn't come out

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.560 
matter and so today we didn't come out
on<00:01:43.409> top<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> sucks<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.119> play<00:01:45.360> against

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
on top and it sucks now we play against

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
on top and it sucks now we play against
an<00:01:45.689> amateur<00:01:46.110> team<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.549> we<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.700> a
