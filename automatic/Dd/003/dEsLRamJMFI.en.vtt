00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.820
 Hello the previous days if you wanted 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.400
 dessert or some wind which you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.380
 they answered that some beauty and it's 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.570
 strange because only 10 people 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.040
 they responded and if you want that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.100
 my notifications arrive in the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.160
 part that I like on facebook have 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.600
 to be able to receive notifications or 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.189
 frame preferences publicist something 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.960
 so that if you want to receive the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.180
 notifications I will understand when 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.100
 upload a video then on facebook before 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.899
 that around here for 3 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.180
 let's do a treatment is called 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.670
 deep conditioner and sorry my 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.829
 sudden new changes because I'm 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.109
 excited explains 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:56.210
 and it's good time to start we need 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:59.120
 mayonnaise honey olive oil cream or 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.309
 almond oil a spoon and a 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.440
 place of glass where we are going to 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.780
 place our final mix 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.790
 let's put a quarter in the blender 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.230
 cup of honey and I really put all 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.230
 because then mine was little 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.970
 a spoonful of olive oil 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.390
 and we'll beat it for 5 minutes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.120
 then we add a quarter cup of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120
 Mayonnaise 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.470
 efe 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.860
 and a spoonful of cream or oil 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.860
 almond 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.190
 and we beat again for 5 minutes after 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.740
 that is fighting to put it like this 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.850
 super thick when super thick but 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.850
 thicker than normal 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.270
 and then we put it into our jar well 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.399
 handsome and the truth is that here we do 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.590
 the super fast and super easy things 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.960
 like many many other tutorials 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.750
 I invite you to see them, if this is the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.750
 first time you see any of my videos 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.750
 Thank you 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.829
 and now if we are not going to occupy it, we are going 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.290
 to put the refrito and when we go 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.760
 we'll take a bath by putting 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.879
 it is important that the bottle is 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.099
 because this is going to help if you already 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.510
 sample is lukewarm going to get better in 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.750
 all our scales of our 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.750
 hair 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.349
 once we have untangled 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.569
 our hair we are going to divide it into 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.060
 three parts can help you league on 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.030
 you paint anything that works for you 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.980
 grab your hair we will root 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.250
 tips the conditioner in our 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.250
 hair 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.030
 It is important that you make sure that everything 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.519
 get wet so be very careful and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.120
 If you need help, ask for the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.120
 all confidence 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.090
 since we have the first part we are going to 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.060
 drop the second one and do the same thing 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.500
 root to inks making sure that everything 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.500
 it is perfectly humid 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.329
 that's the super network and weather part but 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.269
 cream that is worth going to use 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.650
 of that plastic that we use today to 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.090
 wrap the food and we 're not going to 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.099
 put on the head and this is so that 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.799
 between the heat just as I was telling you 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.959
 while of all this mixture in what 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.239
 are the scales of our hair and if 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.790
 is ridiculous enough is that 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.590
 it's fine we 're going to put the dryer in 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.900
 hot air and go through it all 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.189
 our hair can last this with 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.579
 one hour with two hours like all and then 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:57.510
 the truth is that you can but if 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.510
 how they feel others feel 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.500
 I was really 45 minutes because I had to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.500
 go out 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.879
 and that's the whole video I hope you 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.790
 you liked it remember you can 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.980
 write down here 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.390
 I leave you a kiss a hug and see you the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.390
 next video arias 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.490
 I did not get excited it's one when 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.090
 and condemned to give a conditioner 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.090
 young 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.980
 put it
