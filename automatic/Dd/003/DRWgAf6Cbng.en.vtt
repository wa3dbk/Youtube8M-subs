00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 Kim Sang-Hwa took advantage of the goldsmith who replaced the world record. 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.429
 I just did what I always did, 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.429
 It is Jang Ah-young. 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.490
 The idealization of the world record two times in two days is as bright as ever 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.150
 I enter the entrance hall with expressions 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.180
 36 Total 5 7 to 36 seconds 36 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.250
 I was surprised to learn about sweet foods every time I went out. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:38.780
 In coming to think I was standing not so newly'd hasyeoseo 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:46.010
 Uh last word back to the shop 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:50.960
 I was very surprised because it seemed like 35 36 dwellings would be close enough . 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.880
 After an unprecedented renewal of the above, weight loss and improvement of the grou 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.860
 There was a promotion name. 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.860
 I am confident that I have finished my last season successfully , 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.600
 That's why I was able to spread it. 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:09.590
 There is not much change in training compared to last year . 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.299
 Uh , the fact is we lose weight . 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.510
 Weight is lighter As for removal, which can hold up to the last ditch through sport 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.260
 I think it's getting stronger. 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.320
 Short-track's Kim Hak-in Shim Suk-hee also won 10 contests 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:30.370
 I went back home with a gold medal. 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.370
 Despite good grades, he still says he's always left behind. 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 Even if the grades come out, 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.369
 I think it's because I think about something else 10, 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 But the self 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.570
 I think that it will be a little more helpful in preparing the Olympics. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 Done 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.159
 Both players are at the top, but the Sochi Olympic results are not known , 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.050
 I did not slow you down. 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:08.640
 The speed skating team will be hosting the World Cup in Kazakhstan and Germany from next week 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.200
 3 Prepare an art competition and train the short track team again in the army 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.250
