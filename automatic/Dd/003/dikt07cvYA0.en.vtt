00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:10.750
 good afternoon, let's see a review 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.540
 of what corresponds to create catalogs 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.470
 within lightroom especially in the 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.029
 version 5.0 and in this creation of 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.980
 catalog let's also see the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.289
 importing the files in such a way 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.509
 what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.419
 in the same folder where the 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.060
 catalog that I have also saved the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.279
 imported assets to this that allows 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.880
 that when I go back to work in the future 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.040
 with the catalog 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.780
 You can easily find the photos already 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.420
 that are in the same location 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.579
 the first thing then is light room how 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.530
 let's create a catalog as if it were 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.140
 a new project let's go to the menu 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.300
 file and in this file menu we're going to 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.570
 create a new catalog in this new 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.190
 catalog and asked me to save it in this 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.300
 case to make it much clearer and 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.130
 I'm going to save it in the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.350
 desk 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.760
 and I'm going to name the catalog 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.710
 it will automatically create a 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.720
 folder with the same name as the catalog 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.460
 I know that if you want to create a folder 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.140
 additional they can do it but you have to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 remember that when you place the name 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.250
 catalog is also going to be the name the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.010
 folder then I will place for example my 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.760
 name john 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.760
 Charles 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.780
 on the desk I say save 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.150
 and if you look at the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.799
 desk I created that folder and inside 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.439
 from that folder in a certain is going to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.439
 appear the catalog and how is it 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.720
 new catalog in this folder is not going to 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.729
 appear absolutely no image 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.880
 because of course I have zero pictures 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.399
 I'm in the library I have no 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.080
 imported photography but if I have the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.570
 catalog and how do I know because up here 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.090
 where is the name of the document that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.970
 corresponds to the catalog says the name 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.920
 Juan Carlos then the next step 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.659
 to bring images is through 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.310
 import this import we can 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.350
 find from the button that is here 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.810
 down in library to the left or in 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.659
 the file menu import photos and 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.659
 videos and when importing 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.280
 the program tells me where 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.110
 I want to take pictures and where 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.330
 I want to send those images and here I have 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.940
 the possibility of the center to select 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.760
 what are the images I want from 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.610
 automatically transfer the program 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.850
 fix an external unit either the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.770
 memory or a pendrive as the unit of 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.750
 where are we going to extract the photos if 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.120
 you notice here I have a 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.540
 pendrive with my photos if I look here 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.969
 I found myself here 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.140
 this pendrive that has a group of 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.719
 photos that are the photos that are 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.670
 appearing here if I wanted to search 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.840
 specifically within a disc or 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.540
 within another unit 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.260
 I go down here to search or from up here 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.689
 I'm going to look for another source that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.959
 allows you to search specifically on the 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.579
 hard drive or in external drives 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.959
 the file then I'm going to select 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.909
 this photo folder that is in my 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.380
 pendrive that in this case could be the 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.960
 memory folder 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.319
 when selecting see shows me all the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.480
 importable images to this document 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.599
 so what we are going to do is bring 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.730
 the photos to the catalog but also in 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.939
 parallel way these pictures are going to 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.819
 transfer to the hard drive through the 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.680
 copy that appears up here or copy 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.840
 as dng in case they were file 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.730
 raw you can use the copy as ong 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.159
 that will convert them to a dng that 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.319
 much lighter and I will save it 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.599
 on the disk I'm going to use the copy 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.810
 because these are unfortunately only 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.639
 jpg on the right side tells me where I 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.480
 I have already created my folder in the 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.790
 desk 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.950
 then I could search here for the item 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.510
 of the users desktop is not true 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.450
 I'm looking for a desk here 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.750
 there it is yes I do not care where it goes 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.120
 to automatically save lightroom what 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.860
 saves mac images in a folder 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.570
 pc 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.790
 because it is the folder that is defined 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.400
 by default, I will define here 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.310
 be at the desk in the Juan folder 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.530
 Carlos Jara and how he appears here at 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.299
 right side is not true what is the 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.560
 order with which they are going to save me 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.440
 establishes that they are going to be saved in 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.870
 folders and subfolders organized by 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.720
 dates and why because up here 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.960
 where I am importing indicates me here 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.880
 I will order the information organize 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.370
 the information by date I'm going to 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.910
 say that I do not respect the name of 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:45.580
 original folders 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:47.320
 that is, inside this juanca folder 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.660
 lojanos will create the same folder 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.250
 photos if they did not have folders and I'm 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.780
 bringing them directly from memory 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.970
 I can indicate that you do or create a 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.630
 sub folder and placed the name that the 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.920
 subfolder good keeping clear this I'm going 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.920
 to import 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.150
 as I had all the photos selected 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.000
 I care about all the selected photos 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.720
 of memory and he's passing it on to me 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.120
 to the disc in parallel when finished 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.490
 do this process already says and task 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.940
 completed I will minimize the program 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.190
 which did not only taking her 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.710
 to the catalog inside my folder 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.860
 catalog created a photo folder and there 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.020
 are all my photos then I have 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.730
 a copy of the photos and every time I 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.680
 want to continue working with this 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.500
 catalog just take me this 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.110
 full folder through a disk 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.510
 hard to another place and I can open the 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.980
 catalog from here to follow 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.630
 working with the project and why 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.760
 because the catalog is associated 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.580
 physically to the photos that are in the 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.319
 same folder of him 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.310
 that's what I'm asking for now 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:03.409
 for the next class to have their 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.539
 imported from folders because 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.909
 this step we will start working on 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:11.330
 the class for example the creation of 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:14.509
 collections or the work of developing 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.520
 photos that will allow us to see 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:19.099
 specifically in the process of 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.539
 revealed the development tools 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.000
 what are these tools that are 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.590
 here on the right side those that we 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.889
 will allow to adjust the 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.270
 images one or more images for later 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.270
 export those is all
