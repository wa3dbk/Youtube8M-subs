00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.483
 We have to play... 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.383
 are you ready 

00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:11.483
 We are going to play the Solaka of the Laminar Sisters Club. 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.417
 What is this about it? Siv 

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:18.250
 Thank you for your question. 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.150
 We ran to the middle 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.283
 Then some stacks 

00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:25.280
 then... 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.817
 Looking at other roads, for example, my teammates on the road want to kill. 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 The layer of the Solakaring light flashes 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.050
 Open a big 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.950
 Take an assist 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.150
 Free one floor 

00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:45.050
 I’m right, I’m lying down, I like it. 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.583
 First out of this book, get out of the stack as soon as possible. 

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.983
 We want to start the stacking trip as soon as possible. 

00:00:51.983 --> 00:00:55.317
 We have some imprints 

00:00:55.317 --> 00:00:57.683
 Of course, it is necessary to choose the object to attack. 

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.950
 Use that long banana to mad the opposite side 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.350
 very good 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.217
 Soraka: Helping 

00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:06.483
 Give a helping hand 

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:09.117
 By the way, stick out the banana 

00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:12.717
 I hope the banana is hitting Brand. 

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:15.117
 If it is a robbery, I don't have to play. 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.750
 Zalam Brand is coming. 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.883
 Feed directly 

00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:25.017
 Then we put a little back to the devil 

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.017
 The purpose of my doing this is... 

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:28.817
 Maybe let it go. 

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:32.950
 I figured it out, I liked to return to the magic of Soraka. 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.117
 Don't run, don't run. 

00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:37.050
 Eat my bananas 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.917
 Um... a bloody 

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:41.350
 Others are enchanting 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.583
 Don't step into the banana area 

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:45.950
 Maybe the banana area will come to you. 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.250
 Now get the rune 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.450
 Uh ... 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.150
 Put a little general 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.617
 This is good, this can also 

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:55.017
 These are all very good 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.283
 Put a silence 

00:02:08.317 --> 00:02:08.983
 Not bad 

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:11.383
 We have a layer 

00:02:11.383 --> 00:02:15.950
 I will name it "a stack of Henry." 

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:20.017
 a stack of Henry 

00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:23.050
 Your brothers and sisters will come soon 

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:26.717
 Negative reputation on the Laupe Brotherhood 

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:30.883
 I am so sorry. 

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:32.583
 My big is not for blood. 

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:33.750
 Is used for stacking 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.283
 I am doing damage to Soraka. 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.583
 Are you going to kill? 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.383
 Looks good 喔

00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:46.983
 It’s a stack 

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:49.717
 Thank you, thank you OMG for two layers. 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.950
 Laminated sister Soraka bless you 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.617
 Let's go to it. 

00:02:58.617 --> 00:02:59.550
 What are you waiting for? 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.050
 What are you waiting for~~~ 

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:04.783
 Silence one 

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:08.150
 Oh, good. 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.950
 Look at the way down. 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.783
 Oh don't don't want to 

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:26.117
 Should I save him with a big loss? 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.750
 Forget it... 

00:03:30.017 --> 00:03:31.017
 Ignite one 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.650
 Then silence the tail knife 

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:38.283
 what is this 

00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:39.850
 Looks good 喔

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.950
 (Subscriber's name: a stack of Henry) An eight stack of seven stacks 

00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:47.183
 Go ahead. 

00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:52.017
 A stack of Henry will bring the rhythm of the stack 

00:03:53.217 --> 00:03:57.117
 You don't know what to buy like when I buy a stack now and don't know what to buy. 

00:03:57.117 --> 00:03:58.450
 If you don't know what to buy 

00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:01.083
 Buy time sticks 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.750
 Make up 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.550
 I want to borrow your head to stack 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.950
 Shoot him 

00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:09.917
 what... 

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.783
 Oh, what a pity. 

00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:14.450
 This looks good 唷

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.283
 Thank you for the stack 

00:04:16.283 --> 00:04:18.883
 Before they grabbed the block, 

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:22.083
 We also have to spend time 

00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:25.850
 I am so big, you guys. 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.750
 Taunt 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.583
 please 

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:36.450
 I have to speed up to make my stacking journey faster. 

00:04:46.983 --> 00:04:48.983
 I don’t want to zoom in 

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:50.283
 Investment is dead. 

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.650
 Let’s make a flash and fool show. 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.417
 I did it but it didn’t return. 

00:05:05.317 --> 00:05:10.483
 Do you know that the real stack sisters will call the enemy "folding"? 

00:05:10.483 --> 00:05:11.817
 Look at the stack of the middle road 

00:05:11.817 --> 00:05:13.817
 After killing those stacks 

00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:16.450
 These stacks will be yours. 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.083
 This is the thinking of the stacked sisters. 

00:05:21.183 --> 00:05:22.150
 Make up 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.250
 Greve Greif Griff 

00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:31.650
 No one is better at playing Greif. 

00:05:32.617 --> 00:05:33.783
 Sell ​​it 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.750
 At least we have Barong. 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.083
 and many more... 

00:05:41.217 --> 00:05:45.650
 Pay tribute to our first defeated sister. 

00:05:47.683 --> 00:05:51.083
 We will stack next time 

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:54.017
