first very late spawning pool which is
going<00:02:44.639> to<00:02:44.700> make<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:45.030> definitely<00:02:45.629> more

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
going to make it definitely more

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.909 
going to make it definitely more
difficult<00:02:45.900> for<00:02:46.169> him<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.439> put<00:02:46.650> up<00:02:46.739> with<00:02:46.829> all

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
difficult for him to put up with all

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.259 
difficult for him to put up with all
these<00:02:47.069> Marines<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.639> really<00:02:47.879> it's<00:02:48.000> gonna<00:02:48.090> be<00:02:48.239> a

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
these Marines and really it's gonna be a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.629 
these Marines and really it's gonna be a
very<00:02:48.629> difficult<00:02:48.959> defense<00:02:49.590> simply<00:02:50.340> because<00:02:50.609> of

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
very difficult defense simply because of

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.550 
very difficult defense simply because of
that<00:02:50.760> fast<00:02:51.090> expand<00:02:51.480> not<00:02:51.689> scouting<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.230> at

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
that fast expand not scouting that at

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.440 
that fast expand not scouting that at
all<00:02:52.799> he's<00:02:53.370> gonna<00:02:53.489> be<00:02:53.639> using<00:02:53.909> probably<00:02:54.209> almost

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
all he's gonna be using probably almost

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.360 
all he's gonna be using probably almost
all<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.900> his<00:02:55.200> resources<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.919> building<00:02:56.310> up

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
all of his resources on building up

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.190
