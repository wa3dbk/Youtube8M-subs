through<00:00:05.879> my<00:00:06.210> drum<00:00:06.480> kit<00:00:06.509> my<00:00:07.379> drum<00:00:07.589> kit<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.859> is

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
through my drum kit my drum kit is is

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.830 
through my drum kit my drum kit is is
basically<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.490> giant<00:00:08.639> pearl<00:00:08.970> export<00:00:09.450> kit<00:00:09.690> I

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
basically a giant pearl export kit I

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.020 
basically a giant pearl export kit I
think<00:00:10.230> pearls<00:00:10.440> are<00:00:10.590> great<00:00:10.800> they're<00:00:11.730> good<00:00:11.880> for

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
think pearls are great they're good for

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.890 
think pearls are great they're good for
live<00:00:12.240> scenarios<00:00:12.780> like<00:00:13.349> performances<00:00:14.099> gigs

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
live scenarios like performances gigs

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.900 
live scenarios like performances gigs
but<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.139> think<00:00:16.590> they're<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.490> good<00:00:17.699> for

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
but I think they're not that good for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.380 
but I think they're not that good for
recording<00:00:18.330> because<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:20.580> exports<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.240> made

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
recording because the exports are made

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.939 
recording because the exports are made
out<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.539> popular<00:00:21.960> wood<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.590> don't<00:00:22.769> think

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
out of popular wood and I don't think

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.519 
out of popular wood and I don't think
that<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.430> particular<00:00:24.090> type<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> wood<00:00:24.900> can

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that that particular type of wood can

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.490 
that that particular type of wood can
actually<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> desired<00:00:26.820> sound<00:00:27.500> for

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
actually get you the desired sound for

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.120 
actually get you the desired sound for
studio<00:00:29.279> work<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> despite<00:00:31.529> all<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.830> let's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
module right there as you probably

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.100 
module right there as you probably
already<00:01:19.799> saw<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.970> zildjian<00:01:21.750> cymbals

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
already saw I use zildjian cymbals

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.370 
already saw I use zildjian cymbals
mainly<00:01:22.530> zildjian<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> custom<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:24.380> I'm

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
mainly zildjian a custom because I'm

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
mainly zildjian a custom because I'm
into<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> power<00:01:26.189> metal<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> extreme

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
into a lot of power metal and extreme

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
into a lot of power metal and extreme
metal<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.909> offers<00:01:30.439> great<00:01:31.549> like

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
metal so that this offers great like

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.090 
metal so that this offers great like
bright<00:01:32.850> sounds<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.470> perfect

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
bright sounds which is I think perfect

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.230 
bright sounds which is I think perfect
for<00:01:35.820> metal<00:01:36.090> since<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.479> nice<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> piercing

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
for metal since it's nice and piercing

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
it but I do look forward to changing my

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.380 
it but I do look forward to changing my
resonant<00:03:19.340> heads<00:03:19.930> um<00:03:21.489> yeah<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.519> have<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.820> think<00:03:23.330> I

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
resonant heads um yeah I have I think I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.020 
resonant heads um yeah I have I think I
use<00:03:23.540> ambassadors<00:03:24.350> for<00:03:24.920> all<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.160> them<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.519> use

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
use ambassadors for all of them I use

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.170 
use ambassadors for all of them I use

actually<00:03:36.709> have<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> Kevlar<00:03:37.970> pad<00:03:38.720> right<00:03:38.900> here<00:03:38.930> I

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
actually have a Kevlar pad right here I

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.600 
actually have a Kevlar pad right here I
plan<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.420> change<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:42.200> plan<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.010> actually<00:03:43.160> put

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
plan to change a plan to actually put

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.630 
plan to change a plan to actually put
these<00:03:43.959> as<00:03:44.959> my<00:03:45.200> resonant<00:03:45.620> heads<00:03:45.769> and<00:03:46.070> actually

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
these as my resonant heads and actually

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.289 
these as my resonant heads and actually
use<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.299> switch<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.049> maybe<00:03:48.320> Emperor's<00:03:49.299> because

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
use a switch to maybe Emperor's because

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.300 
use a switch to maybe Emperor's because
I<00:03:50.360> think<00:03:50.420> those<00:03:50.720> will<00:03:50.930> give<00:03:51.110> me<00:03:51.260> like<00:03:52.100> probably

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
I think those will give me like probably

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.350 
I think those will give me like probably
a<00:03:52.580> bit<00:03:52.850> more<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.390> bit<00:03:53.420> more<00:03:54.049> warm<00:03:54.350> or<00:03:54.560> sound<00:03:55.360> well
