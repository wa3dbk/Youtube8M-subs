that<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.800> yeah<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.460> robust

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that you have to do yeah as robust

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
that you have to do yeah as robust
against<00:00:42.059> against<00:00:42.420> suffocation<00:00:43.110> oh<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
