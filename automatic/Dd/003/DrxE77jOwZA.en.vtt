00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 3 Various digital cameras will be released for the past year , though it will be over in 2013 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.960
 There were a lot of interesting things this year too 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.590
 I would like to inform you of the 5 best today I am using the same relationship I used to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.020
 There is that bias I have bias of interest , but also 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.440
 So first, do we come from # 5 Jani 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.660
 Male kiss x 7 small light 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:34.000
 Although the width is slightly more than iphone, but the jacker width is small but of course the cat 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.870
 I think it's Tteyuu Toka small body wear Why or Nagata to this is that it is already no longer violence 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.010
 But 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 If it is used together with such a pancake lens 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.129
 It's better than digital or anything, but it's a big sensor. 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.800
 I liked it 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:55.010
 Followed by 4th Jajan Cannon Youth 70 d Canon Eos 70 d 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.810
 I say I made a new sensor 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:05.390
 What's great is that it's a single-lens reflex camera 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:11.600
 If you write a fast af in live view shooting and what happens to the sunri 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.470
 Come on here it was taken with both 60 d and 70 d on a tripod 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.520
 But 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.800
 Well 70 d af is amazing 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.620
 Properly I think you me chasing Pinto 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:31.640
 After all, if it is not the stm stepping motor and the lens at the same time 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:36.650
 Nde feelings I to say a few feel that should not be in af of that video 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.370
 Well such care and I wish I think we kinda nice if me more and more stm ends in 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.400
 I will 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:49.820
 Yes No. 3 is Sony's Alpha 7 r but it's a full size sensor 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.659
 I Table really evaluation because the first few Toka world's smallest and lightest and the lens in the interchangeable-lens camera 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.430
 To be from next year 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:00.940
 I'm wondering, but for now I'm only doing one 35 mm now 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:07.510
 Because it is Sony, super resolution zoom 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.280
 Well smart zoom Toka of why I'm Then this is it 35 mm use lens Gane 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:15.700
 50 mm 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.450
 It's about 70 mm, so even though you only have this one, it 's all you can play 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.099
 It looks like a digital camera because it is a digital camera 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:27.769
 I really like it because I feel like I 'm doing sonily 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:33.590
 The second pentax k 3 Thats Ja is here 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:37.440
 Bar Caron's 庵 7 d mark ii will be announced soon 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 And conflicting rumors softening Toka or not it does not appear When you are equal to or greater than 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.240
 But as an aps c flagship machine 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.540
 pentax k 3 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.730
 That's why I think this year is good 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.510
 I'm blazing fire Pakapaka Pakapaka is too early feels good I even what to say 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.010
 If the auto firing speed that can be auto bracketed by hand is fast 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.010
 Development 3 frames per second 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:11.000
 I think it's definitely key 3 if I want to take hdr photos 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:16.160
 I Toka cold guarantee of operation until after minus 5 degrees went drip-proof dust-proof and money so 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.400
 After all it is a very good camera to use in tough conditions 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.819
 I felt it was such a great cospa high 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.969
 First place 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:29.840
 Walk Soni 100 mark 2 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:33.110
 I was able to change the lens camera from 5th to 4th 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:38.720
 Suddenly Condé has become the first place 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.950
 I'm going to travel a little bit and I 'm shooting it 's it already, it's only this one cover 2 pot 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.530
 Insertion spring 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:49.830
 I can cope with most things already True After all Sony's amazing is full with auto 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:56.040
 Pictures taken when shooting with Auto Wow I think this is a good place 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:04:03.840
 I'd only 3.6 times gold red and white zoom even when combined with the super-resolution zoom 7.2 times 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:09.850
 I have been to Hiroshima twice this year , but I'm saying Onomichi and Hiroshima Miyajima twice 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:14.770
 The first lens in the list of the most common that alpha 99 has other lenses 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:17.890
 I also took an interchangeable lens and also had a video camera 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.290
 It's a large package It's a great package 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.010
 When I went to the second time I tried to go with this one 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.820
 Panty 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.320
 This it's Tabiron 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:36.870
 Iinda was there at the first place in this'm just have no complaint in this 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.650
 Only I think you'll keep in kept to a reference grade But I is my biased opinion 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.800
 Though 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:46.010
 But in me, the 100 magical caves that walk 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.010
 It was the first place of Mr. Monsen Yes
