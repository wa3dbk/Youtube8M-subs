00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.850
 Hello, welcome to Todd's kitchen. This is just how an information video takes care of 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.749
 Your chopping board. Now I use many different types of chopping boards 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.539
 My daily use every day. I have two wooden ones, here you can see, but I also use plastic 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.429
 as well as 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.730
 But personally when it comes to the chopping board, you just go wrong 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.029
 wooden. However, you must take care of them. So I cleaned for the first time 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.910
 Chopping board. Now, if you are like me, you cut the garlic, you cut the onion 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.489
 Then leave the storyboard and make them smell like what they are doing. 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.780
 Garlic or onion. So the best way to remove the odor chopping board 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.000
 Some salt 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.050
 Just make a small heap 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.410
 We will use half a lemon 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.940
 So itâ€™s going 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.510
 Drop some lemon 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.190
 salt. Now we use salt as an abrasive so that we put the lemon 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.370
 Just rub around 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.660
 In a circular motion board 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.960
 Just like this 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.790
 What will this do? 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.990
 Salt is to help the lemon push to the chopping board 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.820
 This will delete 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.170
 You have used everything, the smell of garlic or onion or fish 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.920
 So they are rubbing 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.370
 Then use some paper towels 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.450
 Just wipe it down 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.970
 Just dry 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.040
 Paper towel like this 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.760
 Simple 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.080
 That is a lovely smell 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.509
 Once again 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.180
 Loading cleaning with lemon and salt 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.630
 Will also remove the bacteria allotment, but you know there is a better way to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.220
 To remove bacteria, we will use daily household items 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.450
 And that's white vinegar. So, simply pour some vinegar 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.650
 On the board 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.750
 Just like this 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.759
 I have seen people on the internet, suggesting that you use bleaching 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.140
 Disinfection board 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.650
 Look at it now, you really want to use a harsh chemical 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.750
 Things, your food contact 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.570
 Bleach is an incredibly harsh chemical, so I don't care much, you dilute 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.740
 Down, no use 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.539
 When you can use something line vinegar, you can come out anyway food 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.400
 Do the same job 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.750
 So please stay away from bleach and use things, she is not exactly the same job 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 But not all the harsh chemicals in it 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.659
 So once done, we will let the air dry and what will happen 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.099
 To prevent 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.159
 Anything that builds on your bacteria forms your chopping board. So you can rest assured that theres won't be any 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.859
 Legacy E.coli 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.749
 Staphylococcus or leave annoying germs on the blackboard that may have been transferred 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.849
 When you cut someone to say red meat. You will want to know how long you should do this 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.309
 They say it once a month, but I am personal, because I use them to distribute 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.559
 I like to do it once a week just to be safe, but remember, you also want to wash 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.649
 They are used every time after each use 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:51.419
 So, I hope these handy tips will help you. Thank you for watching this episode Todd's kitchen.
