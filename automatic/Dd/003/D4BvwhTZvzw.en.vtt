little<00:01:33.240> bit<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.689> some<00:01:34.049> rage<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.909> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
little bit of some rage so I think this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.969 
little bit of some rage so I think this
is<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> turn<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.110> well<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.680> did

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is going to turn out really well I did

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.679 
is going to turn out really well I did
not<00:01:38.130> actually<00:01:38.280> realize<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.060> he<00:01:39.329> has<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> whole

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
not actually realize that he has a whole

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.480 
not actually realize that he has a whole
bunch<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.960> blue<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.350> saw<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> base<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
bunch of blue I just saw the base I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
bunch of blue I just saw the base I
don't<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.750> did<00:01:42.990> mention<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
don't know if I did mention it but I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.730 
don't know if I did mention it but I
don't<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> remember<00:01:44.909> about<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.479> um<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
don't know I remember about it but um I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.280 
don't know I remember about it but um I
think<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.880> raised<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.390> troops<00:01:48.659> again<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
think I raised my troops again in the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
think I raised my troops again in the
center<00:01:49.680> right<00:01:49.799> here<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
center right here because there is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.039 
center right here because there is
nothing<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.590> King<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.220> golem<00:01:54.090> three

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
nothing so the King a golem three

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.410 
nothing so the King a golem three
Wizards<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.189> two<00:01:56.490> wizards<00:01:56.880> okay

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
Wizards is that two wizards okay

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
Wizards is that two wizards okay
and<00:01:57.530> we<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> whole<00:01:58.799> bunch<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.070> wizards

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and we have a whole bunch of wizards

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.679 
and we have a whole bunch of wizards
coming<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> center<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> should<00:02:00.659> be

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
coming to the center so that should be

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.880 
coming to the center so that should be
good<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.079> well<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:03.079> really<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.320> nice<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.289 
good as well and really really nice and
the<00:02:05.159> reason<00:02:05.430> why<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.579> because<00:02:05.670> there's<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> lot

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the reason why is because there's a lot

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.660 
the reason why is because there's a lot
of<00:02:06.420> defenses<00:02:06.869> targeting<00:02:07.409> these<00:02:07.590> uh<00:02:07.619> these<00:02:08.459> um

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
the purple stuff and these combs

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.090 
the purple stuff and these combs
actually<00:03:12.180> look<00:03:12.480> dark<00:03:12.989> which<00:03:13.650> makes<00:03:13.860> them<00:03:13.980> look

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
actually look dark which makes them look

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.949 
actually look dark which makes them look
like<00:03:14.160> level<00:03:14.550> 3<00:03:14.790> or<00:03:14.820> 4<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.180> remember<00:03:15.690> what<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
like level 3 or 4 I remember what the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.199 
like level 3 or 4 I remember what the
what<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.680> golem<00:03:17.130> type<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:17.670> when<00:03:17.970> they<00:03:18.060> get

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
what the golem type it's when they get

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.270 
what the golem type it's when they get
dark<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.750> like<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.080> think<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.920> before

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
dark it's like I think it's one before

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.160 
dark it's like I think it's one before
maximum<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> goldens<00:03:21.299> get<00:03:21.480> like<00:03:21.630> really<00:03:21.989> dark

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
maximum the goldens get like really dark

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.300 
maximum the goldens get like really dark
like<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> tan<00:03:22.799> or<00:03:22.980> something<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:24.180> yeah<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.350> they

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
like a tan or something and yeah so they

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.830 
like a tan or something and yeah so they
they<00:03:26.700> kind<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:26.940> look<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.360> I'm<00:03:27.570> alive

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
they kind of look like that I'm alive

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.350 
they kind of look like that I'm alive
but<00:03:28.110> yeah<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.709> think<00:03:29.519> we're<00:03:29.700> gonna<00:03:29.820> three-star

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
but yeah I think we're gonna three-star

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.930 
but yeah I think we're gonna three-star
knocked<00:03:30.780> out<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.140> doubt<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.790> use

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
knocked out I doubt it but I think I use

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.850 
knocked out I doubt it but I think I use
my<00:03:33.090> lightning<00:03:33.390> spell<00:03:33.540> for<00:03:33.690> no<00:03:33.810> reason<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.320> if

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
my lightning spell for no reason and if

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.580 
my lightning spell for no reason and if
I<00:03:34.950> did<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.790> know<00:03:35.820> oh<00:03:36.090> well<00:03:36.269> but<00:03:36.590> we

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
I did then it you know oh well but we

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.070 
I did then it you know oh well but we
got<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:38.250> lot<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.610> Lutz<00:03:38.910> reason<00:03:39.780> Lou<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> lot

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
got a lot of Lutz reason Lou not a lot

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.240 
got a lot of Lutz reason Lou not a lot
and<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.350> think<00:03:43.410> we're<00:03:43.799> gonna<00:03:43.890> end<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.220> right

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and I think we're gonna end it right

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.280 
and I think we're gonna end it right
here<00:03:44.519> because<00:03:44.850> there's<00:03:45.120> no<00:03:45.390> time<00:03:45.660> left<00:03:46.019> I

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
here because there's no time left I

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.430 
here because there's no time left I
think<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:46.920> King<00:03:47.220> does<00:03:47.519> not<00:03:47.549> okay<00:03:48.299> he<00:03:48.690> gets

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
think that King does not okay he gets

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.680 
think that King does not okay he gets
distracted<00:03:49.590> by<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.160> golem<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.880> think<00:03:51.209> the

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
distracted by that golem so I think the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.630 
distracted by that golem so I think the
widget<00:03:52.080> our<00:03:52.260> not<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.830> wins<00:03:53.010> out<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.280> my<00:03:53.370> wizard

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
widget our not the wins out of my wizard

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.460 
widget our not the wins out of my wizard
is<00:03:53.850> gonna<00:03:54.060> kill<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.360> king<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.260> should

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
is gonna kill that king and that should

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.050 
is gonna kill that king and that should
be<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.010> unfortunately<00:03:56.519> we<00:03:56.670> don't<00:03:56.760> have<00:03:56.910> any

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
be it so unfortunately we don't have any

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.479
