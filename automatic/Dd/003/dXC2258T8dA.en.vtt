in<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.110> video<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.949> look<00:00:02.070> at

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
in this video we're going to look at

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.679 
in this video we're going to look at
some<00:00:02.399> quick<00:00:02.610> worked<00:00:02.850> examples<00:00:03.480> of

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
some quick worked examples of

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.889 
some quick worked examples of
calculating<00:00:04.410> powers<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.100> roots<00:00:05.629> let's<00:00:06.629> start

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
calculating powers and roots let's start

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.150 
calculating powers and roots let's start
off<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.440> 3<00:00:07.890> ^<00:00:08.130> 2<00:00:08.820> or<00:00:09.090> 3<00:00:09.540> squared<00:00:09.860> this<00:00:10.860> tells

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
off with 3 ^ 2 or 3 squared this tells

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.009 
off with 3 ^ 2 or 3 squared this tells
me<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.429> I'm<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.910> be<00:00:12.090> multiplying<00:00:12.750> for

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
me if I'm going to be multiplying for

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.020 
me if I'm going to be multiplying for
number<00:00:13.440> 3<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.980> I'm<00:00:14.130> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.549> two<00:00:15.000> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
number 3 and I'm going to have two of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.950 
number 3 and I'm going to have two of
them<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.690> we<00:00:16.109> end<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.650> with<00:00:16.980> 3<00:00:17.580> times<00:00:18.270> by<00:00:18.510> 3<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
them so we end up with 3 times by 3 a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.859 
them so we end up with 3 times by 3 a
common<00:00:19.949> misconception<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.570> two

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
common misconception is that we do two

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.250 
common misconception is that we do two
times<00:00:22.140> by<00:00:22.410> 3<00:00:22.680> 3<00:00:23.609> squared<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.539> six<00:00:24.869> it's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
times by 3 3 squared is not six it's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
times by 3 3 squared is not six it's
three<00:00:25.439> times<00:00:25.650> by<00:00:25.920> three<00:00:26.189> which<00:00:26.490> gives<00:00:26.519> us<00:00:27.090> nine

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
three times by three which gives us nine

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.470 
three times by three which gives us nine
if<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.590> wanted<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.980> visual<00:00:29.189> representation<00:00:29.699> we

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
if you wanted a visual representation we

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
if you wanted a visual representation we
could<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.380> square<00:00:31.740> now<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.489> side

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
could think of a square now with side

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.780 
could think of a square now with side
lengths<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.480> three<00:00:34.230> centimeters<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.700> we

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
lengths of three centimeters so if we

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.840 
lengths of three centimeters so if we
have<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> square<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:37.020> 3<00:00:37.850> multiplied

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
have this square just here 3 multiplied

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.119 
have this square just here 3 multiplied
by<00:00:38.879> 3<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.840> would<00:00:40.110> give<00:00:40.290> us<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.559> area<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
by 3 this would give us the area and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.940 
by 3 this would give us the area and
this<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:41.879> give<00:00:42.059> us<00:00:42.120> 9<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.110> 3<00:00:43.350> squared<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> 9

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this would give us 9 so 3 squared is 9

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.930 
this would give us 9 so 3 squared is 9
if<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.059> had<00:00:45.510> 3<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> power<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.739> 3<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
if we had 3 to the power of 3 this is

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.639 
if we had 3 to the power of 3 this is
telling<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:48.360> now<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.629> need<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> take<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.320> number

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
telling me now I need to take the number

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700 
telling me now I need to take the number
3<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.190> need<00:00:50.370> three<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:51.149> 3<00:00:51.899> times<00:00:52.140> by<00:00:52.379> 3

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
3 and I need three of them 3 times by 3

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.029 
3 and I need three of them 3 times by 3
times<00:00:53.160> by<00:00:53.370> 3<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:54.629> already<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.500> 3

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
times by 3 we already know that 3

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.580 
times by 3 we already know that 3
squared<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.670> 9<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:57.300> simply<00:00:57.719> multiply<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.199> by<00:00:58.350> 3

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
squared is 9 we simply multiply it by 3

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.060 
squared is 9 we simply multiply it by 3
again<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.460> gives<00:00:59.699> me<00:00:59.870> 27<00:01:00.870> again<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
again and that gives me 27 again if you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.219 
again and that gives me 27 again if you
wanted<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> visual<00:01:02.670> representation<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.989> could

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
wanted a visual representation you could

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.649 
wanted a visual representation you could
turn<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.650> into<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.100> cube<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
turn this into a cube and you can have a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.620 
turn this into a cube and you can have a
three-dimensional<00:01:07.140> shape<00:01:08.030> 3<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> power

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
three-dimensional shape 3 to the power

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.429 
three-dimensional shape 3 to the power
of<00:01:09.810> 4<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.740> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.369> 3<00:01:12.200> multiplied<00:01:13.200> by<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
of 4 is going to be 3 multiplied by the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.130 
of 4 is going to be 3 multiplied by the
3<00:01:13.770> multiplied<00:01:14.580> by<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> 3<00:01:15.180> multiplied<00:01:16.110> by

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
3 multiplied by the 3 multiplied by

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.910 
3 multiplied by the 3 multiplied by
another<00:01:16.590> 3<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> base<00:01:18.630> number<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> free<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
another 3 so a base number is free the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
another 3 so a base number is free the
number<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> them<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:20.909> require<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.479> 4<00:01:21.869> all

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
number of them that we require is 4 all

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.289 
number of them that we require is 4 all
we<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> multiply<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.670> answer<00:01:24.180> by

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
we need to do is multiply this answer by

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.920 
we need to do is multiply this answer by
3<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> give<00:01:25.830> us<00:01:25.979> 81<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> if

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
3 and that's going to give us 81 so if

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.100 
3 and that's going to give us 81 so if
we<00:01:28.080> took<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.560> 5<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> power<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.329> 2<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.869> 5

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
we took now 5 to the power of 2 or 5

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.819 
we took now 5 to the power of 2 or 5
squared<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.220> 5<00:01:32.700> times<00:01:33.030> by<00:01:33.509> 5<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.470> gives

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
squared this is 5 times by 5 which gives

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.390 
squared this is 5 times by 5 which gives
us<00:01:35.630> 25<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.619> 10<00:01:38.100> 5<00:01:38.880> squared<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:40.020> equal

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
us 25 it's not 10 5 squared is not equal

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.490 
us 25 it's not 10 5 squared is not equal
to<00:01:41.400> 10<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.180> again<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> common

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
to 10 this again is a common

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.730 
to 10 this again is a common
misconception<00:01:44.329> so<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.570> wanted<00:01:45.930> 5<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
misconception so if I wanted 5 to the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.910 
misconception so if I wanted 5 to the
power<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.100> 3<00:01:47.430> I'd<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:48.180> five<00:01:48.659> times<00:01:49.320> by<00:01:49.560> 5

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
power of 3 I'd have five times by 5

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.999 
power of 3 I'd have five times by 5
times<00:01:50.670> by<00:01:50.939> 5<00:01:51.329> which<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.409> give<00:01:52.680> us<00:01:52.710> now

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
times by 5 which is going to give us now

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.289 
times by 5 which is going to give us now
5<00:01:53.430> lots<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.820> 25<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.340> 125<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.090> could

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
5 lots of 25 which is 125 and I could

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.260 
5 lots of 25 which is 125 and I could
keep<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.540> 5<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> power<00:01:58.770> 4<00:01:59.369> you're<00:02:00.060> not

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
keep going 5 to the power 4 you're not

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.600 
keep going 5 to the power 4 you're not
likely<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.930> asked<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.290> do<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.280> again

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
likely to be asked to do this but again

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
likely to be asked to do this but again
we<00:02:03.000> would<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> 5<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.560> would

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
we would just have the 5 and we would

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.370 
we would just have the 5 and we would
have<00:02:04.920> 4<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.820> them<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.840> would<00:02:07.020> give<00:02:07.259> us

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
have 4 of them and that would give us

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.339 
have 4 of them and that would give us
now<00:02:08.629> 625<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.340> 5<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.819> power<00:02:11.910> 4<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.660> 6

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
now 625 so 5 to the power 4 is 6

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.429 
now 625 so 5 to the power 4 is 6
and<00:02:13.769> 25<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.209> that's<00:02:15.390> calculating<00:02:16.200> powers

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
and 25 so that's calculating powers

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.970 
and 25 so that's calculating powers
let's<00:02:17.370> look<00:02:17.549> at<00:02:17.640> 2<00:02:17.879> 2<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.079> power<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.319> 1<00:02:19.709> it's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
let's look at 2 2 to the power of 1 it's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.819 
let's look at 2 2 to the power of 1 it's
going<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.310> give<00:02:20.430> us<00:02:20.579> 2<00:02:20.879> 2<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.200> power<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.439> 2

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
going to give us 2 2 to the power of 2

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.069 
going to give us 2 2 to the power of 2
is<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> give<00:02:23.640> us<00:02:23.670> now<00:02:23.969> 2<00:02:24.359> times<00:02:24.719> by<00:02:25.019> 2

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
is going to give us now 2 times by 2

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.630 
is going to give us now 2 times by 2
which<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.219> 4<00:02:26.959> 2<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> power<00:02:28.530> 3<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.430> is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
which is 4 2 to the power 3 this is

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.789 
which is 4 2 to the power 3 this is
another<00:02:30.090> one<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.450> seems<00:02:30.689> to<00:02:30.780> cause<00:02:31.079> problems

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
another one that seems to cause problems

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.000 
another one that seems to cause problems
2<00:02:32.189> times<00:02:32.489> by<00:02:32.670> 2<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.359> give<00:02:33.480> me<00:02:33.569> 4

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
2 times by 2 is going to give me 4

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.099 
2 times by 2 is going to give me 4
multiplying<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.159> by<00:02:35.189> 2<00:02:35.370> again<00:02:36.030> will<00:02:36.510> give<00:02:36.689> me<00:02:36.870> 8

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
multiplying it by 2 again will give me 8

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.869 
multiplying it by 2 again will give me 8
not<00:02:37.980> 6<00:02:38.609> it's<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.480> three<00:02:39.989> times<00:02:40.290> by<00:02:40.530> 2<00:02:40.639> 2<00:02:41.639> to<00:02:41.849> a

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
not 6 it's not three times by 2 2 to a

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.940 
not 6 it's not three times by 2 2 to a
power<00:02:42.090> 4<00:02:42.569> we're<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.200> multiply<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:43.769> by

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
power 4 we're going to multiply this by

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.580 
power 4 we're going to multiply this by
2<00:02:44.159> again<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:45.030> we're<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.659> end<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:46.200> now

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
2 again and we're going to end up now

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.210 
2 again and we're going to end up now
with<00:02:47.069> 16<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:48.510> gives<00:02:48.840> us<00:02:49.019> 4<00:02:49.170> powers<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.709> 2<00:02:49.920> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
with 16 this gives us 4 powers of 2 and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.240 
with 16 this gives us 4 powers of 2 and
if<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.430> kept<00:02:50.639> going<00:02:50.879> we<00:02:51.239> would<00:02:51.359> have<00:02:51.540> 32<00:02:52.349> 64<00:02:53.629> 128

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
if we kept going we would have 32 64 128

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.330 
if we kept going we would have 32 64 128
256<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.909> it's<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.269> on<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.689> so<00:02:57.870> forth<00:02:58.139> so<00:02:58.340> this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
256 and it's so on and so forth so this

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.720 
256 and it's so on and so forth so this
mat<00:02:59.579> is<00:02:59.609> calculating<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.720> power<00:03:01.129> sometimes<00:03:02.129> we

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
mat is calculating a power sometimes we

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.470 
mat is calculating a power sometimes we
will<00:03:02.879> be<00:03:03.000> asked<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.750> find<00:03:04.169> a<00:03:04.439> root<00:03:05.239> often<00:03:06.239> it's

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
will be asked to find a root often it's

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.960 
will be asked to find a root often it's
the<00:03:06.659> square<00:03:07.139> root<00:03:07.200> now<00:03:08.129> if<00:03:08.370> we<00:03:08.519> were<00:03:08.609> asked<00:03:08.819> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the square root now if we were asked to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.679 
the square root now if we were asked to
find<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.540> square<00:03:10.230> root<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.769> 9<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.669> we<00:03:12.209> consider

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
find the square root of 9 if we consider

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.920 
find the square root of 9 if we consider
what<00:03:13.019> we've<00:03:13.200> done<00:03:13.409> here<00:03:13.650> 3<00:03:14.609> times<00:03:15.150> by<00:03:15.419> 3<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.900> 9

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
what we've done here 3 times by 3 is 9

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.069 
what we've done here 3 times by 3 is 9
so<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.889> square<00:03:17.370> root<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.790> 9<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.449> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.930> be

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
so the square root of 9 is going to be

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.319 
so the square root of 9 is going to be
equal<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.680> 3

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
equal to 3

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.199 
equal to 3
technically<00:03:21.329> it's<00:03:21.690> plus<00:03:22.229> or<00:03:22.500> minus<00:03:23.159> 3<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:23.940> in

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
technically it's plus or minus 3 but in

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.539 
technically it's plus or minus 3 but in
this<00:03:24.479> particular<00:03:24.840> video<00:03:25.169> app<00:03:25.590> level<00:03:26.250> we're

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
this particular video app level we're

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.000 
this particular video app level we're
working<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.449> simply<00:03:27.870> state<00:03:28.139> 3<00:03:28.470> would<00:03:28.829> be

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
working at to simply state 3 would be

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.629 
working at to simply state 3 would be
acceptable

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
acceptable

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.599 
acceptable
the<00:03:30.359> reason<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.840> plus<00:03:31.229> or<00:03:31.440> minus<00:03:31.829> 3<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.250> that

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
the reason it's plus or minus 3 is that

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.140 
the reason it's plus or minus 3 is that
we<00:03:32.699> could<00:03:32.849> have<00:03:33.090> minus<00:03:33.840> 3<00:03:34.049> x<00:03:34.919> minus<00:03:35.489> 3<00:03:35.639> which

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
we could have minus 3 x minus 3 which

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.110 
we could have minus 3 x minus 3 which
would<00:03:36.359> give<00:03:36.569> us<00:03:36.599> positive<00:03:37.349> 9<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.549> we<00:03:38.699> can<00:03:38.909> say

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
would give us positive 9 so we can say

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.270 
would give us positive 9 so we can say
now<00:03:39.449> that<00:03:39.690> if<00:03:39.870> 3<00:03:40.709> squared<00:03:41.699> is<00:03:42.000> equal<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.959> 9<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
now that if 3 squared is equal to 9 the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.699 
now that if 3 squared is equal to 9 the
square<00:03:44.790> root<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.239> 9<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.750> going<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.169> be<00:03:46.290> equal<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
square root of 9 is going to be equal to

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.110 
square root of 9 is going to be equal to
3<00:03:47.069> we<00:03:47.699> can<00:03:47.879> see<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.690> inverse<00:03:49.530> relationship<00:03:50.310> so

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
3 we can see the inverse relationship so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.199 
3 we can see the inverse relationship so
1<00:03:51.479> now<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:51.959> sends<00:03:52.409> it<00:03:52.500> one<00:03:52.769> way<00:03:52.949> and<00:03:53.220> now<00:03:53.879> we<00:03:53.940> do

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
1 now it sends it one way and now we do

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.649 
1 now it sends it one way and now we do
the<00:03:54.359> inverse<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.169> send<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.590> back<00:03:55.909> so<00:03:56.909> if<00:03:57.150> we<00:03:57.449> now

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
the inverse to send it back so if we now

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.800 
the inverse to send it back so if we now
looked<00:03:58.019> at<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.829> cube<00:03:59.250> root<00:03:59.549> so<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.419> cube<00:04:00.780> root

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
looked at the cube root so the cube root

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.500 
looked at the cube root so the cube root
and<00:04:01.260> we<00:04:01.470> would<00:04:01.620> have<00:04:01.889> now<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.159> notation<00:04:03.000> with

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and we would have now the notation with

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.909 
and we would have now the notation with
the<00:04:03.659> same<00:04:03.900> as<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.169> square<00:04:04.409> root<00:04:04.470> but<00:04:04.769> with<00:04:04.889> a

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
the same as the square root but with a

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.849 
the same as the square root but with a
little<00:04:05.129> 3<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:06.329> is<00:04:06.569> saying<00:04:06.810> now<00:04:06.989> what<00:04:07.319> is<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
little 3 this is saying now what is the

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.640 
little 3 this is saying now what is the
cube<00:04:08.159> root<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.489> 27<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:10.019> we're<00:04:10.199> looking<00:04:10.470> for

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
cube root of 27 so we're looking for

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.979 
cube root of 27 so we're looking for
three<00:04:10.829> numbers<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.509> multiply<00:04:12.509> the<00:04:12.569> same

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
three numbers that multiply the same

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.530 
three numbers that multiply the same
number<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.409> give<00:04:13.560> 27<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.489> that's<00:04:14.939> going<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.329> be

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
number to give 27 and that's going to be

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.189 
number to give 27 and that's going to be
free<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.560> cube<00:04:16.799> root<00:04:16.979> of<00:04:17.099> 27<00:04:17.849> is<00:04:17.940> 3<00:04:18.000> we<00:04:18.900> know

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
free so the cube root of 27 is 3 we know

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.700 
free so the cube root of 27 is 3 we know
that<00:04:19.530> 3<00:04:19.829> cubed<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.459> 27<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.049> cube<00:04:22.349> root<00:04:22.440> of

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
that 3 cubed is 27 so the cube root of

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.620 
that 3 cubed is 27 so the cube root of
27<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.669> going<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.389> free<00:04:24.659> it's<00:04:25.349> not

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
27 is going to be free it's not

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.860 
27 is going to be free it's not
cubed<00:04:27.820> so<00:04:28.820> sometimes<00:04:29.360> students<00:04:29.720> right<00:04:29.840> here

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
cubed so sometimes students right here

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.260 
cubed so sometimes students right here
the<00:04:30.140> cube<00:04:30.350> root<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.500> 27<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:31.130> 3<00:04:31.160> cubed<00:04:31.550> it's<00:04:31.760> just

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
the cube root of 27 is 3 cubed it's just

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.470 
the cube root of 27 is 3 cubed it's just
free<00:04:32.480> if<00:04:33.320> we<00:04:33.680> look<00:04:33.890> now<00:04:34.100> at<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.730> cube<00:04:35.210> root<00:04:35.450> of

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
free if we look now at the cube root of

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.050 
free if we look now at the cube root of
64<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.980> we're<00:04:37.100> looking<00:04:37.340> at<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.520> cube<00:04:37.760> root<00:04:37.940> of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
64 so we're looking at the cube root of

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.380 
64 so we're looking at the cube root of
64<00:04:38.380> we<00:04:39.380> need<00:04:39.590> 3<00:04:40.190> at<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.670> same<00:04:40.700> number

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
64 we need 3 at the same number

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.980 
64 we need 3 at the same number
multiplied<00:04:42.260> now<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:43.160> give<00:04:43.430> us<00:04:43.550> 64<00:04:44.120> if<00:04:44.420> you're

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
multiplied now to give us 64 if you're

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.200 
multiplied now to give us 64 if you're
unsure<00:04:45.170> you<00:04:45.620> can<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:46.010> work<00:04:46.190> up<00:04:46.430> 1<00:04:46.670> times<00:04:46.970> 1

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
unsure you can just work up 1 times 1

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.990 
unsure you can just work up 1 times 1
times<00:04:47.240> 1<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:48.050> going<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.470> be<00:04:48.620> 1<00:04:48.830> we<00:04:49.520> can<00:04:49.700> see<00:04:49.880> that

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
times 1 is going to be 1 we can see that

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.710 
times 1 is going to be 1 we can see that
2<00:04:50.240> times<00:04:50.570> 2<00:04:50.870> times<00:04:50.900> 2<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.710> going<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.280> be<00:04:52.430> 8<00:04:52.720> 3

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
2 times 2 times 2 is going to be 8 3

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.610 
2 times 2 times 2 is going to be 8 3
times<00:04:54.050> 3<00:04:54.380> times<00:04:54.410> 3<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.280> going<00:04:55.730> to<00:04:55.820> be<00:04:55.910> 27<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.410> all

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
times 3 times 3 is going to be 27 so all

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.840 
times 3 times 3 is going to be 27 so all
of<00:04:57.800> these<00:04:57.920> are<00:04:57.980> too<00:04:58.250> small

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
of these are too small

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.610 
of these are too small
4<00:04:59.540> times<00:05:00.020> by<00:05:00.230> 4<00:05:00.590> is<00:05:00.800> 16<00:05:01.580> times<00:05:02.540> by<00:05:02.750> 4<00:05:03.050> again<00:05:03.200> is

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
4 times by 4 is 16 times by 4 again is

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.180 
4 times by 4 is 16 times by 4 again is
going<00:05:03.980> to<00:05:04.070> give<00:05:04.160> me<00:05:04.400> 64<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.350> cube<00:05:06.770> root<00:05:06.980> of

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
going to give me 64 so the cube root of

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.160 
going to give me 64 so the cube root of
64<00:05:07.490> is<00:05:08.210> 4<00:05:08.630> because<00:05:09.470> we<00:05:09.680> know<00:05:09.980> that<00:05:10.340> 4<00:05:10.940> cubed<00:05:11.870> is

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
64 is 4 because we know that 4 cubed is

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.260 
64 is 4 because we know that 4 cubed is
going<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:12.830> give<00:05:13.010> us<00:05:13.130> 64<00:05:13.790> these<00:05:14.720> are<00:05:15.020> in<00:05:15.350> verses

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
going to give us 64 these are in verses

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.630 
going to give us 64 these are in verses
so<00:05:17.270> if<00:05:17.450> we<00:05:17.630> were<00:05:17.720> asked<00:05:18.140> now<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.380> find<00:05:19.100> the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
so if we were asked now to find the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.950 
so if we were asked now to find the
square<00:05:20.060> root<00:05:20.480> of<00:05:21.340> 100<00:05:22.340> this<00:05:23.180> is<00:05:23.450> saying<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.870> me

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
square root of 100 this is saying to me

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.170 
square root of 100 this is saying to me
now<00:05:24.140> which<00:05:24.710> two<00:05:25.040> numbers<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.550> same<00:05:25.760> numbers

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
now which two numbers the same numbers

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.960 
now which two numbers the same numbers
multiplied<00:05:27.170> together<00:05:27.380> give<00:05:27.830> us<00:05:27.950> 100<00:05:28.520> the

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
multiplied together give us 100 the

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.870 
multiplied together give us 100 the
square<00:05:29.450> root<00:05:29.630> of<00:05:29.840> 100<00:05:30.560> is<00:05:30.680> technically<00:05:31.490> plus

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
square root of 100 is technically plus

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.670 
square root of 100 is technically plus
or<00:05:32.060> minus<00:05:32.360> 10<00:05:32.600> I'm<00:05:32.870> going<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:33.410> write<00:05:33.530> the

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
or minus 10 I'm going to write the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.490 
or minus 10 I'm going to write the
positive<00:05:34.100> value<00:05:34.460> of<00:05:34.490> 10<00:05:34.880> as<00:05:35.120> 10<00:05:35.900> squared<00:05:36.110> is

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
positive value of 10 as 10 squared is

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.630 
positive value of 10 as 10 squared is
equal<00:05:37.400> to<00:05:37.880> 100<00:05:38.510> so<00:05:38.780> we're<00:05:39.680> doing<00:05:39.860> some<00:05:40.100> basic

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
equal to 100 so we're doing some basic

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.050 
equal to 100 so we're doing some basic
calculations<00:05:40.990> now<00:05:41.990> with<00:05:42.470> powers<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:43.310> roots

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
calculations now with powers and roots

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.350 
calculations now with powers and roots
these<00:05:44.990> are<00:05:45.350> about<00:05:45.830> as<00:05:46.190> tough<00:05:46.700> as<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.150> ones

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
these are about as tough as the ones

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.330 
these are about as tough as the ones
that<00:05:47.510> you'll<00:05:47.630> be<00:05:47.780> given<00:05:48.110> but<00:05:48.530> hopefully<00:05:49.100> you

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
that you'll be given but hopefully you

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.460 
that you'll be given but hopefully you
can<00:05:49.520> now<00:05:49.580> understand<00:05:50.420> the<00:05:50.750> relationship

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
can now understand the relationship

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.110 
can now understand the relationship
between<00:05:51.700> the<00:05:52.700> inverse<00:05:53.450> functions
