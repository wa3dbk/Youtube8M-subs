very lightly very lightly let me just

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.150 
very lightly very lightly let me just
compare<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.100> side<00:01:34.340> here<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:36.040> feel<00:01:37.040> it

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
compare that to this side here I feel it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.510 
compare that to this side here I feel it
more<00:01:37.370> on<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.610> left<00:01:37.820> side<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.410> top<00:01:39.590> it's
