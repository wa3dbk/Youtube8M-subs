00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.019 

we<00:00:13.590> believe<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.129> when<00:00:14.309> people<00:00:14.549> are<00:00:14.820> praying

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:15.029 
we believe that when people are praying

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.510 
we believe that when people are praying
about<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.570> good<00:00:15.840> outcome<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.560> holy<00:00:16.740> spirit<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
about a good outcome the holy spirit is

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.499 
about a good outcome the holy spirit is
present<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.500> Holy<00:00:19.680> Spirit<00:00:20.160> acts<00:00:20.429> to<00:00:21.089> help

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509

present and the Holy Spirit acts to help
us<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> one<00:00:22.919> thing<00:00:23.099> I<00:00:23.249> think<00:00:23.310> our

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
us all but the one thing I think our

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
us all but the one thing I think our
personal<00:00:24.210> prayer<00:00:24.480> does<00:00:24.749> is<00:00:25.140> ask<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
personal prayer does is ask the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
personal prayer does is ask the
Cardinals<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.669> be<00:00:26.789> open<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> worst

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
Cardinals to be open one of the worst

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.439 
Cardinals to be open one of the worst
things<00:00:28.679> about<00:00:29.159> discernment<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
things about discernment one of the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.190 
things that can get in the road of good
discernment<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.060> when<00:00:33.510> people<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:33.989> already

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
difficult to see that the outcome of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.370 
difficult to see that the outcome of
that<00:01:35.759> Conclave<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.540> what<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> Holy<00:01:36.960> Spirit
