00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
pretty tough being a Cub when parents

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.930 
pretty tough being a Cub when parents
seem<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.500> blow<00:02:47.709> their<00:02:47.950> tops<00:02:48.160> without<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> good

seem to blow their tops without a good
reason<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.930> good<00:02:50.110> thing<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.560> sooner<00:02:51.310> or<00:02:51.459> later

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
reason the good thing is sooner or later

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.270 
reason the good thing is sooner or later
parents<00:02:52.540> grow<00:02:53.019> out<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.950> become

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
not only did we enjoy it it helped us to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.360 
not only did we enjoy it it helped us to
see<00:03:14.270> that<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:14.660> not<00:03:15.170> always<00:03:15.410> easy<00:03:15.830> being<00:03:16.190> a

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
see that it's not always easy being a

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.030 
see that it's not always easy being a
Cub<00:03:16.700> but<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.660> goes<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.900> other<00:03:18.080> way<00:03:18.470> too<00:03:18.500> you

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
Cub but it goes the other way too you

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.310 
Cub but it goes the other way too you
know<00:03:19.240> sometimes<00:03:20.240> it's<00:03:20.450> not<00:03:20.510> easy<00:03:20.840> being<00:03:21.110> a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
know sometimes it's not easy being a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.130 
know sometimes it's not easy being a
parent<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:22.030> think<00:03:23.030> being<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.390> parent<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:23.990> the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
parent I think being a parent is the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.370 
parent I think being a parent is the
easiest<00:03:24.620> thing<00:03:24.800> there<00:03:25.130> is<00:03:25.450> yeah<00:03:26.480> parents

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
easiest thing there is yeah parents

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.990 
easiest thing there is yeah parents
don't<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.650> anyone<00:03:28.160> telling<00:03:28.459> them<00:03:28.700> what<00:03:28.880> to

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.800 
think about that part
I'll<00:04:10.280> get<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.610> cereal<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.060> get<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.569> juice

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
I'll get the cereal you get the juice

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.569 
I'll get the cereal you get the juice
and<00:04:12.220> berries<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.250> toast<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:18.100> hey<00:04:19.100> where<00:04:19.489> did

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
and berries a toast to hey where did

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.560 
and berries a toast to hey where did
they<00:04:19.729> go<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.209> guess<00:04:20.870> they're<00:04:21.109> finished
