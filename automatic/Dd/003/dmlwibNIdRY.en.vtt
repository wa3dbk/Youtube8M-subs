this is dr. John Lamberton this morning

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.730 
this is dr. John Lamberton this morning
I<00:00:03.240> thought<00:00:03.419> we'd<00:00:03.600> talk<00:00:03.780> very<00:00:04.020> briefly<00:00:04.140> about<00:00:04.589> I

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
I thought we'd talk very briefly about I

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.940 
I thought we'd talk very briefly about I
sign<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.520> how<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.759> evaluate<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.779> pidgin<00:00:07.200> using

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
sign and how you evaluate a pidgin using

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.370 
sign and how you evaluate a pidgin using
I<00:00:08.130> sign<00:00:08.460> there<00:00:09.450> are<00:00:09.540> many<00:00:09.690> good<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.990> sign

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
I sign there are many good I sign

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.980 
I sign there are many good I sign
theories<00:00:10.860> out<00:00:11.040> there<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.809> many<00:00:12.809> good

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
theories out there and many good

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.070 
theories out there and many good
explanations<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.429> sign<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.120> believe<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
explanations of I sign I believe that I

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.170 
explanations of I sign I believe that I
sign<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.830> small<00:00:17.220> component<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
sign is one small component of the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.279 
sign is one small component of the
overall<00:00:18.830> evaluation<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> good<00:00:20.609> pidgin<00:00:21.289> but

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
overall evaluation of a good pidgin but

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.550 
overall evaluation of a good pidgin but
in<00:00:22.410> evaluating<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.310> sign<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> use

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
in evaluating I sign first of all I use

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.060 
in evaluating I sign first of all I use
an<00:00:26.039> 18<00:00:26.490> power<00:00:26.760> loop<00:00:27.410> that<00:00:28.410> could<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.890> buy

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
an 18 power loop that could you can buy

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.060 
an 18 power loop that could you can buy
from<00:00:29.550> any<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> pidgin<00:00:30.720> supply<00:00:31.080> houses<00:00:31.349> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
from any of the pidgin supply houses it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.910 
from any of the pidgin supply houses it
has<00:00:32.219> two<00:00:32.430> lenses<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.899> gives<00:00:34.079> us<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.469> 18

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
has two lenses on it it gives us it's 18

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.119 
has two lenses on it it gives us it's 18
power<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.320> second<00:00:37.680> thing<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> think

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
power and the second thing is I think

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.690 
power and the second thing is I think
it's<00:00:38.760> best<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.239> evaluate<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.110> sign<00:00:40.860> using<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's best to evaluate I sign using the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's best to evaluate I sign using the
bright<00:00:41.940> sunshine<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.860> find<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> bright

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
bright sunshine I find on a bright

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.209 
bright sunshine I find on a bright
sunshiny<00:00:45.090> day<00:00:45.360> such<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.719> today<00:00:45.980> that's<00:00:46.980> when

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
sunshiny day such as today that's when

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.750 
sunshiny day such as today that's when
you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.940> eye<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> most<00:00:48.570> clearest

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
you can see the eye is the most clearest

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.830 
you can see the eye is the most clearest
there<00:00:50.760> are<00:00:50.820> several<00:00:51.090> things<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.570> look<00:00:51.809> for

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
there are several things that I look for

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.430 
there are several things that I look for
when<00:00:52.260> I'm<00:00:52.379> evaluating<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.070> pigeon's<00:00:53.460> eye<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
when I'm evaluating a pigeon's eye the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.380 
when I'm evaluating a pigeon's eye the
first<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.480> I<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.350> how<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.590> pupil

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
first is I want to see how the pupil

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
first is I want to see how the pupil
dilates<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.660> constricts<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> hold<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> eye

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
dilates and constricts so I hold the eye

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.560 
dilates and constricts so I hold the eye
up<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> sunshine<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.760> look<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> pupil

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
up to the sunshine and look at the pupil

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.950 
up to the sunshine and look at the pupil
and<00:01:07.220> watch<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.180> dilates<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and watch the way it dilates and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.250 
and watch the way it dilates and
constricts<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.760> find<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.180> pigeon<00:01:12.540> whose

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
constricts if you find a pigeon whose

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.210 
constricts if you find a pigeon whose
pupil<00:01:13.710> constricts<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:15.509> small<00:01:16.189> generally<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
pupil constricts very small generally I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
pupil constricts very small generally I
have<00:01:17.580> found<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> past<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.380> type<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
have found in the past that this type of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.820 
have found in the past that this type of
pigeon<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.670> fly<00:01:20.880> well<00:01:21.119> at<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> distance

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
pigeon will fly well at the distance

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
pigeon will fly well at the distance
there<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:22.920> several<00:01:23.479> areas<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> eye<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there are several areas of the eye that

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
there are several areas of the eye that
I<00:01:25.590> look<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.040> number<00:01:27.030> two<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> look<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.689> number
