 the turbocharger 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.059
 an invention that has been constantly evolving for more than a hundred years 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.169
 Can you still improve them 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.079
 not really 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.259
 we have been working on it for over 30 years 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.259
 and we see no reason to stop 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.810
 At the beginning of the seventies, the development of the 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.109
 Exhaust gas turbocharger spelled out 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.269
 and already in 1972 the brochures dominate 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.110
 1974 began 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.310
 with hitherto unattainable powerful he delights 9 11 tob 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 at the latest from 1 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.240
 The 9th generation Drobo of the third generation ensures shiny eyes and moist 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.060
 Hands already at 2500 rpm set a torque of 400 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 Newton meters available 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 shifts the boundaries 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.269
 now provides an even more dynamic power delivery
