00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 and then if there's a new bodybuilder 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.650
 labrada he was known for his symmetry 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.480
 structure all that is called 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.670
 a mass combination with common classes 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.289
 with a weight of 7 out of 9 kilos go on 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 professional level was complexity 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.750
 tasks for anyone at the same time 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.369
 Will there labrada sale were excellent 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930
 proportions in a certain aspect he was 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.470
 perfect what little guy with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.470
 powerful hands 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.719
 89 made serious competition for 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.309
 heine the first time I then became the second 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.870
 I enjoyed public support because 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.460
 that we performed in rimini city 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.530
 Italy and the Italians have a tendency to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.370
 aesthetic physique which I like 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.100
 once possessed 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 Well, you know the cultural heritage of the ancient 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 Rome or all that is very popular there 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.219
 entered the arena with no schmitt vince taylor 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 many beautiful champions or 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.379
 labrada again and rich gaspari i have it 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.920
 called it itchy and nowhere too 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.949
 not gone 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.870
 I was the second and then 2 place fell 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.920
 down skipping labrador and vince from 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.770
 this on Ali heine won again on 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.270
 I was waiting for the competition next year 90 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.740
 expecting this to be my year 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.689
 because this year was scheduled 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.490
 doping control in competitions I knew 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.939
 what my natural genetics will be 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:28.500
 In this case, my advantage is so much 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.979
 excitement was in the final and when leading 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.750
 announced 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.520
 did we become the winner? 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.840
 by name 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.220
 condition was like I'm standing on the edge 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.350
 rocks and either i jumped and fly 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 either fall and break at the bottom of me was 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.590
 feeling of free fall when it became 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.140
 it is clear that Lehin won and played again 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.270
 the role of the size factor ahay did not have them 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.950
 therefore the labrada conquered was very 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.810
 close to winning time in italy and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.690
 the ninetieth year when there was a competition with 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.370
 doping control but did not work out alla 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.849
 would take could be a great mr 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.290
 Olympia 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.340
 and as a personality and beckoned 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.530
 and in the manner of keeping myself I was very 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.420
 young as bodybuilders i started to pay 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.060
 attention to what's happening to me has become 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.980
 getting hurt really seems 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.879
 It was that I burned out from all these 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.989
 competition for mr olympia '90 i 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.430
 took only 5 place 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.370
 dropped another place down and i 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.510
 said oh my god all successful bodybuilding 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.150
 for me is over 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.889
 sorry for the rich but because if 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.109
 would not exist gaspari would become 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.989
 at least three times mister olympia he was 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.519
 second three times in a row it's phenomenal 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.950
 you know most professionals 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.970
 now when they already have 30 only 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.470
 go to the pro 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.370
 and he became the second on the Olympia 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.260
 aged 22 to 24 he was another 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.389
 great potential champion 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.400
 i talked to my wife shirley and 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.819
 said i won seven times already 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.099
 contract 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.900
 no one has won so many times in a row 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.590
 and asked how are you looking to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.819
 me try again she looked at 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.709
 me and answered try what else 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.209
 so try you should only 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.290
 win and come on more to this 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.970
 the conversation will not even return 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.889
 Here is my wife this conversation gave 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.940
 I have the energy to continue and win 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.659
 on 8 Olympus 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.389
 and then there was a guy who was equal 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.810
 by size from in and by weight 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.000
 and having a good form everyone pleads 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.859
 dorian yats form but he is good 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.190
 he has proportions 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.440
 long torso short legs back and all 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.680
 such and 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.810
 famously and did not know that it was a threat to him 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:00.449
 there was a possibility of pressure damage all 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:03.739
 intensified and intensified and they 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.739
 fought ninety first year 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.459
 round of symmetry famously and did not win 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.940
 muscularity round won 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.739
 darren I was in the competition for the first time and not 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:25.880
 I thought that in the end I will fight valiantly 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:29.060
 and not for the first place it seems to me 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.830
 liked to be losers crowd crazy 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:37.729
 went down at the sight of two hefty guys 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:40.700
 weighing 110 115 kilograms took four with 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.240
 half a minute to spend 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.780
 a comparison of 7 poses or won them 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.270
 of all 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.900
 I could not win it was mine 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.000
 work of my career 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.300
 it all came together when my voice sounded 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.700
 music from excalibur and it was 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.560
 the return of the king of eighty 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.660
 the fourth year when he won the Olympia 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.030
 for the first time he spoke under the theme of 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.500
 excalibur and the same thing happened on 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:14.390
 his last olympia turned out 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:17.030
 gorgeous performance I came to the competition 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.600
 in perfect shape and at its end my hands 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.940
 triumphantly he won the Olympia 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.729
 eight times it was the end of it 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.710
 competitive career need to say 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.760
 perhaps hai was not the first gentleman in 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.370
 bodybuilding famously and was not and now 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.360

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.360
 bodybuilding as a sport
