previously
said<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.800> all<00:02:14.180> ps3<00:02:15.180> compatible<00:02:15.660> headsets

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
said that all ps3 compatible headsets

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.980 
said that all ps3 compatible headsets
would<00:02:16.320> work<00:02:16.530> with<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.010> ps4<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.690> change

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
would work with the ps4 and to change

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.140 
would work with the ps4 and to change
that<00:02:19.320> at<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.740> point<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.520> close<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
that at this point so close to the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.420 
that at this point so close to the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
release date of the ps4 I think it's a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.870 
release date of the ps4 I think it's a
real<00:02:23.640> mistake<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.810> Sony's<00:02:25.170> part<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.950> lot<00:02:26.760> of

six<00:02:29.760> months<00:02:30.060> or<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.210> based<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> fact<00:02:31.320> that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
six months or so based on the fact that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.870 
six months or so based on the fact that
they<00:02:31.680> knew<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.310> would<00:02:32.460> be<00:02:32.490> compatible

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880

they knew that it would be compatible
with<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> ps4<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.470> now<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.340> Sony<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.670> change

with the ps4 and now for Sony to change
their<00:02:36.270> minds<00:02:36.480> or<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.840> change<00:02:37.110> their<00:02:37.320> policy

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
their minds or to change their policy

their minds or to change their policy
about<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.610> think<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.240> sucks<00:02:39.630> man<00:02:39.930> that

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
about that I think that sucks man that

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.010 
about that I think that sucks man that
is<00:02:40.350> like<00:02:40.380> an<00:02:40.740> anti<00:02:41.190> consumer<00:02:41.850> policy<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.570> that

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
is like an anti consumer policy and that

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.570 
is like an anti consumer policy and that
is<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.230> kind<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.500> stuff<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.830> hate<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.430> these

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
is the kind of stuff I hate to see these

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.720 
is the kind of stuff I hate to see these
companies<00:02:44.850> do<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.690> fairness<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> Sony<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
companies do in fairness to Sony if you

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.180 
companies do in fairness to Sony if you
have<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.330> headset<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.870> uses<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.620> optical

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
launch so that we could just jump right

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.850

can't<00:03:22.890> lie<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.180> thought<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.360> Sony<00:03:24.720> really<00:03:25.200> had

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
can't lie I thought that Sony really had

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.370 
can't lie I thought that Sony really had
the<00:03:25.680> better<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:27.540> better<00:03:27.750> options<00:03:28.290> for

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
the better the better options for

headset compatibility on the on the
PlayStation<00:03:31.290> 4<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.680> really<00:03:31.920> turns<00:03:32.130> out

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
PlayStation 4 and it really turns out
