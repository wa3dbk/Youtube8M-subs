that<00:06:10.889> my<00:06:11.130> heels<00:06:11.400> are<00:06:11.610> healing<00:06:11.850> by<00:06:12.120> giants<00:06:13.020> the

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
that my heels are healing by giants the

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.460 
that my heels are healing by giants the
Giants<00:06:14.100> going<00:06:14.250> against<00:06:14.700> the<00:06:14.880> cannon<00:06:15.780> spot<00:06:16.050> are

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
Giants going against the cannon spot are

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.010 
Giants going against the cannon spot are
you<00:06:17.100> can<00:06:17.250> see<00:06:17.430> that<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:18.360> giant<00:06:18.750> is<00:06:18.840> still

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
you can see that the the giant is still

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.070 
you can see that the the giant is still
started<00:06:19.410> a<00:06:19.470> war<00:06:19.680> while<00:06:20.100> is<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:21.090> initial

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
started a war while is the initial

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.779 
started a war while is the initial
targets<00:06:22.440> being<00:06:22.620> taken<00:06:22.919> up<00:06:22.979> by<00:06:23.039> the<00:06:23.190> outside

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
targets being taken up by the outside

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.120 
targets being taken up by the outside
research<00:06:24.419> so<00:06:25.200> that<00:06:25.229> is<00:06:25.440> quite<00:06:25.680> weird<00:06:25.890> that<00:06:26.099> a

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
research so that is quite weird that a

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.740 
research so that is quite weird that a
giant<00:06:26.400> is<00:06:26.640> actually<00:06:26.970> attached<00:06:27.270> to<00:06:27.450> the<00:06:27.570> wall

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
giant is actually attached to the wall

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.310 
giant is actually attached to the wall
right<00:06:27.900> now<00:06:28.110> even<00:06:28.409> though<00:06:28.590> that

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
right now even though that

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.890 
right now even though that
you<00:06:29.830> know<00:06:29.950> all<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.640> powers<00:06:31.150> on<00:06:31.390> these<00:06:31.690> sites

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
you know all the powers on these sites

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.900 
you know all the powers on these sites
already<00:06:32.290> taken<00:06:32.890> out<00:06:32.980> so<00:06:33.190> you<00:06:33.280> need<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.610> break

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
already taken out so you need to break

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.080 
already taken out so you need to break
the<00:06:34.090> wall<00:06:34.360> before<00:06:35.320> they<00:06:35.710> realize<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.700> target

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
the wall before they realize the target

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.520 
the wall before they realize the target
has<00:06:37.180> been<00:06:37.210> taken<00:06:37.690> out<00:06:37.780> so<00:06:38.020> this<00:06:38.200> is<00:06:38.290> quite

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
has been taken out so this is quite

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.250 
has been taken out so this is quite
weird<00:06:38.740> I<00:06:38.950> hold<00:06:39.100> the<00:06:39.190> developer<00:06:39.670> CDs<00:06:40.150> and<00:06:40.360> try

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
weird I hold the developer CDs and try

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.180 
weird I hold the developer CDs and try
to<00:06:41.730> find<00:06:42.730> another<00:06:42.940> way<00:06:43.360> to<00:06:43.390> detect<00:06:44.130> that<00:06:45.130> the

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
to find another way to detect that the

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.330 
to find another way to detect that the
Chinese<00:06:46.090> racing<00:06:46.450> is<00:06:46.570> time<00:06:46.780> on<00:06:46.990> the<00:06:47.110> war<00:06:47.350> so<00:06:48.040> the

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
Chinese racing is time on the war so the

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.610 
Chinese racing is time on the war so the
rest<00:06:48.370> of<00:06:48.640> the<00:06:48.730> truth<00:06:48.940> is<00:06:49.090> currently<00:06:49.990> trying<00:06:50.410> to

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
rest of the truth is currently trying to

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.460 
rest of the truth is currently trying to
attack<00:06:51.030> very<00:06:52.030> successfully<00:06:52.630> the<00:06:52.870> Wizards<00:06:53.260> is

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.470 
attack very successfully the Wizards is

very<00:06:53.710> strong<00:06:54.070> I<00:06:54.250> really<00:06:54.580> like<00:06:54.790> to<00:06:54.970> visit<00:06:55.150> now

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
very strong I really like to visit now

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.740 
very strong I really like to visit now
but<00:06:56.440> other<00:06:56.710> is<00:06:56.920> very<00:06:57.250> a<00:06:57.430> very<00:06:58.000> long<00:06:58.330> time<00:06:58.540> too

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
but other is very a very long time too

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110 
last building is the archer tower and

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.610 
last building is the archer tower and
this<00:07:32.920> each<00:07:33.280> hundred<00:07:33.880> percent<00:07:34.210> alright<00:07:34.870> this<00:07:35.320> I

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
this each hundred percent alright this I

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.830 
this each hundred percent alright this I
can<00:07:35.950> potentially<00:07:36.580> take<00:07:37.120> all<00:07:37.360> the<00:07:37.480> resource

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 
can potentially take all the resource

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.110 
can potentially take all the resource
and<00:07:38.050> stop<00:07:38.290> there<00:07:38.530> but<00:07:38.740> this<00:07:39.280> is<00:07:39.550> to<00:07:39.850> prove<00:07:40.060> that

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 
and stop there but this is to prove that

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.090 
and stop there but this is to prove that
I<00:07:40.300> can't<00:07:40.570> redo<00:07:40.840> it<00:07:40.870> a<00:07:40.990> higher<00:07:41.290> percentage<00:07:41.560> ack

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.100 
I can't redo it a higher percentage ack

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.350 
I can't redo it a higher percentage ack
which<00:07:42.880> is<00:07:43.030> awesome
