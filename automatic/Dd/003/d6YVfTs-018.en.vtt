00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.690
 for the good cause 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.569
 at break this week 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.869
 I know what it is that filiation this movement by placing myself 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.210
 p 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.829
 likewise no sign of the 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.050
 it is normal this product 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.230
 but the menu 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 but also for the driver 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.400
 I do not think that at the level 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.020
 everyone is talking about him 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.020

 it turns out that he 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.130
 the patriot 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930
 posted the link 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.200
 who the sources 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 clear 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.840
 in this case 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.480
 in all languages 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.280
 what matters for statistics 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.420
 after 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420
 the economist christian saint-etienne 1-4 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 flat 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.190
 yes for the highest 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.259
