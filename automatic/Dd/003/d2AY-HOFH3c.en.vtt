straight in with us now it's a fairly
thick<00:00:27.710> line<00:00:27.949> with<00:00:28.279> just<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.550> tiny<00:00:28.760> bit<00:00:28.910> of<00:00:29.090> a

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
thick line with just a tiny bit of a

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.979 
thick line with just a tiny bit of a
flick<00:00:29.390> on<00:00:29.600> the<00:00:29.840> edge<00:00:31.000> so<00:00:32.000> take<00:00:32.449> your<00:00:32.570> time<00:00:32.629> with

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
flick on the edge so take your time with

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:42.630 
flick on the edge so take your time with
this<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:33.410> get<00:00:33.559> it<00:00:33.649> nice<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:33.829> even

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:51.830 

I'm<00:00:43.239> just<00:00:43.420> using<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.840> b<00:00:43.989> ys<00:00:44.320> liquid<00:00:44.739> liner

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.530 

so<00:00:52.470> small<00:00:52.740> strokes<00:00:53.100> usually<00:00:53.490> helps<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.060> just

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
so small strokes usually helps and just

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.500 
so small strokes usually helps and just
build<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> thickness

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.460 

then<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:02.260> can<00:01:02.410> just<00:01:02.530> flick<00:01:03.190> out<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.550> edge<00:01:04.470> or

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
then you can just flick out that edge or

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.899 
then you can just flick out that edge or
stick<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.830> up<00:01:06.009> a<00:01:06.189> bit<00:01:06.220> more<00:01:06.580> than<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:06.820> would

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
stick it up a bit more than you would

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.070 
stick it up a bit more than you would
think<00:01:06.970> because<00:01:07.299> when<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.659> open<00:01:07.900> your<00:01:07.930> eyes

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
think because when you open your eyes

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.020 
think because when you open your eyes
that<00:01:08.380> always<00:01:08.530> droops<00:01:09.100> down<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.369> little<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
that always droops down a little and

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.770 
that always droops down a little and
that<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.790> be<00:01:15.939> careful<00:01:16.240> make<00:01:16.360> sure<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.600> dries

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
that just be careful make sure it dries

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.510 
that just be careful make sure it dries
before<00:01:17.049> you<00:01:17.290> open<00:01:17.560> up<00:01:17.619> your<00:01:17.680> hair<00:01:17.950> properly
