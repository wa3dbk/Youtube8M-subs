00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
been there um you know those times where
I<00:01:03.149> thought<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.989> know<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.949> made<00:01:05.040> an

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I thought you know I could have made an

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.750 
I thought you know I could have made an
impact<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> game<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:08.040> guys<00:01:08.250> went<00:01:08.670> out

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
impact on the game the guys went out

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.219 
impact on the game the guys went out
there<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.600> played<00:01:09.840> very<00:01:09.869> very

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
there and they they played very very

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.020 
there and they they played very very
hard<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:13.040> mean<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> tough<00:01:14.909> loss

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
hard and and I mean it was a tough loss

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.420 
hard and and I mean it was a tough loss
but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.080> thought<00:01:16.729> with<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.090> loss<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.570> Kansas

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
but I thought with that loss at Kansas

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.399 
but I thought with that loss at Kansas
it<00:01:20.430> kind<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.759> helped<00:01:21.090> our<00:01:21.240> our<00:01:21.659> basketball

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409

Williams<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> first<00:01:29.909> half<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
Williams in the first half of the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.080 
Williams in the first half of the
syracuse<00:01:30.750> game<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.369> thought<00:01:32.369> that's<00:01:32.790> where<00:01:32.970> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
syracuse game I thought that's where it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
syracuse game I thought that's where it
all<00:01:33.150> started<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.650> didn't<00:01:35.100> play<00:01:35.250> at

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
all started when when I didn't play at

all started when when I didn't play at

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
Kansas we've been playing a high impact

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
Kansas we've been playing a high impact
game<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.850> last<00:01:39.060> thing<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> dominate

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
game and one last thing not to dominate

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.520 
game and one last thing not to dominate
this<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:43.880> they<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.630> seen<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.200> in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
this but the they have not seen you in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.039 
this but the they have not seen you in
action<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.310> Ohio<00:01:47.909> State<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.240> played<00:01:48.720> against

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
action but Ohio State has played against

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.510 
action but Ohio State has played against
Kansas<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:50.250> bit<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.430> an

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
Kansas is that a little bit of an

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.630 
Kansas is that a little bit of an
advantage<00:01:50.729> um<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:52.799> can't<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.250> say<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
advantage um you can't really say that

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.660 
advantage um you can't really say that
because<00:01:53.880> coach<00:01:54.210> shelf<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.670> great

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
because coach shelf is a very great

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.289 
because coach shelf is a very great
excellent<00:01:57.060> I'll<00:01:57.560> coach<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:59.270> he's<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
excellent I'll coach you know he's a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.859 
excellent I'll coach you know he's a
very<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.810> scouting<00:02:01.110> coach<00:02:02.180> he<00:02:03.180> knows<00:02:03.600> he

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
very good scouting coach he knows he

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.310 
very good scouting coach he knows he
knows<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> game<00:02:04.380> playing<00:02:04.680> well<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:06.090> think

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
knows a game playing well and I think

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.540 
knows a game playing well and I think
that<00:02:07.320> doesn't<00:02:07.590> give<00:02:07.740> us<00:02:07.770> no<00:02:07.979> advantage<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that doesn't give us no advantage I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.859 
that doesn't give us no advantage I
think<00:02:08.580> whoever<00:02:08.970> comes<00:02:09.239> out<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.509> place<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
think whoever comes out in place the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.510 
think whoever comes out in place the
hardest<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:11.220> doesn't<00:02:11.580> quit<00:02:11.730> in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
