and it was really concerning me because

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.350 
and it was really concerning me because
the<00:00:31.950> amount<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.129> fuel<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.520> would<00:00:32.610> require<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the amount of fuel that would require to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.780 
the amount of fuel that would require to
get<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> water<00:00:34.590> boiling<00:00:34.920> continues<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> keep

get the water boiling continues to keep

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.849 
get the water boiling continues to keep
it<00:00:35.910> boiling<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:37.019> the<00:00:37.140> rice<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.559> there<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
it boiling with the rice in there and

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.979 
it boiling with the rice in there and
things<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.609> cook<00:00:38.789> it<00:00:38.999> made<00:00:39.870> me<00:00:39.960> very

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
things like that to cook it made me very

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:40.520 
things like that to cook it made me very
nervous

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
nervous

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.299 
nervous
so<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.789> came<00:00:41.999> up<00:00:42.089> with<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> solution<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.309> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so I came up with a solution and is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.439 
so I came up with a solution and is
while<00:00:44.640> you're<00:00:44.789> looking<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.089> it

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
while you're looking at it

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.750 
while you're looking at it
thermos<00:00:46.050> cooking<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.649> know<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> sounds<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
thermos cooking I know it sounds a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.399 
thermos cooking I know it sounds a
little<00:00:47.850> crazy<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.449> when<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.839> think<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.109> it

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
little crazy but when you think about it

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.220 
little crazy but when you think about it
the<00:00:49.620> concept<00:00:50.010> should<00:00:50.129> work<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.429> fine

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
the concept should work just fine

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.840 
the concept should work just fine

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.580 
will keep the heat in there so basically
you<00:02:13.209> know<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.330> pour<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.660> hot<00:02:13.750> water<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.019> put<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
you know I pour the hot water on put the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.890 
you know I pour the hot water on put the
lid<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.180> technically<00:02:16.180> estar<00:02:16.420> mrs.<00:02:16.660> posed

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.229 
lid on and technically estar mrs. posed
to<00:02:17.050> keep<00:02:17.260> warm<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.739> just<00:02:18.280> see<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.400> says<00:02:18.610> 24<00:02:19.030> hours

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
to keep warm I just see it says 24 hours

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.880 
to keep warm I just see it says 24 hours
down<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.510> there<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.440> know<00:02:20.560> for<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
down in there but you know for the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.070 
down in there but you know for the
kippah<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.630> not<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.989> to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
kippah you know it's it's not going to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.320 
kippah you know it's it's not going to
be<00:02:23.170> some<00:02:23.350> good<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.530> stay<00:02:23.769> 24<00:02:24.069> hours

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
be some good to stay 24 hours

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.789 
be some good to stay 24 hours
you<00:02:25.630> know<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.930> will<00:02:26.049> keep<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> heat<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
you know this will keep the heat in the

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.470 
you know this will keep the heat in the
rice<00:02:26.980> should<00:02:27.010> cook<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.549> about<00:02:27.790> 2<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.150> 3<00:02:28.450> hours

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
rice should cook in about 2 to 3 hours

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.750 
rice should cook in about 2 to 3 hours
you<00:02:29.019> could<00:02:29.650> have<00:02:29.739> easily<00:02:29.860> put<00:02:30.130> some<00:02:30.310> salt<00:02:30.549> and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
you could have easily put some salt and

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520 
you could have easily put some salt and
stuff<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.030> there<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.299> wanted<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:32.440> for

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
stuff in there if you wanted to just for

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.620 
stuff in there if you wanted to just for
demonstration<00:02:33.100> purposes<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.390> poured<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
demonstration purposes I just poured the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.500 
demonstration purposes I just poured the
water<00:02:34.840> in<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.940> will<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.209> will<00:02:37.269> save

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
water in so so this will this will save

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.949 
water in so so this will this will save
you<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.690> ton<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.440> fuel<00:02:39.540> because<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.660> all<00:02:40.840> you

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
you a ton of fuel because you all you

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.930 
you a ton of fuel because you all you
really<00:02:41.170> have<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.130> just<00:02:42.370> boil<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> water

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
really have to do is just boil the water

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.140 
really have to do is just boil the water
and<00:02:43.209> an<00:02:43.870> add<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.769> yes<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.580> say<00:02:45.790> when<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.000> do

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and an add it so yes I say when you do

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.370 
and an add it so yes I say when you do
traditionally<00:02:46.660> cooking<00:02:46.930> rice<00:02:47.110> you're

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
traditionally cooking rice you're

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.870 
traditionally cooking rice you're
cooking<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.709> forever<00:02:48.010> well<00:02:48.430> not<00:02:48.549> forever<00:02:48.640> but

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
cooking it forever well not forever but

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.630 
cooking it forever well not forever but
you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.180> 15<00:02:49.599> 20<00:02:50.080> minutes<00:02:50.410> however<00:02:51.190> long<00:02:51.370> it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
you know 15 20 minutes however long it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.130 
you know 15 20 minutes however long it
takes<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.510> was<00:02:52.599> gonna<00:02:52.690> burn<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> lot

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
takes it and that was gonna burn a lot

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.680 
takes it and that was gonna burn a lot
of<00:02:53.200> fuel<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.400> get<00:02:54.549> water<00:02:55.030> boiling<00:02:55.450> within

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
of fuel you can get water boiling within

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.539 
of fuel you can get water boiling within
a<00:02:55.720> couple<00:02:55.870> minutes<00:02:56.109> it's<00:02:56.799> done<00:02:56.920> important

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
a couple minutes it's done important

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.910 
a couple minutes it's done important
thermos<00:02:57.940> put<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> lid<00:02:58.690> on<00:02:58.810> come<00:02:59.560> back<00:02:59.739> in<00:02:59.890> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
thermos put the lid on come back in a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.650 
thermos put the lid on come back in a
couple<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.190> hours<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.700> we<00:03:01.150> will<00:03:01.299> check<00:03:01.510> on

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
couple of hours and we will check on

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.849 
couple of hours and we will check on
this<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.870> she<00:03:01.959> would<00:03:02.049> have<00:03:02.260> some<00:03:02.500> perfectly

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
this and she would have some perfectly

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.670 
this and she would have some perfectly
cook<00:03:03.010> rice<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:04.269> I'll<00:03:04.359> get<00:03:04.510> back<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.500> a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
cook rice so I'll get back to in just a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.660 
cook rice so I'll get back to in just a
second<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.730> right<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:08.440> been<00:03:08.530> about<00:03:08.670> two

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
second all right so it's been about two

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.309 
second all right so it's been about two
and<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.819> half<00:03:09.940> almost<00:03:10.120> three<00:03:10.510> hours<00:03:10.630> later<00:03:11.049> I

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
and a half almost three hours later I

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.300 
and a half almost three hours later I
opened<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.579> up<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.540> pour<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.959> out<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.350> this

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
opened it up and I pour it out and this

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.360 
opened it up and I pour it out and this
is<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.609> cooked<00:03:15.970> rice<00:03:16.209> no<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:18.040> worked

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
is the cooked rice no it worked

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.180 
is the cooked rice no it worked
perfectly<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.150> rice<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.630> cooked<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:21.040> it's

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
perfectly the rice is cooked but it's

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.280 
perfectly the rice is cooked but it's
overcooked<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.600> it's<00:03:22.690> actually<00:03:22.870> kind<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.230> like

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
overcooked so it's actually kind of like

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.789 
overcooked so it's actually kind of like
mush

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
mush

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.190 
mush
so<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.760> need<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.239> work<00:03:25.389> on<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.630> timing<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:26.139> that

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
so I need to work on the timing of that

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.039 
so I need to work on the timing of that
I'm<00:03:27.130> gonna<00:03:27.280> give<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.549> shot<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.090> maybe<00:03:28.870> give

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
I'm gonna give it a shot and maybe give

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.979 
I'm gonna give it a shot and maybe give
it<00:03:29.170> an<00:03:29.260> hour<00:03:29.819> jacket<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.630> cook<00:03:31.840> to

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
it an hour jacket and see the cook to

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.210 
it an hour jacket and see the cook to
maybe<00:03:32.170> needs<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.380> little<00:03:32.470> longer<00:03:32.680> I'm<00:03:32.889> not<00:03:33.040> sure

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
maybe needs a little longer I'm not sure

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.740 
maybe needs a little longer I'm not sure
so<00:03:33.700> I'll<00:03:33.790> work<00:03:33.910> on<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.420> update<00:03:34.569> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
so I'll work on that and update the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.750 
so I'll work on that and update the
video<00:03:34.959> as<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.139> go<00:03:35.380> but<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.280> whole<00:03:36.459> point<00:03:36.730> of

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
video as I go but the whole point of

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.509 
video as I go but the whole point of
this<00:03:36.850> test<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.680> know<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:39.040> was<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.400> make

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
this test is you know it was to make

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.039 
this test is you know it was to make
sure<00:03:39.639> this<00:03:39.730> worked<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.329> does<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.840> works

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
sure this worked and it does it works

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.289 
sure this worked and it does it works
great<00:03:41.350> obviously<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.730> just<00:03:42.760> needs<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> little

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
great obviously it just needs a little

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.660 
great obviously it just needs a little
less<00:03:43.480> time<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.380> thermos<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.459> rice

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
less time in the thermos but the rice

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.910 
less time in the thermos but the rice
you<00:03:46.000> know<00:03:46.359> it's<00:03:46.540> thoroughly<00:03:47.470> thoroughly

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
alright so I decided to do one more try

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.039 
alright so I decided to do one more try
this<00:04:19.920> time<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.160> left<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.579> for<00:04:20.850> approximately<00:04:21.720> 90

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
this time I left it for approximately 90

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.140 
this time I left it for approximately 90
minutes<00:04:22.320> an<00:04:22.590> hour<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.890> half

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
minutes an hour and a half

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.400 
minutes an hour and a half
I<00:04:24.230> poured<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.440> did<00:04:25.770> strain<00:04:26.070> it<00:04:26.750> before<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.780> film

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
I poured I did strain it before I film

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.760 
I poured I did strain it before I film
this<00:04:28.640> but<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:31.050> seems<00:04:31.320> like<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.560> was<00:04:31.650> the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
this but it seems like it was the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.350 
this but it seems like it was the
perfect<00:04:32.040> amount<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.340> time<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:33.060> rice<00:04:33.210> is

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
perfect amount of time the rice is

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.670 
perfect amount of time the rice is
cooked<00:04:33.540> perfectly<00:04:34.970> yeah<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.390> yeah<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.020> think<00:04:37.500> it

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
cooked perfectly yeah so yeah I think it

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.060 
cooked perfectly yeah so yeah I think it
might<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:37.830> depend<00:04:38.310> on<00:04:39.170> your<00:04:40.170> time<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.950> might

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
might just depend on your time it might

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.160 
might just depend on your time it might
depend<00:04:41.340> on<00:04:41.460> your<00:04:41.700> thermos<00:04:42.180> if<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:43.020> have<00:04:43.110> an

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
depend on your thermos if you have an

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.450 
depend on your thermos if you have an
older<00:04:43.440> thermos<00:04:43.740> might<00:04:43.920> take<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.100> little<00:04:44.280> longer

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
older thermos might take a little longer

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.800 
older thermos might take a little longer
if<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.820> have<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:45.000> newer<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.390> that<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.690> know

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
working properly and stuff etc it may

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.210 
working properly and stuff etc it may
take<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:48.930> short<00:04:49.200> amount<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.440> time<00:04:49.500> so<00:04:49.800> it

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
take a short amount of time so it

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.220
