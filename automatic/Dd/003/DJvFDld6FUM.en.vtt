00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
developer kit 2 which will arrive at my

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.840 
developer kit 2 which will arrive at my
house<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.350> July<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.160> I'm<00:00:35.219> excited<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.670> take<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
house in July so I'm excited to take a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
house in July so I'm excited to take a
look<00:00:36.030> at<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.020> addition<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.500> think

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
look at that then in addition I think

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.290 
look at that then in addition I think
the<00:00:37.829> iphone<00:00:38.160> 6<00:00:38.460> could<00:00:38.670> make<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> positive

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the iphone 6 could make a positive

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810 
the iphone 6 could make a positive
change<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.899> apple<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> phone<00:00:41.370> market<00:00:41.730> at

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
change for apple in the phone market at

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.069 
change for apple in the phone market at
least<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.420> been<00:00:42.629> lagging

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
least because they have been lagging

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
least because they have been lagging
behind<00:00:43.170> quite<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> bit<00:00:43.829> recently<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.550> then

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
behind quite a bit recently and then

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540 
behind quite a bit recently and then
also<00:00:45.270> i<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.289> 4k<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> become

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
also i think that 4k is going to become

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.770 
also i think that 4k is going to become
more<00:00:47.730> affordable<00:00:48.180> throughout<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> year<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
more affordable throughout the year and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420 
more affordable throughout the year and
I'm<00:00:48.870> excited<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.379> what<00:00:49.680> options<00:00:49.890> come<00:00:50.280> out

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I'm excited to see what options come out

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.090 
I'm excited to see what options come out
of<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> insane<00:00:51.510> Jake<00:00:51.840> asks<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
of that insane Jake asks what do you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
of that insane Jake asks what do you
feel<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.309> better<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.850> FPS<00:00:54.270> gaming<00:00:54.539> triple

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
feel is better for FPS gaming triple

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
feel is better for FPS gaming triple
surround<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> single<00:00:56.309> high-resolution

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
surround or a single high-resolution

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.700
