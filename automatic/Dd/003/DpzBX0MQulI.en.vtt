00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.309
 Welcome to the film analysis 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.440
 today with the fantastic world of oz 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.590
 started by director sam raimi in 1939 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.230
 the movie of the magicians of oz with judy 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 garland is the hit somebody rainbow 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.269
 probably not forgotten yet in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.939
 the new house movie will not work at all 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.340
 more singing and dancing 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.290
 it's not a remake either, it's one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.950
 Prequel is told the prehistory 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 like the wizard of oz came to from 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.180
 Already in the film of 39 we had 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.460
 learn that he is actually one 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 Fairs magician is we see there 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 how an authority is unmasked 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.399
 magician with a bad voice 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.920
 speaks and subjugates the whole people 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.440
 this is really a little guy 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.379
 with a microphone system we see here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.500
 all the ridiculousness of authority 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.990
 The movie now goes the other way 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.270
 he shows how to make such a ridiculous 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.760
 authority can enthrone 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.890
 but he does that relatively unreflected 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.470
 and I believe that the wizard of oz 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.340
 perfect in our post democratic 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.340
 time fits 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 The film begins in 1905 in Kansas 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.570
 played by james franco is a pity 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.210
 Wizard then with a tether balloon 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.280
 flees into a cyclone device and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 then in the magical world from 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 Arrives there expect three witches 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.090
 Two evil witches played by Rachel 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.909
 weisz and mila kunis and a good witch 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.860
 played by michael williams the witches 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.080
 Of course, he does not know that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.340
 really prophesied magician is 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.770
 but its really just a trick 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.569
 but they think he is quite useful 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.850
 and he always says I am 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.409
 but actually only a charlatan 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 but he also wants that big one 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.819
 assets which it is promised there 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 and he just leaves it that way 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.380
 to do with you and the good witch says 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.299
 then I admit that you do not 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.200
 Wizards are you are selfish 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.120
 braggart 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.950
 but if they believe in you if that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.780
 That's good, folks believe in you 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.730
 in bad times they need 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.170
 someone like that man and on she says 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.480
 then afterwards in a speech 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.510
 we are a mystery people and the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.530
 Wizard leads us 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.390
 it should not be surprising that 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.640
 this movie just now 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.320
 comes out with the electoral success for 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.019
 silvio berlusconi 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.660
 because this movie actually propagates 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.880
 such a berlusconi shaped one 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.459
 a clown fools a charlatan 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.150
 because only a few tricks available 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.410
 But it still has a whole people 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.489
 can manipulate and on his side 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.769
 can pull 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.269
 It also makes a speech and says so 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.310
 This is not about knowledge and so on 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.620
 we have to believe firmly 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.109
 It is clear that one thing is clear here 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.269
 the mighty witches also the good 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.549
 witch and made not the national 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.769
 but they want to represent 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.769
 especially to represent themselves 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.870
 The perfidious thing about this movie is that 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.330
 people actually have no choice 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.420
 either the people are dominated by 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.810
 evil witches or it has to be this 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.160
 to give charlatan a home 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.080
 We also had this constellation 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.870
 already in kung fu panda 2 was at that time 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.210
 I am very critical of this idea 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.920
 kung fu panda is actually berlusconi 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.620
 but I think you can do that directly too 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.670
 back to the wizard of oz here 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.340
 transfer 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.080
 but there is a little innovation and 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.660
 that should make us listen 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.620
 because on the one hand we have the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.420
 charlatan 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.580
 but this charlatan then says 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.980
 suddenly i may not be the one 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.620
 Wizard but maybe I am the one 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.520
 you need and then shows whether as 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.420
 official 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.520
 we have an interesting one here 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.650
 Coupling if we look at the euro rescue 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.450
 looked at and how new president in 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.850
 the bankrupt states will be installed 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.580
 then it's about any clowns 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.800
 replace and use functionaries 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.810
 for us, both are true, we have 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.420
 here a charlatan and a 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.060
 working in a personal union then 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.280
 wear and, of course, at the end of success 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.530
 We could see that here 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.280
 program how do I save a country from the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.530
 bankrupt 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.020
 we should not go to the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.970
 usual fanatics expire because he 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.500
 uses a special trick he speaks 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.080
 from Edison and says we have to 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.530
 Actually, this is what a cinema has to do 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.510
 here 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.790
 then there is a smoke cloud and that 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.740
 face of oz is projected and that 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.770
 is so scary for everybody because 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.690
 you do not even know the cinema at all 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.120
 so then everyone will listen to him and also 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.080
 The evil witches suddenly get scared 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.610
 we should not be in this 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.560
 boomings expire without it 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.229
 a wonderful tribute to the beginnings 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.870
 the film is beautiful to see like the pictures 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.550
 In truth, it will be here to learn to walk 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.620
 to a media mogul as well 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.510
 berlusconi yes there almost the entire 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.150
 Italian television in his hand 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.300
 so is also from such a media 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.030
 mogul with monstrous makes the truth 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.460
 about the fantastic world of oz 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.500
 is this manipulation of the 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.990
 First quality is operated 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.940
 you need the parallel to berlusconi 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.100
 not large Rhine to read are 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.600
 abundantly clear 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.880
 in front of the people and that's it 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.130
 interesting when everything turns to 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.170
 Good turned but still that is 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.810
 mystery of the true origin of oz 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.570
 The people should continue to be thin 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.240
 stay away from it and the good witch 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.460
 in other words, that can govern 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.460
 People should look but not see
