00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.820
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.230
 a new minecraft motto trial of 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.600
 Today I introduce you to them 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.760
 Modification means to have it here 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.380
 already prepared a small world and 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.289
 yes, some things are a pun 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.560
 minecraft and chase so that's chess 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.480
 had been very difficult but I had 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.249
 It did not last long around here, they tell 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.679
 but what is that you are now see here 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.269
 even in person such a magic board 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.360
 selected and if I now 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.630
 right click make then builds 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.760
 checkerboard on each with 16 or 1 2 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.900
 3 4 5 6 7 8 years with 16 each 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.130
 figures on each side I hope you 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.140
 Everyone knows how chick is that is one 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.430
 basic requirement for this game because 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.960
 if not then you have to look around 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.660
 regulate to adopt all 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.250
 Modification is actually more for than 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.840
 multiplayer suitable so what, of course 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.460
 Much funnier is when one against 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.720
 one plays in that sense in this sense 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.760
 The condition does not matter now 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.990
 have a lot of sense right around you have hopefully 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 already seen how to do that 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.700
 crafted there you need first you have to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.750
 first of all, these tribal powers 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.670
 with a lot of doller you have grad 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.409
 seen on the top right and then it 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.710
 sometimes this whole field is needed 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.180
 these two ps move once too 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.460
 white or black with white granite 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.170
 bite objects move with the black 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.659
 The black sounds kind of logical 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.180
 I know I'm going to be cool 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.790
 is it here in creative mode with it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.590
 I can fly around a bit and 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.030
 how is it going now so you can 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.950
 on the one hand, such a chessboard 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.690
 super powers or over deadline 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.000
 lead time or find one finds 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.549
 this also keeps it under the earth 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.870
 and then to play so to speak against 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.400
 You can always have this computer 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.260
 have things with you when you do that 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.760
 want because you do not have this piste then 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.229
 is but then you can not namely 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.360
 In any case, you are missing 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.400
 underground so in dungeons you can find 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.720
 If you laugh the chess boards then plays 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.540
 you can against this computer and if 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.729
 You lose one chance happens 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.250
 selected one of four swim 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.780
 things when you win transforms 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.240
 the opponent for king in a box with 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.310
 very many valuable than usual, it is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.680
 actually very cool and therefore makes 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.229
 but that's the only way to be here 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.280
 such a shadow then you can 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.580
 play alternately white and black 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.890
 but therefore allowed 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.990
 Well, I think that we are going to that 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.760
 so if I'm with the white now 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.620
 powder here is an object from pictures 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 shown here with green where I go 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.960
 I can move right click 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.590
 I can rest here now 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.900
 click on it 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.960
 and now there is moving building down here 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.400
 It is exactly as here 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.190
 indicated abcdefg and 12 34 need 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.270
 yes so with the black has 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.740
 of course fast opponents this 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.450
 You can get black kÃ¤ssbohrer here now 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.590
 the black figures are moving station 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.400
 that probably reminds me now 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.810
 bad a bit at harry potter 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.650
 flash you saw the first part 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.900
 it was also on the side 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.240
 described how then the figure and 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.340
 destroy each other and became the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.690
 figure just killed when you are 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.940
 now no longer has to play and 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.350
 I think oh do not come from realistic 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.270
 the black dress was lost here 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.220
 On losing then you have to shift the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.860
 press right mouse button and also the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.420
 the queen was damned and then on the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.760
 king must be right on the king 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.140
 of animals study and countries so 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.910
 are you going to go now ? 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.250
 you can do that again and shift 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.500
 press reski and now it is white here 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.430
 won and all the characters die 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.110
 successively 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.330
 yes that was it already in the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.070
 Rough and whole of the migration, too 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.860
 everything is down here sadly 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.090
 sad but I was definitely 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.560
 funny and if you try now you 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.680
 the jeans a connected from 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.000
 if you do not find or get it 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.030
 so therefore it makes just her 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.670
 start a new game at the whole 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.330
 collecting experience points that would be good 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.650
 that was actually it from the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.390
 modification I hope you very much 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.030
 fun here with player or against the ki 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.230
 have the dungeons 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.180
 that was all that one can say 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.080
 installation I show you now and 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.209
 schmidt bass until easy on the desktop 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.970
 business during the installation of mainz 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.120
 arrived and that is quite fix as well 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.569
 actually always so please 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.220
 on percent dpa tmn sign like 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.239
 here in the dolls force folder into it 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.590
 here, take a tie and public 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.420
 minecraft with a relaxation program 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.019
 esslingress marashi taking her child 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.209
 because I love you 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.379
 Now we go to the miniature Michael 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.709
 timms game organic even need 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.609
 Not much money on minecraft going on loud 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.190
 link is of course in the description 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.380
 and now we pull all folders first 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.660
 and generally files here in the sharp 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.720
 of minecraft into it is like that 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.580
 the meters away where is there he is so with 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.139
 the partner is solved close now 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.389
 we both go back in now again 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.160
 the directory of minecraft here 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.410
 back to minecraft and open up 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.550
 the folder mods so I would before 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.020
 start the game again to watch 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.090
 whether minecraft for job that worked out all right 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.260
 but it is not compulsory now 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.970
 necessary as far as I know but me 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.470
 would still make so play starts 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.930
 then watch if it works 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.690
 now closed here the mainz 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.729
 just folder that packed ups that 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.380
 packed archive as well as it's her inside 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.169
 pull as it was already done 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.970
 so there goes the installation 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.110
 of manchester totally simple if the 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.419
 items still want to install that comes 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.970
 also into the minecraft and me 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.430
 Would say that was fun for people 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.639
 with the relegations and until the next 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.639
 times
