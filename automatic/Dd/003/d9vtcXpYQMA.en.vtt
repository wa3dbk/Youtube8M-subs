00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 well this is going to be the tutorial of how 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.519
 configure the pp sp for what they are 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.620
 games we are mainly going to set up 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.710
 some games good first 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.760
 we have a fallen dragon ball symbol 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.050
 we are going to configure 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.050
 and ended at 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.970
 but we go on the backward we 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.529
 we go where it says game settings and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.960
 these are the configurations that 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.280
 we must have 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.180
 as you see here in mode we put it without 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.000
 rendering in portbou fer 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 then in jumping frames we are going to put a 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.109
 picture 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.440
 in the center of automatic frames 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:50.550
 none informal fat in forcing the most 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.559
 60 frames either no 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.480
 in the speed of alternatiba you 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.640
 we put unlimited 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.550
 now here in this part of here where 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.089
 it says adjust screen we select it 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.350
 small screen not in immersed mode 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.810
 it will also be selected 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.380
 in the mapping not in the transformation 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.380
 by hardware 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.700
 if we select it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.320
 in the cache to see if not the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.979
 we select out tells you this cache 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.760
 of texture vertex a lazy if not 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.670
 we select 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.940
 we keep going down and this we have to 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.480
 have the level of automatic scaling 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.610
 type of scaling xb recipe 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.990
 the sub-section is tropics we deactivate 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 without textures too 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.079
 then we are going to be part of here that 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.890
 says about the sound that the child 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.890
 we leave as they are 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.160
 no other nothing else in the system this is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.160
 what we have to have 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.470
 in quick memory that is unstable goes 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.030
 to be selected in cpu 0 this 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.610
 rotation of the screen that is 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.220
 horizontal updates if not 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.590
 we select 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.670
 and activate tricks per fence if it's 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.540
 we have a psp model chat that's 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.879
 everything they have to have 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.360
 then we go back and we'll see that 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.360
 the game 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.800
 good as regards the game of tekken will give 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:42.060
 your reaction and also the configuration 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.060
 let's see it right now 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.310
 let's try first on the graphs 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.310
 to see how it is 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.310
 as we see there are good graphics almost not 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.310
 there is a lot of work 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.690
 the graphics are very good 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.080
 once tested we go back we go where 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.810
 says game settings and this is going to be 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.080
 what they will have to select in the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.060
 way is going to be without made without 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.580
 made by going to jump box is 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.610
 one in sant area of ​​automatic pictures 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.350
 also not selected the speed 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.959
 alternative is going to be limited 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.140
 we select adjust screen mode 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:51.100
 immersed and here transformation by 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.480
 hardware of this vertex cache that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.860
 the cache is not selected 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.830
 textures fast vague and 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.750
 we select and this also level of 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.790
 automatic scaling 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.800
 the filter for the texture filter 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.490
 it's also going to be this is going to be 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.490
 automatic 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.560
 good nothing more almost 6 in the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.570
 configuration that we did before for what 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.100
 that the dragon ball can use 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.610
 almost all the dragonballs that there are for 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.780
 psp that does not vary much this base this is 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.780
 the setting for the king 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.949
 fast movistar 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.620
 well that is in itself the configuration that 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.070
 did almost for all the games that they 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.980
 I showed in the river you can also 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.920
 use it almost with them we do not have any 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.900
 problem in terms of the frames 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.030
 the configuration we made with the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.030
 dragon ball for all
