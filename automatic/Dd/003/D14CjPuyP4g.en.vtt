this<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.620> actually<00:02:52.040> my<00:02:52.220> trick<00:02:52.550> for<00:02:53.000> those<00:02:53.270> who

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
this is actually my trick for those who

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.060 
this is actually my trick for those who
don't<00:02:53.720> know<00:02:53.750> how<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.990> do<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> cat<00:02:54.470> eye<00:02:54.500> properly

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
don't know how to do a cat eye properly

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.500 
don't know how to do a cat eye properly
you<00:02:55.520> can<00:02:55.640> always<00:02:55.760> start<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.330> bottom

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
you can always start with the bottom

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.050 
you can always start with the bottom
line<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.140> then<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.770> can<00:02:57.920> always<00:02:58.100> just<00:02:58.250> join

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
line and then you can always just join

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.910 
line and then you can always just join
it<00:02:59.210> with<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.390> top<00:02:59.630> line<00:02:59.870> which<00:03:00.080> makes<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.620> much

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
it with a top line which makes it much

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.340 
it with a top line which makes it much
more<00:03:01.190> easier<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.210> do<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.480> quite<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> thick<00:03:03.110> line

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
more easier so I do a quite a thick line

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.140 
more easier so I do a quite a thick line
because<00:03:03.710> I<00:03:03.920> am<00:03:04.010> going<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.310> go<00:03:04.430> over<00:03:04.459> with<00:03:04.940> eyes

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
because I am going to go over with eyes

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.350 
because I am going to go over with eyes

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
now using the crease color which is a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.080 
now using the crease color which is a
darkest<00:03:13.130> color<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.490> palette<00:03:13.580> I'm<00:03:14.060> going

Pat that color over the eyeliner this
not<00:03:18.860> only<00:03:19.010> will<00:03:19.340> prevent<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.880> from<00:03:19.910> creasing

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
not only will prevent it from creasing

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.449 
not only will prevent it from creasing
but<00:03:20.690> also<00:03:20.840> intensify<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.620> eye<00:03:21.800> color<00:03:22.250> the

think they also might have other colors
