00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.040

 Why do not you come with me? 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.530
 Good people, let's start with the eyes. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.360
 so I already left the ready sauce is okay k 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.129
 to accelerate more wine 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 So you're wearing a concealer all over the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.930
 eyelid as usual you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.449
 do this to standardize the color I go 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.530
 nominate eyebrow with a tender tone 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.530
 with sparkling milk in natura that I love 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 now I came with my gel eyeliner 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.200
 but you can in any shadow base 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 black pencil game anyway you have me 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 I'll apply it all over the eyelid. 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.450
 even a little with cases is a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.450
 a little bit 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.790
 now with this pin point brush more 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.149
 I'll just give you a 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 I 'm sorry, excuse me for not staying 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.570
 nothing much marked 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.759
 then I came with this black pigment 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
 It's beautiful, it 's dairo I do not know if it's for 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.509
 sell yet but can be our mayor 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 if you have not I liked this segment 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.549
 because you're shining so we will 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.689
 apply throughout this base of shadows 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.689
 depositing only 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.530
 now it 's to build the call I came 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.200
 with a brown brown shadow on the brush of 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.080
 even he is harder and 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.970
 we will apply in the whole ball is 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.530
 one thing to understand is that because of this 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.780
 ax is perfect you have to do 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.430
 calmly you know you have to have 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.950
 Quite patience, so I'm doing 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.920
 with enough calm patience 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.390
 To build your beloved few and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.840
 We'll see later with this brush. 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.910
 cuddly, this chubby cigarette is going 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.860
 blurring the edges you actually go 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.000
 building layers then comes first 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.709
 with that chubby 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.570
 I'll come back with that harder one later. 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.740
 Finally I'm going to do this to my stomach. 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.740
 it's perfect 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.370
 I used to go there pretty much afterwards 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.739
 come clean under the eyes with the 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.959
 obeyed linense that fell on the guinea 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.959
 and I will reapply the base 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.400
 to be part of the lower eye is 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.400
 very simple I'll just apply the pencil 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 eye rent the water line I opted for 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.690
 not apply indoors because I found that 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 I was going to close my eye a lot and then 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.650
 People are still felipe michel durinho and à 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.920
 brown shadow fading very well simple 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.980
 It's just there, paste the false eyelashes and you 're 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.130
 first aid for dark circles and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.780
 pass a lot of mascara 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:41.730
 paste my spaces into the powder and paste the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:44.130
 simple and makeup was well 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840
 simple and easy of the mouth I opted for 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.120
 put a rosy lipstick but you can 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.260
 put your favorite color lipstick I 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.260
 I'll leave the name there on the blog. 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.370
 I just filmed that one of a mistake in the 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.130
 my video do not know why I do not 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.930
 I gotta put it on for you guys, but I did. 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.750
 curls well stripped and I will record a 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.640
 Separate video, just about that, are you guys? 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.640
 and now making the curls just above the 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.680
 hair to create more air 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.750
 stripped I did not want anything much 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.280
 straight - laced ballad that I think has to be 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.560
 something more rebellious 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.560
 I do not know, my opinion. 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.940
 I made three looks for you the first 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.300
 sung using so it's like a sweatshirt 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.400
 all windbreaker sequins him it's bad luck I 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.560
 I've never used people I confess to you but 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.990
 I found it very beautiful and I think he is 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.250
 super ballad you can finally put 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.440
 power of the skirt 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.330
 but he's kind of the star of the look 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.840
 know I think it looks pretty cool too 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.460
 funny 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.860
 I decided not to put on accessories because 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.970
 How do I look bright? 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.970
 that was not going to stay cool 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.150
 the second look I did something simpler 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.970
 so for the more discreet girls 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.470
 then this light croft and these areas 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.300
 there are the renner antão out well 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.150
 black and white printed I put the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.289
 jumping the foot high in black that I 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.210
 I think it looks super cute and it did not stop 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.780
 that a bracelet also a well cast 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.780
 beautiful 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:48.550
 but really I did something more like this 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:51.130
 Basic is last look is my favorite 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.650
 so I'm using is a father and also in the 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.620
 blouse is a crop- type crop top 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.080
 This short out, I think he's beautiful. 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.750
 he is one of my favorite parts of the 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.580
 wardrobe and switch thread I solved 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.889
 put on this pink blazer to give a 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.380
 glad in the look I cultivated with the same 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.699
 I play and this was definitely mine. 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.699
 even if you prefer 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.910
 with girls now I'll spend the 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.140
 powerful perfume today I 'm the one I chose 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:32.900
 Mine with the eller family. 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.460
 almost 6 lived almost my hand 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.200
 people I chose my black clash 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.030
 because I do not know the ballad has no goals 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.500
 loading there money wallets with 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:50.810
 so I think it's important to take a 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:52.580
 thing is these people then this is it people if 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.980
 Did you like the video clip I liked and? 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.680
 under the channel sign 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.800
 open that is the middle of the 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.010
 instagram and no boss who is to send 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.200
 I loved it and the blog will also have photos of 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.970
 more details given what I used is going 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.760
 have the name of all the products there in the 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.710
 blog the name of other clothes and get me 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.680
 asks that psd does not want it 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:19.990
 finally not so fond of the stadium there 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.990
 or a kiss for you tea
