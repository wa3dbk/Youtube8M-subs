00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that we could open doors and maybe be

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.090 
that we could open doors and maybe be
there<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.270> day<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:11.000> think<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:13.680> at<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
there one day and I think that at that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.359 
there one day and I think that at that
time<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.820> actually<00:01:15.770> was<00:01:16.770> already<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
time I actually was already in the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
time I actually was already in the
rhythm<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.880> competition<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.869> long<00:01:19.020> time

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
rhythm of competition for a long time

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.310 
rhythm of competition for a long time
already<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> amateur<00:01:20.580> time<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.320> I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
already but in the amateur time and I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.980 
already but in the amateur time and I
think<00:01:22.680> he<00:01:22.890> he's<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.210> opened<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
think he he's the one that opened the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.590 
think he he's the one that opened the
first<00:01:25.170> door<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.950> Fabio<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.000> live

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
first door with Fabio and that time live

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.530 
first door with Fabio and that time live
in<00:01:27.780> Fargo<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:29.130> started<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.759> sort<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
in Fargo then they started to sort of a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.990 
in Fargo then they started to sort of a
give<00:01:30.720> us<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.079> opportunity<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.729> believe<00:01:32.729> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
