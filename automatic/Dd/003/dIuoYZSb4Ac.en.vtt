00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.329
 in the house itself and in any 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 season of the year a little bit of 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:30.689
 time per day it takes a little bit of sun 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.509
 land a few bags and patience for 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.969

 disposable bottle of soda 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.270
 father 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.450
 a potato that has barely a month 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.590
 we sow it directly in the bottle 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.960
 and of course it's going to pay off 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.530
 in two or three months we are going to eat 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.650
 Organic potatoes raised in a bottle 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.710
 disposable with a little sun can 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.590
 have organic potatoes but of course 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.210
 you prefer the large potatoes the normal ones 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.259
 they have to plant the ones in a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.730
 container more this coming here is 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.360

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.320
 Look what quality leaves and leave it 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.190
 well these leaves that you see here were 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.020
 Planted in a bag 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.020
 a bag that finishes in my hand 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.320
 it's only about 30 centimeters by 30 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.840
 and in that bag if we are going to eat potatoes 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.940
 of normal size but with a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.860
 difference that is going to be dad 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.490
 organic 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.869
 the potato there we are seeing crisis and they 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.550
 note that we plant a silver and from there 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.390
 the plant emerges 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.490
 then he has to give flowers 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.960
 and they are beautiful flowers that also have 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.950
 ornamental value 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.830
 so ladies and gentlemen 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.540

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.700
 land a bag 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.549

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.549
