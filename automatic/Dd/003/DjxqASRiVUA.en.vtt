goddamn lead but I think there's a lot

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.090 
goddamn lead but I think there's a lot
of<00:05:47.390> unknowns<00:05:47.870> when<00:05:48.140> it<00:05:48.230> comes<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.650> Xbox

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
of unknowns when it comes to the Xbox

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.820 
of unknowns when it comes to the Xbox
because<00:05:49.670> it's<00:05:49.970> created<00:05:50.420> a<00:05:50.540> mystery<00:05:51.290> landscape

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
because it's created a mystery landscape

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.530 
because it's created a mystery landscape
and<00:05:52.070> i<00:05:52.130> think<00:05:52.400> that<00:05:52.610> there's<00:05:52.880> going<00:05:53.090> to<00:05:53.150> be<00:05:53.180> new

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
and i think that there's going to be new

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.510 
and i think that there's going to be new
and<00:05:53.810> improved<00:05:54.260> shit<00:05:54.620> that's<00:05:55.130> going<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.340> come
