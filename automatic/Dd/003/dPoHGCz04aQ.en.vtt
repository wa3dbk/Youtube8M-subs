00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
okay now I'm thinking oh sorry I'm i do

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.040 
okay now I'm thinking oh sorry I'm i do
not<00:01:42.740> know<00:01:42.920> right<00:01:43.130> now<00:01:43.479> i'll<00:01:44.479> find<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.900> out

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050

later though but i'm thinking if you
update<00:01:48.040> when<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.130> jailbreak<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.640> available

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
update when the jailbreak is available

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.550 
update when the jailbreak is available
it's<00:01:50.180> basically<00:01:50.659> going<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.960> reset<00:01:51.530> your

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
it's basically going to reset your

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.640 
it's basically going to reset your
entire<00:01:52.010> ipod<00:01:52.430> where<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.890> thought<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.250> know

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
entire ipod where I thought you know

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
we have your device so that even though

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.300 
we have your device so that even though
it<00:02:00.270> could<00:02:00.600> still<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.900> jailbroken<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.830> if<00:02:02.160> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it could still be jailbroken all if you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.890 
it could still be jailbroken all if you
had<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> bunch<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.940> jail<00:02:03.150> broken<00:02:03.480> stuff<00:02:03.750> on
