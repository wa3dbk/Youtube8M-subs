00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello dear swami friends, Morocco 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.660
 7 today i would like to show you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.480
 great fight on Fri-sau level 10 object 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.800
 263 on the map the sacred valley and so 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.289
 the player immediately decides to go to the gorge and 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.199
 here of course very often opponents 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.050
 try to go top and shoot and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.689
 that's what happens at the beginning well of course i 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.349
 lt-shka too framed unless of course her 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.750
 immediately takes the same here is the E50m 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.820
 and there may be problems with it 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.239
 because he took more opinion 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 advantageous position for himself and he is on top 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.010
 down may be easier to punch the object 263 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.710
 and plus nld is not very good from here 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 in sight but in principle possible under 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.180
 disassemble the e-50 though it is already the second time 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.059
 breaks through 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.359
 our pawn and also breaks the cannon 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.989
 not less than 263 could very well 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.040
 to potalk then by the tube and he's pretty 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:11.760
 disassembled e50m go out and m x 50 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.810
 120 his control over allies and french 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.090
 very quickly discharges its drum and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.470
 now he is almost completely defenseless 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.509
 of course you can go and calm him 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.640
 destroy that's what he expected 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.770
 totally incomprehensible to leave 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.110
 shoot your drum and then 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.710
 merge i think this is some kind of tactic 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.290
 completely useless need at least 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.229
 take place for retreat well maybe 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.000
 to be a Frenchman hoping that his 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.700
 cover allies and that's it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.850
 his allies come here e100 but 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.720
 naturally he is here doomed him here with 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.590
 from different sides begins to disassemble the object 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.890
 263 again 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.649
 huddles does he of course not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.710
 just because he is trying to substitute the cabin 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.950
 under a big slope thereby the ultimate 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.780
 with the current will be harder to punch and so 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.879
 way you can very well them 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.269
 caulk damage on this Fri 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:16.019
 if not even shot for some reason and of course 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.709
 then it all sorted out the crowd 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.430
 object 263 it is going its base there already 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.840
 just arrived opponents who 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.510
 fights with allies at this 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 moment and of course you need on your 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.810
 allies how to help and task base 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.690
 the same on this flank already seems to be all 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.440
 calm and there it remains only to finish 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.060
 a couple of opponents and an object 263 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.519
 begins to disassemble the rear t30. 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.620
 turns on his tower not immediately 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.819
 shoots her pretty oblique 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.930
 gun and manage to disassemble it without loss 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:01.019
 on the left there are two more enemies out of 8 and 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.130
 amx-13 75 why not try them 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.470
 pick some more podamazhit and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.769
 get another frag which is superfluous 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:15.000
 never happens and manages to pick up 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.639
 the object of 8 as they say who managed that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.920
 and ate but also here a and max trying 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.389
 run away 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.810
 the object is again trying to destroy it 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:27.470
 to get another frag and he 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.930
 it turns out to do it but then he 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.680
 arrives from Fri-shki vaffcentura on for 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.849
 4 who were hiding somewhere else 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.220
 end of the map of the bushes nastraivaet and 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.620
 Of course it's better not to be shot 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.940
 fall after all too she much 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.690
 Damazhit and there is not much left though 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.180
 the object of the 263 stage the sole of which even 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.930
 with so many hpe it will still help 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.170
 survive for a very long time due to its 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.690
 booking and then manage to pick e75 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.790
 also arrived here yet 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.010
 IS-7 and so far our hero is distracted 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.290
 starts it 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.930
 shoot IS-7 here after all 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.080
 distracted by our support starts 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.620
 her you follow player hides again 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.950
 Nld and shows the cabin he does everything 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.680
 quite right so you can 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.280
 do a good deal of damage on this birdie 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.920
 the main thing is not to substitute nld on it then 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.490
 In principle, everything will be fine and under 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.960
 such an angle exact 7 will not be able to pierce 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.950
 he shoots again 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.770
 Of course the player does not damage it already 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.730
 pretty disassembled well and then drive up 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.400
 ally distracts attention and 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.100
 the object to pick up IS-7 the player decides 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.530
 wait a bit right away I leave 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.720
 to open space basically this 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.630
 true because no one knows where else 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.400
 is TCP and she could shoot off 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.210
 on the remaining light 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.150
 well and then the player goes on the attack on the other 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.690
 flank lit up in the E100 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.050
 and he begins to disassemble there remaining 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.020
 living allies already st-1 he could 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.860
 disassemble waffentrager 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.100
 pz 4 player shoots misses she 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.890
 she damages a high-explosive shot 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.010
 Of course shells caused a little damage 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.140
 nevertheless it is still dangerous although i 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.669
 would be in place boffin and calm there 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.910
 I took the shot from one shot took 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.550
 263 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.010
 the player begins to understand with the mafs in 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.820
 auto to keep shooting high-explosive 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.530
 projectile deals 188 damage in principle 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.200
 if she is still shooting 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.600
 mine may then finish off the object but she 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.720
 why are you shooting armor-piercing this time 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.080
 and does not break through and the player and and calmly 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.540
 gets in principle waffle got 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.860
 certainly not the most skill bathroom she could 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.740
 calm drink 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.419
 nld 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:17.050
 and pick up object 263 leaves here 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:20.199
 waffenturger rides he shoots he smears and 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.410
 farther he you holding it our hero 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:26.830
 board snaps off again shoots not 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:30.729
 breaks and further enemy Fri-shka 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.919
 just falls off the mountain and dies sooner 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.130
 she ran out of shells 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:41.130
 So look at the results of the main 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:45.849
 caliber warrior steel wall spartan 10 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:48.759
 1998 damage and 6 frags to the enemy team 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:51.970
 best played waffentrager pz 4 and 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:54.659
 also played well vaffenturu E100 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:07:00.840
 true at the end both players merged 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:07:02.020
 natankoval player 4120 damage and got 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.050
