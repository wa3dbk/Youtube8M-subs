will plug right in here and then you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.399 
will plug right in here and then you
will<00:01:34.500> put<00:01:34.530> them<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.579> same<00:01:35.939> order<00:01:36.360> over<00:01:37.110> in

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
will put them in the same order over in

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
will put them in the same order over in
your<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.310> guess<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> backwards<00:01:39.240> order

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
your or I guess that's a backwards order

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.590 
your or I guess that's a backwards order
over<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:41.090> HDTV<00:01:42.090> these<00:01:42.360> should<00:01:42.570> be

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
over in your HDTV these should be

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780 
over in your HDTV these should be
color-coded<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> will<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.549> where<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
color-coded so you will know where to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.749 
color-coded so you will know where to
put<00:01:44.939> them<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.829> then<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.220> cables<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
put them and then the cables on the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.359 
put them and then the cables on the
bottom<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.890> component<00:01:49.890> cables<00:01:50.189> from<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
bottom are the component cables from the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
xbox on your component cable you should

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.880 
xbox on your component cable you should
have<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.430> splitter<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.420> goes<00:01:54.689> off<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.680> right

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
have a splitter it goes off on the right

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.630 
have a splitter it goes off on the right
there<00:01:56.610> should<00:01:56.820> be<00:01:56.939> three<00:01:57.899> cables<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.710> yellow<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
there should be three cables a yellow a
