00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
the racing but it gets in the way of me

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.690 
the racing but it gets in the way of me
getting<00:02:13.600> enough<00:02:14.020> seed<00:02:14.260> time<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.770> be<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.190> faster

driver and there is the rub I have to
focus<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:20.020> hundred<00:02:20.290> percent<00:02:20.380> on<00:02:20.650> my<00:02:20.709> racing<00:02:20.920> I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
focus a hundred percent on my racing I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.500 
focus a hundred percent on my racing I
just<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.640> way<00:02:21.730> my<00:02:21.880> brain<00:02:22.090> works

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
just it's the way my brain works

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.729 
just it's the way my brain works
you<00:02:22.690> know<00:02:22.780> Patrick's<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.350> different

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
you know Patrick's in a different

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.610 
you know Patrick's in a different
position<00:02:24.239> but<00:02:25.239> still<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.989> level<00:02:26.290> of

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
position but still that level of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.440 
position but still that level of
flipping<00:02:27.040> disciplines<00:02:27.640> back<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.120> forwards

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
flipping disciplines back and forwards

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.120 
flipping disciplines back and forwards
that<00:02:28.840> makes<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.170> more<00:02:29.380> difficult<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:29.920> him

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that makes it more difficult for him

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.979 
that makes it more difficult for him
what<00:02:30.340> he's<00:02:30.459> doing<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.000> know<00:02:31.120> he's<00:02:31.690> kind<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.900> I

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
what he's doing you know he's kind of I

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:32.970 
what he's doing you know he's kind of I
guess<00:02:32.140> he's<00:02:32.260> drinking<00:02:32.590> out<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.770> fire<00:02:32.950> hose

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
guess he's drinking out of a fire hose

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.560 
guess he's drinking out of a fire hose
in<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.340> lot<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.489> ways<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:33.970> all<00:02:34.150> coming<00:02:34.180> at

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
in a lot of ways is this all coming at

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.090 
in a lot of ways is this all coming at
once<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.020> that's<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.440> blessing<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:35.980> it's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
once and that's the blessing but it's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.160 
once and that's the blessing but it's
also<00:02:36.220> very<00:02:36.340> difficult<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.030> magic<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.810> deal

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
also very difficult of the magic to deal

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.860 
also very difficult of the magic to deal
