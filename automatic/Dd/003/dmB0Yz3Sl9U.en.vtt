robert<00:01:45.980> garcia<00:01:46.190> boxing<00:01:46.760> academy<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.870> think

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
robert garcia boxing academy and I think

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.780 
robert garcia boxing academy and I think
that'll<00:01:48.410> only<00:01:48.970> proved<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.180> benefit<00:01:50.900> Chino<00:01:51.320> and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
that'll only proved to benefit Chino and

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.360 
that'll only proved to benefit Chino and
I<00:01:52.790> think<00:01:53.000> what<00:01:53.150> she<00:01:53.330> know<00:01:53.450> needs<00:01:53.660> to<00:01:53.840> do<00:01:54.220> he<00:01:55.220> has

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
I think what she know needs to do he has

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.790 
I think what she know needs to do he has
to<00:01:55.520> use<00:01:55.580> his<00:01:55.700> jab<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.690> set<00:01:57.230> up<00:01:57.350> his<00:01:57.470> shots

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
to use his jab to set up his shots

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.160 
to use his jab to set up his shots
attack<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.790> body<00:01:59.030> pin<00:01:59.510> Mayweather<00:01:59.900> on<00:02:00.080> the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
ropes basically do everything that he

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.670

really<00:02:19.879> close<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> show<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.530> impressive

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
really close a show in impressive

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.699 
really close a show in impressive
fashion<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:23.030> win<00:02:23.209> any<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.599> those<00:02:23.780> last<00:02:24.110> rounds

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
fashion to win any of those last rounds

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.100 
fashion to win any of those last rounds
those<00:02:24.980> are<00:02:25.129> always<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.640> very<00:02:25.910> decisive<00:02:26.629> rounds

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
those are always a very decisive rounds

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.440

in<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.650> close<00:02:27.860> fight<00:02:28.129> so<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:28.880> think<00:02:29.030> that's<00:02:29.269> what

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
in a close fight so I think that's what

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.180 
in a close fight so I think that's what
he<00:02:29.510> needs<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:29.989> if<00:02:30.170> he<00:02:30.349> has<00:02:30.530> any<00:02:30.739> chance<00:02:30.830> at

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
he needs to do if he has any chance at

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.670 
he needs to do if he has any chance at
Victory<00:02:31.610> again<00:02:32.239> if<00:02:32.420> he<00:02:32.540> cannot<00:02:32.900> hurt<00:02:33.170> Floyd

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
Victory again if he cannot hurt Floyd

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.550 
Victory again if he cannot hurt Floyd

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
Mayweather on the flip side Mayweather

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.380 
Mayweather on the flip side Mayweather
appears<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.280> more<00:02:37.489> focused<00:02:37.760> even<00:02:38.120> though

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
appears to be more focused even though

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.960 
appears to be more focused even though
he's<00:02:38.599> had<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:39.560> course<00:02:40.099> out<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.489> ring

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
he's had of course out of ring

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.820 
he's had of course out of ring
distractions<00:02:41.780> but<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.379> comes<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.709> the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
distractions but that comes with the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.570 
distractions but that comes with the
territory<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.519> who<00:02:43.790> he<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.950> he<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.099> getting

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
territory of who he is he is getting

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580 
territory of who he is he is getting
older<00:02:46.730> which<00:02:47.120> needs<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.720> considered<00:02:48.019> and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
older which needs to be considered and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.020 
older which needs to be considered and
he<00:02:49.580> does<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.150> only<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.989> few<00:02:51.200> more<00:02:51.349> fights<00:02:51.650> left

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
he does have only a few more fights left

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.190 
he does have only a few more fights left
aside<00:02:53.030> from<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.750> think<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.739> he<00:02:55.519> needs<00:02:55.730> to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
aside from that I think that he needs to

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
aside from that I think that he needs to
basically<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.440> what<00:02:57.680> we<00:02:57.920> all<00:02:58.099> know<00:02:58.280> him<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.640> be

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670

the fight in the center of the ring as
much<00:03:09.620> as<00:03:09.769> possible<00:03:10.299> utilize<00:03:11.299> that<00:03:11.329> high<00:03:11.720> ring

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
much as possible utilize that high ring

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.699 
much as possible utilize that high ring
IQ<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.790> ring<00:03:13.790> generalship<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.810> if<00:03:15.380> he<00:03:15.500> does

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
IQ and ring generalship and if he does

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.220 
IQ and ring generalship and if he does
that<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.130> he<00:03:16.280> should<00:03:16.519> coast<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:17.420> that

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
that and he should coast to that

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.039 
that and he should coast to that
unanimous<00:03:18.859> decision<00:03:19.370> victory<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.720> think

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
unanimous decision victory but I think

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.330 
unanimous decision victory but I think
this<00:03:21.109> is<00:03:21.170> going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> more<00:03:22.010> competitive

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
this is going to be a more competitive

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.750 
this is going to be a more competitive
fight<00:03:22.819> than<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> first<00:03:23.480> one<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.760> hopefully

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
fight than the first one and hopefully

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.720 
fight than the first one and hopefully
we<00:03:26.180> get<00:03:26.329> that<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.829> have<00:03:28.010> poignet<00:03:28.519> whether

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
we get that and I have poignet whether

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.069 
we get that and I have poignet whether
by<00:03:29.090> unanimous<00:03:29.569> decision<00:03:29.600> over<00:03:30.200> 12<00:03:30.590> rounds
