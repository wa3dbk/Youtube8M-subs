light<00:03:16.640> sir<00:03:16.850> currently<00:03:17.390> connect<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.840> up<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.260> I

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
light sir currently connect it up so I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.440 
light sir currently connect it up so I
just<00:03:19.100> playing<00:03:19.400> back<00:03:19.580> on<00:03:23.380> yeah<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.390> think

just playing back on yeah and I think
that's<00:03:26.810> for<00:03:27.170> grass<00:03:27.530> midi<00:03:27.829> control<00:03:28.480> maybe<00:03:29.480> that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
that's for grass midi control maybe that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.180 
that's for grass midi control maybe that
one's<00:03:29.870> straub<00:03:30.519> DC<00:03:31.519> controller<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:33.079> DMX<00:03:33.890> and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
one's straub DC controller and DMX and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.150 
one's straub DC controller and DMX and
deer<00:03:34.579> makes<00:03:34.940> polarity<00:03:35.810> or<00:03:36.079> me<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.769> think<00:03:36.890> that's

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
deer makes polarity or me I think that's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.770 
deer makes polarity or me I think that's
I<00:03:37.430> think<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.970> same<00:03:39.880> ones<00:03:40.880> one<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.600> them<00:03:41.750> is

thing being i'm currently i have the
mega<00:04:16.850> pascal<00:04:17.329> pulse<00:04:17.510> hooked<00:04:18.229> up<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:19.250> is

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
mega pascal pulse hooked up so this is

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.909 
mega pascal pulse hooked up so this is
RGB<00:04:19.850> right<00:04:20.209> here<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.380> different<00:04:21.709> depending

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
RGB right here it is different depending

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.650 
RGB right here it is different depending
on<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.430> light<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.729> have<00:04:23.050> lights<00:04:24.050> up<00:04:24.260> changing

that's it so that's red green well it

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.559 
that's it so that's red green well it
will<00:04:31.099> change<00:04:31.430> depending<00:04:31.669> on<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> light
