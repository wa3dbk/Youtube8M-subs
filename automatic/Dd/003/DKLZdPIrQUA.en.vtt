I'll<00:02:43.590> say<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.190> kid<00:02:48.020> now

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
I'll say that for this kid now

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.500 
I'll say that for this kid now
transforming<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.980> isn't<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:50.880> complex

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.899 

and<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:55.470> nice<00:02:55.680> thing<00:02:55.709> about<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.310> V<00:02:56.459> Finn<00:02:56.730> on

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
and one nice thing about the V Finn on

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.869 
and one nice thing about the V Finn on
this<00:02:57.030> kit<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.420> rubber<00:02:58.459> which<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.670> good

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
this kit it is rubber which is good

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.000 
this kit it is rubber which is good
because<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.540> were<00:03:00.690> plastic<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:01.650> sure

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
because if this were plastic I'm sure

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.110 
because if this were plastic I'm sure
would<00:03:02.220> snap<00:03:02.519> easily<00:03:02.849> during<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
would snap easily during the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.619 
would snap easily during the
transformation<00:03:04.670> now<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.760> get<00:03:05.970> into<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.269> very

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
transformation now we get into the very

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.410 
transformation now we get into the very
complex<00:03:07.260> transformation<00:03:08.159> it's<00:03:09.060> about<00:03:09.209> moving

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
complex transformation it's about moving

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.479 
complex transformation it's about moving
the<00:03:09.599> skirt<00:03:09.900> arm<00:03:10.080> around<00:03:10.200> bringing<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.190> elbows

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the skirt arm around bringing the elbows

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.250 
the skirt arm around bringing the elbows
forward<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.330> change<00:03:12.540> out<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> hands

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
forward you have to change out the hands

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.100 
forward you have to change out the hands
move<00:03:13.410> them<00:03:14.129> back<00:03:14.400> I'm<00:03:15.150> not<00:03:15.420> gonna<00:03:15.840> get<00:03:15.989> into

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
move them back I'm not gonna get into

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.869 
move them back I'm not gonna get into
the<00:03:16.230> real<00:03:16.440> complicated<00:03:17.040> details<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> will

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
the real complicated details but I will

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.190 
the real complicated details but I will
say<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.360> manual<00:03:18.599> does<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.810> very<00:03:18.959> good<00:03:19.140> job

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
say that the manual does a very good job

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
say that the manual does a very good job
of<00:03:19.379> explaining<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.430> step-by-step

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
of explaining this and step-by-step

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.569 
of explaining this and step-by-step
instructions<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.319> very<00:03:22.650> very<00:03:22.890> complex

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.880 

yosef<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.700> move<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.940> shoulders<00:03:27.299> around<00:03:27.890> there

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
yosef to move the shoulders around there

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.009 
yosef to move the shoulders around there
are<00:03:29.069> very<00:03:29.489> few<00:03:29.730> guns<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.269> get<00:03:30.390> more<00:03:30.540> complex

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
are very few guns that get more complex

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.430 
are very few guns that get more complex
than<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.319> in<00:03:31.470> terms<00:03:31.620> transformation<00:03:33.440> you

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
than this in terms transformation you

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.710 
than this in terms transformation you

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
put the core fighter in and you can also

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.050 
put the core fighter in and you can also
put<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.200> beam<00:03:37.709> rifle<00:03:38.010> into<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.609> arm<00:03:38.790> section

can put in the back of the flyer and put
it<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.560> an<00:03:58.650> action<00:03:58.919> base<00:03:59.099> if<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.400> want<00:04:02.569> now

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
it on an action base if you want now

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
good in the least they are very weak

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.330 
good in the least they are very weak
some<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.290> weakest<00:04:10.590> I've<00:04:10.739> ever<00:04:10.889> seen<00:04:11.190> on<00:04:11.310> a

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
some of the weakest I've ever seen on a

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
master grade first problem this leads to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.129 
master grade first problem this leads to
has<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.730> do<00:04:14.819> with<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.030> legs<00:04:15.239> there<00:04:15.930> are<00:04:15.989> very

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
has to do with the legs there are very

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.870 
has to do with the legs there are very
few<00:04:16.289> poly<00:04:16.530> caps<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:16.979> this<00:04:17.130> kit<00:04:17.340> but<00:04:17.549> one<00:04:17.700> place

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
few poly caps on this kit but one place

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.370 
few poly caps on this kit but one place
you<00:04:17.970> do<00:04:18.060> see<00:04:18.269> them<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.599> in<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.810> legs<00:04:18.989> where<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
you do see them is in the legs where the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.120 
you do see them is in the legs where the
leg<00:04:19.530> connects<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> hip<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:22.830> doesn't

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
leg connects to the hip it doesn't

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.529 
leg connects to the hip it doesn't
connect<00:04:23.370> very<00:04:23.580> well<00:04:23.760> with<00:04:23.910> those<00:04:24.060> weak<00:04:24.300> hips

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
connect very well with those weak hips

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.029 
connect very well with those weak hips
and<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:25.110> lot<00:04:25.289> of<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.440> time<00:04:25.620> when<00:04:25.770> you're<00:04:25.860> moving

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
and a lot of the time when you're moving

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.620 
and a lot of the time when you're moving
the<00:04:26.310> legs<00:04:26.490> around<00:04:26.849> they<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.270> have<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.479> tendency

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
the legs around they do have a tendency

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.100 
the legs around they do have a tendency
to<00:04:27.870> fall<00:04:28.139> out<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.349> lot<00:04:29.539> it<00:04:30.539> was<00:04:30.660> just<00:04:30.870> standing

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
to fall out a lot it was just standing

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.230 
to fall out a lot it was just standing
there<00:04:31.289> it's<00:04:31.500> not<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> problem<00:04:33.289> now<00:04:35.000> when<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.120> do

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
there it's not a problem now when you do

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.670 
there it's not a problem now when you do
the<00:04:36.330> transformation<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:37.020> actually<00:04:37.289> split

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
the transformation you actually split

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.200 
the transformation you actually split
the<00:04:37.830> hips<00:04:38.039> apart<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.580> move<00:04:38.789> them<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.060> two

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
the hips apart and move them in two

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.120 
the hips apart and move them in two
separate<00:04:39.570> sections<00:04:39.770> making<00:04:40.770> them<00:04:40.979> even

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
separate sections making them even

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.469 
separate sections making them even
weaker<00:04:41.550> than<00:04:41.700> they<00:04:41.820> already<00:04:41.940> were<00:04:42.210> in<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
weaker than they already were in the

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.850 
weaker than they already were in the
first<00:04:42.599> place<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.960> attach<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.500> legs<00:04:46.680> on

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
first place and you attach the legs on

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.100 
first place and you attach the legs on
there<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:48.300> actually<00:04:48.479> have<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.810> add<00:04:48.930> another

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
there you actually have to add another

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.830 
there you actually have to add another
little<00:04:49.830> attachment<00:04:50.820> for<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.150> transformation

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
little attachment for the transformation

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.290 
little attachment for the transformation
in<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.110> center<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.979> acts<00:04:53.280> as<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.820> connector

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
in the center this acts as a connector

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.420 
in the center this acts as a connector
for<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.510> core<00:04:54.720> fighter<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.289> also<00:04:55.979> acts<00:04:56.190> as<00:04:56.370> a

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
for the core fighter and also acts as a

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.370 
for the core fighter and also acts as a
connector<00:04:57.300> for<00:04:57.449> an<00:04:57.539> action<00:04:57.840> base<00:04:57.990> if<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.199> want

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
connector for an action base if you want

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.580 
connector for an action base if you want
to<00:04:58.440> put<00:04:58.560> this<00:04:58.680> one<00:04:58.889> in<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.070> air<00:04:59.630> the<00:05:00.630> legs<00:05:00.960> very

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
to put this one in the air the legs very

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.320 
to put this one in the air the legs very
easy<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.190> fun<00:05:02.400> transformation<00:05:03.090> when<00:05:03.240> you

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
easy and fun transformation when you

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.640 
easy and fun transformation when you
move<00:05:03.479> them<00:05:03.630> around<00:05:03.750> all<00:05:04.050> sorts<00:05:04.409> of<00:05:04.440> little

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
move them around all sorts of little

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.950 
move them around all sorts of little
compartments<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.340> fins<00:05:05.700> pop<00:05:06.060> out<00:05:06.270> it's

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
compartments and fins pop out it's

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.260 
compartments and fins pop out it's
actually<00:05:07.110> really<00:05:07.500> nice

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
actually really nice

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.760 
actually really nice
problem<00:05:09.270> again<00:05:09.480> is<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.870> hips<00:05:10.080> you<00:05:10.470> can<00:05:10.500> see

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
problem again is the hips you can see

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:20.100 
problem again is the hips you can see
the<00:05:10.950> legs<00:05:11.190> slowly<00:05:11.730> go<00:05:12.360> back<00:05:12.600> down

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.839 

now<00:05:20.740> when<00:05:20.889> you<00:05:20.949> attach<00:05:21.189> the<00:05:21.340> core<00:05:21.490> fighter<00:05:21.699> the

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
now when you attach the core fighter the

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.689 
now when you attach the core fighter the
core<00:05:22.000> fighter<00:05:22.210> fits<00:05:22.509> in<00:05:22.659> fine<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:22.960> looks<00:05:23.379> nice

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
core fighter fits in fine and looks nice

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.559 
core fighter fits in fine and looks nice
and<00:05:24.699> it's<00:05:24.909> just<00:05:25.060> sitting<00:05:25.240> there<00:05:25.419> on<00:05:25.509> the

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
and it's just sitting there on the

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.990 
and it's just sitting there on the
ground<00:05:25.599> there's<00:05:26.020> no<00:05:26.110> problem<00:05:26.500> but<00:05:26.650> again<00:05:27.000> you

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
ground there's no problem but again you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.149 
ground there's no problem but again you
can<00:05:28.150> see<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.449> legs<00:05:28.719> slowly<00:05:29.169> going<00:05:29.650> back<00:05:29.919> down

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
can see that legs slowly going back down

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.070 
can see that legs slowly going back down
so<00:05:30.430> you're<00:05:30.550> not<00:05:30.759> getting<00:05:31.000> any<00:05:31.210> aerial<00:05:31.719> poses

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
so you're not getting any aerial poses

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.390 
so you're not getting any aerial poses
out<00:05:32.199> of<00:05:32.289> this<00:05:32.439> thing<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:33.009> if<00:05:33.129> you<00:05:33.159> shake<00:05:33.340> it

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
out of this thing and if you shake it

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.320 
out of this thing and if you shake it
too<00:05:33.580> hard<00:05:33.759> the<00:05:33.909> legs<00:05:34.060> gonna<00:05:34.210> pop<00:05:34.539> off<00:05:34.719> entirely

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
too hard the legs gonna pop off entirely

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.149 
too hard the legs gonna pop off entirely
so<00:05:37.330> those<00:05:37.599> hips<00:05:37.900> causes<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.650> lot<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:38.949> problems

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
so those hips causes a lot of problems

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.240 
so those hips causes a lot of problems
on<00:05:39.550> this<00:05:39.699> kit<00:05:40.590> one<00:05:41.590> of<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.740> most<00:05:41.919> aggravating

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
on this kit one of the most aggravating

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.129 
on this kit one of the most aggravating
set<00:05:42.699> of<00:05:42.789> hips<00:05:42.969> I've<00:05:43.210> ever<00:05:43.389> seen<00:05:43.629> on<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.870> Master

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
set of hips I've ever seen on the Master
