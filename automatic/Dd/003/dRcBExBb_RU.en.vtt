in<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.140> past<00:00:01.319> videos<00:00:01.709> we've<00:00:02.100> seen<00:00:02.129> how<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.550> set

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in the past videos we've seen how to set

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.690 
in the past videos we've seen how to set
the<00:00:02.909> pedal<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:04.170> food<00:00:04.410> technique<00:00:04.859> that<00:00:05.580> I'm

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the pedal the food technique that I'm

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.770 
the pedal the food technique that I'm
using<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.629> I'm<00:00:07.970> practicing<00:00:08.970> them<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
using and how I'm practicing them the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.610 
using and how I'm practicing them the
hands<00:00:10.139> technique<00:00:10.530> today<00:00:11.400> we're<00:00:11.790> gonna<00:00:11.940> see

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
hands technique today we're gonna see

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.250 
hands technique today we're gonna see
the<00:00:13.620> blastbeats<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.700> apply<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.719> hands<00:00:16.109> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the blastbeats so we apply the hands and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.779 
the blastbeats so we apply the hands and
the<00:00:16.379> feet<00:00:16.560> technique<00:00:17.810> on<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> set<00:00:19.580> trying<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the feet technique on a set trying to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.230 
the feet technique on a set trying to
have<00:00:20.970> groovy<00:00:21.840> blast<00:00:22.230> bit<00:00:22.730> another<00:00:23.730> important

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
have groovy blast bit another important

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.839 
have groovy blast bit another important
thing<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:26.010> hand<00:00:26.310> technique<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:28.849> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
thing about the hand technique is the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.290 
thing about the hand technique is the
role<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.390> each<00:00:31.050> end<00:00:31.430> if<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.610> play<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> ride

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
role of each end if you play on a ride

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.380 
role of each end if you play on a ride
cymbal<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.110> usually<00:00:34.950> use<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> same<00:00:35.390> position

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
cymbal I usually use the same position

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.430 
cymbal I usually use the same position
that<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:37.070> on<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> snare<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> starting<00:00:40.290> from

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that I use on the snare so starting from

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.740 
that I use on the snare so starting from
a<00:00:40.590> French<00:00:40.950> position<00:00:41.550> ending<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> German

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
a French position ending to a German

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.570 
a French position ending to a German
positions

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.620 

but<00:00:52.580> I<00:00:52.940> can<00:00:53.540> also<00:00:54.370> choose<00:00:55.370> how<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:56.000> play<00:00:56.390> the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
but I can also choose how to play the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:04.540 
but I can also choose how to play the
blast<00:00:56.840> bit<00:00:57.080> if<00:00:57.460> they'd<00:00:58.460> all<00:00:59.060> just<00:00:59.690> straight<00:01:03.550> if

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
blast bit if they'd all just straight if

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.090 
blast bit if they'd all just straight if
dynamics

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.050 

so<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:11.770> trained<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.250> two<00:01:13.430> hands<00:01:13.850> giving

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
so I trained the two hands giving

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:26.850 
so I trained the two hands giving
different<00:01:14.600> accents

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.960 

or<00:01:27.860> if<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.790> move<00:01:29.600> your<00:01:29.840> hand<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:31.340> on<00:01:31.820> the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
or if you move your hand on the on the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.210 
or if you move your hand on the on the
hi-hat<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:32.930> won't<00:01:33.140> have<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.470> same<00:01:33.650> respond

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
hi-hat you won't have the same respond

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.840 
hi-hat you won't have the same respond
of<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.940> snare<00:01:35.180> drum<00:01:35.210> over<00:01:35.930> right<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.610> have

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
of a snare drum over right so you have

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.410 
of a snare drum over right so you have
to<00:01:38.210> use<00:01:38.420> your<00:01:38.660> wrist<00:01:38.900> more<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.090> usually

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
to use your wrist more and so I usually

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.480 
to use your wrist more and so I usually
use<00:01:41.659> more<00:01:42.619> of<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:43.190> German<00:01:44.680> motion<00:01:45.680> using<00:01:46.250> more

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
use more of a German motion using more

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.469 
use more of a German motion using more
the<00:01:46.729> wrist<00:01:48.369> just<00:01:49.369> like<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.729> wrist<00:01:49.970> exercise<00:01:50.450> I

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
the wrist just like the wrist exercise I

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.480 
the wrist just like the wrist exercise I
was<00:01:50.780> doing<00:01:50.990> before<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.430> way<00:01:57.369> so<00:01:58.369> as

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
was doing before so in this way so as

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.300 
was doing before so in this way so as
you<00:01:58.640> can<00:01:58.729> see<00:01:58.970> both<00:01:59.660> hands<00:01:59.990> are<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.710> different

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
you can see both hands are of different

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.219 
you can see both hands are of different
roles<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.940> this<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.300> very<00:02:02.509> important<00:02:03.050> to

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
roles and this is very important to

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.190 
roles and this is very important to
train<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:04.369> practice<00:02:05.030> when<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.840> practice

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
train to practice when you practice

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.840 
train to practice when you practice
blastbeats<00:02:06.680> because<00:02:07.100> usually<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.700> just

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
blastbeats because usually we just

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.850 
blastbeats because usually we just
practice<00:02:08.270> them<00:02:08.450> on<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.660> pad<00:02:08.929> or<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> snare

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
practice them on a pad or in a snare

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.820 
practice them on a pad or in a snare
drum<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.340> then<00:02:10.789> when<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:11.570> go<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.320> play<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> blast

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
drum and then when we go to play a blast

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.610 
drum and then when we go to play a blast
beat<00:02:13.070> we<00:02:13.250> have<00:02:13.370> different<00:02:13.910> surface<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.750> it

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
beat we have different surface and it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.229 
beat we have different surface and it
doesn't<00:02:15.950> sound<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.280> same<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.820> doesn't<00:02:17.060> feel

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
doesn't sound the same it doesn't feel

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.070 
doesn't sound the same it doesn't feel
the<00:02:17.300> same<00:02:17.690> way<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.870> another

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
the same way so this is another

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.820 
the same way so this is another
important<00:02:21.769> thing<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.459> should<00:02:22.700> care<00:02:22.940> about<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
important thing you should care about I

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.690 
important thing you should care about I
divide<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:26.590> practicing<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.830> two<00:02:28.010> parts<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
divide the practicing in two parts the

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.570 
divide the practicing in two parts the
speed<00:02:29.530> practice<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:31.130> endurance

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
speed practice and the endurance

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.690 
speed practice and the endurance
practice<00:02:32.180> for<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.930> speed<00:02:33.170> practice<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.950> after

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
practice for the speed practice I after

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.280 
practice for the speed practice I after
a<00:02:34.730> warm-up

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
a warm-up

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.410 
a warm-up
I<00:02:38.500> put<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.590> click<00:02:39.830> on<00:02:40.160> about<00:02:40.930> 110<00:02:41.930> new<00:02:42.140> VM<00:02:42.380> and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
I put the click on about 110 new VM and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.949 
I put the click on about 110 new VM and
from<00:02:44.420> there

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
from there

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:53.590 
from there
I<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:47.470> play<00:02:48.470> one<00:02:49.280> bar<00:02:50.410> fast<00:02:51.410> one<00:02:52.010> bar<00:02:52.340> slow<00:02:52.880> plus

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
I I play one bar fast one bar slow plus

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.699 
I I play one bar fast one bar slow plus
bit<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:54.620> two<00:02:55.040> bars<00:02:55.310> fast<00:02:55.880> one<00:02:56.720> bars<00:02:57.079> slope

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
bit then two bars fast one bars slope

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.140 
bit then two bars fast one bars slope
then<00:02:58.340> three<00:02:58.850> bars<00:02:59.120> fast<00:02:59.660> one<00:03:00.440> bars<00:03:00.769> slow<00:03:01.220> four

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
then three bars fast one bars slow four

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
then three bars fast one bars slow four
bars<00:03:02.480> fast<00:03:03.320> and<00:03:03.650> one<00:03:03.920> bar<00:03:04.190> slow<00:03:04.959> I'm<00:03:05.959> gonna

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170

bars fast and one bar slow I'm gonna
show<00:03:06.440> you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:39.050 

I<00:03:36.530> usually<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.830> one<00:03:38.069> minute<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.640> each<00:03:38.670> bar

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
I usually do one minute for each bar

alternating feet grasp it which gives me

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.250 
alternating feet grasp it which gives me
more<00:04:51.360> sensation<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.970> standing<00:04:53.970> glass<00:04:54.539> bit<00:04:54.810> you
