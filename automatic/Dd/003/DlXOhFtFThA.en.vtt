adhesive<00:00:50.219> didn't<00:00:50.700> stick<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.360> water

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
adhesive didn't stick because the water

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.130 
adhesive didn't stick because the water
got<00:00:52.829> wet<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:54.120> got<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> mesh<00:00:54.809> netting

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
got wet to it it's got the mesh netting

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.700 
got wet to it it's got the mesh netting
where<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> put<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> shoe<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.350> then<00:00:58.350> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
where you put a shoe in it and then it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.779 
where you put a shoe in it and then it's
got<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.280> adjustable<00:01:01.460> shoehorn<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
got the adjustable shoehorn that you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.210 
got the adjustable shoehorn that you
keep<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.049> retains<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> shape<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
keep in so it's retains a shape and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.429 
keep in so it's retains a shape and
whatnot<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.689> main<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:09.080> don't<00:01:10.080> really

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
whatnot so the main thing don't really

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
whatnot so the main thing don't really
have<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> comparison<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.580> before<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.180> after

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
have a comparison of before and after

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.179 
have a comparison of before and after
anymore<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.439> long<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
anymore because it's so long for the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.050 
anymore because it's so long for the
video<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.420> want<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> give<00:01:15.990> props<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
video but I do want to give props to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
rejuvenate it works really well there

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.340 
rejuvenate it works really well there
are<00:01:21.240> some<00:01:21.479> cons<00:01:21.840> there's<00:01:22.259> tons<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> pros<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
are some cons there's tons of pros to it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
are some cons there's tons of pros to it
but<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> main<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:25.950> brush<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:27.000> nice<00:01:27.210> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
but the main thing brush is nice it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.310 
but the main thing brush is nice it's
it's<00:01:28.520> not<00:01:29.520> too<00:01:29.970> stiff<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.479> stiff<00:01:30.780> enough<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it's not too stiff but stiff enough to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.469 
it's not too stiff but stiff enough to
to<00:01:31.530> agitate<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.250> mesh<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.790> material<00:01:33.299> will

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
not what I really really love is the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.969 
not what I really really love is the
actual<00:01:37.560> solution<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.880> supposedly

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
actual solution it's supposedly

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.020 
actual solution it's supposedly
biodegradable<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.220> good<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.729> it's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
biodegradable it's good for you it's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.230 
biodegradable it's good for you it's
actually<00:01:42.180> made<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.840> natural<00:01:43.680> soap<00:01:44.240> derived

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
actually made of natural soap derived

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
actually made of natural soap derived
from<00:01:45.570> coconut<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:48.320> jojoba<00:01:49.320> oils<00:01:49.860> its

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
from coconut and jojoba oils its

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
from coconut and jojoba oils its
jail-jail<00:01:50.909> ba<00:01:51.630> oils<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:54.420> doesn't<00:01:54.840> can

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
jail-jail ba oils so it doesn't can

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.260 
jail-jail ba oils so it doesn't can
irritate<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> eyes<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.460> watch<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> course

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
irritate the eyes so watch out of course

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.700 
irritate the eyes so watch out of course
don't<00:01:57.360> put<00:01:57.540> an<00:01:57.630> eye<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.810> don't<00:01:58.079> drink<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.500> this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
don't put an eye on don't drink it this

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.550 
don't put an eye on don't drink it this
is<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> 4<00:01:59.159> ounce<00:01:59.280> solution<00:02:00.290> I'll<00:02:01.290> probably

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
is the 4 ounce solution I'll probably

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.289 
is the 4 ounce solution I'll probably
buy<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:02.040> solution<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.119> like

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
buy more solution because I really like

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
buy more solution because I really like
the<00:02:03.630> cleaning<00:02:04.049> capability<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.670> only

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the cleaning capability of this the only

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.680 
the cleaning capability of this the only
downside<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.869> doesn't<00:02:07.229> smell<00:02:07.649> good

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
downside is it doesn't smell good

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.889 
downside is it doesn't smell good
it's

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
it's

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.770 
it's
just<00:02:11.079> kind<00:02:11.349> of<00:02:11.379> a<00:02:11.470> neutral<00:02:12.180> fragrance<00:02:13.180> too<00:02:13.420> but

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
just kind of a neutral fragrance too but

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.869 
just kind of a neutral fragrance too but
I<00:02:13.810> think<00:02:14.170> if<00:02:14.319> they<00:02:14.680> add<00:02:14.799> something<00:02:15.220> like<00:02:15.430> what

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
I think if they add something like what

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.550 
I think if they add something like what
Jason<00:02:16.239> mark<00:02:16.450> has<00:02:16.659> where<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.959> smells<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.349> little

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
Jason mark has where it smells a little

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.559 
Jason mark has where it smells a little
bit<00:02:17.650> nicer<00:02:18.040> or<00:02:18.189> maybe<00:02:18.400> some<00:02:18.640> sort<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.879> a<00:02:19.030> soap

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
bit nicer or maybe some sort of a soap

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.520 
bit nicer or maybe some sort of a soap
or<00:02:21.569> something<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.900> doesn't<00:02:23.140> smell<00:02:23.379> too

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
or something that doesn't smell too

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.399 
or something that doesn't smell too
strong<00:02:24.129> but<00:02:24.370> smells<00:02:24.700> good<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.269> have<00:02:25.510> this

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
strong but smells good to have this

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.710 
strong but smells good to have this
would<00:02:26.799> be<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.159> killer<00:02:27.760> cleaner<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.359> think

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
would be a killer cleaner I think

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960 
would be a killer cleaner I think
honestly<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.609> why<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:30.849> recommend

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
honestly so this is why we recommend

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.140 
honestly so this is why we recommend
actually<00:02:31.620> more<00:02:32.620> than<00:02:32.709> Jason<00:02:32.920> mark<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.760> I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
actually more than Jason mark and I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.119 
actually more than Jason mark and I
believe<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.750> cheaper<00:02:35.200> than<00:02:35.230> Jason<00:02:35.530> mark<00:02:35.859> so

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
believe it's cheaper than Jason mark so

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.589 
believe it's cheaper than Jason mark so
keep<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.519> in<00:02:36.579> hand<00:02:36.909> or<00:02:37.329> keep<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.049> in<00:02:38.140> mind

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
keep that in hand or keep that in mind

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.789 
keep that in hand or keep that in mind
really<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.720> only<00:02:40.750> thing<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.709> with<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.280> shoe

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
really the only thing is with the shoe

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.729 
really the only thing is with the shoe
the<00:02:44.799> bag<00:02:45.099> itself<00:02:45.639> I<00:02:46.230> really<00:02:47.230> don't<00:02:47.409> know<00:02:47.530> how

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
the bag itself I really don't know how

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.740 
the bag itself I really don't know how
the<00:02:47.799> construction<00:02:48.459> works<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.849> everything<00:02:49.060> it

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the construction works and everything it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.540 
the construction works and everything it
I<00:02:50.579> thought<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.700> locks<00:02:51.970> down<00:02:52.090> because

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.550 

it's<00:02:57.090> supposed<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.600> lock<00:02:57.810> down<00:02:58.050> once<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.440> have

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it's supposed to lock down once you have

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.170 
it's supposed to lock down once you have
to<00:02:58.650> tap<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.130> but<00:02:59.340> once<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.700> throw<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
to tap in but once you throw it in the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.800 
to tap in but once you throw it in the
washer<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.900> actually<00:03:01.260> loosens<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:01.980> so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
washer it actually loosens it up so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.270 
washer it actually loosens it up so
unless<00:03:03.810> I'm<00:03:03.960> doing<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.380> wrong<00:03:04.530> let<00:03:04.950> me<00:03:04.980> know

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
unless I'm doing it wrong let me know

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.820 
unless I'm doing it wrong let me know
but<00:03:05.910> what<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.810> order<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.080> keep<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.560> shoe

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
but what I do in order to keep the shoe

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.520 
but what I do in order to keep the shoe
in<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.250> seal<00:03:08.520> was<00:03:09.420> actually<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.900> knotted<00:03:10.380> it

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
in the seal was actually just knotted it

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.550 
in the seal was actually just knotted it
up<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.890> tied<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.370> way<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:13.320> won't

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
up and tied it that way so that won't

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.600 
up and tied it that way so that won't
fit<00:03:14.180> your<00:03:15.180> typical<00:03:15.450> J's<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:17.040> will<00:03:17.220> fit<00:03:17.430> you

stress<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:32.270> where<00:03:33.270> you're<00:03:33.390> supposed<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.780> do

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
stress but where you're supposed to do

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.190 
stress but where you're supposed to do
in<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.590> case<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:35.070> probably<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.930> don't<00:03:37.050> want

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
in this case it probably you don't want

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.900 
in this case it probably you don't want
to<00:03:37.290> throw<00:03:37.410> adorns<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.460> know<00:03:38.550> won't<00:03:38.640> depend

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
to throw adorns in you know won't depend

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.730 
to throw adorns in you know won't depend
on<00:03:39.000> how<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.390> it<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.720> probably<00:03:40.560> won't

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
on how you do it but I probably won't

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.500 
on how you do it but I probably won't
throw<00:03:41.010> these<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.310> because<00:03:41.520> they're<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.120> good<00:03:42.360> I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
throw these in because they're so good I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.350 
throw these in because they're so good I
keep<00:03:42.750> them<00:03:42.840> pretty<00:03:43.050> well<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:44.670> instruction<00:03:45.210> is

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
keep them pretty well the instruction is

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.210 
keep them pretty well the instruction is
you're<00:03:45.540> supposed<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.170> put<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.190> this

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you're supposed to put it in like this

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.150 
you're supposed to put it in like this
put<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.940> shoots<00:03:48.210> shoehorn<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.080> there<00:03:49.320> throw

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
put the shoots shoehorn in there throw

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.360

it<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> bag<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.680> throw<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.770> in<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.950> washer

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
it in the bag and throw it in the washer

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.920 
it in the bag and throw it in the washer
and<00:03:53.520> you<00:03:53.550> just<00:03:53.700> let<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.240> the<00:03:54.420> thing<00:03:54.660> and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
and you just let it do the thing and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.780 
and you just let it do the thing and
then<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.650> take<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:55.890> out<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:56.250> just<00:03:56.310> let<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.670> air

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
then you take it out and just let it air

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.170 
then you take it out and just let it air
dry<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:59.030> pretty<00:04:00.030> great<00:04:00.300> concept<00:04:00.990> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
dry so pretty great concept and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.340 
dry so pretty great concept and
definitely<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.240> cleans<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.930> lot<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
definitely it cleans a lot of the

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.830 
definitely it cleans a lot of the
sneakers<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:06.200> our<00:04:07.200> kiss<00:04:07.530> for<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> lot<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.070> the

cherry love and Lowe's in there just to

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.539 
cherry love and Lowe's in there just to
see<00:04:19.020> how<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.350> walked<00:04:19.620> between<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:20.010> mesh<00:04:20.220> and

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.960 
see how it walked between the mesh and
it<00:04:21.060> did<00:04:21.210> a<00:04:21.239> pretty<00:04:21.450> good<00:04:21.630> job<00:04:22.820> I'm<00:04:23.820> still

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970

trying<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.300> figure<00:04:24.480> out<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.720> most<00:04:24.930> part

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
trying to figure out the most part

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.470 
trying to figure out the most part
because<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:26.070> keeps<00:04:26.280> bleeding<00:04:26.700> from<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
because it keeps bleeding from the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
yellow so but other than that definitely

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.300 
yellow so but other than that definitely
highly<00:04:32.850> recommended<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:33.660> does<00:04:33.870> help

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
highly recommended it does help

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.770 
highly recommended it does help

to 13 of cleaning brush and the shoe bag
and<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:01.950> solution<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:03.470> pretty<00:05:04.470> good<00:05:04.500> stuff

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
the only thing I would really change is

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.040 
the only thing I would really change is
probably<00:05:10.480> depending<00:05:11.480> on<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.630> type<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:11.840> shoes

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
probably depending on the type of shoes

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.260 
probably depending on the type of shoes
maybe<00:05:12.290> offer<00:05:12.710> a<00:05:12.980> bigger<00:05:13.250> bag<00:05:13.520> or<00:05:13.790> just<00:05:13.820> even

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
maybe offer a bigger bag or just even

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.040 
maybe offer a bigger bag or just even
throw<00:05:14.450> in<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.660> bigger<00:05:14.840> bag<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:15.260> a<00:05:15.290> solution<00:05:17.050> get

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
throw in a bigger bag for a solution get

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.750 
throw in a bigger bag for a solution get
this<00:05:18.230> figured<00:05:18.560> out<00:05:18.650> because<00:05:18.980> it<00:05:19.430> won't<00:05:19.580> come

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
this figured out because it won't come

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.250 
this figured out because it won't come
undone<00:05:20.060> when<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:20.330> throw<00:05:20.450> in<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.630> washer<00:05:21.020> and

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
then of course solution put some

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.100 
then of course solution put some
fragrance<00:05:25.880> into<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.360> and<00:05:26.510> then<00:05:26.660> definitely<00:05:26.870> a
