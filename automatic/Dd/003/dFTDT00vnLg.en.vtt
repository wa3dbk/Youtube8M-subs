quality cameras in much smaller sizes by

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.589 
quality cameras in much smaller sizes by
removing<00:00:10.500> some<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> guts<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.000> prism<00:00:12.540> of

removing some of the guts the prism of
the<00:00:12.660> mirror<00:00:12.900> system<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.590> makes<00:00:13.950> SLR<00:00:14.400> so

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
the mirror system that makes SLR so

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.849 
the mirror system that makes SLR so
bulky<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.630> sensor<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.320> EP<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:16.740> is

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
bulky the sensor in the EP one is

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.439 
bulky the sensor in the EP one is
basically<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> same<00:00:17.490> sensor<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.029> founded

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
basically the same sensor is founded

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.570 
basically the same sensor is founded
Olympus's<00:00:18.869> SLR<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> e520<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
Olympus's SLR it's like the e520 and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.359 
Olympus's SLR it's like the e520 and
such<00:00:20.779> but<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.050> camera<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.680> much<00:00:22.920> smaller<00:00:23.189> much

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
such but the camera is much smaller much

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.890 
such but the camera is much smaller much
more<00:00:23.760> compact<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.500> much<00:00:25.500> more<00:00:26.340> user<00:00:26.609> friendly

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
more compact and much more user friendly

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.120 
more compact and much more user friendly
so<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.230> turn<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.980> can

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
so if we turn it just so that you can

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.189 
so if we turn it just so that you can
see<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:30.060> pretty<00:00:30.269> thick<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.779> mean<00:00:31.050> it's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
see it's pretty thick I mean it's

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.200 
see it's pretty thick I mean it's
probably<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> buzz<00:00:31.740> thick<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> point<00:00:33.059> shoot

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
probably the buzz thick is a point shoot

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.580 
probably the buzz thick is a point shoot
camera<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.719> four<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.020> five<00:00:34.200> years<00:00:34.440> ago

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
camera was four or five years ago

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.240 
camera was four or five years ago
certainly<00:00:35.480> hefty<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.719> has<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> nice

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
certainly hefty and it has a nice

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.299 
certainly hefty and it has a nice
appealing<00:00:38.250> stainless<00:00:39.149> steel<00:00:39.360> body<00:00:39.800> but<00:00:40.800> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
appealing stainless steel body but we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.260 
appealing stainless steel body but we
can<00:00:41.430> bring<00:00:41.550> some<00:00:41.700> other<00:00:41.820> cameras<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.239> here

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
can bring some other cameras in here

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
can bring some other cameras in here
this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.690> Panasonic<00:00:43.320> FS<00:00:43.590> 15<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.309> ultra

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this is the Panasonic FS 15 and ultra

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
this is the Panasonic FS 15 and ultra
compact<00:00:44.730> camera<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:48.170> it's<00:00:49.170> not

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
compact camera and you can see it's not

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.720 
compact camera and you can see it's not
that<00:00:49.770> much<00:00:49.980> bigger<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.399> probably<00:00:50.640> about

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that much bigger it's probably about

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.900 
that much bigger it's probably about
twice<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> size<00:00:51.329> actually<00:00:51.949> but<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.309> far<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.550> SL

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
twice the size actually but as far as SL

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
twice the size actually but as far as SL
ours<00:00:54.059> ago<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.780> incredibly<00:00:55.230> small<00:00:57.829> this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
ours ago this is incredibly small this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.729 
ours ago this is incredibly small this
is<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> 14<00:00:59.879> x<00:01:00.000> 42<00:01:00.449> millimeter<00:01:00.840> lens<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.379> kit

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is the 14 x 42 millimeter lens that kit

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.450 
is the 14 x 42 millimeter lens that kit
lens<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> came<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> olympus<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
lens that came with the olympus it's a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
lens that came with the olympus it's a
reasonable<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.610> think<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.540> kit<00:01:06.869> costs<00:01:07.320> about

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
reasonable I think this kit costs about

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.859 
reasonable I think this kit costs about
eight<00:01:07.979> hundred<00:01:08.010> dollars<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.060> buying

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
eight hundred dollars if you're buying

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.620 
eight hundred dollars if you're buying
it<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.200> together<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> protrudes

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it all together you can see it protrudes

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
it all together you can see it protrudes
slightly<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.170> even<00:01:13.860> though<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.070> small

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
slightly so even though it's small

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
slightly so even though it's small
you're<00:01:14.880> still<00:01:15.150> taking<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.600> room<00:01:15.780> you're

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you're still taking up some room you're

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.210 
you're still taking up some room you're
going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> need<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> bag<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.740> camera<00:01:16.950> you

going to need a bag for this camera you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.520 
going to need a bag for this camera you
probably<00:01:17.400> can't<00:01:17.670> slip<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.030> pocket<00:01:18.530> but

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
