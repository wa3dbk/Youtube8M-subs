hands<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.760> not<00:00:08.880> have<00:00:09.120> as<00:00:09.389> many<00:00:09.599> sebaceous

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
hands to not have as many sebaceous

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.620 
hands to not have as many sebaceous
glands<00:00:10.740> or<00:00:10.950> oil<00:00:11.130> producing<00:00:11.670> glands<00:00:11.940> as<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
glands or oil producing glands as the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.650 
glands or oil producing glands as the
rest<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.049> our<00:00:13.230> skin<00:00:13.830> does<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.519> therefore<00:00:15.269> they

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
rest of our skin does and therefore they

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.050 
rest of our skin does and therefore they
are<00:00:15.690> really<00:00:16.080> prone<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.680> being<00:00:16.920> dry

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
are really prone to being dry

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.900 
are really prone to being dry
extra<00:00:18.449> dry<00:00:18.690> also<00:00:19.289> hands<00:00:19.830> tend<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.400> show<00:00:20.580> signs

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
extra dry also hands tend to show signs

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.900 
extra dry also hands tend to show signs
of<00:00:21.150> aging<00:00:21.720> much<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.560> readily<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.460> could<00:00:23.760> be

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
of aging much more readily that could be

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.000 
of aging much more readily that could be
because<00:00:24.090> they<00:00:24.449> do<00:00:24.510> not<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.439> many<00:00:25.650> oil

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
because they do not have as many oil

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.220 
because they do not have as many oil
producing<00:00:26.730> glands<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.300> keep<00:00:27.480> them<00:00:27.720> supple

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
producing glands to keep them supple

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
producing glands to keep them supple
another<00:00:28.859> reason<00:00:29.310> could<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.179> use<00:00:30.420> our

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
another reason could be that we use our

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.290 
another reason could be that we use our
hands<00:00:31.050> every<00:00:31.470> day<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:32.219> do<00:00:32.399> everything<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
hands every day to do everything and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.280 
hands every day to do everything and
therefore<00:00:33.660> hands<00:00:34.350> are<00:00:34.500> more<00:00:34.829> prone<00:00:35.219> to

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
therefore hands are more prone to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.600 
therefore hands are more prone to
getting<00:00:37.290> weathered<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:39.329> um<00:00:39.800> at-home<00:00:40.800> hand

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
getting weathered so um at-home hand

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
getting weathered so um at-home hand
care<00:00:41.879> tips<00:00:42.149> should<00:00:42.420> start<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:43.170> with

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
care tips should start really with

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.979 
care tips should start really with
exfoliation<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> hands<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> rest<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
exfoliation of hands like the rest of

exfoliation of hands like the rest of
our<00:00:46.140> skin<00:00:46.950> hands<00:00:47.489> also<00:00:47.760> tend<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
our skin hands also tend to have a

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.439 
our skin hands also tend to have a
buildup<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.200> dead<00:00:49.530> skin<00:00:49.950> cells<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:51.059> top<00:00:51.090> of

do is to get rid of these dead skin

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.029 
do is to get rid of these dead skin
cells<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.480> prepare<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> hands

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
cells so that we can prepare the hands

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.820 
cells so that we can prepare the hands
to<00:01:02.550> moisturize<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.500> certain

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to moisturize them now there are certain

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
to moisturize them now there are certain
things<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.820> um<00:01:06.170> every<00:01:07.170> day<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that is to moisturize your hands on a

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.690 
that is to moisturize your hands on a
very<00:01:15.570> regular<00:01:15.780> basis<00:01:16.439> every<00:01:17.159> time<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> wash

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
very regular basis every time you wash

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.499 
very regular basis every time you wash
your<00:01:17.970> hands

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
your hands

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.350 
your hands
moisturize<00:01:19.110> them<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.560> after<00:01:20.360> hopefully

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
moisturize them right after hopefully

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.649 
moisturize them right after hopefully
when<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> hands<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:22.950> still<00:01:23.250> damp<00:01:23.580> damp<00:01:24.240> skin

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
when the hands are still damp damp skin

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.289 
when the hands are still damp damp skin
tends<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.200> absorb<00:01:25.350> moisture<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.340> readily<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
tends to absorb moisture more readily so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
tends to absorb moisture more readily so
in<00:01:27.420> addition<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.860> do

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
in addition to that then you can do

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.670 
in addition to that then you can do
things<00:01:29.280> twice<00:01:29.640> or<00:01:29.970> twice<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.479> week<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.990> make

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
things twice or twice a week to make

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
things twice or twice a week to make
your<00:01:31.860> hands<00:01:32.100> look<00:01:32.310> very<00:01:32.579> healthy<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> supple

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
your hands look very healthy and supple

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
your hands look very healthy and supple
and<00:01:33.840> coming<00:01:34.590> back<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.950> exfoliation

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and coming back to exfoliation

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.050 
and coming back to exfoliation
exfoliation<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:38.100> process<00:01:38.520> by<00:01:38.729> which<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
exfoliation is the process by which the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.469 
exfoliation is the process by which the
dead<00:01:39.240> cells<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.689> removed<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.200> an<00:01:40.920> at-home

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
dead cells are removed and an at-home

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.510 
dead cells are removed and an at-home
exfoliation<00:01:42.479> process<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:43.200> very<00:01:43.740> simple<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
exfoliation process is very simple and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.660 
exfoliation process is very simple and
extremely<00:01:45.090> effective<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.860> need<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.399> a
