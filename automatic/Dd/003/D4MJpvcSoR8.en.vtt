00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.510
 the ingredients for this jelly 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.830
 prepared are 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.540
 fruit cocktail in syrup 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:30.440
 an evaporated milk a condensed milk 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:34.130
 It is not in small pieces 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.750
 a cup of normal milk and gelatin 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.750
 the flavors that we like 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.260
 well as first step let's elaborate 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.650
 our gelatins as it says in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.650
 the box 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.300
 and we're going to put them to refrigerate 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.800
 that set in a refractory we are going to 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 place the condensed milk 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.110
 we add half evaporated milk 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.110
 only and the normal milk cup 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.810
 and we mix perfectly the three 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.810
 milks 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.020
 until there is only one mixture once 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.060
 that our gelatins are ready 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.649
 what we did then what we are going to do is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.329
 with the help of a knife we ​​are going to 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.100
 cut into small cubes and we're going to 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.100
 go to another refractory 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.960
 and once we have them from this 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.860
 way what we're going to do is add 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.860
 the fruit cocktail 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.720
 and the nuts 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.719
 we're not going to mix then until 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.670
 this moment we made three gelatin 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:01.020
 water of different flavors 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.780
 the chilled and cut into cubes 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.819
 we add all in a container and 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.149
 then add the fruit cocktail and 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.799
 the nuts still do not mix what we're going 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.690
 to do is that the mixture that we had 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.460
 milk that we had already done that we had 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.420
 reserved 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.420
 We are going to take it 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.860
 directly 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.840
 where we have all the ingredients 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.840
 and we are going to add it in this way 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.560
 and now we are going to mix 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.560
 carefully 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.060
 It is a very easy to make jelly and it is 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.090
 very rich I recommend them because 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.850
 It has a very rich flavor and apart it is a 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.490
 gelatin that is very yielding with beams 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.220
 a lot with little money I hope 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.780
 that they like to be encouraged to do it and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.250
 I'm going to show you how I'm going to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.350
 present 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.840
 Well, as you can see, it's a recipe 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.990
 rich they had touchable is very colorful 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 it's a jelly and juices is and so I 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.470
 to serve her I will serve her in 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.360
 small matters 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.920

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.560
 I hope it's coming soon goodbye
