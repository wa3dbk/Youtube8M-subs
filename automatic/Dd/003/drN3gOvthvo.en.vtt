00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
of B minor here slash D major now I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.499 
of B minor here slash D major now I
wanted<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.829> mention<00:01:19.039> slash<00:01:19.670> D<00:01:19.969> major<00:01:20.240> because

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
wanted to mention slash D major because

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.120 
wanted to mention slash D major because
I<00:01:20.689> think<00:01:20.750> it's<00:01:20.929> quite<00:01:21.020> important<00:01:21.619> because<00:01:21.740> a

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
I think it's quite important because a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.459 
I think it's quite important because a
lot<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.880> stuff<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.270> hear<00:01:23.479> in<00:01:24.020> his<00:01:24.170> pink

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
lot of the stuff you hear in his pink

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.050 
lot of the stuff you hear in his pink
floyd<00:01:24.799> blades<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:25.159> when<00:01:25.310> he's<00:01:25.459> playing<00:01:25.610> over

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
floyd blades and when he's playing over

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.230 
floyd blades and when he's playing over
it<00:01:26.209> he's<00:01:26.719> playing<00:01:27.259> quite<00:01:27.920> smart<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:29.090> could

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
it he's playing quite smart you could

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.080 
it he's playing quite smart you could
say<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:29.569> deliberately<00:01:30.530> using<00:01:30.860> our<00:01:31.579> pager

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
say so deliberately using our pager

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.440 
say so deliberately using our pager
shapes<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.810> chord<00:01:33.200> based<00:01:33.590> licks<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:35.090> kind

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
shapes and chord based licks to to kind

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.899 
shapes and chord based licks to to kind
of<00:01:35.539> walk<00:01:35.780> through<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:36.619> chord<00:01:37.069> within<00:01:37.429> a<00:01:37.640> solo

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
of walk through a chord within a solo

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.440 
of walk through a chord within a solo
okay<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.649> opening<00:01:40.310> couple<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.700> lines<00:01:40.939> very

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
okay so the opening couple of lines very

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.779 
okay so the opening couple of lines very
much<00:01:41.689> suggests<00:01:42.110> D<00:01:42.319> major<00:01:42.560> whereas<00:01:43.459> the<00:01:43.610> last

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
much suggests D major whereas the last

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.969 
much suggests D major whereas the last
couple<00:01:44.270> suggests<00:01:44.599> a<00:01:44.689> bit<00:01:44.840> more<00:01:44.989> b<00:01:45.200> minor<00:01:45.560> okay

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
couple suggests a bit more b minor okay

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:54.279 
couple suggests a bit more b minor okay
so<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.700> opening<00:01:47.030> lick<00:01:47.209> is<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:53.289> and

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
so the opening lick is is this and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.080 
so the opening lick is is this and
what's<00:01:54.530> happening<00:01:55.009> is<00:01:55.189> at<00:01:55.369> first<00:01:55.610> I'm<00:01:55.819> taking

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
what's happening is at first I'm taking

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.550 
what's happening is at first I'm taking
the<00:01:56.179> D<00:01:56.360> major<00:01:56.599> chord<00:01:57.819> like<00:01:58.819> that<00:01:59.409> okay<00:02:00.409> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
the D major chord like that okay and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.850 
the D major chord like that okay and
just<00:02:00.649> taking<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.579> top<00:02:01.840> third<00:02:02.840> fifth<00:02:03.649> and

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
just taking the top third fifth and

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.240 
just taking the top third fifth and
remote<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.670> raking<00:02:05.509> through<00:02:05.719> them<00:02:06.250> and

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
remote and raking through them and

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.710 
remote and raking through them and
that's<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.640> little<00:02:07.819> arpeggio<00:02:08.299> isn't<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.599> but

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
that's a little arpeggio isn't it but

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.389 
that's a little arpeggio isn't it but
I'm<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:08.840> very<00:02:09.229> much<00:02:09.380> raking<00:02:10.009> them<00:02:10.160> for<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
I'm just very much raking them for the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.530 
I'm just very much raking them for the
moment<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:12.260> grabbing<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:13.700> major<00:02:14.000> third

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
moment and then grabbing the major third

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.770 
moment and then grabbing the major third
on<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> top<00:02:15.109> of<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.410> chord<00:02:16.120> on<00:02:17.120> top<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.720> the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
on the top of the chord on top of the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.220 
on the top of the chord on top of the
arpeggio<00:02:18.200> yucatan<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:19.850> is<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.329> frets<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230

of minor arpeggios which you can do all
over<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.200> fretboard<00:06:16.440> and<00:06:16.710> I<00:06:17.010> won't<00:06:17.340> go<00:06:17.400> into

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
over the fretboard and I won't go into

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.280 
over the fretboard and I won't go into
it<00:06:17.700> now<00:06:17.730> due<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.150> lack<00:06:18.450> of<00:06:18.480> time<00:06:18.630> but<00:06:19.020> there's

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
it now due to lack of time but there's

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.590 
it now due to lack of time but there's
some<00:06:19.470> stuff<00:06:19.620> on<00:06:19.890> the<00:06:20.070> sheet<00:06:20.340> now<00:06:20.670> combine

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
some stuff on the sheet now combine

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.290 
some stuff on the sheet now combine
those<00:06:22.050> ideas<00:06:22.350> with<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.370> pentatonix

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
those ideas with the pentatonix

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.020 
those ideas with the pentatonix
that<00:06:24.480> are<00:06:24.600> underneath<00:06:24.960> so<00:06:25.740> for<00:06:26.100> example<00:06:26.580> if<00:06:26.820> if

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
that are underneath so for example if if

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.870 
that are underneath so for example if if
I<00:06:27.240> had<00:06:27.510> a<00:06:27.720> pentatonic<00:06:28.140> shape<00:06:28.410> three<00:06:29.310> up<00:06:29.610> here

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
I had a pentatonic shape three up here

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.450 
I had a pentatonic shape three up here
in<00:06:30.030> B<00:06:30.180> minor

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
in B minor

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.310 

there's<00:06:33.460> also<00:06:33.670> a<00:06:33.820> little<00:06:34.090> kind<00:06:34.660> of<00:06:34.750> arpeggio

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
there's also a little kind of arpeggio

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:40.080 
there's also a little kind of arpeggio
three<00:06:35.650> string<00:06:38.580> underneath<00:06:39.580> it<00:06:39.820> which<00:06:39.940> is

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
three string underneath it which is

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.200 
three string underneath it which is
worth<00:06:40.270> learning<00:06:41.460> for<00:06:42.460> the<00:06:42.520> Gilmore<00:06:43.020> and

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
worth learning for the Gilmore and

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.400 
worth learning for the Gilmore and
equally<00:06:46.210> worth<00:06:46.420> knowing<00:06:46.780> how<00:06:46.870> it<00:06:47.020> goes<00:06:47.140> into

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
equally worth knowing how it goes into

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.410 
equally worth knowing how it goes into
your<00:06:47.740> pentatonic<00:06:48.370> shapes<00:06:48.610> okay<00:06:49.210> and

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
your pentatonic shapes okay and

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.730 
your pentatonic shapes okay and
eventually<00:06:50.080> you<00:06:50.170> want<00:06:50.260> to<00:06:50.410> do<00:06:50.470> that<00:06:50.620> with

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
eventually you want to do that with

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.040 
eventually you want to do that with
minor<00:06:51.040> and<00:06:51.400> major<00:06:51.670> but<00:06:51.970> just<00:06:52.150> start<00:06:52.480> easy<00:06:52.750> and

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
minor and major but just start easy and

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.870 
minor and major but just start easy and
gradually<00:06:53.500> build<00:06:53.800> it<00:06:53.920> up<00:06:54.040> now<00:06:54.640> the<00:06:54.700> other

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
gradually build it up now the other

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.570 
gradually build it up now the other
thing<00:06:55.150> is<00:06:55.180> those<00:06:55.420> bends<00:06:55.780> he's<00:06:56.170> notorious<00:06:56.830> 4<00:06:57.010> /

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.420 

4<00:07:00.580> /<00:07:00.880> bending<00:07:01.510> the<00:07:01.870> string<00:07:01.930> ok<00:07:02.740> so<00:07:03.160> this<00:07:03.310> is

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
4 / bending the string ok so this is

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.890 
4 / bending the string ok so this is
where<00:07:03.640> it's<00:07:03.820> worth<00:07:04.060> kind<00:07:04.360> of<00:07:04.450> knowing<00:07:04.600> where

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
where it's worth kind of knowing where

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.750 
where it's worth kind of knowing where
your<00:07:05.080> notes<00:07:05.410> in<00:07:05.620> the<00:07:05.710> full<00:07:05.890> scale<00:07:06.250> are<00:07:06.520> so

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
your notes in the full scale are so

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.570 
your notes in the full scale are so
rather<00:07:07.360> than<00:07:07.570> bending<00:07:07.870> up<00:07:07.960> to<00:07:08.110> this<00:07:08.290> note<00:07:08.580> he's

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
rather than bending up to this note he's

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.390 
rather than bending up to this note he's
bending<00:07:09.790> up<00:07:09.970> to<00:07:10.120> this<00:07:10.270> note<00:07:10.980> which<00:07:11.980> is<00:07:12.010> a<00:07:12.190> nice

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
bending up to this note which is a nice
