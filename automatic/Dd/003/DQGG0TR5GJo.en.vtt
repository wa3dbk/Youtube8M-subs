all it is this exact same setup how can
you<00:00:31.890> tell<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:32.430> low<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.579> volume<00:00:32.820> it's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you tell me that's low in volume it's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
you tell me that's low in volume it's
it's<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.840> any<00:00:34.110> other<00:00:34.410> freakin<00:00:34.920> program<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it's like any other freakin program the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.740 
it's like any other freakin program the
only<00:00:35.700> difference<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.360> gotta<00:00:36.540> monitor

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
your frequency a little bit you got to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.860 
your frequency a little bit you got to
pay<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> bit<00:00:38.610> more<00:00:38.640> attention<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.180> recovery<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pay a bit more attention to recovery and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.810
