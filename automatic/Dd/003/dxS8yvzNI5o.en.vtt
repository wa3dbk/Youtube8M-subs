the entire texture pack the way the

the entire texture pack the way the
texture<00:00:24.300> packs<00:00:24.449> work<00:00:24.630> instead<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.380> big

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410

sprite<00:00:25.980> file<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.430> now<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> be

individual<00:00:28.080> files<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.560> each<00:00:28.590> texture<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.340> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
individual files for each texture so I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.490 
individual files for each texture so I
always<00:00:29.939> thought<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.390> would<00:00:30.539> go<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.900> kind<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> do

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
always thought I would go and kind of do

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.580 
always thought I would go and kind of do
a<00:00:31.529> quick<00:00:31.740> search<00:00:31.920> find<00:00:32.279> out<00:00:32.630> which<00:00:33.630> textures

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
a quick search find out which textures

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
a quick search find out which textures
which<00:00:35.040> texture<00:00:35.399> packs<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.760> updated<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.570> far

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
which texture packs have updated so far

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.319 
which texture packs have updated so far
and<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.140> work<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.730> tell<00:00:38.790> if

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and which work so as you can tell if

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.520 
and which work so as you can tell if
you're<00:00:39.510> familiar<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.870> texture<00:00:40.200> packs<00:00:40.379> at

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
survival just showing off so the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
survival just showing off so the
different<00:01:13.140> textures<00:01:13.409> um<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.369> basically<00:01:15.090> i

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
different textures um but basically i

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
different textures um but basically i
can<00:01:15.450> only<00:01:15.540> find<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:15.990> real<00:01:16.650> decent<00:01:16.950> ones<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
can only find two real decent ones that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.789 
can only find two real decent ones that
are<00:01:17.549> working<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.720> let's<00:01:18.869> open<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.470> next

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
are working so let's open up the next

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
are working so let's open up the next
one<00:01:19.979> unfortunately<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> only<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> change

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
one unfortunately the only way to change

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
one unfortunately the only way to change
the<00:01:21.540> textures<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> game<00:01:22.830> as

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the textures are actually in the game as

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
the textures are actually in the game as
you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> tell<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.640> bunch<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.390> my<00:01:24.509> ones<00:01:25.259> don't

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you can tell a bunch of my ones don't

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.200 
you can tell a bunch of my ones don't
work<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.920> let's<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> next<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.060> does

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
work so let's go to the next one it does

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.109 
work so let's go to the next one it does
work<00:01:27.920> coterie<00:01:28.920> craft<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.670> believe<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.030> called

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
work coterie craft i believe it's called

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.069 
work coterie craft i believe it's called
this<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.780> doesn't<00:01:31.110> work<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.240> 52<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> if

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
this one doesn't work so it's 52 as if

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.770 
this one doesn't work so it's 52 as if
notice<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> switch<00:01:34.860> home<00:01:35.790> textures<00:01:36.390> well

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
notice if you switch home textures well

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.100 
notice if you switch home textures well
in<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.350> game<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.790> breaks<00:01:39.180> everything<00:01:39.780> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
in a game it just breaks everything so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
in a game it just breaks everything so
unfortunately<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.299> get<00:01:42.299> out<00:01:43.820> go<00:01:44.820> back

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
unfortunately we have to get out go back

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.230 
unfortunately we have to get out go back
in<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.430> ok<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.060> see

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
in and there we go ok as you can see

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.899 
in and there we go ok as you can see
this<00:01:48.450> texture<00:01:48.899> back<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.820> kind<00:01:50.820> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
this texture back is more of a kind of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.190 
this texture back is more of a kind of
one<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.210> fits<00:01:51.450> along<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:51.960> theme

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
one that fits along with my theme
