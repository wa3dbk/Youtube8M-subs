00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.540 

I<00:00:05.569> think<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.629> biggest<00:00:06.779> goal<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.919> create<00:00:08.519> a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
I think the biggest goal was to create a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.339 
I think the biggest goal was to create a
new<00:00:08.760> exciting<00:00:09.179> environment<00:00:09.420> for<00:00:09.960> for

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
new exciting environment for for

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.290 
new exciting environment for for
Motorola<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.400> was<00:00:11.580> an<00:00:11.670> opportunity<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
Motorola this was an opportunity to

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.090 
Motorola this was an opportunity to
bring<00:00:12.750> them<00:00:13.080> into<00:00:13.940> downtown<00:00:14.940> Chicago<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
bring them into downtown Chicago and

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.769 
bring them into downtown Chicago and
really<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.580> able<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.000> create<00:00:18.270> an<00:00:18.480> environment

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
really be able to create an environment

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.310 
really be able to create an environment
where<00:00:19.350> Motorola<00:00:20.340> engineers<00:00:20.910> could<00:00:21.150> be

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
where Motorola engineers could be

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.109 
where Motorola engineers could be
creative<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.619> innovative<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.580> really

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
creative and innovative and really

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.080 
creative and innovative and really
developed<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> next<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:25.109> wave<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.710> phones<00:00:26.220> so

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
developed the next new wave of phones so

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.880 
developed the next new wave of phones so
I<00:00:27.119> say<00:00:27.359> similar<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.349> any<00:00:28.560> large

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I say similar with with any large

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.740 
I say similar with with any large
project<00:00:29.480> with<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:31.040> an<00:00:32.040> aggressive<00:00:32.610> schedule<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
project with a an aggressive schedule is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.709 
project with a an aggressive schedule is
getting<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> right<00:00:34.469> players<00:00:34.800> involved

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
getting the right players involved

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.290 
getting the right players involved
Motorola<00:00:36.719> Mobility<00:00:37.700> it's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> six<00:00:39.120> hundred

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
Motorola Mobility it's a six hundred

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.440 
Motorola Mobility it's a six hundred
thousand<00:00:39.960> square<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:41.030> renovation<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.300> an

80<00:00:43.079> year<00:00:43.350> old<00:00:43.379> building<00:00:43.879> these<00:00:44.879> environments

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
80 year old building these environments

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.470 
80 year old building these environments
kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:47.000> are<00:00:48.000> sort<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
kind of they are sort of out of the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.920 
kind of they are sort of out of the
ordinary<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:49.340> happened<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.730> building

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
ordinary what happened in this building

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.680 
ordinary what happened in this building
was<00:00:51.930> bigger<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.940> more<00:00:54.090> complex<00:00:54.480> than

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
was bigger and I think more complex than

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
was bigger and I think more complex than
most<00:00:54.719> people<00:00:55.230> really<00:00:55.410> realize<00:00:55.590> cause<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
most people really realize cause the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.869 
most people really realize cause the
contact<00:00:57.239> between<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.800> engineering<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
contact between the engineering the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.810 
contact between the engineering the
construction<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> architect<00:01:00.750> ability

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
construction and the architect ability

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
construction and the architect ability
600,000<00:01:02.820> square<00:01:02.910> feet<00:01:03.090> from<00:01:04.080> interiors

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
600,000 square feet from interiors

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.460 
600,000 square feet from interiors
perspective<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.299> challenging<00:01:06.540> coming

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
perspective is very challenging coming

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.170 
perspective is very challenging coming
in<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> think<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.490> allowing<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
in here I think we are allowing it to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
in here I think we are allowing it to
really<00:01:09.510> immerse<00:01:09.810> himself<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:10.799> makes

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
really immerse himself in what makes

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.230 
really immerse himself in what makes
this<00:01:11.490> area<00:01:11.909> right<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.799> uniquely<00:01:13.799> Chicago

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
this area right here so uniquely Chicago

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
this area right here so uniquely Chicago
multiple<00:01:16.079> operations<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.070> or

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
different floors a lot of technology in

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.210 
different floors a lot of technology in
this<00:01:20.700> space<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.920> rolled<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.070> their

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this space really rolled up their

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.240 
this space really rolled up their
sleeves<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:24.210> wanted<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.689> location<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.130> be

sleeves they wanted this location to be

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
sleeves they wanted this location to be
something<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> fostered<00:01:27.740> collaboration

something that fostered collaboration
and<00:01:28.860> creativity<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.610> employees<00:01:30.030> are

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and creativity and that employees are

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
and creativity and that employees are
gonna<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> lot<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.930> guys<00:01:31.140> down<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.770> just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
kind of a fervor of construction we were

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760 
kind of a fervor of construction we were
taking<00:01:35.729> down<00:01:35.909> structural<00:01:36.720> walls<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.380> there's
