hi<00:00:07.300> everybody<00:00:07.840> in<00:00:08.559> my<00:00:08.710> previous<00:00:08.980> F<00:00:09.340> 12

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
hi everybody in my previous F 12

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.150 
hi everybody in my previous F 12
tutorial<00:00:10.090> I<00:00:10.270> talked<00:00:11.139> about<00:00:11.260> going<00:00:11.740> slow<00:00:11.950> and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
tutorial I talked about going slow and

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.779 
tutorial I talked about going slow and
looking<00:00:12.460> at<00:00:12.639> and<00:00:13.000> solving<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.450> F<00:00:13.690> 12<00:00:13.809> pairs

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
looking at and solving the F 12 pairs

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.830 
looking at and solving the F 12 pairs
everybody<00:00:15.789> has<00:00:16.059> heard<00:00:16.209> of<00:00:16.299> that<00:00:16.420> and<00:00:16.630> knows

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
everybody has heard of that and knows

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.529 
everybody has heard of that and knows
how<00:00:17.080> important<00:00:17.530> it<00:00:17.619> is<00:00:17.770> but<00:00:18.640> I<00:00:18.700> feel<00:00:18.789> that<00:00:19.270> the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
how important it is but I feel that the

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.480 
how important it is but I feel that the
transition<00:00:20.110> from<00:00:20.260> the<00:00:20.410> cross<00:00:20.619> to<00:00:20.650> f12<00:00:21.340> is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
transition from the cross to f12 is

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.420 
transition from the cross to f12 is
overlooked<00:00:22.150> if<00:00:23.020> you<00:00:23.650> have<00:00:23.740> a<00:00:23.770> good<00:00:24.040> transition

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
overlooked if you have a good transition

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.090 
overlooked if you have a good transition
from<00:00:24.790> the<00:00:24.910> cross<00:00:25.120> left<00:00:25.360> wall<00:00:25.660> it<00:00:26.410> can<00:00:26.560> save<00:00:26.830> you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
from the cross left wall it can save you

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.520 
from the cross left wall it can save you
from<00:00:27.400> about<00:00:28.150> 1<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.660> 3<00:00:28.690> seconds<00:00:29.260> of<00:00:29.350> your<00:00:29.470> time

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
from about 1 to 3 seconds of your time

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.400 
from about 1 to 3 seconds of your time
but<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.700> really<00:00:31.060> depends<00:00:31.480> how<00:00:31.930> fast<00:00:32.140> you<00:00:32.320> learn

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
but it really depends how fast you learn

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.220 
but it really depends how fast you learn
also<00:00:33.340> it<00:00:33.610> makes<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:34.270> rest<00:00:34.450> of<00:00:34.629> it<00:00:34.780> looking

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
also it makes the rest of it looking

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.100 
also it makes the rest of it looking
ahead<00:00:35.379> after<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:35.950> little<00:00:36.399> bit<00:00:36.550> smoother<00:00:37.110> in

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
ahead after a little bit smoother in

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.290 
ahead after a little bit smoother in
this<00:00:38.350> tutorial<00:00:38.500> I'm<00:00:39.070> going<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.760> teach<00:00:40.090> you<00:00:40.120> a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
this tutorial I'm going to teach you a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.090 
this tutorial I'm going to teach you a
technique<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.840> use<00:00:41.079> while<00:00:41.530> solving<00:00:41.740> the<00:00:41.890> cross

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
technique to use while solving the cross

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.760 
technique to use while solving the cross
so<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.060> can<00:00:43.329> have<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:43.960> smooth<00:00:44.350> transition

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
so you can have a smooth transition

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.750 
so you can have a smooth transition
across<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.730> f12<00:00:47.190> before<00:00:48.190> watching<00:00:48.430> this<00:00:48.610> video

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
across to f12 before watching this video

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.330 
across to f12 before watching this video
I'd<00:00:49.480> recommend<00:00:49.930> that<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.560> should<00:00:50.770> be<00:00:50.920> able<00:00:51.040> to

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
I'd recommend that you should be able to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.120 
I'd recommend that you should be able to
solve<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.760> COTS<00:00:51.970> in<00:00:52.270> under<00:00:53.050> 4<00:00:53.260> seconds<00:00:53.680> if<00:00:54.070> you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
solve the COTS in under 4 seconds if you

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.590 
solve the COTS in under 4 seconds if you
can't<00:00:54.460> do<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:54.610> then<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.090> would<00:00:55.210> recommend

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
can't do that then I would recommend

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.930 
can't do that then I would recommend
watching<00:00:55.780> about<00:00:56.140> in<00:00:56.290> future<00:00:56.440> videos<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.250> for

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
watching about in future videos and for

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.240 
watching about in future videos and for
the<00:00:58.090> rest<00:00:58.270> of<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.540> F<00:00:58.660> tool<00:00:58.870> I<00:00:59.140> would<00:00:59.649> recommend

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
the rest of the F tool I would recommend

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.979 
the rest of the F tool I would recommend
being<00:01:00.430> able<00:01:00.700> to<00:01:00.880> solve<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.329> in<00:01:01.450> about<00:01:01.660> 12

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
being able to solve it in about 12

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.170 
being able to solve it in about 12
seconds<00:01:02.410> or<00:01:02.530> less<00:01:02.649> if<00:01:03.309> you<00:01:03.489> can't<00:01:03.730> do<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:04.030> I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
seconds or less if you can't do that I

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.700 
seconds or less if you can't do that I
would<00:01:04.479> strongly<00:01:04.750> recommend<00:01:04.899> watching<00:01:05.439> my

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
would strongly recommend watching my

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.940 
would strongly recommend watching my
looking<00:01:06.100> head<00:01:06.399> tutorial<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:08.170> after<00:01:08.590> well<00:01:08.740> and

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
looking head tutorial on after well and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.719 
looking head tutorial on after well and
bad<00:01:09.700> enough<00:01:09.880> ystos<00:01:10.210> f12<00:01:10.720> videos<00:01:10.990> ok<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.580> you've

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
bad enough ystos f12 videos ok so you've

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.520 
bad enough ystos f12 videos ok so you've
heard<00:01:12.940> me<00:01:13.150> saying<00:01:13.420> how<00:01:13.659> important<00:01:14.229> getting

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
heard me saying how important getting

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.770 
heard me saying how important getting
good<00:01:14.770> at<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.340> cost<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.820> F<00:01:15.970> tolls<00:01:16.240> transition

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
good at the cost to F tolls transition

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.230 
good at the cost to F tolls transition
is<00:01:16.960> so<00:01:17.830> what<00:01:18.040> exactly<00:01:18.190> needs<00:01:18.549> to<00:01:18.790> be<00:01:18.909> improved

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
is so what exactly needs to be improved

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.510 
is so what exactly needs to be improved
on<00:01:19.390> a<00:01:19.659> lot<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.380> people<00:01:20.680> when<00:01:21.040> solving<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
on a lot of people when solving the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.399 
on a lot of people when solving the
first<00:01:21.729> two<00:01:21.850> layers<00:01:22.060> stop<00:01:22.720> for<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.020> couple<00:01:23.380> of

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
first two layers stop for a couple of

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.990 
first two layers stop for a couple of
seconds<00:01:23.770> between<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.250> cross<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.760> first

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
seconds between the cross and the first

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120 
seconds between the cross and the first
f12<00:01:25.450> pair<00:01:25.630> because<00:01:26.320> after<00:01:26.650> they<00:01:26.770> finish<00:01:27.040> the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
f12 pair because after they finish the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.310 
f12 pair because after they finish the
cross<00:01:27.340> they<00:01:27.670> have<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:27.940> look<00:01:28.180> for<00:01:28.510> an<00:01:28.780> F<00:01:29.110> tall

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
cross they have to look for an F tall

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.950 
cross they have to look for an F tall
pair<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.610> doesn't<00:01:30.940> sound<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.240> much<00:01:31.479> but<00:01:31.810> if

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
pair it doesn't sound that much but if

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.050 
pair it doesn't sound that much but if
you<00:01:31.990> remove<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.619> pause<00:01:33.040> you<00:01:33.520> can<00:01:33.549> get<00:01:33.850> rid<00:01:34.030> of

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
you remove that pause you can get rid of

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.179 
you remove that pause you can get rid of
one<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.600> three<00:01:34.630> seconds<00:01:35.229> after<00:01:35.409> time<00:01:35.860> that

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
one to three seconds after time that

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.399 
one to three seconds after time that
you've<00:01:36.340> been<00:01:36.520> trying<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.909> do<00:01:37.030> for<00:01:37.060> weeks<00:01:37.420> now

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
you've been trying to do for weeks now

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.380 
you've been trying to do for weeks now
you<00:01:38.470> might<00:01:38.740> be<00:01:38.860> wondering<00:01:39.100> why<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.729> this<00:01:40.119> pause

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
you might be wondering why is this pause

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.039 
you might be wondering why is this pause
happen<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:42.400> my<00:01:42.520> previous<00:01:42.909> F<00:01:43.180> tool<00:01:43.420> tutorial<00:01:43.900> I

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
happen in my previous F tool tutorial I

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.080 
happen in my previous F tool tutorial I
talked<00:01:44.890> about<00:01:44.979> looking<00:01:45.340> ahead<00:01:45.460> when<00:01:45.820> solving

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
talked about looking ahead when solving

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.719 
talked about looking ahead when solving
the<00:01:46.299> corner<00:01:46.570> edge<00:01:46.810> pairs<00:01:47.189> when<00:01:48.189> solving<00:01:48.490> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
the corner edge pairs when solving the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.219 
the corner edge pairs when solving the
first<00:01:48.880> fare<00:01:49.180> you're<00:01:49.540> looking<00:01:49.840> at<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.020> pieces

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
first fare you're looking at the pieces

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.899 
first fare you're looking at the pieces
for<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.680> second<00:01:51.070> pair<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.520> you'll<00:01:51.640> solve

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
for the second pair that you'll solve

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.830 
for the second pair that you'll solve
next<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.619> second<00:01:53.950> pair<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.130> taken<00:01:54.549> care<00:01:54.759> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
next so the second pair is taken care of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.510 
next so the second pair is taken care of
when<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.900> solving<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.350> second<00:01:56.710> pair<00:01:56.860> you're

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
when you solving the second pair you're

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.160 
when you solving the second pair you're
looking<00:01:57.820> for<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.090> pieces<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.720> third<00:01:58.930> pair

looking for the pieces of the third pair

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.789 
looking for the pieces of the third pair
so<00:02:00.159> that's<00:02:00.430> their<00:02:00.610> pairs<00:02:00.880> taken<00:02:01.180> care<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.509> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
so that's their pairs taken care of and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.719 
so that's their pairs taken care of and
when<00:02:02.799> you're<00:02:02.920> solving<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.340> third<00:02:03.520> pair

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
when you're solving the third pair

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.249 
when you're solving the third pair
you're<00:02:04.119> looking<00:02:04.390> for<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.659> pieces<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.170> the

you're looking for the pieces of the
fourth<00:02:05.500> day<00:02:05.680> so<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.700> last<00:02:06.880> pair<00:02:07.119> is<00:02:07.210> taken

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
fourth day so the last pair is taken

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.649 
fourth day so the last pair is taken
care<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.159> second<00:02:09.549> third<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.299> fourth

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659

there<00:02:24.910> are<00:02:25.030> four<00:02:25.209> pieces<00:02:25.420> instead<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.200> two<00:02:26.440> for

of<00:03:34.120> being<00:03:34.180> able<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.750> solve<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.079> cost<00:03:35.319> without

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
of being able to solve the cost without

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.740 
of being able to solve the cost without
looking<00:03:36.010> at<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.220> pieces<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.599> can

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
looking at the pieces is that you can

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.080 
looking at the pieces is that you can
solve<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.079> cost<00:03:38.319> with<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.650> pauses<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.280> see<00:03:40.060> a

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
solve the cost with that pauses I see a

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.360 
solve the cost with that pauses I see a
lot<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.329> people<00:03:40.720> they<00:03:41.620> keep<00:03:41.859> on<00:03:42.069> stopping

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
lot of people they keep on stopping

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.620 
lot of people they keep on stopping
between<00:03:42.670> inserting<00:03:43.239> cross<00:03:43.450> pieces<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:45.630> they

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
between inserting cross pieces like they

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.240 
between inserting cross pieces like they
look<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.620> then<00:03:49.049> sort<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:50.109> like<00:03:50.169> stopping<00:03:50.950> it

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
look and then sort of like stopping it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.470 
look and then sort of like stopping it
and<00:03:51.489> when<00:03:52.000> Southwest<00:03:52.480> all<00:03:52.630> pairs<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:55.209> if<00:03:55.359> you

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
and when Southwest all pairs but if you

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.150 
and when Southwest all pairs but if you
really<00:03:55.569> know<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.989> solution<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.650> solve<00:03:57.069> them

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
really know the solution to solve them

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.890 
really know the solution to solve them
across<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.849> can<00:03:58.030> solve<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.359> cross<00:03:58.569> without

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
across you can solve the cross without

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.490 
across you can solve the cross without
stopping

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
sort of like executing an algorithm so

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.069 
sort of like executing an algorithm so
how<00:04:03.370> exactly<00:04:03.519> do<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.060> go<00:04:04.329> about<00:04:04.599> solving<00:04:04.840> the

even more if you have a really bad
transition<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.850> should<00:04:43.000> also<00:04:43.150> remember<00:04:43.390> that

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
transition you should also remember that

don't<00:04:46.060> go<00:04:46.270> full<00:04:46.540> speed<00:04:46.770> like<00:04:47.770> when<00:04:47.950> solving

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
don't go full speed like when solving

don't go full speed like when solving
the<00:04:48.370> f2o<00:04:48.670> parents<00:04:49.000> go<00:04:49.360> slow<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.840> looking

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
ahead but don't go too slow you should

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.610 
ahead but don't go too slow you should
be<00:04:52.240> able<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.480> solve<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.870> cost<00:04:53.080> most<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.560> the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
be able to solve the cost most of the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.010 
be able to solve the cost most of the
time<00:04:53.800> under<00:04:54.070> 3.5<00:04:54.730> seconds<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.360> still<00:04:55.810> looking

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
ahead you should keep in mind that this

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.860 
ahead you should keep in mind that this
transition<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.550> very<00:05:00.790> important<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.600> improve

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
transition is very important to improve

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.770 
transition is very important to improve
their<00:05:02.140> f2l<00:05:02.730> because<00:05:03.730> not<00:05:03.910> only<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.390> gets<00:05:04.540> rid

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
their f2l because not only it gets rid

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.380 
their f2l because not only it gets rid
of<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:04.900> pause<00:05:05.490> but<00:05:06.490> then<00:05:06.640> it<00:05:06.790> makes<00:05:07.000> looking

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
of that pause but then it makes looking

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.450 
of that pause but then it makes looking
ahead<00:05:07.480> for<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.080> other<00:05:08.260> f2o<00:05:08.710> pairs<00:05:08.980> a<00:05:09.160> little

ahead for the other f2o pairs a little

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.820 
ahead for the other f2o pairs a little
bit<00:05:09.550> easier<00:05:09.870> look<00:05:10.870> at<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.170> current<00:05:11.470> time<00:05:11.620> for

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
bit easier look at the current time for

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.580 
bit easier look at the current time for

making this video my F toe is around 10

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.730 
making this video my F toe is around 10
seconds<00:05:15.010> like<00:05:15.460> average<00:05:15.910> but<00:05:16.780> if<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:17.170> can<00:05:17.410> get<00:05:17.590> a

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
seconds like average but if I can get a

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.580 
seconds like average but if I can get a
good<00:05:18.040> cost<00:05:18.400> after<00:05:18.700> all<00:05:18.940> transition<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:20.380> can

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
good cost after all transition it can

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.830 
good cost after all transition it can
get<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:21.220> nine<00:05:21.610> seconds<00:05:22.060> or<00:05:22.180> eight<00:05:22.330> seconds<00:05:22.720> and

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
get to nine seconds or eight seconds and

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.900 
get to nine seconds or eight seconds and
then<00:05:23.380> it<00:05:23.650> gives<00:05:23.830> me<00:05:23.950> pretty<00:05:24.220> good<00:05:24.430> times<00:05:24.640> in

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
then it gives me pretty good times in

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.810 
then it gives me pretty good times in
normal<00:05:25.530> another<00:05:26.530> tip<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:27.160> may<00:05:27.340> be<00:05:27.400> helpful

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
normal another tip that may be helpful

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.610 
normal another tip that may be helpful
to<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.000> is<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.600> when<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:28.900> solve<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.380> cross

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
to you is that when you solve the cross

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.490 
to you is that when you solve the cross
when<00:05:30.160> you're<00:05:30.430> inspecting<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:32.169> should<00:05:32.350> look

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
when you're inspecting you should look

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.130 
when you're inspecting you should look
not<00:05:32.560> only<00:05:32.830> for<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.520> class<00:05:33.730> solution<00:05:34.300> but<00:05:34.960> also

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
not only for the class solution but also

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.320 
not only for the class solution but also
maybe<00:05:35.890> an<00:05:36.040> F<00:05:36.190> to<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.430> pair<00:05:36.640> that<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.880> can<00:05:37.090> use

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
maybe an F to a pair that you can use

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.980 
maybe an F to a pair that you can use
after<00:05:38.169> you<00:05:38.290> finish<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.740> cross<00:05:39.419> so<00:05:40.419> this<00:05:40.810> is

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
after you finish the cross so this is

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.290 
after you finish the cross so this is
what<00:05:41.110> my<00:05:41.230> cost<00:05:41.470> looks<00:05:41.710> like<00:05:42.090> right<00:05:43.090> now

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
what my cost looks like right now

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.969 
what my cost looks like right now
and<00:05:43.919> I<00:05:44.919> see<00:05:45.550> this<00:05:45.700> cross<00:05:46.090> piece<00:05:46.390> and<00:05:46.960> after<00:05:47.860> I'm

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
and I see this cross piece and after I'm

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.270 
and I see this cross piece and after I'm
done<00:05:48.520> solving<00:05:48.790> the<00:05:48.970> cross<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:50.050> can<00:05:50.290> use

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
done solving the cross and I can use

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.730 
done solving the cross and I can use
this<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.700> find<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.150> edge<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:53.320> I'm<00:05:53.410> gonna<00:05:53.560> set

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
this and find the edge so I'm gonna set

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.659 
this and find the edge so I'm gonna set
the<00:05:53.830> cost<00:05:54.010> right<00:05:54.130> now<00:05:58.560> okay<00:05:59.560> so<00:05:59.770> I<00:06:00.040> already<00:06:00.370> saw

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
the cost right now okay so I already saw

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.670 
the cost right now okay so I already saw
this<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.690> edges<00:06:01.960> here<00:06:02.080> so<00:06:02.290> I<00:06:02.440> can

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
this and the edges here so I can

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.230 
this and the edges here so I can
immediately<00:06:02.770> go<00:06:03.190> on<00:06:03.220> here<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:05.160> do<00:06:06.160> the<00:06:06.340> FSF

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
immediately go on here and do the FSF

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.540 
immediately go on here and do the FSF
tool<00:06:07.419> I<00:06:07.690> don't<00:06:08.200> know<00:06:08.350> if<00:06:08.560> this<00:06:09.040> technique<00:06:09.400> is

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
tool I don't know if this technique is

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.850 
tool I don't know if this technique is
really<00:06:09.880> that<00:06:10.240> much<00:06:10.510> helpful<00:06:10.960> like<00:06:11.500> I<00:06:11.680> don't

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
really that much helpful like I don't

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.980 
really that much helpful like I don't
use<00:06:12.010> it<00:06:12.040> that<00:06:12.190> much<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:13.120> don't<00:06:13.360> it<00:06:13.840> doesn't

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
use it that much and I don't it doesn't

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.180 
use it that much and I don't it doesn't
really<00:06:14.290> help<00:06:14.470> me<00:06:14.620> that<00:06:14.800> much

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
really help me that much

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.400 
really help me that much
but<00:06:15.520> some<00:06:16.000> fast<00:06:16.240> people<00:06:16.479> like<00:06:16.780> felix's<00:06:17.260> and

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
but some fast people like felix's and

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.040 
but some fast people like felix's and
eggs<00:06:17.650> say<00:06:18.250> it's<00:06:19.060> really<00:06:19.330> good<00:06:19.510> to<00:06:19.600> use<00:06:19.750> it<00:06:19.930> in

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
eggs say it's really good to use it in

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.650 
eggs say it's really good to use it in
yourself<00:06:20.380> so<00:06:20.650> maybe<00:06:21.400> he<00:06:21.850> knows<00:06:22.000> what<00:06:22.210> he's

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
yourself so maybe he knows what he's

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.510 
yourself so maybe he knows what he's
talking<00:06:22.960> about<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.140> I<00:06:23.320> don't<00:06:23.380> yes<00:06:24.040> so<00:06:24.190> try<00:06:24.490> it

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
talking about and I don't yes so try it

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.450 
talking about and I don't yes so try it
out<00:06:24.640> maybe<00:06:24.910> you'll<00:06:25.900> find<00:06:26.140> it<00:06:26.229> helpful<00:06:26.460> so

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
out maybe you'll find it helpful so

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.370 
out maybe you'll find it helpful so
remember<00:06:27.880> to<00:06:28.060> get<00:06:28.210> good<00:06:28.479> at<00:06:28.690> solving<00:06:28.990> cost

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
remember to get good at solving cost

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.620 
remember to get good at solving cost
blindfolded<00:06:29.979> and<00:06:30.190> then<00:06:30.400> use<00:06:31.090> that<00:06:31.120> technique

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
blindfolded and then use that technique

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.080 
blindfolded and then use that technique
at<00:06:31.840> not<00:06:32.080> looking<00:06:32.530> in<00:06:32.590> the<00:06:32.650> cross<00:06:32.830> pieces<00:06:33.090> and

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
at not looking in the cross pieces and

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.780 
at not looking in the cross pieces and
use<00:06:34.390> it<00:06:34.510> in<00:06:34.600> yourselves<00:06:34.960> and<00:06:35.640> eventually<00:06:36.640> if

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
use it in yourselves and eventually if

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.190 
use it in yourselves and eventually if
you<00:06:36.820> practice<00:06:37.270> a<00:06:37.300> lot<00:06:37.479> you'll<00:06:37.840> see<00:06:38.080> an

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
you practice a lot you'll see an

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.980 
you practice a lot you'll see an
improvement<00:06:38.350> in<00:06:38.680> your<00:06:38.740> times<00:06:39.330> so<00:06:40.330> I<00:06:40.660> hope<00:06:40.870> this
