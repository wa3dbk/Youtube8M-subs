you're sanding down the logos and the
imprint<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.100> actually<00:02:05.219> use

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
imprint and then you can actually use

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.969 
imprint and then you can actually use
your<00:02:05.520> own<00:02:05.700> makers<00:02:06.060> mark<00:02:06.770> stamping<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.860> there

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
your own makers mark stamping in there

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
your own makers mark stamping in there
and<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> sudden<00:02:08.849> inlay<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.450> your

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and then use a sudden inlay on your

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.150 
and then use a sudden inlay on your
handle<00:02:10.709> I'll<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:11.790> of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
handle I'll be kind of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920

the second is worth about five bucks or
so<00:02:21.450> 550<00:02:22.450> somewhere<00:02:22.750> around<00:02:22.810> there<00:02:23.050> as<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.530> write

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
so 550 somewhere around there as I write

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.260 
so 550 somewhere around there as I write
the<00:02:23.950> second<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:24.940> course<00:02:25.150> that's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
the second but of course that's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.390 
the second but of course that's
constantly<00:02:25.720> changing<00:02:26.110> five<00:02:26.290> grams<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.710> 0.16

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
