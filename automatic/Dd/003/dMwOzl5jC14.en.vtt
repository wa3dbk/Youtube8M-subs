part<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> team<00:00:28.289> but<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.130> main<00:00:29.369> issue<00:00:29.610> with

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
part of the team but my main issue with

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.460 
part of the team but my main issue with
this<00:00:30.000> movie<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:30.750> don't<00:00:30.990> get<00:00:31.170> enough

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
this movie is that they don't get enough

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.500 
this movie is that they don't get enough
screen<00:00:31.680> time<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.279> feel<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> movie<00:00:33.480> was

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
screen time I feel like if the movie was

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
screen time I feel like if the movie was
longer<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.199> pacing<00:00:34.590> would<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> lot<00:00:35.070> better

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
longer the pacing would be a lot better

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.010 
longer the pacing would be a lot better
because<00:00:35.940> our<00:00:36.090> characters<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.540> introduced

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
because our characters are introduced

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110 
because our characters are introduced
then<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.770> couple<00:00:38.010> scenes<00:00:38.310> later<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:38.850> become<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
then a couple scenes later they become a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.310 
then a couple scenes later they become a
part<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> team<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
part of the team and then they have a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.310 
part of the team and then they have a
montage<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> everything<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.300> don't<00:00:43.079> know

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
montage and everything and I don't know

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.340 
montage and everything and I don't know
it<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.710> feels<00:00:44.100> very<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:45.180> quick<00:00:45.600> maybe<00:00:46.140> it's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it just feels very very quick maybe it's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.479 
it just feels very very quick maybe it's
just<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.590> fact<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.950> saw<00:00:47.190> too<00:00:47.399> many

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
just the fact that I saw too many

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.310 
just the fact that I saw too many
trailers<00:00:47.940> before<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.630> to<00:00:48.720> see<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.989> movie

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
trailers before going to see this movie

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.750 
trailers before going to see this movie
or<00:00:49.620> maybe<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.040> way<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> trailers<00:00:50.640> were

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
or maybe it's the way the trailers were

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.479 
or maybe it's the way the trailers were
presented<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.530> feel<00:00:52.710> like<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.160> didn't

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
presented but I just feel like I didn't

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
presented but I just feel like I didn't
get<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> full<00:00:54.090> movie<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> focus<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.620> Hiro

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
get a full movie there's a focus on Hiro

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.709 
get a full movie there's a focus on Hiro
and<00:00:56.040> baymax<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:56.969> good<00:00:57.239> because<00:00:57.420> they

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and baymax and that's good because they

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 
and baymax and that's good because they
work<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.140> well<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.739> each<00:00:58.860> other<00:00:59.040> but

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
work really well off of each other but

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.880 
work really well off of each other but
the<00:00:59.730> other<00:00:59.760> characters<00:01:00.420> they're<00:01:00.719> all

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
the other characters they're all

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.110 
the other characters they're all
interesting<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:01.980> their<00:01:02.100> own<00:01:02.190> way<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> guess<00:01:02.790> but

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
interesting in their own way I guess but

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.200 
interesting in their own way I guess but
I<00:01:03.450> just<00:01:04.350> felt<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.040> were<00:01:05.100> unnecessary<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
I just felt like they were unnecessary I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
I just felt like they were unnecessary I
know<00:01:06.539> they're<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> part<00:01:07.109> of<00:01:07.139> the<00:01:07.259> comic<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
know they're a part of the comic and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.949 
know they're a part of the comic and
that's<00:01:07.979> why<00:01:08.219> they're<00:01:08.399> in<00:01:08.429> this<00:01:08.759> movie<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.359> it

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:09.959 
that's why they're in this movie but it

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.660 
that's why they're in this movie but it
just<00:01:10.229> feels<00:01:10.469> so<00:01:10.590> weird<00:01:10.950> having<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.639> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
just feels so weird having them be a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
just feels so weird having them be a
part<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.969> the<00:01:12.060> team<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.509> quickly<00:01:12.899> and<00:01:13.139> I<00:01:13.409> just

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
part of the team so quickly and I just

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
part of the team so quickly and I just
feel<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.219> movie<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.520> maybe<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.090> 20

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
feel like if the movie was maybe like 20

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.599 
feel like if the movie was maybe like 20
minutes<00:01:16.049> longer<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.829> would<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> felt<00:01:17.429> better

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
minutes longer it would have felt better

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.059 
minutes longer it would have felt better
I<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.149> I<00:01:18.270> say<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> feel<00:01:18.810> things<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:19.950> be

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.069 
I know I say I feel things would be

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:22.219 
I know I say I feel things would be
better<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.520> certain<00:01:20.850> ways<00:01:21.029> but<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:21.899> just

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
better in certain ways but that's just

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.370 
better in certain ways but that's just
the<00:01:22.499> way<00:01:22.649> I<00:01:22.679> feel<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:24.139> don't<00:01:25.139> get<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.350> wrong

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the way I feel now don't get me wrong

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
the way I feel now don't get me wrong
this<00:01:25.859> movie<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.219> still<00:01:26.429> really<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.329> a

there are some pretty real moments in

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.889 
there are some pretty real moments in
this<00:01:31.999> unfortunately<00:01:32.999> they<00:01:33.149> would<00:01:33.299> feel<00:01:33.569> more

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
this unfortunately they would feel more

shouldn't<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.319> a<00:01:55.349> spoiler<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.189> they've

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
shouldn't be a spoiler because they've

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.789 
shouldn't be a spoiler because they've
revealed<00:01:57.359> it<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:57.659> trailers<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.259> Tadashi

is<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> movie<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> good<00:01:59.969> chunk<00:02:00.239> of<00:02:00.389> it

is in the movie for a good chunk of it
so<00:02:00.869> I'm<00:02:00.989> wondering<00:02:01.349> why<00:02:01.499> they<00:02:01.679> chose<00:02:01.919> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979

so I'm wondering why they chose to
reveal<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.489> in<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.669> trailers<00:02:02.999> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.179> first
