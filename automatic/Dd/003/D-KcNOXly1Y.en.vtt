day two on the GFS it always says look

underneath for the next three to five
days<00:01:42.689> always<00:01:43.530> gotta<00:01:43.740> watch<00:01:43.829> under<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.399> when

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
days always gotta watch under here when

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.710 
days always gotta watch under here when
there's<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> big<00:01:44.939> Ridge<00:01:45.119> over<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> eastern

there's a big Ridge over the eastern

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.569 
there's a big Ridge over the eastern
seaboard<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.829> keep<00:01:46.979> an<00:01:47.130> eye<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
seaboard so we will keep an eye on that

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.389

here's<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> mjo<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.909> right<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.320> hard

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
here's the mjo and right now it's hard

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.539 
here's the mjo and right now it's hard

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
to see but here's the initialization

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.819 
to see but here's the initialization
it's<00:02:03.090> moving<00:02:03.930> into<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.229> inner<00:02:04.439> circle

it's moving into this inner circle

circle it means its amplitude is fairly

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.190 
circle it means its amplitude is fairly
low<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> very<00:02:08.849> strong<00:02:09.179> signal<00:02:09.660> but

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
low so it's not a very strong signal but

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.839 
low so it's not a very strong signal but
it's<00:02:10.319> still<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.890> near<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.280> know<00:02:11.430> phases

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
a bad bias that direction and remember

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.050 
a bad bias that direction and remember
it<00:02:57.440> had<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.770> spiking<00:02:58.370> way<00:02:58.490> over<00:02:58.700> here<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:58.970> then

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
it had it spiking way over here and then

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.090 
it had it spiking way over here and then
coming<00:02:59.360> back<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.990> European<00:03:00.590> ended<00:03:00.800> up<00:03:00.890> being

coming back the European ended up being

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.740 
coming back the European ended up being
right<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.460> it<00:03:01.550> slowly<00:03:01.790> comes<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.270> way<00:03:02.510> and

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
right that it slowly comes this way and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.600 
right that it slowly comes this way and
to<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.590> what<00:03:03.740> occurred<00:03:04.010> but<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:04.400> see

to that is what occurred but you can see

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.660 
to that is what occurred but you can see
the<00:03:05.380> spaghetti<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.680> all<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.950> models<00:03:07.250> sitting

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
the spaghetti of all the models sitting

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.740 
the spaghetti of all the models sitting
in<00:03:07.760> here<00:03:07.880> really<00:03:08.150> don't<00:03:08.330> know<00:03:08.420> what<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.540> do

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
in here really don't know what to do

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.030 
in here really don't know what to do
with<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.080> lot<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.380> them<00:03:09.500> though<00:03:09.650> are<00:03:09.740> hinting

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
with it a lot of them though are hinting

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.100 
with it a lot of them though are hinting
at<00:03:10.160> it<00:03:10.280> coming<00:03:10.550> back<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:10.880> direction<00:03:11.300> if<00:03:11.720> so

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
at it coming back this direction if so

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.320 
at it coming back this direction if so
it's<00:03:12.680> going<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.010> mean<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.220> more<00:03:13.430> active<00:03:13.820> August

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
it's going to mean a more active August

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.930 
it's going to mean a more active August
for<00:03:14.540> us<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.990> as<00:03:15.650> soon<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.250> next<00:03:16.550> time<00:03:16.760> it

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
for us and as soon the next time it

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.490 
for us and as soon the next time it
comes<00:03:17.060> back<00:03:17.330> around<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.960> it<00:03:18.080> may<00:03:18.260> play

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
comes back around here it may play

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.620 
comes back around here it may play
around<00:03:18.800> in<00:03:19.010> here<00:03:19.400> but<00:03:19.850> even<00:03:20.060> if<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.210> does<00:03:20.420> so

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
around in here but even if it does so

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.030 
around in here but even if it does so
the<00:03:20.750> next<00:03:20.900> time<00:03:21.110> we<00:03:21.230> get<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.620> here<00:03:21.860> we're

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
the next time we get it in here we're

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.290 
the next time we get it in here we're
going<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.310> be<00:03:22.400> near<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.760> peak<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> season

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
going to be near the peak of the season

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.080 
going to be near the peak of the season
August<00:03:23.930> fifteenth<00:03:24.140> through<00:03:25.100> October<00:03:25.910> first

and once we get there the next time the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.490 
and once we get there the next time the
MGO<00:03:29.240> comes<00:03:29.510> around<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:29.990> probably<00:03:30.260> when<00:03:30.410> the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
MGO comes around is probably when the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.040 
MGO comes around is probably when the
season<00:03:30.770> will<00:03:30.890> really<00:03:31.100> start<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.520> earnest<00:03:32.050> now

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050

here's the GFS 00 i want to show you one

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.850 
here's the GFS 00 i want to show you one
thing<00:03:35.420> here<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:35.990> 700<00:03:36.560> middle<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.770> our

thing here this is the 700 middle of our

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.470 
thing here this is the 700 middle of our
height<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.280> winds<00:03:37.520> we're<00:03:37.850> going<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.240> count

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
height and winds we're going to count

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.210 
height and winds we're going to count
off<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:39.170> tropical<00:03:39.680> waves<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:40.010> come<00:03:40.160> off

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
off the tropical waves that come off

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.090 
off the tropical waves that come off
africa<00:03:40.700> during<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.570> next<00:03:41.720> 15<00:03:42.170> days<00:03:42.200> here's

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
africa during the next 15 days here's

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.040 
africa during the next 15 days here's
our<00:03:43.280> zero<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.030> number<00:03:44.210> one<00:03:44.510> coming<00:03:44.930> off

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
our zero this is number one coming off

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.930 
our zero this is number one coming off
right<00:03:45.290> now<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.500> nice<00:03:45.740> strong<00:03:46.010> way<00:03:46.250> if<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.610> go<00:03:46.790> it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
right now a nice strong way if we go it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.930 
right now a nice strong way if we go it
in<00:03:47.030> time<00:03:47.270> here<00:03:47.800> there's<00:03:48.800> number<00:03:49.160> two<00:03:49.340> coming

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
in time here there's number two coming

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.630 
in time here there's number two coming
off<00:03:50.180> near<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.840> Cape<00:03:51.050> Verde<00:03:51.170> Islands<00:03:51.680> there's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
off near the Cape Verde Islands there's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.080 
off near the Cape Verde Islands there's
three<00:03:53.530> all<00:03:54.530> right<00:03:54.740> then<00:03:55.730> four<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:56.680> then<00:03:58.090> five

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
three all right then four and then five

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.600 
three all right then four and then five
so<00:03:59.840> we<00:04:00.050> have<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.230> lot<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.620> waves<00:04:00.890> coming<00:04:01.220> off<00:04:01.430> and

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
so we have a lot of waves coming off and

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.850 
so we have a lot of waves coming off and
notice<00:04:01.850> how<00:04:01.970> strong<00:04:02.330> they<00:04:02.570> all<00:04:02.750> are<00:04:03.020> i'm<00:04:03.650> here

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
notice how strong they all are i'm here

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.380 
notice how strong they all are i'm here
at<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.040> 700<00:04:04.550> millibar<00:04:04.820> level<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.300> they're

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
at the 700 millibar level and they're

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.730 
at the 700 millibar level and they're
really<00:04:05.510> strong<00:04:05.780> at<00:04:05.960> eight<00:04:06.080> fifty<00:04:06.440> as<00:04:06.530> well

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
really strong at eight fifty as well

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.650 
really strong at eight fifty as well
this<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.370> indicating<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.940> lot<00:04:08.090> of<00:04:08.240> strong<00:04:08.420> waves

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
this is indicating a lot of strong waves

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.570 
this is indicating a lot of strong waves
are<00:04:08.840> still<00:04:09.140> coming<00:04:09.380> off<00:04:09.590> africa<00:04:09.800> at<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> high

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
are still coming off africa at a high

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.940 
are still coming off africa at a high
rate<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.209> one<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.930> seems<00:04:12.230> every<00:04:12.530> three<00:04:12.770> days

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
rate a one it seems every three days

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.650 
rate a one it seems every three days
about<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.580> coming<00:04:13.940> off<00:04:14.090> right<00:04:14.300> now<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.570> you

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
about is coming off right now and you

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.870 
about is coming off right now and you
see<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.959> their<00:04:15.110> remaining<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.770> pretty<00:04:16.040> potent

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
see that their remaining a pretty potent

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.030 
see that their remaining a pretty potent
as<00:04:17.000> they<00:04:17.180> come<00:04:17.390> westward<00:04:17.810> but<00:04:18.230> right<00:04:18.410> now<00:04:18.470> as

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
as they come westward but right now as

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.280 
as they come westward but right now as
of<00:04:19.400> july<00:04:20.000> they're<00:04:20.299> diffusing<00:04:20.989> into<00:04:21.080> the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
of july they're diffusing into the

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.260 
of july they're diffusing into the
strong<00:04:21.500> trade<00:04:21.830> wind<00:04:22.010> flow<00:04:22.250> near<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.090> just

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
strong trade wind flow near and just

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.000 
strong trade wind flow near and just
east<00:04:23.479> of<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.660> caribbean<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:24.710> is<00:04:24.830> really

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
east of the caribbean and this is really

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.140 
east of the caribbean and this is really
what<00:04:25.190> happened<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.610> shining

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
what happened is shining

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.670 
what happened is shining
but<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.389> fact<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.690> she<00:04:26.780> was<00:04:27.139> able<00:04:27.380> to

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
but the fact that she was able to

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.379 
but the fact that she was able to
develop<00:04:28.100> before<00:04:28.220> getting<00:04:28.729> to<00:04:28.759> the<00:04:28.940> Caribbean

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
develop before getting to the Caribbean

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.010 
develop before getting to the Caribbean
indicates<00:04:30.259> how<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.490> vorticity<00:04:32.150> in<00:04:32.540> here<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:32.990> a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
indicates how the vorticity in here is a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.420 
indicates how the vorticity in here is a
little<00:04:33.169> bit<00:04:33.350> more<00:04:33.470> enhanced<00:04:33.979> than<00:04:34.130> usual

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
little bit more enhanced than usual

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.860 
little bit more enhanced than usual
especially<00:04:34.880> for<00:04:35.030> this<00:04:35.150> time<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.389> year<00:04:35.539> and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
especially for this time of year and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.080 
especially for this time of year and
remember<00:04:36.380> July<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.190> least<00:04:37.490> favorable

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
remember July is the least favorable

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.810 
remember July is the least favorable
month<00:04:38.360> for<00:04:38.960> African<00:04:39.410> easterly<00:04:39.800> waves<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.610> as

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
month for African easterly waves so as

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.820 
month for African easterly waves so as
we<00:04:41.030> get<00:04:41.210> into<00:04:41.360> august<00:04:41.449> here<00:04:42.169> especially<00:04:42.740> when

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
we get into august here especially when

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.920 
we get into august here especially when
the<00:04:42.949> mjo<00:04:43.280> starts<00:04:43.669> coming<00:04:44.030> back<00:04:44.240> around<00:04:44.449> for

the mjo starts coming back around for

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.590 
the mjo starts coming back around for

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
trade winds are going to be weaker in

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.540 
trade winds are going to be weaker in
here<00:04:51.560> they're<00:04:51.770> going<00:04:51.889> to<00:04:52.009> be<00:04:52.100> weaker<00:04:52.370> in<00:04:52.460> the

Caribbean in the central Atlantic and

Caribbean in the central Atlantic and
these<00:04:54.500> waves<00:04:54.860> as<00:04:55.190> potent<00:04:55.639> as<00:04:55.729> they<00:04:55.940> are<00:04:56.090> right

these waves as potent as they are right

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.330 
these waves as potent as they are right
now<00:04:56.389> are<00:04:57.080> going<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.440> be<00:04:57.530> coming<00:04:57.560> into<00:04:58.039> a<00:04:58.070> more

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
now are going to be coming into a more

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.060 
now are going to be coming into a more
favorable<00:04:58.820> environment<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.539> the<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.800> think

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
favorable environment and the I think

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.379 
favorable environment and the I think
the<00:05:01.190> Cape<00:05:01.340> Varitek<00:05:01.669> season<00:05:01.970> is<00:05:02.090> still<00:05:02.210> going

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
the Cape Varitek season is still going

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.730 
the Cape Varitek season is still going
to<00:05:02.479> be<00:05:02.539> more<00:05:02.750> active<00:05:02.930> than<00:05:03.169> usual<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:03.680> year

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
to be more active than usual this year

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.379 
to be more active than usual this year
given<00:05:04.190> how<00:05:04.310> strong<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.760> waves<00:05:04.940> are<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.300> how

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
given how strong the waves are and how

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.810 
given how strong the waves are and how
favorable<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.229> area<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.280> world<00:05:07.310> should

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
favorable this area of the world should

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.640 
favorable this area of the world should
be<00:05:07.850> given<00:05:08.449> that<00:05:08.570> we<00:05:08.690> have<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> large<00:05:09.169> sprawling

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
be given that we have a large sprawling

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.439 
be given that we have a large sprawling
hi<00:05:10.039> to<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.400> north<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:11.120> is<00:05:11.240> really

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
hi to the north that is really

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.689 
hi to the north that is really
increasing<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:12.320> natural<00:05:12.949> vorticity<00:05:13.250> in<00:05:13.550> this

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
increasing the natural vorticity in this

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.550 
increasing the natural vorticity in this
area<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.240> once<00:05:14.720> these<00:05:14.840> trade<00:05:15.110> winds<00:05:15.289> calm

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
area and once these trade winds calm

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.350 
area and once these trade winds calm
down<00:05:15.800> just<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.130> little<00:05:16.250> bit<00:05:16.370> more<00:05:16.669> I<00:05:16.880> think

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
down just a little bit more I think

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.610 
down just a little bit more I think
we're<00:05:17.479> going<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:17.750> get<00:05:17.840> more<00:05:17.990> developments<00:05:18.500> in

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
we're going to get more developments in

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.070 
we're going to get more developments in
this<00:05:18.800> area<00:05:19.160> so<00:05:19.849> far<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.180> July<00:05:20.479> has<00:05:20.660> actually

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
this area so far this July has actually

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.469 
this area so far this July has actually
been<00:05:21.169> pretty<00:05:21.380> active<00:05:21.940> especially<00:05:22.940> since<00:05:23.360> we

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
been pretty active especially since we

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.390 
been pretty active especially since we
got<00:05:23.630> shan't<00:05:23.900> all<00:05:24.110> in<00:05:24.349> the<00:05:24.560> deep<00:05:24.710> tropics<00:05:25.130> used

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
got shan't all in the deep tropics used

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.010 
got shan't all in the deep tropics used
of<00:05:25.520> 60<00:05:25.849> west<00:05:26.000> that's<00:05:26.360> not<00:05:26.570> something<00:05:26.599> that

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
of 60 west that's not something that

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.050 
of 60 west that's not something that
usually<00:05:27.139> happens<00:05:27.710> so<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.520> means<00:05:28.669> we<00:05:28.820> have<00:05:28.880> to

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
usually happens so that means we have to

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.370 
usually happens so that means we have to
watch<00:05:29.210> down<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.599> road<00:05:29.750> in<00:05:29.900> August<00:05:30.229> in

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
watch down the road in August in

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.020 
watch down the road in August in
September<00:05:30.889> we<00:05:31.010> could<00:05:31.190> have<00:05:31.370> a<00:05:31.400> decent<00:05:31.699> Cape

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
September we could have a decent Cape

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.939 
September we could have a decent Cape
Verde<00:05:32.210> season<00:05:32.750> this<00:05:32.870> year<00:05:32.930> and<00:05:33.320> notice<00:05:33.830> how

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
Verde season this year and notice how

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.379 
Verde season this year and notice how
all<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.220> waves<00:05:34.400> are<00:05:34.610> also<00:05:34.789> getting<00:05:35.090> farther

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
all the waves are also getting farther

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.650 
all the waves are also getting farther
west<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:36.050> so<00:05:36.949> far<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.789> high<00:05:37.940> has<00:05:38.240> not<00:05:38.449> in<00:05:38.599> a

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
west and so far the high has not in a

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.990 
west and so far the high has not in a
position<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:39.160> significantly<00:05:40.160> recurve<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.820> lot

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
position to significantly recurve a lot

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.580 
position to significantly recurve a lot
of<00:05:41.120> these<00:05:41.240> things<00:05:41.510> which<00:05:41.900> means<00:05:42.139> the<00:05:42.289> Eastern

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
of these things which means the Eastern

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.230 
of these things which means the Eastern
Caribbean<00:05:42.710> islands<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:43.580> perhaps<00:05:43.789> the

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
Caribbean islands and perhaps the

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.140 
Caribbean islands and perhaps the
eastern<00:05:44.570> US<00:05:44.720> may<00:05:45.530> be<00:05:45.590> under<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.130> gun<00:05:46.340> later<00:05:46.970> in

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
eastern US may be under the gun later in

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.339 
eastern US may be under the gun later in
the<00:05:47.210> year<00:05:47.389> but<00:05:47.599> we<00:05:47.720> will<00:05:47.840> have<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:48.110> deal<00:05:48.229> with

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
the year but we will have to deal with

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.350 
the year but we will have to deal with
that<00:05:48.440> pattern<00:05:48.770> when<00:05:49.099> it<00:05:49.220> comes<00:05:49.520> hard<00:05:50.210> to

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
that pattern when it comes hard to

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.529 
that pattern when it comes hard to
predict<00:05:50.690> right<00:05:50.900> now<00:05:51.110> but<00:05:51.740> so<00:05:51.919> far<00:05:52.419> July<00:05:53.419> has

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
predict right now but so far July has

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.060 
predict right now but so far July has
been<00:05:53.750> active<00:05:54.050> likely<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.590> quiet<00:05:54.830> down<00:05:54.919> a

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
been active likely to quiet down a

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.580 
been active likely to quiet down a
little<00:05:55.430> bit<00:05:55.610> especially<00:05:56.270> in<00:05:56.389> here<00:05:56.810> during<00:05:57.409> the

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
little bit especially in here during the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.469 
little bit especially in here during the
next<00:05:57.710> two<00:05:57.979> weeks<00:05:58.010> as<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.610> mjo<00:05:58.940> is<00:05:59.120> now<00:05:59.240> going

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
next two weeks as the mjo is now going

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.089 
next two weeks as the mjo is now going
into<00:05:59.630> a<00:05:59.780> more<00:05:59.990> suppressive<00:06:00.470> phase<00:06:00.710> there<00:06:00.949> just

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
into a more suppressive phase there just

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.460 
into a more suppressive phase there just
a<00:06:01.220> couple<00:06:01.580> little<00:06:01.940> systems<00:06:02.419> to<00:06:02.630> watch<00:06:02.870> warily

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
a couple little systems to watch warily

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.050 
a couple little systems to watch warily
over<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.770> next<00:06:03.979> few<00:06:04.099> days<00:06:04.310> but<00:06:04.580> really<00:06:04.880> no
