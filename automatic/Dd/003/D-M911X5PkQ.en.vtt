00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.990
 the mayor behrs are all very well 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.630
 Nobody else has ever met the car. 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.210
 rj presents here for you two clips 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.010
 there from west kode5 now this first 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.430
 I'm taking a little walk 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.379
 tank and so it was very common because 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.540
 usually when you take the tank with 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.339
 quickie gasoline and rushes the afternoon 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.739
 destroying and this time I got to stay 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.930
 almost two minutes using in the tank 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.030
 I could get a lot back 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.360
 including closing them down and conquering 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.280
 the dogue is not getting i7 kills without 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.379
 dying was really fun then separating 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 This particular stretch is showing 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.580
 for you because it really is not like 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.559
 get to play that much less 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.170
 can not get those seven that 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.420
 tank is getting the dollars the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.010
 second clip is a bit different 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.560
 but in fact it was the beginning of a 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.290
 very good match only that the host pulled the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.970
 Starting cable was way on my 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.310
 pressure was putting into practice 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.340
 all the teachings in the great master 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.649
 Cururu frog in Brazil is bad and that is 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.429
 there sampling in the shot shot the shot now 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.770
 I'm going to go over this guy, look, and 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.990
 Dude, I was playing super good doing. 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.880
 so several drop shot pretty crazy tava 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.649
 well run gameplay only the guy 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.999
 arrived when I was 21 kilos already 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.070
 had released dollars 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.990
 the guy is going to pull the handle, I'm fine 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.789
 upset but it was a crazy sequence 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.130
 the kills so i hope you guys 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.719
 also short on that second peak where 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.270
 I really want to talk to you guys. 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.659
 little respect was a post there my friend 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.280
 bauer on facebook and wanted to account for 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.770
 one with humor possible 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.159
 possibility for us to have another 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.659
 offer collection that playstation 4 of the 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.249
 xbox of the year 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.009
 At first I think it's something for us. 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:10.280
 stay a little cheerful but you know 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.160
 that the dream always stays a little the foot 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.630
 back and so when I looked at the thigh no 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.340
 had looked at his first comment 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.140
 thing that comes to my head is please 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.880
 do not do shit with something that was too much 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.350
 legal for 14 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.060
 then when I took a look at the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.230
 his comment was exactly what 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.840
 I just hope not to do 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.640
 party do not do shit and with 4 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.980
 believes that this was something that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.730
 he was putting there it really is 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.170
 a great fear 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.099
 the guys get you into something that was a lot 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.659
 very cool good adored by fans and 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.819
 turn into something not so cool 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.500
 I just connected, going to the image that 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.780
 I was created earlier 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.049
 particularly those'm not Infanda 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.329
 mastering and re - editing of maps and 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.370
 old games stuff in new games 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.129
 but this is my personal opinion for 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.780
 example in mw3 when it was reissued there 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.930
 that terminal mark that the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.030
 Originally it was the mw2 I did not enjoy the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.980
 light was very different things were quite 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.560
 different then you mean gave me a 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.209
 face- type sensation does not fall well right e 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.000
 also some other maps as per 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.190
 example, also have the prep of mw2 and 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.109
 mastered in the search field, right? 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.329
 maybe for people it's not played 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.470
 this games in the mw2 case when he 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.120
 were green candidate 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.910
 and come and play those maps and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.620
 remastered in new games I do not have 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.870
 I do not feel this feeling 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.549
 but in my case and that's what ends 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.010
 happening then when I saw this 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.530
 news net you have a possible there 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.049
 games reissue of modern series by 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.030
 ps 4 and for xbox one 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.010
 I was a little bit scared or resentful. 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.930
 telling father hd textures 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.329
 some things have been improved too 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.090
 with respect to arms had some there 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.790
 modifications so that it could at last 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.099
 there is a better fit in the game and a 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.840
 new generation then all this left me 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.000
 A little respawned I was kind of like this 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.200
 but it's still a rumor that say has no 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.790
 nothing confirmed 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.799
 apparently it is the art work that 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.150
 was made in that post there including 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.769
 Put on facebook, it 's very pretty. 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.359
 it looks totally professional 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.040
 but for the truth is a channel 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.099
 skillful and having a good program 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.319
 edition in the hand can do and let's go 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.419
 so these posts these images with a 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.340
 very good quality practically 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.650
 identical, leaving nothing to the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.570
 professionals but say there with the opinion 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.630
 Of you about this would be nice. 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.810

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:42.409
 play on fox carrie ann 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.409
