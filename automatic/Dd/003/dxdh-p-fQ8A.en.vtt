 then remove the ice cream from the freezer

 Pass the ice cream in roll form over 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.540

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.729
 then turn the ice ball on the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.460
 egg mixture after again 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.750
 mix it with the corn flakes 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.160
 Put it back in the fridge for 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.200
 one hour space 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.979
 Now we will show you step by step the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.979
 simple process 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.689
 four well-frozen ice cream balls 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.800
 insert the corn or corn leaflets 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.710
 flakes in a nylon bag 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.300
 we passed the role to granulate the one of a 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.000
 uniform way 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.000
 now we can add the grated coconut 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.750
 in a shallow bowl add two 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.319
 eggs and a spoonful of milk 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.319
 mix it with a fork 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.920
 and take the ice cream out of the freezer and 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.350
 roll it in the mixture of corn flakes and 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.810
 grated coconut this is the time to make 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.370
 and form with them a ball imagine 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.860
 that you are making a snowball 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.270
 pack the mixture of hard cornflakes 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.270
 and coconut around the ice cream 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.700
 it is good to repeat this step so that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.830
 we roll the ice cream balls twice 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.460
 before putting it for an hour in the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.460
 freezer 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.209
 final step we proceed to fry the balls 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.489
 frost and finished heating the oil 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.010
 in a heavy pot at three hundred and sixty 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.470
 and five degrees inserts the ice cream in the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.260
 hot oil and you can fry it no more 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.510
 of twenty or twenty-five seconds be at 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.739
 so much that the ice cream balls do not 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.739
 break in the hot oil 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.860
 then we can say that we have done 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.500
 an extremely delicious dessert that 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.470

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.740
 chocolate strawberries and everything to your 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.740
