maximum crew of unknown as yet so we

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.460 
maximum crew of unknown as yet so we
have<00:00:39.699> to<00:00:39.820> wait<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.120> see<00:00:40.210> let's<00:00:41.110> make<00:00:41.290> the

electron<00:00:59.500> cannon<00:01:00.040> sounds<00:01:00.610> interesting<00:01:00.820> for

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
electron cannon sounds interesting for

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.350 
electron cannon sounds interesting for
the<00:01:01.780> missiles<00:01:02.170> four<00:01:02.649> times<00:01:03.040> four<00:01:03.520> triple

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
the missiles four times four triple

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.859 
the missiles four times four triple
mount<00:01:04.600> torpedo<00:01:05.170> cluster<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.700> also<00:01:06.940> has<00:01:07.450> a

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
mount torpedo cluster it also has a

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.920 
mount torpedo cluster it also has a
turrets<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.770> seven<00:01:09.430> times<00:01:09.729> for<00:01:10.180> laser

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
turrets of seven times for laser

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.930 
turrets of seven times for laser
repeater<00:01:11.440> turrets<00:01:11.920> as<00:01:12.100> well<00:01:12.369> so<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.759> sounds

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
repeater turrets as well so that sounds

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.609 
repeater turrets as well so that sounds
pretty<00:01:13.240> crazy<00:01:13.539> this<00:01:13.960> thing's<00:01:14.200> going<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.470> be<00:01:14.590> a

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
pretty crazy this thing's going to be a

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.380 
pretty crazy this thing's going to be a
bit<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:15.039> be<00:01:15.250> snowed<00:01:15.580> out<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.270> they've

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
bit of a be snowed out and they've

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.480 
bit of a be snowed out and they've
actually<00:01:16.570> said<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.200> can<00:01:17.380> also<00:01:17.590> carry<00:01:18.160> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
actually said it can also carry a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.059 
actually said it can also carry a
boarding<00:01:19.270> craft<00:01:19.720> or<00:01:20.140> ship<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:20.709> that's<00:01:20.890> going

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
boarding craft or ship so that's going

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.290 
boarding craft or ship so that's going
to<00:01:21.130> be<00:01:21.220> really<00:01:21.369> interesting<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:21.970> see<00:01:22.209> what

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
to be really interesting to see what

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.660 
to be really interesting to see what
they<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.509> as<00:01:22.780> well<00:01:22.959> so<00:01:23.319> we've<00:01:23.979> just<00:01:24.009> started<00:01:24.490> to

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
they is as well so we've just started to

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.430 
they is as well so we've just started to
see<00:01:24.910> some<00:01:25.209> of<00:01:25.240> these<00:01:25.420> vandals<00:01:25.690> ships<00:01:26.170> come<00:01:26.410> in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
see some of these vandals ships come in

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.990 
see some of these vandals ships come in
now<00:01:26.740> they're<00:01:26.950> quite<00:01:27.130> pointy<00:01:27.700> but<00:01:27.910> they

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
now they're quite pointy but they

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.270 
now they're quite pointy but they
actually<00:01:28.090> betch<00:01:28.479> by<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:28.959> looks<00:01:29.289> of<00:01:29.440> it<00:01:29.619> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
actually betch by the looks of it the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.609 
actually betch by the looks of it the
actual<00:01:30.729> pointy<00:01:31.179> bits<00:01:31.390> some<00:01:31.599> bits<00:01:31.840> fold<00:01:32.170> up<00:01:32.380> and

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
actual pointy bits some bits fold up and

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.020 
actual pointy bits some bits fold up and
I<00:01:32.709> was<00:01:32.800> probably<00:01:33.069> doing<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:33.640> they<00:01:33.729> fit<00:01:33.940> in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
I was probably doing that so they fit in

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.910 
I was probably doing that so they fit in
the<00:01:34.060> hangars<00:01:34.420> it'll<00:01:34.630> be<00:01:34.780> easier<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.560> second

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
the hangars it'll be easier the second

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.400 
the hangars it'll be easier the second
ship<00:01:36.130> we've<00:01:36.310> seen<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:36.940> Vandal<00:01:37.780> site<00:01:38.110> now

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
ship we've seen is the Vandal site now

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.199 
ship we've seen is the Vandal site now
the<00:01:38.470> Vandal<00:01:38.860> staff<00:01:39.099> was<00:01:39.369> actually<00:01:39.700> introduced

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
the Vandal staff was actually introduced

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.510 
the Vandal staff was actually introduced
into<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> game<00:01:40.750> quite<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.590> while<00:01:41.890> ago<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.250> was

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
into the game quite a while ago that was

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.010 
into the game quite a while ago that was
probably<00:01:42.729> one<00:01:42.940> of<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.119> well<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.720> was<00:01:43.869> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
probably one of the well that was the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.260 
probably one of the well that was the
actual<00:01:44.140> first<00:01:44.530> Vandal<00:01:45.039> ship<00:01:45.310> we<00:01:45.520> actually<00:01:45.910> saw

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
actual first Vandal ship we actually saw

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.690 
actual first Vandal ship we actually saw
the<00:01:46.599> van<00:01:47.229> dahl<00:01:47.470> themself<00:01:47.979> I<00:01:48.220> believe<00:01:48.490> are

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
the van dahl themself I believe are

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.190 
the van dahl themself I believe are
particularly<00:01:49.149> tall<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.660> think<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:49.959> also<00:01:50.080> have

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
particularly tall I think that also have

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.719 
particularly tall I think that also have
like<00:01:50.319> nine<00:01:50.560> feet<00:01:50.950> tall<00:01:50.979> or<00:01:51.310> something

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
like nine feet tall or something

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.520 
like nine feet tall or something
ridiculous<00:01:51.819> and<00:01:52.450> goes<00:01:52.780> obviously<00:01:53.259> they're

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
ridiculous and goes obviously they're

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.430 
ridiculous and goes obviously they're
alien<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.700> current<00:01:55.149> Vandal<00:01:55.720> ships<00:01:56.020> we<00:01:56.229> have

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
alien the current Vandal ships we have

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.979 
alien the current Vandal ships we have
account<00:01:56.800> in<00:01:56.979> Rena<00:01:57.459> commander<00:01:58.060> they<00:01:58.750> are

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:58.989 
account in Rena commander they are

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.309 
account in Rena commander they are
actually<00:01:59.819> solely<00:02:00.819> for<00:02:01.239> the<00:02:01.270> van<00:02:01.630> dahl<00:02:01.899> now<00:02:02.259> to

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.830 
actually solely for the van dahl now to
get<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.489> ship<00:02:03.759> so<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.030> could<00:02:04.149> be<00:02:04.179> flyable<00:02:04.539> by

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
get that ship so it could be flyable by

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.469 
get that ship so it could be flyable by
a<00:02:04.869> player<00:02:05.229> obviously<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:06.039> plan<00:02:06.310> not<00:02:06.910> being<00:02:07.149> nine

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
a player obviously a plan not being nine

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.320 
a player obviously a plan not being nine
feet<00:02:07.780> tall<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.649> ship<00:02:08.979> needs<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.429> be<00:02:09.580> adapted

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
feet tall the ship needs to be adapted

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.130 
feet tall the ship needs to be adapted
so<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.560> adapted<00:02:12.340> ship<00:02:12.700> looks<00:02:13.150> slightly

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
so the adapted ship looks slightly

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.010 
so the adapted ship looks slightly
different<00:02:14.739> actually<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.970> original<00:02:16.750> van

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
different actually to the original van

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.130 
different actually to the original van
dahl<00:02:17.319> mainly<00:02:18.250> around<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.840> placement<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
dahl mainly around the placement of the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.899 
dahl mainly around the placement of the
characters<00:02:20.739> quite<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> quite<00:02:21.370> odd<00:02:21.580> placement

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
characters quite a quite odd placement

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.550 
characters quite a quite odd placement
you're<00:02:22.209> actually<00:02:22.329> sort<00:02:22.629> of<00:02:22.659> lying<00:02:22.900> down<00:02:23.290> so

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
you're actually sort of lying down so

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.410 
you're actually sort of lying down so
I'll<00:02:23.709> see<00:02:23.829> that's<00:02:24.040> been<00:02:24.250> adjusted<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.030> also

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
I'll see that's been adjusted and also

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.120 
I'll see that's been adjusted and also
the<00:02:25.959> viewing<00:02:26.379> angles<00:02:26.829> of<00:02:26.980> a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
the viewing angles of a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.250 
the viewing angles of a
you've<00:02:27.370> been<00:02:27.490> improved<00:02:27.910> as<00:02:28.180> well<00:02:28.210> one<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
you've been improved as well one of the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.930 
you've been improved as well one of the
other<00:02:29.350> things<00:02:29.470> they've<00:02:29.950> been<00:02:30.100> focusing<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.730> as

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
other things they've been focusing on as

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.840 
other things they've been focusing on as
well<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.480> off<00:02:31.630> c<00:02:32.040> converting<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.370> alien

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
well is off c converting the alien

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.930 
well is off c converting the alien
technology<00:02:34.600> into<00:02:35.440> sort<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:35.980> human<00:02:36.700> technology

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
technology into sort of human technology

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.980 
technology into sort of human technology
now<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.140> game<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.940> anvil<00:02:39.940> aerospace<00:02:40.690> are

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
now in game the anvil aerospace are

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.830 
now in game the anvil aerospace are
basically<00:02:41.530> working<00:02:41.890> on<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.460> refit<00:02:43.090> one<00:02:43.630> thing

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
basically working on the refit one thing

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.330 
basically working on the refit one thing
i<00:02:43.960> was<00:02:44.080> sort<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.410> looking<00:02:44.560> forward<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:45.070> is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
i was sort of looking forward to is

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.730 
i was sort of looking forward to is
actually<00:02:45.760> seeing<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.240> sort<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:47.260> maybe

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
actually seeing it sort of that maybe

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.060 
actually seeing it sort of that maybe
alien<00:02:48.400> hud's<00:02:48.760> as<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> permanent<00:02:49.660> placement<00:02:50.650> but

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
alien hud's as a permanent placement but

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.620 
alien hud's as a permanent placement but
looks<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.370> what<00:02:51.580> they're<00:02:51.730> doing<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
looks like what they're doing is is the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.470 
looks like what they're doing is is the
boot<00:02:52.840> up<00:02:52.990> sequence<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.890> will<00:02:54.160> see<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.910> Vandal

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
boot up sequence you will see the Vandal

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.960 
boot up sequence you will see the Vandal

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
balancing pass in game this is pretty

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.060 
balancing pass in game this is pretty
significant<00:03:34.990> this<00:03:35.110> actually<00:03:35.440> affects<00:03:35.800> all

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
significant this actually affects all

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.300

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
all parts of the game so this is going

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.190 
all parts of the game so this is going
to<00:03:42.490> be<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> massive<00:03:43.180> transition<00:03:43.810> as<00:03:43.930> well

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
to be a massive transition as well

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.040 
to be a massive transition as well
obviously<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:45.040> part<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.520> 1.2<00:03:46.300> we're<00:03:46.510> expecting

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
obviously a part of 1.2 we're expecting

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.710 
obviously a part of 1.2 we're expecting
to<00:03:47.230> see<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.710> FPS<00:03:48.310> aspect<00:03:48.790> in<00:03:48.940> there<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.330> also

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
to see the FPS aspect in there and also

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.660 
to see the FPS aspect in there and also
there's<00:03:50.110> going<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.380> be<00:03:50.410> some<00:03:50.740> significant

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
there's going to be some significant

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.820 
there's going to be some significant
improvements<00:03:52.270> as<00:03:52.360> well<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.170> launcher<00:03:53.650> and

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
improvements as well to the launcher and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.460 
improvements as well to the launcher and
also<00:03:54.490> some<00:03:54.940> improvements<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.840> load<00:03:56.110> time

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
also some improvements so the load time

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.520 
also some improvements so the load time
not<00:03:57.160> just<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.580> FPS<00:03:58.120> but<00:03:58.390> also<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:58.990> arena

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530

is<00:04:02.380> actually<00:04:02.740> you're<00:04:03.010> going<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.250> need<00:04:03.520> to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
is actually you're going to need to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.670 
is actually you're going to need to
actually<00:04:04.120> load<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.810> hangar<00:04:05.110> module<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.560> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
actually load the hangar module and the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.650 
actually load the hangar module and the
load<00:04:05.860> times<00:04:06.130> will<00:04:06.340> be<00:04:06.370> improved<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.420> they'll

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
load times will be improved so they'll

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.900 
load times will be improved so they'll
be<00:04:07.720> less<00:04:07.959> Ram<00:04:08.530> actually<00:04:09.040> load<00:04:09.280> into<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.640> VR

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
be less Ram actually load into the VR

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.270 
be less Ram actually load into the VR
Ram<00:04:10.180> unload<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.350> think<00:04:11.620> at<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.800> moment<00:04:11.830> is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
Ram unload I think at the moment is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.160 
Ram unload I think at the moment is
something<00:04:12.550> like<00:04:12.640> ridiculous<00:04:13.330> like<00:04:13.570> 100<00:04:13.990> Meg

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
something like ridiculous like 100 Meg

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.440 
something like ridiculous like 100 Meg
per<00:04:14.380> ship<00:04:14.709> so<00:04:15.280> that's<00:04:15.490> going<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.700> be<00:04:15.790> reduced

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
per ship so that's going to be reduced

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.080 
per ship so that's going to be reduced
down<00:04:16.900> significantly<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:17.920> this<00:04:18.070> awesome<00:04:18.520> let's

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
down significantly so this awesome let's

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.490 
down significantly so this awesome let's
make<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.390> assumption<00:04:19.720> that<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.290> should

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
make the assumption that this should

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.440 
make the assumption that this should
help<00:04:20.650> with<00:04:20.770> performance<00:04:21.459> as<00:04:21.609> well<00:04:21.790> in<00:04:22.060> the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
help with performance as well in the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.720 
help with performance as well in the
latest<00:04:22.690> around<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.620> verse<00:04:23.800> as<00:04:24.100> well<00:04:24.340> we<00:04:24.580> also

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
latest around the verse as well we also

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.800 
latest around the verse as well we also
got<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.450> glimpse<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.010> f8<00:04:27.580> heavy<00:04:28.360> fighter

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
got a glimpse of the f8 heavy fighter

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.530 
got a glimpse of the f8 heavy fighter
and<00:04:29.620> that<00:04:29.890> was<00:04:29.980> in<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.280> latest<00:04:30.850> there<00:04:31.120> around

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
and that was in the latest there around

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.570 
and that was in the latest there around
the<00:04:31.750> verse<00:04:32.020> now<00:04:32.650> this<00:04:32.830> does<00:04:33.070> look<00:04:33.310> really

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
the verse now this does look really

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.670 
the verse now this does look really
really<00:04:33.850> cool<00:04:34.180> we<00:04:34.750> have<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.140> Hornet<00:04:35.470> at<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
really cool we have the Hornet at the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.860 
really cool we have the Hornet at the
moment<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.190> Hornet<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.640> obviously<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.300> smaller

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
moment the Hornet is obviously a smaller

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.920 
moment the Hornet is obviously a smaller
fighter<00:04:38.350> craft<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.490> FAA<00:04:39.850> is<00:04:40.060> being<00:04:40.360> more

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
fighter craft and the FAA is being more

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.409 
fighter craft and the FAA is being more
the<00:04:41.080> side<00:04:41.289> of<00:04:41.320> a<00:04:41.650> heavy<00:04:42.009> fighter<00:04:42.490> there<00:04:43.240> will

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
the side of a heavy fighter there will

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.020 
the side of a heavy fighter there will
be<00:04:43.449> some<00:04:43.750> sacrifice<00:04:44.350> their<00:04:44.680> home<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.789> should

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
be some sacrifice their home I should

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.570 
be some sacrifice their home I should
imagine<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.600> maneuverability<00:04:47.530> won't<00:04:48.190> be<00:04:48.400> as

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
imagine that maneuverability won't be as

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.570 
imagine that maneuverability won't be as
good<00:04:48.729> but<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:49.630> load<00:04:49.900> out<00:04:50.199> of<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.680> ship<00:04:50.979> looks

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
good but the load out of that ship looks

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.860 
good but the load out of that ship looks
