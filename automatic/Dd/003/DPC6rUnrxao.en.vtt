00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone, Ilya This is the second part 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.020
 Japanese Breakthrough Guide 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.020
 level nine go 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.160
 Kiev 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.880
 Before you Japanese tt 10 level 5 type 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.560
 heavy 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.779
 at first glance it is very similar to 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.750
 its predecessor type 4 heavy 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.940
 but still there are some differences 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.560
 look at this gif if you look at 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.570
 them from the front of the differences 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.720
 almost no but if you look 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.280
 at an angle then the Japanese top on the sides 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.530
 something like screens appears 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.059
 also worth noting that a forehead appeared 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.370
 10 millimeters of armor 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.260
 that is, we now have 260 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.449
 millimeters of armor in the forehead of the tower and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.790
 in the forehead of the casing well and now let's 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.750
 let's see what these 10 give us 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.879
 millimeters of armor 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.030
 First, as always, take a gun with 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.280
 breaking through in 218 millimeters l l d m not 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.260
 taken as armor became even more 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.350
 oval but in general you can forget because 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.520
 bounce volume about besides bombs 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.120
 step all three cases also not 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.120
 breaks through 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.310
 Well, it remains only the tower in the forehead, it is not 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.140
 breaks through but here remains one and that 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.060
 same problem previous japanese 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.710
 these are two great bumps on the sides 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.200
 towers that confidently makes its way 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.040
 each shot while still leaving 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.040
 creed bombs 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.560
 well, the commander's turret is not taken from 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.560
 this gun 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.119
 now go to rumba 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 hull cheek defies this gun 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.049
 so these additional 10 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 millimeters of armor played here their 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.649
 role through the rink damage also fails 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:12.239
 we can only immobilize the target not 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:14.370
 causing no damage to the board 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.950
 ricochet happens the same zone remains 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.140
 bumps on the sides of the tower from there is such 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.090
 possibility we target them and reduce 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.850
 our Japanese reload speed in two 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:29.700
 times now we take the guns with a break in 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.280
 264 millimeters and the situation is significant 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.230
 changing I do not know how it is connected but we 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.799
 punched our Japanese nld each 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.040
 shot 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.600
 whether you sometimes don't have 260 meters 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.880
 I flew a high breakthrough 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.190
 also want to note that shooting and 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.980
 punching nld you guaranteed you're wearing 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.410
 the engine does not give way 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.260
 makes his way through every shot of heal 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.769
 at right angles 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.700
 the cheeks of the tower made their way through time and 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.560
 com turret 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.459
 if you shoot in the center too 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.459
 guaranteed break through 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.200
 again we put our tank diamond 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.970
 the rollers are so thick that they 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.050
 absorb the projectile and we do not inflict 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.050
 no damage 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.920
 NLD and VLD punch at such an angle 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.810
 it is unrealistic because of the reservation here 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.810
 becomes about 350 millimeters 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.049
 step we broke through only once this 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.830
 I think it's just luck . 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.830
 instability 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.040
 Well , the cheek body is easy to absorb yourself 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.409
 all shells despite the thicker 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.980
 armor and for two I'm for three shot top 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:51.349
 going on creed ammo as for 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.540
 towers can be pierced at such an angle 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.750
 only sideways turret and bump with instruments 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.750
 observations 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.560
 god is at a great angle and from 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.560
 all shells will ricochet him 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.660
 well, and now object 268 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.910
 he, as always, absolutely do not care for armor 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.250
 and non-theist hemp corpus easy 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.510
 make their way over their tilt 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.510
 bounce all shells 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.020
 but the lubricant here is one better 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.650
 I understood our shot all the same I could 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.000
 accomplish 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.000
 she 2 went to the hangar 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.160
 Well, and finally, the ammunition breaks down on 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.160
 in those areas as the predecessor 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.240
 but to do it is much more difficult and 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.139
 until finally it exploded only 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.139
 last shot 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.559
 but to you as I have always been 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.269
 if this video was useful for you 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.099
 like also ask 

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:31.839
 subscribe to my channel and 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.269
 suggest in the comments on what topic 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:36.809
 make another video but for today all 

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:36.809
 until
