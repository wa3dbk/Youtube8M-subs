another way you can do it also is
changing<00:04:19.470> via<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.609> swatches<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:21.480> click<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
is quite a little more useful features

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.290 
is quite a little more useful features

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
you can actually see the fill now so you

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.130 
you can actually see the fill now so you
can<00:04:53.280> actually<00:04:53.490> click<00:04:54.180> on<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.630> game

I click on that you can actually make

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.400 
I click on that you can actually make
slightly<00:05:06.090> more<00:05:06.300> complicated<00:05:06.660> paths<00:05:07.140> you<00:05:07.290> can

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
slightly more complicated paths you can

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.070 
slightly more complicated paths you can
actually<00:05:07.620> add<00:05:08.750> an<00:05:09.750> additional<00:05:10.260> fill<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:12.020> add<00:05:13.020> a

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
actually add an additional fill so add a

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.910 
actually add an additional fill so add a
new<00:05:13.470> Phil<00:05:17.960> just<00:05:18.960> click<00:05:19.230> on<00:05:19.380> that<00:05:19.410> which

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
new Phil just click on that which

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.310 
new Phil just click on that which
obviously<00:05:20.100> overrides<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.240> existing<00:05:21.840> one<00:05:21.990> and

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.540 

you<00:05:25.320> obviously<00:05:25.410> can<00:05:25.680> make<00:05:25.830> more<00:05:26.130> complicated

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
you obviously can make more complicated

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.940 
you obviously can make more complicated
things<00:05:27.330> like<00:05:27.420> styles<00:05:27.990> you<00:05:28.290> can<00:05:28.470> actually<00:05:28.590> save

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
things like styles you can actually save

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.690 
things like styles you can actually save
that<00:05:29.370> now<00:05:29.790> as<00:05:29.850> a<00:05:30.000> style<00:05:30.330> if<00:05:30.540> you<00:05:30.660> wish<00:05:31.340> but<00:05:32.340> I'm

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
that now as a style if you wish but I'm

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.220 
that now as a style if you wish but I'm
just<00:05:32.880> going<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.060> quickly<00:05:33.210> show<00:05:33.330> with<00:05:33.900> effects

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
just going to quickly show with effects

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:42.850 
just going to quickly show with effects
you<00:05:35.220> can<00:05:35.370> actually<00:05:35.520> go<00:05:36.170> past<00:05:37.490> offset<00:05:38.490> path<00:05:41.420> 20

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
you can actually go past offset path 20

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.900 
you can actually go past offset path 20
right<00:05:45.860> so<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:46.950> can<00:05:47.070> actually<00:05:47.190> create<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.580> plot

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
right so you can actually create a plot

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.020 
right so you can actually create a plot
slightly<00:05:48.480> more<00:05:48.630> complicated<00:05:49.610> sort<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.670> the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
slightly more complicated sort of the

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.420 
slightly more complicated sort of the
original<00:05:51.390> color<00:05:51.630> and<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:52.650> fill<00:05:52.860> color<00:05:53.160> that's

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
original color and the fill color that's

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.270 
original color and the fill color that's
added<00:05:54.360> to<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.570> path<00:05:54.780> using<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.530> offset<00:05:55.650> so

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
added to the path using the offset so

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.340 
added to the path using the offset so
you<00:05:56.370> can<00:05:56.460> actually<00:05:56.580> see<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:57.170> setting<00:05:58.170> there

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
you can actually see the setting there

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.320 
you can actually see the setting there
anyway<00:05:59.280> that's<00:05:59.550> sir<00:05:59.790> there's<00:06:00.000> probably<00:06:00.210> other

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
anyway that's sir there's probably other

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.090 
anyway that's sir there's probably other
ways<00:06:00.570> of<00:06:01.020> doing<00:06:01.140> it<00:06:01.320> there's<00:06:01.470> a<00:06:01.530> black<00:06:01.830> various

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
ways of doing it there's a black various

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
ways of doing it there's a black various
plugins<00:06:02.370> you<00:06:02.670> can<00:06:02.730> find<00:06:03.090> there<00:06:04.020> was<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:05.120> kpt

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
plugins you can find there was the kpt

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.390 
plugins you can find there was the kpt
vector<00:06:07.020> effects<00:06:07.380> plug-in<00:06:08.160> there<00:06:08.280> was<00:06:08.370> a

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
vector effects plug-in there was a

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.910 
vector effects plug-in there was a
really<00:06:08.910> good<00:06:09.120> color<00:06:09.750> tool<00:06:10.050> in<00:06:10.260> that<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.770> can

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
really good color tool in that you can

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.980 
really good color tool in that you can
use<00:06:11.070> that<00:06:11.250> for<00:06:11.490> changing<00:06:11.850> colors<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:12.870> I'm

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
use that for changing colors and I'm

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.390 
use that for changing colors and I'm
certain<00:06:13.260> there<00:06:13.380> are<00:06:13.470> the<00:06:13.560> plugins<00:06:13.770> as<00:06:14.040> well<00:06:14.070> it

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
certain there are the plugins as well it

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.740 
certain there are the plugins as well it
can<00:06:14.520> be<00:06:14.640> found<00:06:14.850> that<00:06:15.060> can<00:06:15.210> change<00:06:15.330> color<00:06:15.420> soon

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
can be found that can change color soon

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.740 
can be found that can change color soon
and<00:06:15.870> graphic<00:06:16.140> extras<00:06:16.500> I've<00:06:16.980> got<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.790> few<00:06:18.180> random

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
and graphic extras I've got a few random

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.290 
and graphic extras I've got a few random
color<00:06:19.140> features<00:06:19.590> in<00:06:20.190> most<00:06:20.730> of<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:20.940> plugins

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
color features in most of the plugins

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.270 
color features in most of the plugins
also<00:06:22.020> there<00:06:22.440> is<00:06:22.530> actually<00:06:22.950> year<00:06:23.190> in<00:06:24.000> volume<00:06:24.420> 1

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
also there is actually year in volume 1

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.370 
also there is actually year in volume 1
there's<00:06:26.280> volume<00:06:27.000> 2<00:06:27.180> as<00:06:27.390> you<00:06:27.480> say<00:06:27.660> volume<00:06:28.050> 2

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
there's volume 2 as you say volume 2

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.310 
there's volume 2 as you say volume 2
there's<00:06:28.650> a<00:06:28.770> plug-in<00:06:29.280> that<00:06:29.870> of<00:06:30.870> the<00:06:31.050> Andrew

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
there's a plug-in that of the Andrew

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.900 
there's a plug-in that of the Andrew
vectors<00:06:31.740> plugins<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:32.340> can<00:06:32.400> actually<00:06:32.610> change

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
vectors plugins you can actually change

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.570 
vectors plugins you can actually change
the<00:06:33.090> colors<00:06:33.570> randomly<00:06:34.470> and<00:06:34.800> tweak<00:06:35.340> it<00:06:35.460> in

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
the colors randomly and tweak it in

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.990 
the colors randomly and tweak it in
thousands<00:06:36.390> of<00:06:36.450> different<00:06:36.540> ways<00:06:36.720> so<00:06:37.110> we're

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
thousands of different ways so we're

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.510 
thousands of different ways so we're
kind<00:06:39.000> of<00:06:39.120> interest
