00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.440
 our forests in the south that in the west what on 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:14.130
 North provides interesting thread fungus 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:18.840
 a mushroom called a truffle is a mushroom 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.880
 which is this mushroom from all products 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.240
 power supply 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.779
 the most expensive product is the cost of it 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.020
 mushroom 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:41.180
 abroad now such a cry is to 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:44.910
 Peter restaurant sell it at 300 euros 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.809
 a kilogram of mushrooms such worth one 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.530
 thousand euros to 5 thousand years is the average 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.110
 price 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.699
 and if it is mushrooms sold at auction 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.430
 then this price will still strike and curl 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.460
 In this case, we see mushrooms that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.650
 weaved the site of our locality in this case 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 in Kherson they do not possess such 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.830
 serious aroma like possess aroma 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.500
 mushrooms grown in france 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.490
 vitali and now around the world started 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.890
 many firms are engaged in production 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.610
 alt inter file and what happens is that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.880
 no matter how many of these do not Ferb was not 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.009
 is covered ie there is a lot more demand 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.360
 what actually produces these 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.700
 mushrooms and this case, these mushrooms 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.119
 grow underground at a depth of 20 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.189
 20 centimeters deep and some mushrooms 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.909
 come to the surface the sick man das 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.610
 and even collect on top of systems 6 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.620
 This mushroom you not provides such 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 serious economic 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.720
 dressing started we wear went on 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:08.080
 mushrooms that were tied 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.020
 considered from France mushrooms that are there 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.780
 constantly have demand has in of very 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.450
 highest taste and has 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.610
 very serious cost on 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.090
 international market how to unleash and 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.550
 mushrooms these mushrooms grow on the roots 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.990
 trees in this case, these mushrooms were 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:35.080
 grown on the roots of oaks here took 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.530
 uterine culture from abroad 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.880
 having serious certificates on them so we 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.680
 and on curated these creeps on our 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.490
 local oak and you know very 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.890
 perfectly succeeded inoculation succeeded 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.530
 and so we see that 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.200
 once but in Kherson region in Ukraine 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.250
 grow red wear wild truffles 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.190
 you will grow 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.080
 these truffles teach us and now on 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.390
 there is enough today 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.930
 number of sowing and planting 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.040
 material and cooler wanna be goals 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.020
 truffles to Ukraine this this 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.140
 theme to develop, and therefore if there is at 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.320
 someone this interest is something we can 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.590
 all lead advisory work and 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:31.480

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:35.820
 can grow on oak not grow on hazel 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.820
