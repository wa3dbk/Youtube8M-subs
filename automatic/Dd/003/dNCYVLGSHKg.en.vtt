00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.550
 I came back so what am I 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.880
 wanted to say yes yes against a car 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.860
 here, there are several 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.230
 if you want to close you go 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:36.930

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:38.880
 1 2 3 4 5 you put waiting 1 2 1 2 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.490
 you take a 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:48.090
 a blogger you put 2 after you 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.760
 put two lengths there and one more 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.920
 trick in talking about the wool ray you 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:01.080

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:03.600
 vauvre evils where I will be at wheels and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.550
 after you take gray wool in 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.320
 goes from the wool you want to the 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.970
 color you want because it's 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.480
 the color of your car so we 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.880
 do not care 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:20.120
 good after we put it like these 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.010
 stop you know the stone slabs 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.830
 you put two there that we will break 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:32.720
 withdrawal and a look at it you have 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.720
 not seen two there and one there 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.020
 would have broken and there will always be 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.270
 slab vote so I know very well you 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:46.880
 take the stairs in birch wood 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.949
 and you put them the 1/2 you would 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.070
 put the windows like that then like 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.070
 it 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:01.660
 after jean will not need both 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.660
 sides of the car not from that but from 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:12.139
 two because we're going to break and 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:22.130
 instead of that will put a parent 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:26.030
 is stone after which true we will put 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.870
 a lever this soil but that's a shelter 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:45.560
 for decoration if you want 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:51.470
 could put some bad words 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:53.599
 and a roof quite simply and instead 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.159
 from there you will put a hatch but 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.370
 I do not care because normally 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:00.349
