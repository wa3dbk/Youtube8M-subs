00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello everyone in this video I want to tell 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.819
 about your channel what are you on my channel 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.819
 can see 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.150
 The main direction of the channel is 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.180
 presentation of video lessons on board 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.490
 computer 1 ha here all downloaded 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.619
 videos per channel they are distributed by 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.950
 playlists, respectively, on the subject and 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.710
 I have a playlist on channel 3 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.450
 this is an onboard computer money 2 playlist 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.610
 money in the house what he is capable of and and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.220
 the third playlist is created while in life 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.480
 ignition 63.ru 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.160
 You certainly are not easy to do with anything 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.050
 variator ignition mode I will say it in 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.320
 that many viewers of my channel 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.300
 is interested in the on-board computer exactly 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.000
 to measure the remaining gas at the very 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.580
 car equipped with a gobl gas cylinder 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.009
 ruins and accordingly they will be very 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.680
 It is useful to see the videos in which and 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.630
 stories about ignition timing variator 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.190
 who is not in the subject for which the variator is needed 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.560
 ignition timing in the car 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.190
 equipped oh year I will say briefly so as not to 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.460
 burned out the exhaust valve is still variable 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.920
 gives an increase in power at low 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.130
 revolutions reduces gas consumption in my 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.890
 the car itself on gas and I know it 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.810
 firsthand and now tell 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.869
 more about each playlist 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 what do you see in them playlist 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.490
 I laid out the onboard computer money 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.690
 which directly concerns the work 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.350
 onboard computer 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.180
 money is the main function for which 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.030
 this onboard computer was created 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.869
 this is the measurement of the remaining fuel 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.320
 simultaneously in two tanks 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.530
 gasoline and gas tank with a large 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.630
 up to 1 liter this device 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.290
 can be installed on any car 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.880
 even on the carburetor all on unequivocally 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.350
 carburettor engine no 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.790
 electronic control unit and 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.299
 accordingly, there is no onboard 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.510
 computer 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.220
 you can not put but this dink can 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.260
 put it to you with a big 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.470
 Accurately show what is your balance 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.750
 fuel tank 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.960
 Soon there will be video lessons on board 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.110
 computer measurement algorithm 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.880
 leftover fuel without knowing the logic you don't 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.510
 be able to properly configure the onboard 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.880
 computer 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.520
 I recommend you subscribe to the channel 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.680
 to be the first and get useful 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.230
 news except 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.720
 residue and fuel measurement 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.330
 onboard computer money and has a lot 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.790
 other functions the most interesting is 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.790
 temperature measurement with us 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.120
 thermal sensors can 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.860
 to be connected up to 8 pieces and for each 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.340
 thermal sensor is remembered by him 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.670
 maximum minimum temperature 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.570
 temperature measurement range from 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.010
 minus 55 is plus 125 degrees 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.470
 the use of a temperature sensor may not 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.830
 only in the car but also in other places 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.870
 for example in an apartment house as 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.670
 use onboard computer 1 ha not 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.920
 be limited to a car and there and 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.650
 We talk about this with a friend of the flattery 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.930
 dinka in the house what is he capable of 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.260
 the brevity will tell what topics will be 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.019
 affected by this installation of temperature sensors 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.300
 to measure the temperature outside in 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.450
 rooms in a heat exchanger in 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.550
 heat carrier in heating can even 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.760
 bury these thermal sensors in the ground on 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.280
 every 20 centimeters and has and winter 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.730
 somewhat frozen ground application 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.019
 weight 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.900
 and more tehad which are intended for 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.269
 measuring the level of fuel on the car in 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.370
 the house can be adapted to measure 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.420
 wind speeds outside for certain 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.150
 time span from 1 to 250 seconds 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.340
 There can be look if couples in meter from 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.420
 put the entire measurement time of 3 seconds 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.250
 you can see if a gust of wind 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.100
 how much will change if you 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.650
 set let's say the measurement time is there 200 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.000
 seconds you are already watching accordingly 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.040
 average wind speed 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.340
 for 200 seconds which was 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.420
 you can also measure the remaining water 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.710
 greenhouse moisture level 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.750
 illuminance noise level and much 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.700
 other 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.310
 if something interested you 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.730
 ask questions on my form link 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.130
 look in the description with you was Tretyakov 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.640
 Alexey onboard computer developer 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.470
 1 ha and I also have a live channel on 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.470
 which can you tell me from another 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.320
 parties on the live channel I talk about 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.140
 his hobby repairing useful homemade 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.240
 do see you bye 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.820
 don't forget to subscribe to like 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.820
