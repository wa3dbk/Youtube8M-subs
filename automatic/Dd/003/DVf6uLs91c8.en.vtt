favorite sing with Pillman so I did live
through<00:02:17.580> those<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.060> too<00:02:18.240> young<00:02:18.320> any

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320

through those but I was too young any
the<00:02:19.650> reason<00:02:20.070> why<00:02:20.190> Eddie<00:02:20.430> affected<00:02:20.970> me<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
the reason why Eddie affected me the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.810 
the reason why Eddie affected me the
most<00:02:21.330> was<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.350> he<00:02:22.950> was<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.160> five<00:02:23.490> foot

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
most was because he was a five foot

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.400 
most was because he was a five foot
eight<00:02:24.000> guy<00:02:24.360> I'm<00:02:24.600> about<00:02:24.840> maybe<00:02:25.080> two<00:02:25.290> inches

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
eight guy I'm about maybe two inches

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.770 
eight guy I'm about maybe two inches
taller<00:02:25.740> than<00:02:25.890> he<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.160> I'm<00:02:26.880> not<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.270> tall<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
taller than he is I'm not that tall a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.680 
taller than he is I'm not that tall a
person<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.470> he<00:02:29.100> was<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.490> this<00:02:29.790> guy<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.420> had

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
person but he was just this guy that had

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.560 
person but he was just this guy that had
used<00:02:31.170> charisma<00:02:32.070> oozed<00:02:32.310> personality<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.480> was

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
used charisma oozed personality and was

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.500 
used charisma oozed personality and was
a<00:02:33.600> great<00:02:33.930> wrestler<00:02:34.320> at<00:02:34.530> back<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.550> i<00:02:35.850> really

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
a great wrestler at back so i really

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.970 
a great wrestler at back so i really
loved<00:02:36.720> Eddie<00:02:36.930> around<00:02:37.350> he<00:02:37.530> was<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.800> so

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980

charismatic<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.480> guess<00:02:39.660> my<00:02:39.840> favorite

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
charismatic and I guess my favorite

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.199 
charismatic and I guess my favorite
moment<00:02:40.620> from<00:02:40.650> him<00:02:40.980> would<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.490> obvious<00:02:41.670> one

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
moment from him would be the obvious one

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.680 
moment from him would be the obvious one
when<00:02:42.360> he<00:02:42.570> beat<00:02:42.780> Brock<00:02:43.050> Lesnar<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.800> WWE

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
when he beat Brock Lesnar for the WWE

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.490 
when he beat Brock Lesnar for the WWE
title<00:02:45.690> um<00:02:46.670> Chris<00:02:47.670> Benoit<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.500> probably

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
title um Chris Benoit was probably

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.710 
title um Chris Benoit was probably
affected<00:02:49.860> me<00:02:49.980> even<00:02:50.190> more<00:02:50.459> because<00:02:50.790> he<00:02:51.510> was<00:02:51.690> a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
affected me even more because he was a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720 
affected me even more because he was a
wrestler<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.709> over<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.550> field

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
wrestler that got over just on the field

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.750 
wrestler that got over just on the field
the<00:02:54.480> pure<00:02:54.900> fact<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.350> he<00:02:55.470> was<00:02:55.590> talented<00:02:55.890> he

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
the pure fact that he was talented he

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.699 
the pure fact that he was talented he
went<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.180> there<00:02:57.209> he<00:02:57.720> destroyed<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.410> shit<00:02:58.590> out
