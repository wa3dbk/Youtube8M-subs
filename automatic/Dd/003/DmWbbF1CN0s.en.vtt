00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 I is amber from the horse insider 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.089
 point is coming and I want to be here today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.720
 with part 2 of horses important and safe 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.720
 attach 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.819
 [Music] 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.669
 to correctly attach a horse 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.650
 First of all, it is also the right one 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.220
 There is a choice of help 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.070
 own video and then of course 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.769
 the right choice of the knit 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.519
 Of course, there are many 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:45.230
 different cabin but on and for 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.360
 you can differentiate yourself in a group 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.089
 a security or too 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.579
 panic attacks and not in one 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.320
 thus secured hook distinction 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.030
 Of course, it is clear here when the horse 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.059
 really arrive then this hook goes 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.299
 she can speak to the horse, so to speak 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.750
 free in any emergency or 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:07.460
 panic situation and such hooks 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.610
 Unfortunately, either the halter breaks 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.680
 the stripe broke the bar or broken 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.439
 The horse broke in the worst case 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.270
 So those or even so far admits 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.689
 These western booze and stuff like that 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.009
 They do not secure other carbines 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.380
 Of course they have clear 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.800
 dangerous 54 if it hangs on 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.930
 because she just does not rise then 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.780
 so that you can, of course, always 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.030
 Basically, I must hang on 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.250
 a horse at all anna me please mine 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.350
 horses my own horses from what 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.130
 they also stand free at the same time 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.560
 saddle 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.450
 even when cleaning that they just learn 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.030
 to be free or to accept them 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.010
 has to hang because it always stays 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.170
 certain residual risk even if I have the 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.940
 drives right trailer even if I 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.130
 correct halter sizes and so on 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.400
 Used when a horse startles 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.040
 or just kind of 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.720
 a fly can turn around or something like that 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.240
 we already block tension 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.250
 continue to generate this and forget that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.140
 many people when you attach horses 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.850
 that they just do not think that 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.040
 that are attached and that they are simple 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.990
 fly or brake bite and thereby 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.530
 time and again in the neck and so on 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.530
 Mucke himself and thus trauma 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.390
 can therefore be considered as correct 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.930
 is the variant food really drives 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.370
 solid, so to speak, stand by 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.070
 bring but that is of course synonymous 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.560
 a well fenced area so now 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.959
 Milled is deliberately misaligned 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.140
 So this year is definitely like this 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.180
 long appended too deeply attached 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.190
 and then not with a right one 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.110
 knot so no safety knots 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.200
 so if we have one now 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.540
 step is there or for example 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.920
 in the face of music cats and two 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.380
 a brake or the plane is sitting that 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.800
 I have a hakelt here panic get the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.150
 Of course, then , it will catch it 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.480
 damage within for worried 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.880
 musculature or other structures 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.010
 can come or just again 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.620
 walk or search for is so that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.989
 absolutely not or have as he leans 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.340
 So it's wrong to know correctly 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.140
 a horse always with the safety 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.140
 knots and ideally also 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.650
 even with panic hooked to yes just not 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.660
 long 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.180
 that does not somehow result 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.709
 may impose and very important just 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.560
 This safety minutes open 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.330
 just in every situation immediately and he 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.980
 does not even pull yourself 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.450
 So it's getting stuck somehow now 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.430
 you get that idea were 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.739
 You can really jerk it right away 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.600
 open here you see that again in the 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.480
 Close up, we'll show you that again 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.340
 how to put it on so you do that 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.769
 safety cited here for 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.410
 sling and here you will see how to 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.400
 the end with a jerk, so to speak again 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.250
 can raise so that 's it for today 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.980
 from my side of pr inside.com to 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.110
 Attach horses correctly 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.390
 I also have another one 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.890
 correctly attach a video on the topic of horses 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.310
 of course , that's what it is, of course 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.260
 on 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.510
 so you know rest horses the best 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.900
 attaches and where least happen 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.419
 can 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.850
 and most importantly also the topic 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.940
