00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
anyone it'll last you a long time and it

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.160 
anyone it'll last you a long time and it
actually<00:02:53.790> does<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.420> amazing<00:02:54.720> pop<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.989> has

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
actually does have amazing pop it has

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.729 
actually does have amazing pop it has
amazing<00:02:58.560> pop<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.340> the<00:03:00.120> shape<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.290> got<00:03:01.500> is

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
amazing pop on the shape that I got is

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.120 
amazing pop on the shape that I got is
like<00:03:02.280> an<00:03:02.430> eight<00:03:02.610> point<00:03:03.000> 25<00:03:03.630> i<00:03:03.660> think<00:03:04.080> i<00:03:04.350> got

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
like an eight point 25 i think i got

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.040 
like an eight point 25 i think i got
big-ass<00:03:05.489> feet<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.709> concave<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:09.050> concave

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
big-ass feet and the concave the concave

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.250 
big-ass feet and the concave the concave
is<00:03:10.260> pretty<00:03:10.590> deep<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.540> really<00:03:12.750> good<00:03:12.989> for

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
is pretty deep so it's really good for

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.979 
is pretty deep so it's really good for
kick<00:03:13.800> flips<00:03:14.070> and<00:03:14.310> heel<00:03:14.489> flips<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.150> tre<00:03:15.690> flips

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
kick flips and heel flips and tre flips

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.229 
kick flips and heel flips and tre flips
and<00:03:17.030> inward<00:03:18.030> heel<00:03:18.269> flips<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:19.550> hard<00:03:20.550> clips<00:03:20.970> and

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
and inward heel flips and hard clips and

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.380 
and inward heel flips and hard clips and
everything

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.309 

I<00:03:24.480> think<00:03:25.110> Holly's<00:03:25.470> our<00:03:25.620> best<00:03:25.920> with<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.160> though

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
I think Holly's our best with it though

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.670 
I think Holly's our best with it though
yeah<00:03:28.319> but<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.770> mean<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:30.140> think<00:03:31.140> it's<00:03:31.260> amazing<00:03:31.520> um

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
yeah but I mean I think it's amazing um

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.090 
yeah but I mean I think it's amazing um
they<00:03:34.680> say<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:34.950> with<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.520> carbon<00:03:35.940> fiber<00:03:37.100> they

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
they say that with the carbon fiber they

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.990 
they say that with the carbon fiber they
can<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.390> they<00:03:39.390> only<00:03:39.569> use<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> six<00:03:40.500> sheets<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:44.000> of

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
can on they only use a six sheets of of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.540 
can on they only use a six sheets of of
a<00:03:45.810> wood<00:03:47.090> instead<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.360> set<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.200> seven<00:03:49.709> inside

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
a wood instead of a set of seven inside

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.610 
a wood instead of a set of seven inside
of<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.700> straight<00:03:50.940> up<00:03:50.970> seven<00:03:51.360> flights<00:03:51.500> it's<00:03:52.500> a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
of a straight up seven flights it's a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.820 
of a straight up seven flights it's a
six<00:03:52.860> fly<00:03:53.040> sorry<00:03:53.970> just<00:03:54.150> had<00:03:54.330> dinner<00:03:56.090> okay<00:03:57.090> um

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
six fly sorry just had dinner okay um

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.880 
six fly sorry just had dinner okay um
yeah<00:03:58.830> they<00:03:59.040> say<00:03:59.220> they<00:03:59.480> use<00:04:00.480> six<00:04:01.230> flies<00:04:01.470> instead

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
yeah they say they use six flies instead

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.240 
yeah they say they use six flies instead
of<00:04:01.980> seven<00:04:02.250> pies<00:04:02.430> because<00:04:02.790> with<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.250> extra

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
of seven pies because with that a extra

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.750 
of seven pies because with that a extra
layer<00:04:05.459> of<00:04:05.489> carbon<00:04:06.209> fiber<00:04:08.360> see<00:04:09.360> um<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:10.760> covered

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
layer of carbon fiber see um I covered

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.729 
layer of carbon fiber see um I covered
it<00:04:11.850> all<00:04:12.030> up<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:13.250> here<00:04:14.250> at<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.580> end<00:04:15.560> it's<00:04:16.560> like

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
it all up but here at the end it's like

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:24.530 
it all up but here at the end it's like
right<00:04:17.100> here<00:04:18.620> right<00:04:19.620> there<00:04:20.239> um<00:04:23.270> yeah<00:04:24.270> where

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
right here right there um yeah where

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.000 
right here right there um yeah where
that<00:04:24.750> where<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.169> grip<00:04:25.350> tape<00:04:25.530> ends<00:04:25.800> right

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
that where the grip tape ends right

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.450 
that where the grip tape ends right
there<00:04:26.600> that's<00:04:27.600> supposedly<00:04:28.560> an<00:04:28.950> actual<00:04:29.340> layer

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
there that's supposedly an actual layer

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.090 
there that's supposedly an actual layer
of<00:04:29.790> carbon<00:04:30.210> fiber<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:33.150> UM<00:04:33.360> help<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.410> hold<00:04:34.620> more

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
of carbon fiber to UM help it hold more

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.340 
of carbon fiber to UM help it hold more
better<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.740> double<00:04:38.010> impact<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.700> um<00:04:39.350> right

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
better and the double impact is um right

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.200 
better and the double impact is um right
here<00:04:42.620> we're<00:04:43.620> like<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.370> carbon<00:04:44.700> fiber<00:04:44.880> is

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
here we're like the carbon fiber is

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:53.480 
here we're like the carbon fiber is
right<00:04:45.780> here<00:04:46.970> see<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:50.960> has<00:04:51.960> two<00:04:52.350> rings<00:04:52.680> right

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
right here see it it has two rings right

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.100 
right here see it it has two rings right
where<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> trucks<00:04:54.060> are<00:04:54.240> supposed<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.690> be<00:04:54.870> and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
where the trucks are supposed to be and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.540 
where the trucks are supposed to be and
it's<00:04:55.260> supposed<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.650> disperse<00:04:56.100> energy

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
it's supposed to disperse energy

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.980 
it's supposed to disperse energy
throughout<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.940> whole<00:04:57.210> board<00:04:57.479> instead<00:04:57.870> of

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
throughout the whole board instead of

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.250 
throughout the whole board instead of
pressure<00:04:58.560> right<00:04:58.890> there<00:04:59.270> so<00:05:00.270> it'll<00:05:00.750> last<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.200> a

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
pressure right there so it'll last you a

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.050 
pressure right there so it'll last you a
long<00:05:01.470> time<00:05:03.110> yeah<00:05:04.110> I'm<00:05:04.260> hoping<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.830> a<00:05:04.940> take<00:05:05.940> it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
long time yeah I'm hoping to a take it

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.430 
long time yeah I'm hoping to a take it
out<00:05:06.180> tomorrow<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:07.470> just<00:05:07.620> skate<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:09.440> skate

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
out tomorrow and just skate it skate
