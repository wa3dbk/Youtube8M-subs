00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.759
 I hope you like the warmed up dry 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.480
 and outdated because this week in order to 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.429
 stick to the news 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.780
 videogame of the past months I judged 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.210
 wise to cause you some 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.480
 instants a really interesting title 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.980
 and which is called grim fandango you the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.359
 certainly know the completeness of 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.949
 the internet is currently in the process of 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.599
 sing the praises of this title which has 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.970
 revolutionized the way we tell 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.919
 a video game story about 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.409
 pc so the fact is that the players 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.180
 console already had games with 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.399
 three-dimensional characters that get 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.230
 moves in sets but that it was 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.000
 something we had rarely seen on pc 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.250
 is rarely seen as well written on pc 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.750
 it's a title that survives on its charm 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.370
 and not on his gameplay qualities 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.600
 and in this episode 6 of a broadcast of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.250
 video game reviewer from belgium 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.989
 we are going to ask ourselves a simple 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.519
 question an easy question 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.589
 a classic question to be 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.899
 considered a classic enough 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.899
 to be considered a classic 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.820
 I remind you the question because she 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.260
 is of importance for the entirety of 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.630
 what am I going to present here the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.860
 question is so to be considered 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.050
 like a classic is what is enough 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.950
 that a game is considered a 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.570
 classic is well and truly 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.130
 considerations it's here question off 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.050
 I would think that games 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.880
 who actually manage to take their 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.440
 place in the history of the video game have 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.150
 one of the following qualities 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.980
 they have either a gameplay so much 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.080
 successful that will never seem outmoded 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.090
 or they have something unique 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.250
 which certainly makes them interesting 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.020
 existence as a historical fact it 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.280
 is also possible when a game 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.870
 foreshadows the future ie 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.820
 sees through him the beginnings of a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.860
 future announcement and that eventually will happen 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.260
 because people have implanted things 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.330
 in this one in order to build their 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.980
 terrible personality there are also the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.110
 fake classic the fake classic this 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.700
 are these games that are on the top of the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.020
 tops 10 for so many years that 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.330
 people do not even get tired there 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.490
 play insar not precisely why he 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.459
 should make a special effort so 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.410
 to judge the quality of the securities concerned 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.330
 because you know very well that you do not have 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.239
 not want to make you piss off by 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.160
 hordes of exultant and belching boy fans 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.170
 on your channel you know very well 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.700
 that people do not want to arrive 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.440
 in a field of violence the month the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.360
 violence it does not bother me absolutely 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.640
 because eventually I think it takes a 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.260
 moment or another rather be frank by 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.150
 relating to his personal choices to his 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.910
 felt things that actually 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.200
 look for the answer wrapped up this game 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.880
 you have before your eyes is called grim 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.190
 fandango and master they were nine in 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.019
 98 and he's now come out to the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.510
 the magic of a wolf and function portage 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.070
 on vita playstation cap mac linux and pc 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.350
 it's a game of tim schaffer creator 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.660
 emeritus of classics as brutal agent 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.519
 rubs in quebec part where can she 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.140
 beast psychonauts is this a guy we're going 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.030
 to say this is probably the most 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.360
 great writer of the history of the game 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.310
 video 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.170
 it's a guy he has games that are 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.850
 so low achieved on these 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.290
 scenarios that we say yes yes but in 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.209
 same time since its gameplay all the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.739
 no time I'm going to make an effort I'm going 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.640
 buy I will support him and we will 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.200
 is now in a situation 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.150
 definitely people are trying to us 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.260
 to say like this that our was a big 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.810
 platform game 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.360
 this is not the case is scheduled 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.470
 by brett mogilev if a guy who claims 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.300
 to have a wind 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.460
 enter the gameplay system where one 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.080
 can play with characters that are 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.360
 in 3d on precomputed decors and 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.420
 interact with objects even though the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.190
 fact is that in 1998 at the time when this 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.330
 game spell we had already seen resident evil 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.070
 2 on consoles 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.720
 see you it's a type of inventions 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.580
 which is confined to the world of pc 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.320
 do you see on pc you can do some 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.890
 classics have a zero gameplay 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.080
 a zero playability of the abilities that 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.370
 are evident in the field of 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.739
 staging is certain but that 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.480
 here it is only on pc that we can 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.709
 make comics interactive and say this 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.810
 are the biggest games all the time 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.580
 because it is a game that actually 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.140
 qualities and charming graphics of 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.610
 pieters welcomed peter hutton from the 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.200
 music of peter mc connell a guy who 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.110
 is also known for its 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.020
 work on incredible audio effects 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.270
 star wars game that on these games of 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.010
 davant than lucasarts at a time and 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.180
 of which these is probably the beginning 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.160
 of the end because do you see when you 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.990
 make a game that comes out the year of half 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.580
 life and who sells for less than 500 thousand 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.990
 copies despite the fact that it is 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.200
 acclaimed by the entirety of the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.790
 press a third he asks himself questions 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.490
 and we must also say that when 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.800
 lucasarts tried one last game a 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.570
 last adventure game in this type of 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.250
 formula is escape from monkey island 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.750
 and we can not say that this is the 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.250
 most successful of the series but released on 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.990
 ps2 so they tried to sell it 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.190
 all I have to say to you here is 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.110
 that I would have a lot of trouble 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.690
 consider that grim fandango and again 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.140
 any kind of interest by the 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.760
 gameplay 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.530
 it's obvious that it's probably 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.150
 one of the best tell stories 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.890
 the video game story but it's a 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.020
 title that came out the resident year 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.940
 evil 2 of starcraft 2 0 x2 parasites 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.220
 yves of metal gear solid gran turismo de 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.350
 pokemon daf karine aftam type of 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.850
 baldur's gate and so I have a lot of 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.160
 bad to consider a grim fandango 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.900
 yourself in the top 10 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.550
 games released this year there must be 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.890
 not messing around it's definitely a 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.630
 interesting example of a total failure 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.340
 from a sales point of view is 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.350
 certainly one of those games that deserves 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.479
 to be protected which you should have 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.350
 played but only to report 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.390
 how well she is able 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.250
 to install a classic in the 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.020
 remember the audience when we are 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.310
 journalist because it is indeed that of 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.229
 which we are talking about is a game that 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.670
 is supposedly in good taste it's a game 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.260
 you 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.780
 eve have played to be able to 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.180
 chat in the living room and it's not 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.980
 a game however good but it's a game 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.360
 really charming and well double that 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.100
 which is interesting to say is that 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.570
 his greatest achievement is to be a 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.010
 excellent cinematics of excellent 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.910
 cinematics actually well written by 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.410
 tim schaffer who is a 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.020
 extraordinarily bad they like 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.300
 designers but that's really great 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.830
 writer he'll have to admit it a 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.900
 moment or another the video game this is 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.730
 not just gameplay but that 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.780
 should also be and that's why 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.000
 that I have a hard time considering 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.960
 grim fandango like a classic from another 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.840
 thing that narration 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.880
 because it is a good too poor video game 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.510
 to be able to move me by his 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.510
 playful qualities
