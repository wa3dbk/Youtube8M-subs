00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.680
 signing Adebayor has made him think 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.270
 more he has put the batteries that we 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.760
 shows this that the French are 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.439
 a few bums apart that the competition is 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.270
 stimulates therefore for us 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.689
 you sleep look you want signed now 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.369
 sounding with his exact dance he is the one 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.080
 runs faster in the world so the 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.970
 day that someone does not run who knows what 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.650
 I can change for man but the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.610
 runs so much because it goes with the car and 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.320
 also the fastest is not him but 20 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.320
 vettel if I already knew that I did not have to 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.299
 come Christian you are very slow and sorry 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.799
 but the heart having to leave you in the 

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:45.769
 bench during the match and that 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:47.659
 play alonso and collaco come on I'll see you 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.790
 very quiet is born of someone who in the 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.210
 next game will be sitting like this 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:57.100
 Who am I, I start to light up and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.100
 that's how threats work well 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.750
 almost always older hey hey he's going 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.880
 well this method of yours yes of course 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.130
 the methods of those of mourinho always 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.020
 sometimes reality also fails but 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.490
 well everyone is good in itself that was a 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.440
 this madness to bring a pilot 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.570
 races but how is it from Madrid and what 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.310
 it's free and also that way it entertains 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.950
 until the season starts we are 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.710
 all happy all except the mushroom of 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.659
 shut up in any case the method is so 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.670
 well I 'm going to take an example if 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.440
 you are very confused with the results 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.440
 guess who will be the coach 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 dt 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.550
 Friendly sight against Spain and Colombia 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.770
 for crisis and the most interesting thing is not 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.350
 happened in the field that means that 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.690
 happened then I have no idea but I 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.670
 I imagine I do not know what you're talking about 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.530
 and that will continue to make the hollow 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.530
 that's a good Spain-Colombia
