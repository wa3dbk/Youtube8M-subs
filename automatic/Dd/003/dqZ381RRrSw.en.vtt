00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.289
 we of course know the mind 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.370
 But what we actually don't know so well is exactly how those 2 turn together 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.200
 to relate 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.710
 and what we are trying to do now is to say translate the spirits into the square 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.760
 we want to know what people fawaz are aware of how they think 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.280
 before that the state lottery made mri scans fmri scans 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.430
 and then you can chart exactly what it was about 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.710
 happened to oblige all kinds of area that we show activity 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.070
 can therefore simply go outside without anyone actively thinking about it 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 what someone 4 the result of a series of pictures that relationship 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.230
 so that we now do 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.830
 went with the minister plasterk to abandon all categories of place 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.350
 can thus determine what he thinks not 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.350
 of that type of category 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.760
 for example, let's see pictures of impressionist paintings and then 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.200
 we can make together his decision activities and what art he rome 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 actually find the best deep inside 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:21.629
 inflation will be 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.519
 regional manager 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.519
 revenge 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.519
 oh well I am always curious what happens 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.809
 I am not used to being among whom four tall 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:36.149
 totally passive to lie still there to be lived and so what happens that 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.319
 takes some getting used to is the prophet is that 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.899
 the party experience 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.129
 of the come without images along the different degrees of penetration 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.219
 again call bussum and then soon sex opportunity uk and benches 6 with 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.219
 different consequence but without success 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 yes that in the not too distant future 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.239
 being 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.169
 10 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.769
 and what we are going to do now is to start looking at which pieces 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.009
 brown from ronald plasterk we also have negative pictures 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:22.090
 For example, mutilated bodies will show and which parts react when 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:25.629
 on the more positive the pictures and the brands think for example that were 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.379
 and started to pilot pictures 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.069
 well and the hand of it can see then yes 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.439
 he belongs little to eat positive and negative and then use that and that 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.509
 again to see how the brain reacted to the other categories of 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.509
 placed 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.599
 what do you think about singing swimming 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.729
 hello plasterk thinks he is working obama and so it may be that he himself 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.889
 says he's not a big fan of berkel warmer at all 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.849
 we think that breinstein is better represented and timina really 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.330
 deep down inside but for example obama then he had that himself 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.360
 also simply because that someone says my mommy is very small reflection 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.800
 of it is a party taking place and just in case of a scan 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.960
 take everything with you
