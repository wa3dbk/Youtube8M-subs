you guys so just wanna give you a quick

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.070 
you guys so just wanna give you a quick
tip<00:00:01.650> on<00:00:01.879> playing<00:00:02.879> major<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.300> minor<00:00:03.449> chords<00:00:03.750> up

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
tip on playing major and minor chords up

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.829 
tip on playing major and minor chords up
and<00:00:04.290> down<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.500> neck<00:00:04.529> rather<00:00:05.160> than<00:00:05.839> playing

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
and down the neck rather than playing

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.030 
and down the neck rather than playing
your<00:00:07.049> standard<00:00:07.379> open<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.010> know<00:00:08.630> G<00:00:10.309> C<00:00:11.309> D<00:00:13.040> so

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
your standard open you know G C D so

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.279 
your standard open you know G C D so
what<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.370> based<00:00:14.580> off<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.780> top<00:00:15.960> string

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
what it's based off of is the top string

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.859 
what it's based off of is the top string
that<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.369> play<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.550> chord<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.630> in

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that you play the chord on and so in

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.400 
that you play the chord on and so in
this<00:00:20.150> in<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.270> lesson<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.930> base

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this in this lesson we're going to base

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
this in this lesson we're going to base
our<00:00:22.619> root<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.760> sixth<00:00:24.119> string<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:26.039> 5th

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
our root on the sixth string and the 5th

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.810 
our root on the sixth string and the 5th
string<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.480> mean<00:00:27.660> by<00:00:27.720> root<00:00:28.710> would<00:00:29.640> be

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
string so what I mean by root would be

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.740 
string so what I mean by root would be
like<00:00:30.029> if<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.330> playing<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:30.689> F<00:00:31.969> then<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.510> root

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
like if we're playing an F then the root

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.639 
like if we're playing an F then the root
would<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.410> F<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> top<00:00:35.309> string<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
would be the F on the top string so this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.690 
would be the F on the top string so this
is<00:00:37.800> your<00:00:37.950> neck<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.910> e<00:00:39.469> open<00:00:40.700> your

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
is your neck so if this is e open your

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
is your neck so if this is e open your
notes<00:00:44.390> sharp<00:00:45.390> G<00:00:45.719> sharp<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.649> B<00:00:47.629> sharp<00:00:48.629> or<00:00:49.140> B<00:00:49.170> flat

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
notes sharp G sharp a B sharp or B flat

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.299 
notes sharp G sharp a B sharp or B flat
same<00:00:50.039> thing<00:00:50.280> B<00:00:51.120> C<00:00:51.980> C<00:00:52.980> sharp<00:00:53.570> D<00:00:54.570> d<00:00:54.680> sharp<00:00:55.680> e<00:00:56.039> flat

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
same thing B C C sharp D d sharp e flat

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.830 
same thing B C C sharp D d sharp e flat
same<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:58.489> yes<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.789> would<00:00:59.940> find<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.510> root

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
same thing yes you would find your root

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
same thing yes you would find your root
on<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.350> 6th<00:01:01.680> string<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:01.980> play<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> major

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
on the 6th string and play the major

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.179 
on the 6th string and play the major
shape<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> major<00:01:03.930> shape<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> 6th

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
shape and so the major shape on the 6th

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.030 
shape and so the major shape on the 6th
string<00:01:05.420> with<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.659> sixth<00:01:07.080> string<00:01:07.320> root<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:10.040> F

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
string with a sixth string root is the F

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.060 
string with a sixth string root is the F
you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.740 

learn<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:15.939> 1<00:01:16.240> 3<00:01:16.600> 3<00:01:16.659> 2<00:01:17.380> 1<00:01:17.829> 1<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:19.420> take<00:01:19.600> that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
learn so 1 3 3 2 1 1 I can take that

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.350 
learn so 1 3 3 2 1 1 I can take that
same<00:01:20.020> shape<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.649> because<00:01:20.829> my<00:01:21.250> finger<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.090> kind

that shape same thing goes for minor

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.390 
that shape same thing goes for minor
chords<00:02:05.170> as<00:02:05.290> well<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:06.220> only<00:02:06.310> difference

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
chords as well the only difference

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.580 
chords as well the only difference
between<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.120> minor<00:02:07.330> chord<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.900> major<00:02:08.170> chord

between the minor chord the major chord

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
between the minor chord the major chord
is<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.250> flattened<00:02:09.730> 2/3<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:11.170> would<00:02:11.200> be

fifth string same approach just

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.550 
fifth string same approach just
different<00:02:53.170> shapes<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:55.079> the<00:02:56.079> knees<00:02:56.920> C<00:02:57.540> D

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
different shapes so that the knees C D

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.640 
different shapes so that the knees C D
the<00:03:00.629> present<00:03:01.629> all<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.840> notes<00:03:02.019> in<00:03:02.139> between<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
the present all the notes in between the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.020 
the present all the notes in between the
Sharps<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.159> flats<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:06.459> major<00:03:06.670> shape

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
Sharps and the flats the major shape

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.080 
Sharps and the flats the major shape
would<00:03:07.269> be<00:03:07.450> say<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.379> is<00:03:08.440> B<00:03:08.739> flat<00:03:11.579> then<00:03:12.579> that

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
would be say if this is B flat then that

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.349 
would be say if this is B flat then that
means<00:03:13.299> your<00:03:13.450> shape<00:03:13.599> would<00:03:13.750> be<00:03:13.810> 1<00:03:14.290> 3<00:03:15.010> 3<00:03:15.549> 3

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
means your shape would be 1 3 3 3

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.010 
means your shape would be 1 3 3 3
I<00:03:17.280> usually<00:03:18.280> just<00:03:18.519> play

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.080 

just<00:03:22.020> i<00:03:22.290> usually<00:03:23.100> don't<00:03:23.280> play<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.580> many<00:03:23.910> days

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
just i usually don't play this many days

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.800 
just i usually don't play this many days
just<00:03:24.270> meet<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.830> do<00:03:25.830> whatever<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.160> want<00:03:26.340> though

just meet it do whatever you want though
and<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:28.230> yeah<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.620> move<00:03:28.770> it<00:03:28.890> up<00:03:28.950> if<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.460> find

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and so yeah you can move it up if I find

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.970 
and so yeah you can move it up if I find
the<00:03:29.820> C<00:03:30.120> which<00:03:30.690> would<00:03:30.840> be<00:03:30.990> on<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.230> fifth<00:03:31.770> string

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
the C which would be on the fifth string

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.410 
the C which would be on the fifth string
third<00:03:32.190> fret

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
third fret

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.710 
third fret
I<00:03:33.860> can<00:03:34.860> play<00:03:35.010> C<00:03:35.240> instead<00:03:36.240> of<00:03:36.330> playing<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.660> this

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
I can play C instead of playing it this

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.410 
I can play C instead of playing it this
way<00:03:39.080> you<00:03:40.080> know<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.410> yeah<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.850> goes<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.210> and<00:03:42.330> on

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
way you know and yeah it goes on and on

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.800 
way you know and yeah it goes on and on
so<00:03:42.480> say<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> find<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:44.040> which<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.550> up<00:03:44.790> here<00:03:44.820> on<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
so say I find a which is up here on the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.220 
so say I find a which is up here on the
seventh<00:03:46.170> fret<00:03:46.350> fifth<00:03:46.680> string<00:03:47.990> and<00:03:50.900> then<00:03:51.900> same

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
seventh fret fifth string and then same

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.340 
seventh fret fifth string and then same
thing<00:03:52.260> with<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> major<00:03:53.820> minor<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.420> flatten<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
thing with the major minor I flatten the

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.770 
thing with the major minor I flatten the
third<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.220> chord<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.760> B<00:04:00.150> flat<00:04:00.450> minor

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
third of the chord so a B flat minor

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:10.949 
third of the chord so a B flat minor
with<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.740> fifth<00:04:02.070> string<00:04:02.550> root<00:04:03.110> would<00:04:04.110> be<00:04:05.810> 1/3

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.470 

and<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.469> can<00:04:11.650> move<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.920> up<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.219> down<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.579> I'm

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
and you can move it up and down so I'm

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.770 
and you can move it up and down so I'm
gonna<00:04:13.599> play<00:04:13.810> an<00:04:13.900> F<00:04:14.079> minor<00:04:15.269> find<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.389> half<00:04:16.539> which

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
gonna play an F minor find a half which

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.620 
gonna play an F minor find a half which
is<00:04:16.810> on<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.199> eighth<00:04:17.320> fret

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.830 

and<00:04:20.490> there<00:04:21.490> you<00:04:21.580> go<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:24.210> that's<00:04:25.210> four<00:04:25.570> shapes

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
and there you go so that's four shapes

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.380 
and there you go so that's four shapes
you<00:04:26.170> have<00:04:26.200> your<00:04:26.560> six<00:04:27.250> string<00:04:27.580> shapes<00:04:27.940> which

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
you have your six string shapes which

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.230 
you have your six string shapes which
would<00:04:28.600> be<00:04:28.750> half<00:04:29.160> or<00:04:30.160> what<00:04:30.700> squeaking<00:04:31.030> plate

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
would be half or what squeaking plate

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.180 
would be half or what squeaking plate
let's<00:04:31.420> do<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.900> for<00:04:32.140> an<00:04:32.230> example

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.350 

and<00:04:37.190> then<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:37.490> can<00:04:37.610> play<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.760> line<00:04:38.120> here

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
and then you can play the line here

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.780 
and then you can play the line here
which<00:04:38.630> is<00:04:40.420> and<00:04:41.420> then<00:04:42.320> taking<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.980> strings<00:04:43.550> so

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
which is and then taking the strings so

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.710 
which is and then taking the strings so
if<00:04:44.420> I<00:04:44.540> stay<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.990> fifth<00:04:45.200> fret<00:04:46.450> this<00:04:47.450> note

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
if I stay on the fifth fret this note

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.550 
if I stay on the fifth fret this note
right<00:04:47.900> here<00:04:47.930> would<00:04:48.200> be<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.410> d<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:50.530> b<00:04:51.530> c<00:04:51.560> d<00:04:53.560> and

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
right here would be a d a b c d and

I'll try and put up a video on nature
scales<00:05:48.630> on<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:49.780> major<00:05:49.960> scale<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.910> what<00:05:51.910> I'm

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
scales on the major scale and what I'm

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.610 
scales on the major scale and what I'm
talking<00:05:52.210> about<00:05:52.389> with<00:05:52.690> intervals<00:05:53.289> and

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
talking about with intervals and

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.290 
talking about with intervals and
flattening<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.280> 3rd<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.910> difference

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
flattening the 3rd and the difference

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.779 
flattening the 3rd and the difference
between<00:05:55.479> major<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.080> minor<00:05:56.229> scales<00:05:56.949> a<00:05:57.669> little

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
between major and minor scales a little

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.159 
between major and minor scales a little
bit<00:05:58.060> later<00:05:58.300> probably<00:05:58.630> next<00:05:58.840> week<00:05:58.960> or
