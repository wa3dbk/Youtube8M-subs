00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.970 
easy to like swing around manipulate
twist<00:04:12.120> up<00:04:12.390> do<00:04:12.959> whatever<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.709> want<00:04:13.920> to

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
twist up do whatever it is you want to

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.830 
twist up do whatever it is you want to
do<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.520> if<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.700> want<00:04:14.880> something<00:04:15.090> isn't<00:04:15.630> heavy

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
do so if you want something isn't heavy

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.810 
do so if you want something isn't heavy
it's<00:04:16.670> perfect<00:04:17.750> um<00:04:18.980> what<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.010> think<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.400> did<00:04:20.580> wrong

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
it's perfect um what I think I did wrong

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.560 
it's perfect um what I think I did wrong
is<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.900> think<00:04:22.410> if<00:04:23.280> you're<00:04:24.120> going<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.300> wear<00:04:24.450> them

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
is I think if you're going to wear them

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.340 
is I think if you're going to wear them
down<00:04:24.780> then<00:04:25.790> it's<00:04:26.790> finally<00:04:27.360> room<00:04:27.600> do<00:04:27.990> different

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
down then it's finally room do different

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.350 
down then it's finally room do different
this<00:04:28.500> but<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.830> did<00:04:29.070> different<00:04:29.400> lengths<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:29.820> I

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
this but I did different lengths and I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.670 
this but I did different lengths and I
don't<00:04:30.510> like<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.810> way<00:04:30.930> they<00:04:31.050> look<00:04:31.080> down

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
don't like the way they look down

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.680 
don't like the way they look down
and<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.979> think<00:04:32.039> it<00:04:32.310> would<00:04:32.400> be<00:04:32.520> easier<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:33.270> do

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
and I think it would be easier to do

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.200 
and I think it would be easier to do
different<00:04:34.199> styles<00:04:34.710> if<00:04:34.889> I<00:04:35.310> had<00:04:35.639> done<00:04:35.850> them<00:04:36.030> all

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
different styles if I had done them all

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.330 
different styles if I had done them all
the<00:04:36.630> same<00:04:36.660> length<00:04:37.169> looks<00:04:37.889> like<00:04:38.039> it<00:04:38.190> would<00:04:38.280> be

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the same length looks like it would be

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.070 
the same length looks like it would be
easier<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.000> wouldn't<00:04:39.270> have<00:04:39.360> as<00:04:39.539> many<00:04:39.840> in

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
easier and I wouldn't have as many in

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.150 
easier and I wouldn't have as many in
sticking<00:04:40.740> out<00:04:40.889> when<00:04:41.400> i<00:04:41.430> try<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.759> style<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.270> um

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
sticking out when i try to style it um

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.700 
sticking out when i try to style it um
the<00:04:44.160> other<00:04:44.190> thing<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.759> did<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:45.289> my<00:04:46.289> parts

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710

them<00:04:50.759> a<00:04:50.940> little<00:04:51.180> small<00:04:51.600> around<00:04:52.199> my<00:04:52.500> edges<00:04:53.039> and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
them a little small around my edges and

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.540 
them a little small around my edges and
around<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.780> back<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.500> I<00:04:55.530> did<00:04:55.979> kind<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.400> like

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
I like it I think they're gonna grow on

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.120 
I like it I think they're gonna grow on
me<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:16.020> is<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.349> first<00:05:16.560> day<00:05:16.710> that<00:05:16.740> I<00:05:16.949> had<00:05:17.099> a

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
me this is the first day that I had a

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.129 
me this is the first day that I had a
minute<00:05:17.460> I'm<00:05:17.580> not<00:05:17.610> used<00:05:17.910> to<00:05:17.970> seeing<00:05:18.240> myself<00:05:18.419> you

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
minute I'm not used to seeing myself you

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.900 
minute I'm not used to seeing myself you

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
know with these so I think it's gonna

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.029 
know with these so I think it's gonna
grow<00:05:21.090> on<00:05:21.300> me<00:05:21.449> eventually<00:05:22.020> I<00:05:22.050> probably<00:05:22.410> crinkle

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
grow on me eventually I probably crinkle

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.089
