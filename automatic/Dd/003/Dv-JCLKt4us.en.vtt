case reminds me of a transformer I don't
know<00:02:12.459> what<00:02:12.609> are<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.790> guys<00:02:12.939> saying

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
know what are you guys saying

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.420 
know what are you guys saying
but<00:02:15.540> anyways<00:02:15.900> as<00:02:16.260> far<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> case<00:02:16.800> goes<00:02:16.830> you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
but anyways as far as the case goes you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.110 
but anyways as far as the case goes you
have<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:18.060> rubber<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.650> edges<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.549> that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
have a rubber on the edges here and that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.660 
have a rubber on the edges here and that
helps<00:02:21.360> protect<00:02:21.930> from<00:02:22.590> gives<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.400> shock

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
helps protect from gives you shock

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.570 
helps protect from gives you shock
absorption<00:02:24.260> now<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.590> case<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:26.099> kind<00:02:26.489> of

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
absorption now in this case is kind of

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.550 
absorption now in this case is kind of
slick<00:02:26.849> that's<00:02:27.060> one<00:02:27.299> probably<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> main<00:02:28.290> flaw

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
slick that's one probably the main flaw

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.190 
slick that's one probably the main flaw
about<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.040> case<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.640> doesn't<00:02:30.090> feel<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.599> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
about this case it doesn't feel like you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.470 
about this case it doesn't feel like you
have<00:02:31.379> much<00:02:31.739> grip<00:02:32.069> on<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.580> am<00:02:32.730> pretty<00:02:32.970> careful

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
have much grip on it I am pretty careful

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.360 
have much grip on it I am pretty careful
with<00:02:33.599> my<00:02:33.720> phones<00:02:33.959> though<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:35.069> that's<00:02:35.250> not

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
with my phones though so that's not

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.949 
with my phones though so that's not
something<00:02:35.549> I<00:02:35.760> worry<00:02:36.000> about<00:02:36.090> all<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.420> time<00:02:36.720> but

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
something I worry about all the time but

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.869 
something I worry about all the time but
somebody<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:37.950> kind<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.489> more<00:02:39.239> careless<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:40.879> can

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
somebody is kind of more careless I can

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.369 
somebody is kind of more careless I can
see<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.239> phone<00:02:42.480> slipping<00:02:43.049> out<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.200> their

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
see this phone slipping out of their

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.420 
see this phone slipping out of their
hands<00:02:43.640> unfortunately<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.329> uh<00:02:46.160> it's<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.250> nice

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
hands unfortunately but uh it's a nice

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.449 
hands unfortunately but uh it's a nice
design<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:49.170> gotta<00:02:49.379> lay<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.769> table<00:02:49.829> design

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
design you gotta lay on the table design

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.520 
design you gotta lay on the table design
here<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.209> got<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.360> nice<00:02:51.510> little<00:02:51.720> lip<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
here so you got a nice little lip so it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710 
here so you got a nice little lip so it
means<00:02:52.680> if<00:02:52.859> you<00:02:52.950> want<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.160> lay<00:02:53.280> facedown<00:02:54.060> flat

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
means if you want to lay facedown flat

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.280 
means if you want to lay facedown flat
surface<00:02:55.319> you're<00:02:55.500> fine<00:02:55.849> so<00:02:56.849> if<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.660> were<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
surface you're fine so if you were to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.680 
surface you're fine so if you were to
drop<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.829> case<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.250> think<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.609> would<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.299> fine

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
drop this case I think you would be fine

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.670 
drop this case I think you would be fine
as<00:03:00.989> long<00:03:01.019> as<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.790> minor<00:03:02.790> drive<00:03:03.269> nothing<00:03:03.870> too

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
as long as as a minor drive nothing too

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.589 
as long as as a minor drive nothing too
dramatic<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.030> drop<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.390> on

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
dramatic because if you drop this on

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.470 
dramatic because if you drop this on
comfort<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.410> mean<00:03:07.709> concrete<00:03:08.340> from<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.269> maybe

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
comfort I mean concrete from like maybe

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.080 
comfort I mean concrete from like maybe
two<00:03:09.989> feet<00:03:10.019> or<00:03:10.859> something<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.430> you'll

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
two feet or something like that you'll

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.809 
two feet or something like that you'll
be<00:03:12.239> fine<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:13.379> anything<00:03:13.829> higher<00:03:14.069> than<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.459> I

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
be fine but anything higher than it I

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.610 
be fine but anything higher than it I
don't<00:03:15.569> think<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:16.019> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> survive<00:03:16.560> i

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
don't think it's going to survive i

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.720 
don't think it's going to survive i
think<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.069> screen<00:03:17.340> would<00:03:17.489> shatter<00:03:18.019> but<00:03:19.730> this

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
think the screen would shatter but this

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.240 
think the screen would shatter but this
case<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.329> made<00:03:21.599> for<00:03:21.859> just<00:03:22.859> pretty<00:03:23.069> much

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
case is just made for just pretty much

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.720 
case is just made for just pretty much
average<00:03:23.669> protection<00:03:24.359> so<00:03:25.040> yep<00:03:26.040> all<00:03:26.400> your

buttons and stuff are accessible a nice
looking<00:03:29.069> case<00:03:29.370> only<00:03:30.180> flaws<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:31.139> pretty

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
looking case only flaws that is pretty

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.220 
looking case only flaws that is pretty
slick<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.299> that's<00:03:33.299> pretty<00:03:33.540> much<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:34.079> my

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
slick and that's pretty much it on my
