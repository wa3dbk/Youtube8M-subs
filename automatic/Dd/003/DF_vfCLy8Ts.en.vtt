hey<00:00:00.989> guys<00:00:01.170> welcome<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.920> whiteboard<00:00:02.100> Wednesday

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey guys welcome to whiteboard Wednesday

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.090 
hey guys welcome to whiteboard Wednesday
we've<00:00:03.449> been<00:00:03.600> talking<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.959> lot<00:00:04.110> about<00:00:04.140> tires<00:00:04.710> and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
we've been talking a lot about tires and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.920 
we've been talking a lot about tires and
tire<00:00:05.310> performance<00:00:05.520> recently<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.600> we're<00:00:06.720> kind

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
tire performance recently and we're kind

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.900 
tire performance recently and we're kind
of<00:00:06.960> keep<00:00:07.170> falling<00:00:07.950> along<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.400> vein<00:00:08.429> for

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
of keep falling along that vein for

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.879 
of keep falling along that vein for
another<00:00:09.120> week<00:00:09.389> or<00:00:09.540> two<00:00:09.599> because<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.170> think<00:00:10.230> well

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
another week or two because I think well

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.620 
another week or two because I think well
tires<00:00:11.280> are<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> only<00:00:11.790> thing<00:00:12.150> touching<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
tires are the only thing touching the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.030 
tires are the only thing touching the
road<00:00:12.809> right<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.290> they're<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> only<00:00:13.710> thing

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
road right so they're the only thing

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.099 
road right so they're the only thing
that<00:00:14.160> really<00:00:14.429> contributes<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> cornering

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
that really contributes to the cornering

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.840 
that really contributes to the cornering
performance<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:17.010> go-kart<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.640> they're

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
performance of your go-kart so they're

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.689 
performance of your go-kart so they're
fairly<00:00:18.390> important<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.020> think<00:00:19.080> you'd<00:00:19.380> agree<00:00:19.699> so

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
fairly important I think you'd agree so

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.910 
fairly important I think you'd agree so
this<00:00:20.910> week<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.359> want<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> ask<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> question

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
this week I want to ask you a question

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.240 
this week I want to ask you a question
are<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.880> talking<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.750> your<00:00:24.990> tires<00:00:25.320> when<00:00:26.010> your

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
are you talking to your tires when your

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.859 
are you talking to your tires when your
tires<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.730> trying<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> tell<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.420> something

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
tires are trying to tell you something

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
tires are trying to tell you something
are<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.410> listening<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.550> asking<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
are you listening and are you asking the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
are you listening and are you asking the
right<00:00:30.269> questions<00:00:30.869> your<00:00:31.590> tires<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.219> tell<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
right questions your tires can tell you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.520 
right questions your tires can tell you
a<00:00:32.579> great<00:00:32.940> deal<00:00:33.390> about<00:00:33.660> how<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> karts

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a great deal about how the karts

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.110 
a great deal about how the karts
performing<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> track<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.730> you've

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
performing out on the track and you've

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.340 
performing out on the track and you've
just<00:00:36.300> got<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.450> learn<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> look<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.110> signs

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
just got to learn to look for the signs

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680 
just got to learn to look for the signs
to<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> look<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> know

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to know what to look for and to know

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.190 
to know what to look for and to know
what<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.899> ask<00:00:40.110> them<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.730> how<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> tires<00:00:42.780> talk<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
what to ask them so how to tires talk to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.770 
what to ask them so how to tires talk to
you<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> think<00:00:43.500> there's<00:00:43.649> two<00:00:43.829> major<00:00:44.129> ways

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
you I think there's two major ways

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.010 
you I think there's two major ways
temperature<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.190> grain<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:48.030> temperature<00:00:48.809> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
temperature and grain so temperature is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.299 
temperature and grain so temperature is
pretty<00:00:49.469> straightforward

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
pretty straightforward

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
pretty straightforward
I<00:00:50.340> reckon<00:00:50.850> everyone<00:00:51.329> should<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.809> their

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
I reckon everyone should have in their

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
I reckon everyone should have in their
toolbox<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.739> those<00:00:52.829> laser<00:00:53.309> temperature

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
toolbox one of those laser temperature

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.479 
toolbox one of those laser temperature
gauges<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.110> some<00:00:55.680> super<00:00:56.250> tire

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
gauges now I know that some super tire

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.950 
gauges now I know that some super tire
nerds<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:57.000> tell<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.809> need

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
nerds will tell you that you really need

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.020 
nerds will tell you that you really need
a<00:00:57.989> proper<00:00:58.379> pyrometer<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.280> jabs<00:00:59.609> into<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
a proper pyrometer that jabs into the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.610 
a proper pyrometer that jabs into the
tire<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.510> measures<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> temperature<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
tire and measures the temperature of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.049 
tire and measures the temperature of
it's<00:01:01.739> 40<00:01:02.010> millimeters<00:01:02.520> under<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> surface

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it's 40 millimeters under the surface

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.810 
it's 40 millimeters under the surface
but<00:01:03.530> frankly<00:01:04.530> they're<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.159> expensive<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
but frankly they're really expensive and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
but frankly they're really expensive and
B<00:01:06.060> nobody<00:01:06.689> ever<00:01:06.810> bothers<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> stupid

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
B nobody ever bothers to use the stupid

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.640 
B nobody ever bothers to use the stupid
things<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> reckon<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.720> useful<00:01:10.080> head<00:01:10.470> down

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
things what I reckon is useful head down

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
things what I reckon is useful head down
to<00:01:10.770> Bunnings<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> buy<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> $50<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.299> those

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to Bunnings and buy a $50 one of those

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
to Bunnings and buy a $50 one of those
laser<00:01:12.780> temp<00:01:13.170> gauges<00:01:13.590> I've<00:01:13.740> done<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> lot<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
laser temp gauges I've done a lot of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.219 
laser temp gauges I've done a lot of
testing<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:14.939> frankly<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.509> taught<00:01:15.750> me<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.990> lot

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
testing and frankly they taught me a lot

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.719 
testing and frankly they taught me a lot
about<00:01:16.290> tires<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> don't<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.610> any

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
about tires and so I don't see any

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
about tires and so I don't see any
reason<00:01:18.090> why<00:01:18.210> they<00:01:18.420> can't<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> job<00:01:19.140> just

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
reason why they can't do the job just

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
reason why they can't do the job just
fine<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.340> also<00:01:20.520> means<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.330> you're<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
fine it also means that if you're in a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.240 
fine it also means that if you're in a
race<00:01:22.049> meeting<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.560> can't<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
race meeting and you can't get to the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
race meeting and you can't get to the
Kart<00:01:23.490> quickly<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.420> point<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
Kart quickly you can point them at the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
Kart quickly you can point them at the
tires<00:01:25.560> over<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.040> fence<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> reading<00:01:26.909> as

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
tires over the fence to get a reading as

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.850 
tires over the fence to get a reading as
soon<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.810> possible<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.350> you're<00:01:28.470> coming<00:01:28.770> off

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
soon as possible when you're coming off

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
soon as possible when you're coming off
the<00:01:29.009> track<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> other<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.689> can

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the track so the other one that you can

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.359 
the track so the other one that you can
use<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.290> talk<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.650> your<00:01:31.799> tires<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
use to talk to your tires they have a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.130 
use to talk to your tires they have a
sign<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:33.119> give<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> tell<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.990> what

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
sign that they give you to tell you what

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660 
sign that they give you to tell you what
it<00:01:34.229> was<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> track<00:01:35.430> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it was like out there on the track is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.230 
it was like out there on the track is
grain<00:01:36.350> now<00:01:37.350> grain<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.159> basically<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> look<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
grain now grain is basically the look of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.359 
grain now grain is basically the look of
the<00:01:39.390> tire<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> surface<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the tire it's it's the surface of the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.100 
the tire it's it's the surface of the
contact<00:01:41.820> patch<00:01:41.970> whether<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.450> rough<00:01:42.810> or

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
contact patch whether it's rough or

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
contact patch whether it's rough or
smooth<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> shape<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> roughness<00:01:45.030> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
smooth and the shape of the roughness in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.030 
smooth and the shape of the roughness in
it<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.750> grain<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.110> tell<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> lot<00:01:46.979> about

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it the grain can tell you a lot about

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
it the grain can tell you a lot about
what<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> tires<00:01:47.850> doing<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.540> actually

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
what the tires doing when it's actually

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.310 
what the tires doing when it's actually
touching<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> track<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.930> I'm<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
touching the track so I'm just going to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.160 
touching the track so I'm just going to
draw<00:01:52.590> pretty<00:01:53.130> roughly<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.450> types<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.960> grain

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
draw pretty roughly the types of grain

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.810 
draw pretty roughly the types of grain
that<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.380> tend<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.219> let's<00:01:56.430> pretend

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that you tend to see so let's pretend

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
that you tend to see so let's pretend
that<00:01:56.880> we're<00:01:57.060> looking<00:01:57.180> down<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> top<00:01:58.140> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that we're looking down on the top of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.149 
that we're looking down on the top of
the<00:01:58.950> front<00:01:59.189> tire<00:01:59.460> and<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:01.320> grain<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> front

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the front tire and the grain on a front

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.370 
the front tire and the grain on a front
tire<00:02:02.399> will<00:02:02.640> tend<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.090> centered<00:02:03.630> roughly

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
tire will tend to be centered roughly

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.959 
tire will tend to be centered roughly
where<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> middle<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> tire<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.790> when

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
where the middle of the tire is when

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.039 
where the middle of the tire is when
you're<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.180> mid<00:02:06.360> corner<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:06.930> you're

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you're in mid corner so if you're

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.859 
you're in mid corner so if you're
running<00:02:07.170> lots<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.619> negative<00:02:07.860> camber<00:02:08.310> it'll<00:02:08.640> be

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
running lots of negative camber it'll be

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.570 
running lots of negative camber it'll be
Ward's<00:02:09.080> inside<00:02:09.530> if<00:02:09.950> you're<00:02:10.069> running<00:02:10.190> lots<00:02:10.459> of

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
Ward's inside if you're running lots of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.550 
Ward's inside if you're running lots of
positive<00:02:11.090> camera<00:02:11.450> towards<00:02:12.019> middle<00:02:12.290> or<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
positive camera towards middle or the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.559 
positive camera towards middle or the
outside<00:02:12.709> generally<00:02:13.580> it's<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:14.120> towards

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
outside generally it's just towards

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.150 
outside generally it's just towards
inside<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.410> what<00:02:15.560> you'll<00:02:15.680> get<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:15.980> these

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
inside but what you'll get is these

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.610 
inside but what you'll get is these
lines<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.330> kind<00:02:17.629> of<00:02:17.780> appear<00:02:18.140> through<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
lines that kind of appear through the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.210 
lines that kind of appear through the
the<00:02:19.400> center<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.910> tile<00:02:20.180> like<00:02:20.420> that

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the center of the tile like that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.940 
the center of the tile like that
hundreds<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.310> them<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.440> those<00:02:24.440> lines<00:02:24.739> are

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
hundreds of them and those lines are

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.350 
hundreds of them and those lines are
what<00:02:25.069> we<00:02:25.190> call<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.549> grain<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.209> they're

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
what we call the grain and they're

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.089 
what we call the grain and they're
basically<00:02:26.870> an<00:02:26.959> indication<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.709> what<00:02:27.950> the

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
basically an indication of what the

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.920 
basically an indication of what the
contact<00:02:28.549> patch<00:02:28.700> was<00:02:28.940> feeling<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.629> when<00:02:29.840> it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
contact patch was feeling like when it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.080 
contact patch was feeling like when it
was<00:02:30.019> getting<00:02:30.140> jammed<00:02:30.739> into<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.190> track<00:02:31.459> so

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
was getting jammed into the track so

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.940 
was getting jammed into the track so
what<00:02:32.299> you<00:02:32.420> do<00:02:32.599> when<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.080> want<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.319> investigate

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
what you do when you want to investigate

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.490 
what you do when you want to investigate
the<00:02:34.459> grain<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.940> your<00:02:34.970> tire<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.510> come<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the grain of your tire you come in and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.380 
the grain of your tire you come in and
you<00:02:36.590> scrub<00:02:37.040> all<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.370> dirt<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.670> grit<00:02:38.090> off<00:02:38.239> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
you scrub all the dirt and grit off it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.640 
you scrub all the dirt and grit off it
that<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.569> picked<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:38.900> off<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.080> in<00:02:39.290> grid<00:02:39.500> so

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
that you picked up off the in grid so

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.170 
that you picked up off the in grid so
you<00:02:39.739> can<00:02:39.890> get<00:02:40.069> in<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.340> look<00:02:40.489> closely<00:02:40.849> at<00:02:41.150> that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
you can get in and look closely at that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.289 
you can get in and look closely at that
grain<00:02:41.680> now<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.069> think<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.549> them<00:02:43.670> kind

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
grain now I like to think of them kind

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.410 
grain now I like to think of them kind
of<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.480> waves<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.470> an<00:02:45.590> ocean<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.579> you<00:02:47.299> know

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
of like waves in an ocean so you know

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.330 
of like waves in an ocean so you know
how<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.599> more<00:02:48.019> force<00:02:48.440> there<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.739> behind<00:02:49.130> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
how the more force there is behind the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.830 
how the more force there is behind the
waves<00:02:49.549> of<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> ocean<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.510> bigger<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
waves of the ocean so the bigger the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.780 
waves of the ocean so the bigger the
wind<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.440> was<00:02:51.530> pushing<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.430> bigger

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
wind that was pushing on it the bigger

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.030 
wind that was pushing on it the bigger
the<00:02:52.970> waves<00:02:53.180> get<00:02:53.540> not<00:02:54.049> only<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.650> further

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
the waves get not only that the further

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.949 
the waves get not only that the further
apart<00:02:55.459> they<00:02:55.670> get<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.150> see<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> footage<00:02:56.780> of

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
apart they get to see the footage of

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.199 
apart they get to see the footage of
those<00:02:57.110> huge<00:02:57.650> waves<00:02:58.010> coming<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.030> waves

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
those huge waves coming in and the waves

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.050 
those huge waves coming in and the waves
are<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.510> 45<00:03:00.110> seconds<00:03:00.829> apart<00:03:01.099> is<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.400> massive

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
are like 45 seconds apart is a massive

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.940 
are like 45 seconds apart is a massive
massive<00:03:02.180> gap<00:03:02.599> between<00:03:03.079> these<00:03:03.410> massive

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
massive gap between these massive

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.369 
massive gap between these massive
massive<00:03:04.160> waves<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.849> then<00:03:05.360> when<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.200> just

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
massive waves and then when you just

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.600 
massive waves and then when you just
down<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.650> beach<00:03:06.829> at<00:03:06.980> angle<00:03:07.250> sea<00:03:07.400> or<00:03:07.519> whatever

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
down the beach at angle sea or whatever

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.009 
down the beach at angle sea or whatever
and<00:03:08.030> there's<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.480> bit<00:03:08.629> of<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.780> breeze

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
and there's just a bit of a breeze

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.030 
and there's just a bit of a breeze
blowing<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.530> there's<00:03:09.680> all<00:03:09.769> these<00:03:09.860> little

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
blowing and there's all these little

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.619 
blowing and there's all these little
ones<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.549> there's<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:10.819> coming<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.209> every<00:03:11.450> ten

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
ones and there's one coming in every ten

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.050 
ones and there's one coming in every ten
seconds<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.739> more<00:03:12.980> force<00:03:13.400> there<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
seconds so the more force there is the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.580 
seconds so the more force there is the
bigger<00:03:14.329> they<00:03:14.510> are<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.049> further<00:03:15.319> they<00:03:15.560> are

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
bigger they are and the further they are

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.250 
bigger they are and the further they are
apart<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.400> reckon<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.819> translate<00:03:17.420> pretty

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
apart and I reckon that translate pretty

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.849 
apart and I reckon that translate pretty
closely<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.340> grain<00:03:19.609> on<00:03:19.819> your<00:03:19.970> tire<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.870> if

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
closely to the grain on your tire so if

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.160 
closely to the grain on your tire so if
you<00:03:22.069> look<00:03:22.280> at<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> grain<00:03:22.790> on<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.180> low<00:03:23.630> grip<00:03:23.900> tile

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
you look at the grain on a low grip tile

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.920 
you look at the grain on a low grip tile
like<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.470> Dunlop<00:03:24.920> sl1<00:03:25.489> really<00:03:26.450> will<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.750> get

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
like a Dunlop sl1 really will it get

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.479 
like a Dunlop sl1 really will it get
really<00:03:27.349> really<00:03:27.560> big<00:03:27.769> because<00:03:28.099> that<00:03:28.280> tire

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
really really big because that tire

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.430 
really really big because that tire
doesn't<00:03:29.150> make<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> lot<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.690> grip<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.230> doesn't

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
doesn't make a lot of grip so it doesn't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.390 
doesn't make a lot of grip so it doesn't
make<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.680> lot<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:31.040> force

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
make a lot of force

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.610 
make a lot of force
so<00:03:31.819> you'll<00:03:31.970> tend<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.420> fairly<00:03:32.930> neat<00:03:33.410> little

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
so you'll tend have fairly neat little

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.530 
so you'll tend have fairly neat little
grains<00:03:34.040> with<00:03:34.310> maybe<00:03:34.519> two<00:03:35.329> or<00:03:35.480> three

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
grains with maybe two or three

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.900 
grains with maybe two or three
millimeters<00:03:35.959> between<00:03:36.440> each<00:03:36.829> wave<00:03:37.190> on<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.730> on

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
millimeters between each wave on that on

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.699 
millimeters between each wave on that on
the<00:03:38.090> surface<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.750> tire<00:03:38.959> or<00:03:39.440> if<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.590> go<00:03:39.680> to

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
the surface of the tire or if you go to

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.740 
the surface of the tire or if you go to
an<00:03:39.889> mg<00:03:40.220> yellow<00:03:40.579> or<00:03:40.790> an<00:03:40.880> open<00:03:41.180> tire<00:03:41.389> up<00:03:41.569> in<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
an mg yellow or an open tire up in the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.720 
an mg yellow or an open tire up in the
really<00:03:41.989> sticky<00:03:42.349> end<00:03:42.650> sometimes<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.489> grain

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
really sticky end sometimes the grain

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.420 
really sticky end sometimes the grain
can<00:03:43.760> be<00:03:44.000> massive<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.870> enormous<00:03:45.799> ly<00:03:46.099> spread

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
can be massive and enormous ly spread

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.009 
can be massive and enormous ly spread
out<00:03:46.579> because<00:03:46.880> obviously<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.329> generating<00:03:47.959> a

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
out because obviously it's generating a

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.229 
out because obviously it's generating a
lot<00:03:48.169> of<00:03:48.200> force<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:48.980> within<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.489> range<00:03:49.819> that

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
lot of force but within the range that

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.110 
lot of force but within the range that
your<00:03:50.480> tire<00:03:50.900> tends<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.889> produce<00:03:52.069> you<00:03:52.700> can<00:03:52.730> learn

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
your tire tends to produce you can learn

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.390 
your tire tends to produce you can learn
a<00:03:53.150> lot<00:03:53.510> about<00:03:53.750> how<00:03:54.169> that<00:03:54.230> tire<00:03:54.650> was<00:03:54.859> performing

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
a lot about how that tire was performing

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.430 
a lot about how that tire was performing
by<00:03:55.579> investigating<00:03:56.540> what<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.870> grain<00:03:57.139> looks

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
by investigating what that grain looks

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.059 
by investigating what that grain looks
like<00:03:57.819> if<00:03:58.819> you've<00:03:59.150> got<00:03:59.389> a<00:03:59.569> fairly<00:04:00.049> wide<00:04:00.530> grain

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
like if you've got a fairly wide grain

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.920 
like if you've got a fairly wide grain
pattern<00:04:01.519> it's<00:04:01.639> pushed<00:04:01.880> out<00:04:02.090> pretty<00:04:02.389> wide<00:04:02.630> I

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
pattern it's pushed out pretty wide I

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.270 
pattern it's pushed out pretty wide I
think<00:04:03.260> that<00:04:03.380> what<00:04:03.560> that's<00:04:03.680> telling<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.250> is

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
think that what that's telling you is

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.789 
think that what that's telling you is
the<00:04:04.730> tire<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.209> twisting<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.959> lot<00:04:06.139> so<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
the tire is twisting a lot so the

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.559 
the tire is twisting a lot so the
contact<00:04:07.220> patch<00:04:07.430> itself<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:08.000> gripping<00:04:08.359> the

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
contact patch itself is gripping the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.690 
contact patch itself is gripping the
road<00:04:08.750> really<00:04:08.989> hard<00:04:09.319> but<00:04:09.829> as<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.130> carts<00:04:10.459> really

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
road really hard but as the carts really

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.460 
road really hard but as the carts really
driving<00:04:11.569> it<00:04:11.660> into<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.930> track<00:04:12.260> it's

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
driving it into the track it's

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.039 
driving it into the track it's
stretching<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.579> really<00:04:14.419> stretching<00:04:14.959> it

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
stretching it really stretching it

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.930 
stretching it really stretching it
across<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:16.010> asphalt<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.519> that's<00:04:16.700> what's

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
across the asphalt and that's what's

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.000 
across the asphalt and that's what's
creating<00:04:17.180> this<00:04:17.930> weird<00:04:18.260> wave

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
creating this weird wave

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.040 
creating this weird wave
pattern<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.520> surface<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.090> tire<00:04:20.330> the

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
pattern and surface of the tire the

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.780 
pattern and surface of the tire the
exact<00:04:21.380> opposite<00:04:21.890> condition<00:04:22.370> when<00:04:22.580> you're<00:04:22.700> in

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
exact opposite condition when you're in

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.940 
exact opposite condition when you're in
the<00:04:22.910> wet<00:04:23.150> right<00:04:23.390> if<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:23.600> out<00:04:23.780> go<00:04:24.170> out<00:04:24.350> in<00:04:24.590> the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
the wet right if you out go out in the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.590 
the wet right if you out go out in the
wet<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.310> slicks<00:04:25.760> you've<00:04:25.970> pumped<00:04:26.180> them<00:04:26.390> up<00:04:26.480> to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
wet on slicks you've pumped them up to

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.350 
wet on slicks you've pumped them up to
50<00:04:26.960> psi<00:04:27.170> so<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.860> go<00:04:27.980> out<00:04:28.010> on<00:04:28.250> slick<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.730> course

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
50 psi so you go out on slick of course

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.790 
50 psi so you go out on slick of course
you've<00:04:29.540> got<00:04:29.570> very<00:04:30.020> little<00:04:30.200> grip<00:04:30.440> at<00:04:30.560> all<00:04:30.650> and

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
you've got very little grip at all and

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.930 
you've got very little grip at all and
they<00:04:30.860> cut<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.250> tires<00:04:31.490> are<00:04:31.760> skidding

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
they cut the tires are skidding

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.450 
they cut the tires are skidding
everywhere<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.230> they<00:04:33.680> come<00:04:33.890> back<00:04:34.070> in<00:04:34.250> there

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
everywhere and they come back in there

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.370 
everywhere and they come back in there
literally<00:04:34.940> polished<00:04:35.480> so<00:04:35.840> polished<00:04:36.230> that

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
literally polished so polished that

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.170 
literally polished so polished that
they're<00:04:36.560> shiny<00:04:36.890> and<00:04:37.340> that's<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.790> exact

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
they're shiny and that's the exact

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.180 
they're shiny and that's the exact
opposite<00:04:38.840> condition<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.860> reckon

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
opposite condition so I reckon

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.640 
opposite condition so I reckon
investigating<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.150> grain<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.630> your<00:04:41.660> tire<00:04:42.050> can

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
investigating the grain of your tire can

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.350 
investigating the grain of your tire can
tell<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:42.980> great<00:04:43.340> deal<00:04:43.580> about<00:04:43.820> whether<00:04:44.180> the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
tell you a great deal about whether the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.210 
tell you a great deal about whether the
tire<00:04:44.600> was<00:04:44.840> twisting<00:04:45.470> on<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> track<00:04:46.010> and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
tire was twisting on the track and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.920 
tire was twisting on the track and
therefore<00:04:46.850> that<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.120> had<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.270> lot<00:04:47.540> of<00:04:47.690> weight<00:04:47.900> on

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
therefore that it had a lot of weight on

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.200 
therefore that it had a lot of weight on
it<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.410> was<00:04:48.710> generating<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.340> lot<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.520> load<00:04:49.910> or

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
it and was generating a lot of load or

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.360 
it and was generating a lot of load or
whether<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:51.020> was<00:04:51.170> skidding<00:04:51.800> on<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.070> track

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
whether it was skidding on the track

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.920 
whether it was skidding on the track
because<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.000> didn't<00:04:53.270> have<00:04:53.420> a<00:04:53.450> lot<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.660> weight

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
because it didn't have a lot of weight

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.450 
because it didn't have a lot of weight
on<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:54.350> it<00:04:54.470> didn't<00:04:54.800> have<00:04:54.920> a<00:04:54.950> lot<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.160> load

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
on it and it didn't have a lot of load

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.450 
on it and it didn't have a lot of load
and<00:04:56.300> you'll<00:04:56.450> tend<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.870> notice<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.470> correlation

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
and you'll tend to notice a correlation

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.840 
and you'll tend to notice a correlation
between<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.180> grain<00:04:59.480> and<00:04:59.780> the<00:05:00.200> temperature

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
between the grain and the temperature

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.190 
between the grain and the temperature
generally<00:05:01.850> speaking<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.510> can't<00:05:02.810> say<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:03.140> is

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
generally speaking I can't say this is

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.080 
generally speaking I can't say this is
going<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.530> be<00:05:03.650> for<00:05:03.950> all<00:05:04.100> cases<00:05:04.370> at<00:05:04.640> all<00:05:04.730> times

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
going to be for all cases at all times

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.390 
going to be for all cases at all times
generally<00:05:06.080> speaking<00:05:06.380> if<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:07.010> tire<00:05:07.220> is

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
generally speaking if a tire is

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.060 
generally speaking if a tire is
generating<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.150> lot<00:05:08.180> of<00:05:08.480> grip<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:09.050> lot<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.560> twist

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
generating a lot of grip a lot of twist

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.180 
generating a lot of grip a lot of twist
it's<00:05:10.700> also<00:05:11.030> going<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.510> have<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.990> lot<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.470> wide

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
it's also going to have a lot of wide

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.490 
it's also going to have a lot of wide
grains<00:05:13.730> bigger<00:05:14.210> grain<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.810> it's<00:05:14.990> also<00:05:15.170> going

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
grains bigger grain and it's also going

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.320 
grains bigger grain and it's also going
to<00:05:15.590> get<00:05:15.830> hotter<00:05:16.190> so<00:05:16.760> you'll<00:05:16.910> often<00:05:17.060> notice

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
to get hotter so you'll often notice

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.150 
to get hotter so you'll often notice
that<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.720> hot<00:05:17.990> tire<00:05:18.260> comes<00:05:18.620> in<00:05:18.800> with<00:05:18.920> quite<00:05:19.100> a

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
that a hot tire comes in with quite a

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.460 
that a hot tire comes in with quite a
lot<00:05:19.490> of<00:05:19.520> grain<00:05:19.850> wear<00:05:20.390> a<00:05:20.420> cool<00:05:20.750> tire<00:05:21.050> will<00:05:21.260> come

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
lot of grain wear a cool tire will come

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.500 
lot of grain wear a cool tire will come
in<00:05:21.620> with<00:05:21.770> very<00:05:22.010> little<00:05:22.280> grain<00:05:22.640> and<00:05:23.060> those<00:05:23.270> two

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
in with very little grain and those two

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.600 
in with very little grain and those two
things<00:05:23.540> together<00:05:24.050> can<00:05:24.680> combine<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.310> tell<00:05:25.520> you

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
things together can combine to tell you

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.700 
things together can combine to tell you
a<00:05:25.640> lot<00:05:25.910> about<00:05:25.940> how<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.510> tire<00:05:26.870> was<00:05:27.140> performing

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
a lot about how the tire was performing

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.250 
a lot about how the tire was performing
when<00:05:28.070> it<00:05:28.190> was<00:05:28.280> out<00:05:28.430> on<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.610> track<00:05:28.940> rear<00:05:29.930> tires

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
when it was out on the track rear tires

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.710 
when it was out on the track rear tires
it's<00:05:30.680> much<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.310> same<00:05:31.550> except<00:05:32.210> because<00:05:32.480> we<00:05:32.600> are

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
it's much the same except because we are

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.750 
it's much the same except because we are
braking<00:05:33.200> and<00:05:33.290> accelerating<00:05:33.860> forces<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.550> think

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
braking and accelerating forces I think

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.670 
braking and accelerating forces I think
that<00:05:34.880> tends<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.330> cover<00:05:35.930> up<00:05:36.200> a<00:05:36.320> lot<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.590> the

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
that tends to cover up a lot of the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.650 
that tends to cover up a lot of the
grain<00:05:36.920> that<00:05:37.070> gets<00:05:37.250> generated<00:05:37.340> by<00:05:38.030> side<00:05:38.330> loads

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
grain that gets generated by side loads

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.200 
grain that gets generated by side loads
braking<00:05:39.290> in<00:05:39.410> particular<00:05:39.740> but<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:40.850> can<00:05:41.000> still

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
braking in particular but you can still

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.520 
braking in particular but you can still
learn<00:05:41.420> a<00:05:41.450> bit<00:05:41.660> about<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.990> tire<00:05:42.170> and<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.320> reckon

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
learn a bit about the tire and I reckon

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.640 
learn a bit about the tire and I reckon
there's<00:05:42.650> just<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.890> slightly<00:05:43.370> different<00:05:43.610> way<00:05:44.650> to

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
there's just a slightly different way to

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.860 
there's just a slightly different way to
look<00:05:45.770> at<00:05:45.920> the<00:05:45.980> tire<00:05:46.190> so<00:05:46.790> on<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.210> inside<00:05:47.660> edge

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
look at the tire so on the inside edge

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.570 
look at the tire so on the inside edge
of<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.080> tire<00:05:48.170> you'll<00:05:48.650> usually<00:05:48.860> have<00:05:49.160> that<00:05:49.370> bit

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
of the tire you'll usually have that bit

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.010 
of the tire you'll usually have that bit
that's<00:05:49.760> really<00:05:50.030> scrubbed<00:05:50.510> and<00:05:50.750> we<00:05:50.840> call<00:05:50.990> that

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
that's really scrubbed and we call that

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.670 
that's really scrubbed and we call that
a<00:05:51.170> feather

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
a feather

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.680 
a feather
that's<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.580> feather<00:05:52.880> of<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.150> tire<00:05:53.390> there's

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
that's the feather of the tire there's

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.960 
that's the feather of the tire there's
that<00:05:53.810> really<00:05:53.990> scrub<00:05:54.380> bit<00:05:54.590> it's<00:05:55.400> often<00:05:55.670> almost

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
that really scrub bit it's often almost

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.780 
that really scrub bit it's often almost
completely<00:05:56.720> polished<00:05:56.960> off<00:05:57.550> there's<00:05:58.550> not<00:05:58.760> a

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
completely polished off there's not a

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.100 
completely polished off there's not a
lot<00:05:58.970> of<00:05:59.000> info<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.330> can<00:05:59.540> learn<00:05:59.690> there<00:05:59.960> though

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
lot of info you can learn there though

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.300 
lot of info you can learn there though
if<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.380> feather<00:06:00.590> bit<00:06:00.890> is<00:06:01.010> really<00:06:01.700> really<00:06:02.150> worn

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
if the feather bit is really really worn

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.890 
if the feather bit is really really worn
often<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:04.460> means<00:06:04.610> you're<00:06:04.880> creating<00:06:05.450> too

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
often that means you're creating too

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.290 
often that means you're creating too
much<00:06:06.140> load<00:06:06.410> on<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.740> rear<00:06:06.890> tires<00:06:07.190> so<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.910> size

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
much load on the rear tires so the size

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.670 
much load on the rear tires so the size
of<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.630> feather<00:06:08.900> can<00:06:09.170> give<00:06:09.320> you<00:06:09.470> some

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
of the feather can give you some

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.920 
of the feather can give you some
indication<00:06:09.860> but<00:06:10.670> the<00:06:10.820> next<00:06:11.210> bit<00:06:11.390> I<00:06:11.540> reckon<00:06:11.840> is

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
indication but the next bit I reckon is

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.690 
indication but the next bit I reckon is
where<00:06:12.080> most<00:06:12.470> of<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.770> information<00:06:13.400> is<00:06:13.520> and

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
where most of the information is and

when it was getting driven into the

doing that much work whereas if there's

big gaps between the waves then you know

the<00:06:38.540> tire<00:06:38.750> was<00:06:38.960> working<00:06:39.380> pretty<00:06:39.590> hard

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
the tire was working pretty hard

the tire was working pretty hard
you'll<00:06:40.760> intend<00:06:41.210> to<00:06:41.270> have<00:06:41.389> some<00:06:41.600> kind<00:06:41.750> of

dotted stuff out here and from tired
attire<00:06:45.110> I<00:06:45.440> find<00:06:46.130> that<00:06:46.250> can<00:06:46.400> be<00:06:46.520> quite

attire I find that can be quite

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.210

look like out there so concluding are

look like out there so concluding are
you<00:07:08.930> talking<00:07:09.410> to<00:07:09.560> your<00:07:09.650> tires<00:07:09.919> like<00:07:10.340> a<00:07:10.370> you<00:07:10.700> are

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
you talking to your tires like a you are

they could about the session that you've

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.760 
they could about the session that you've
just<00:07:14.270> had<00:07:14.540> because<00:07:14.930> I<00:07:14.960> think<00:07:15.290> it's<00:07:15.410> really

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
just had because I think it's really

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.030 
just had because I think it's really
important<00:07:16.460> to<00:07:16.850> understand<00:07:17.480> that<00:07:18.020> this<00:07:18.290> is<00:07:18.830> the
