00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.780 
and he got away with it you know he
caught<00:02:35.530> some<00:02:35.680> good<00:02:35.860> breaks<00:02:36.100> got<00:02:36.340> dealt<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.670> lot

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
caught some good breaks got dealt a lot

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.660 
caught some good breaks got dealt a lot
of<00:02:36.940> good<00:02:37.060> cards<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.709> know<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.830> it's<00:02:39.400> been<00:02:39.550> over

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
of good cards you know I it's been over

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.190 
of good cards you know I it's been over
a<00:02:39.910> year<00:02:39.970> since<00:02:40.209> then<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.600> year<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.870> half<00:02:40.900> I

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
a year since then a year and a half I

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.810 
a year since then a year and a half I
think<00:02:41.440> since<00:02:41.620> he<00:02:41.830> since<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.340> he<00:02:42.520> won<00:02:42.670> that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
think since he since that he won that

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.390 
think since he since that he won that
title<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.810> now<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.770> appears<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.160> he's<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
title and now it appears that he's a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.830 
title and now it appears that he's a
little<00:02:45.700> more<00:02:45.850> willing<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.180> lay<00:02:46.420> some<00:02:46.630> hands

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
little more willing to lay some hands

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.990 
little more willing to lay some hands
down<00:02:47.160> because<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.310> like<00:02:48.459> okay<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.820> isn't

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
down because it's like okay this isn't

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.910 
down because it's like okay this isn't
okay<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:49.900> not<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> bad<00:02:50.320> hand<00:02:50.560> but<00:02:50.800> it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
okay and it's not a bad hand but it's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.590 
okay and it's not a bad hand but it's
not<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.250> know<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:51.580> not<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.730> best<00:02:51.940> hand<00:02:52.239> right

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
not I know it's not the best hand right

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.300 
not I know it's not the best hand right
so<00:02:52.870> rather<00:02:53.020> than<00:02:53.230> calling<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.800> guy's<00:02:54.010> raise

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
so rather than calling that guy's raise

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.370 
so rather than calling that guy's raise
and<00:02:54.580> trying<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.880> outplay<00:02:55.239> them<00:02:55.360> with<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
and trying to outplay them with the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.670 
and trying to outplay them with the
worst<00:02:56.590> two<00:02:57.280> cards<00:02:57.820> let's<00:02:58.630> just<00:02:58.690> lose<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> small
