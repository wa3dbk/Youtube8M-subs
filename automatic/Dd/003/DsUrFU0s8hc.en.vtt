gonna show you the way that was easiest
for<00:00:18.960> me<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.439> way<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.859> learned<00:00:20.100> in

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
for me and the way that I learned in

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:30.180 
for me and the way that I learned in
nursing<00:00:20.580> school<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.539> here's<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.230> problem

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.830 

so<00:00:31.190> I<00:00:31.220> have<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:31.760> vehicle<00:00:32.090> mycin<00:00:32.450> problem

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
so I have the vehicle mycin problem

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.830 
so I have the vehicle mycin problem
written<00:00:33.050> up<00:00:33.260> here<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:33.800> we're<00:00:34.580> gonna<00:00:34.670> take<00:00:34.940> 150

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
written up here and we're gonna take 150

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.810 
written up here and we're gonna take 150
mils<00:00:36.110> over<00:00:36.650> one<00:00:36.830> and<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:37.010> half<00:00:37.190> hours<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.730> put

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
mils over one and a half hours and put

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.490 
mils over one and a half hours and put
it<00:00:37.910> here<00:00:37.940> 150<00:00:38.570> mils<00:00:38.750> over<00:00:39.020> one<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> half

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
it here 150 mils over one and a half

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.470 
it here 150 mils over one and a half
hours<00:00:39.860> they<00:00:40.070> give<00:00:40.220> us<00:00:40.370> 60<00:00:40.760> drops<00:00:41.000> per<00:00:41.270> mil

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
hours they give us 60 drops per mil

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.420 
hours they give us 60 drops per mil
we're<00:00:42.230> gonna<00:00:42.320> put<00:00:42.500> 60<00:00:42.739> drops<00:00:42.980> per<00:00:43.220> mil<00:00:43.400> over

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
we're gonna put 60 drops per mil over

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.850 
we're gonna put 60 drops per mil over
here<00:00:43.970> but<00:00:44.180> we<00:00:44.270> have<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.480> convert<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.840> hours<00:00:45.200> to

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
here but we have to convert the hours to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.979 
here but we have to convert the hours to
minutes<00:00:46.070> since<00:00:46.520> they're<00:00:46.730> asking<00:00:47.150> for<00:00:47.360> drops

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
minutes since they're asking for drops

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.410 
minutes since they're asking for drops
per<00:00:48.320> minute<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.220> we<00:00:49.340> put<00:00:49.520> one<00:00:49.699> hour<00:00:49.820> up<00:00:50.059> here<00:00:50.090> so

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
per minute so we put one hour up here so

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.630 
per minute so we put one hour up here so
we<00:00:50.510> can<00:00:50.540> cross<00:00:50.870> them<00:00:51.050> all<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.290> ply<00:00:51.470> it<00:00:51.530> out<00:00:51.800> 60

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
we can cross them all to ply it out 60

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.900 
we can cross them all to ply it out 60
minutes<00:00:52.910> down<00:00:53.090> here<00:00:53.449> mils<00:00:54.580> crosses<00:00:55.580> itself

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
minutes down here mils crosses itself

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.090 
minutes down here mils crosses itself
out<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:56.420> we<00:00:56.629> end<00:00:56.780> up<00:00:56.930> with<00:00:57.110> drops<00:00:57.379> per<00:00:57.949> minute

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
out and we end up with drops per minute

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.180 
out and we end up with drops per minute
so<00:00:58.790> if<00:00:58.940> we<00:00:59.120> multiply<00:00:59.690> everything<00:00:59.809> across<00:01:00.260> 150

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
so if we multiply everything across 150

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.290 
so if we multiply everything across 150
times<00:01:01.460> 60<00:01:02.030> will<00:01:02.690> give<00:01:02.809> us<00:01:02.960> nine<00:01:03.230> thousand<00:01:04.300> and

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
times 60 will give us nine thousand and

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.130 
times 60 will give us nine thousand and
then<00:01:06.110> 1.5<00:01:06.800> times<00:01:07.190> 60<00:01:07.670> will<00:01:07.820> give<00:01:07.940> us<00:01:08.060> 90<00:01:08.330> so

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
then 1.5 times 60 will give us 90 so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
then 1.5 times 60 will give us 90 so
that<00:01:09.320> equals<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.890> hundred<00:01:10.220> drops<00:01:11.180> per<00:01:11.899> minute

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.770 

so<00:01:21.520> here<00:01:21.850> again<00:01:21.940> we<00:01:22.090> have<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.360> same<00:01:22.540> type<00:01:22.720> of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
so here again we have the same type of

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.270 
so here again we have the same type of
problem<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:23.260> have<00:01:23.380> our<00:01:23.500> thousand<00:01:23.980> milliliters

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
problem we have our thousand milliliters

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.340 
problem we have our thousand milliliters
of<00:01:24.550> LR<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:25.180> fuse<00:01:25.450> over<00:01:25.630> ten<00:01:25.810> hours<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.260> we're

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
of LR to fuse over ten hours so we're

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.810 
of LR to fuse over ten hours so we're
going<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:26.500> put<00:01:26.650> a<00:01:26.680> thousand<00:01:27.100> mils<00:01:27.280> over<00:01:27.610> ten

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
going to put a thousand mils over ten

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.060 
going to put a thousand mils over ten
hours<00:01:27.850> here<00:01:28.390> times<00:01:29.020> we<00:01:29.380> have<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.620> change<00:01:29.830> it<00:01:29.950> to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
hours here times we have to change it to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.620 
hours here times we have to change it to
minutes<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:30.520> we're<00:01:30.610> gonna<00:01:30.700> put<00:01:30.940> one<00:01:30.970> hour<00:01:31.330> so

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
minutes so we're gonna put one hour so

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.180 
minutes so we're gonna put one hour so
they<00:01:31.750> can<00:01:31.870> cross<00:01:32.110> multiply<00:01:32.320> each<00:01:32.830> other<00:01:33.010> out

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
they can cross multiply each other out

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.340 
they can cross multiply each other out
put<00:01:33.430> one<00:01:33.640> hour<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> top<00:01:34.270> over<00:01:34.930> sixty

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
put one hour on the top over sixty

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.290 
put one hour on the top over sixty
minutes<00:01:35.650> times<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.280> they<00:01:36.670> give<00:01:36.850> us<00:01:36.970> here<00:01:37.120> the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
minutes times and they give us here the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.530 
minutes times and they give us here the
drops<00:01:37.540> per<00:01:37.840> mil<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.620> 15<00:01:39.040> drops<00:01:39.250> per<00:01:39.490> mil<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.420> we

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
drops per mil so 15 drops per mil so we

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.750 
drops per mil so 15 drops per mil so we
crossed<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.140> milliliters<00:01:41.800> out<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.250> hours<00:01:42.610> oh

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
crossed the milliliters out the hours oh

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.160 
crossed the milliliters out the hours oh
and<00:01:42.940> we<00:01:43.030> end<00:01:43.150> up<00:01:43.240> with<00:01:43.390> drops<00:01:43.630> per<00:01:43.900> minute

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
and we end up with drops per minute

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.990 
and we end up with drops per minute
right

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
right

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.330 
right
so<00:01:46.000> we<00:01:46.150> times<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.570> thousand<00:01:47.140> by<00:01:47.320> fifteen<00:01:47.980> which

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
so we times a thousand by fifteen which

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.110 
so we times a thousand by fifteen which
gives<00:01:48.580> us<00:01:48.730> fifteen<00:01:49.210> thousand<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.700> ten<00:01:51.700> times

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
gives us fifteen thousand and ten times

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.310 
gives us fifteen thousand and ten times
