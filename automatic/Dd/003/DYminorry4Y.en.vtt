00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
questions miss Coco face okay so the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.360 
questions miss Coco face okay so the
first<00:00:45.670> question<00:00:46.239> was<00:00:46.600> how<00:00:47.019> many<00:00:47.440> inches<00:00:47.800> do<00:00:48.340> I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
first question was how many inches do I

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.240 
first question was how many inches do I
get<00:00:48.940> in<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.239> month<00:00:49.769> basically<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:50.800> get

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
get in the month basically I get

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.720 
get in the month basically I get
anywhere<00:00:51.760> from<00:00:52.210> half<00:00:52.690> an<00:00:52.899> inch<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.399> 3/4<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.579> an

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
anywhere from half an inch to 3/4 of an

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.840 
anywhere from half an inch to 3/4 of an
inch<00:00:55.030> per<00:00:55.570> month<00:00:55.870> so<00:00:56.589> it<00:00:56.980> all<00:00:57.100> depends<00:00:57.550> on<00:00:57.699> what

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
inch per month so it all depends on what

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.150 
inch per month so it all depends on what
I'm<00:00:57.969> doing<00:00:58.390> if<00:00:58.570> I'm<00:00:58.749> eating<00:00:59.109> right<00:00:59.410> exercising

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.349 
and it's wet and I keep the roots pretty
loose<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.739> can<00:03:27.980> get<00:03:28.190> my<00:03:28.340> fingers<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:29.180> there

when I'm washing my hair so when it does

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.240 
when I'm washing my hair so when it does
dry<00:03:34.609> it<00:03:34.880> can<00:03:35.299> shrink<00:03:35.810> pretty<00:03:36.200> bad<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.920> it's<00:03:37.130> up

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
dry it can shrink pretty bad so it's up

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.310

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
roots I usually

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.690 
roots I usually
you<00:03:52.250> know<00:03:52.310> apply<00:03:52.700> shea<00:03:52.970> butter<00:03:53.240> and<00:03:53.570> then<00:03:54.700> you

you know apply shea butter and then you

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.060 
you know apply shea butter and then you
know<00:03:55.820> stretch<00:03:56.240> it<00:03:56.450> out<00:03:56.600> by<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:57.260> smoothing<00:03:57.740> it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
know stretch it out by just smoothing it

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.090 
know stretch it out by just smoothing it
down<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.910> pulling<00:03:59.300> it<00:03:59.540> back<00:03:59.570> into<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.290> bun<00:04:00.710> so

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
down and pulling it back into a bun so

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.360 
down and pulling it back into a bun so
that<00:04:01.850> way<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.510> you<00:04:02.900> know<00:04:03.020> you<00:04:03.920> know<00:04:04.040> gonna

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
that way it's you know you know gonna

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.670 
that way it's you know you know gonna
stay<00:04:04.760> stretch<00:04:05.150> it's<00:04:05.510> not<00:04:05.720> going<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.960> dry<00:04:06.320> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
stay stretch it's not going to dry and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.760 
stay stretch it's not going to dry and
shrink<00:04:07.220> up<00:04:07.490> really<00:04:07.940> really<00:04:08.180> bad<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:09.110> that's

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
shrink up really really bad so that's

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.200 
shrink up really really bad so that's
one<00:04:10.250> way<00:04:10.490> of<00:04:10.520> keeping<00:04:11.210> those<00:04:11.720> roots<00:04:12.080> from

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
one way of keeping those roots from

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.710 
one way of keeping those roots from
shrinking<00:04:14.210> and<00:04:14.810> tangling<00:04:15.500> up<00:04:15.650> on<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.720> another

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
shrinking and tangling up on you another

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.830 
shrinking and tangling up on you another
way<00:04:17.930> like<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.440> mentioned<00:04:18.920> earlier<00:04:19.459> is<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:20.120> just

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
way like I mentioned earlier is to just

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.740 
way like I mentioned earlier is to just
regrade<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:22.100> braids<00:04:22.370> before<00:04:22.940> they<00:04:23.090> dry<00:04:23.360> or

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
regrade the braids before they dry or

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.520 
regrade the braids before they dry or
you<00:04:24.470> know<00:04:24.560> or<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:26.000> might<00:04:26.210> have<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.930> huge

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
you know or you might have a huge

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.990 
you know or you might have a huge
detangling<00:04:28.220> job<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.760> do<00:04:28.880> there<00:04:29.290> so<00:04:30.520> that's<00:04:31.520> you

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
detangling job to do there so that's you

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.180 
detangling job to do there so that's you
know<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.120> good<00:04:32.960> way<00:04:33.140> of<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.860> know<00:04:33.920> preventing
