00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.289

tried<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.829> correct<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.340> although<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.270> actually

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
tried to correct it although it actually

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.719 
tried to correct it although it actually
sent<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.930> 30<00:02:07.170> degrees<00:02:07.530> down<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.580> be

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
sent it 30 degrees down so they will be

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.059 
sent it 30 degrees down so they will be
looking<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.319> whether<00:02:10.739> there

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
looking at this to see whether there

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.370

it's<00:02:13.470> happening<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> average<00:02:14.220> well<00:02:14.640> this

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
it's happening to the average well this

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.400 
it's happening to the average well this
is<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.270> thing<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.600> mean<00:02:15.690> clearly<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
is the thing I mean clearly it's a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.710 
is the thing I mean clearly it's a
stretch<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.070> Tristar<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.090> very<00:02:18.390> end

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
stretch the Tristar is at the very end

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.870 
stretch the Tristar is at the very end
of<00:02:18.960> its<00:02:19.140> service<00:02:19.440> life<00:02:19.710> but<00:02:20.460> it's<00:02:20.580> only<00:02:20.730> got

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
of its service life but it's only got

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.690 
of its service life but it's only got
five<00:02:21.180> weeks<00:02:21.540> per<00:02:22.080> program<00:02:22.530> anyway<00:02:22.830> left<00:02:23.430> in

five weeks per program anyway left in

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.060 
five weeks per program anyway left in
RAF<00:02:24.270> service<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.260> obviously<00:02:25.800> there<00:02:25.950> are

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
RAF service and so obviously there are

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.040 
RAF service and so obviously there are
very<00:02:26.280> few<00:02:26.700> aircraft<00:02:26.850> still<00:02:27.570> around<00:02:27.840> and

very few aircraft still around and

very few aircraft still around and
there's<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.290> lot<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.650> slack<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.640> them<00:02:29.760> to

there's a lot of slack there for them to

there's a lot of slack there for them to
