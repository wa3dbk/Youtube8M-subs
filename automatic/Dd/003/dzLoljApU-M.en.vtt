so guys my truck is still broken and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.150 
so guys my truck is still broken and
through<00:00:06.600> process<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.140> elimination<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.890> found

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
through process of elimination I found

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.919 
through process of elimination I found
it<00:00:08.700> was<00:00:08.820> actually<00:00:08.940> not<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.269> training<00:00:09.660> that

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
it was actually not the training that

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.990 
it was actually not the training that
was<00:00:10.550> the<00:00:11.550> problem

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
was the problem

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.209 
was the problem
originally<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.259> parts<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.889> this

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
originally it was because parts of this

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.990 
originally it was because parts of this
I<00:00:14.490> believe<00:00:15.210> actually<00:00:15.990> got<00:00:16.139> into<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.440> tranny

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
I believe actually got into the tranny

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.400 
I believe actually got into the tranny
when<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> pulled<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> drain<00:00:18.630> plug<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.109> fluid

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
when I pulled the drain plug the fluid

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
when I pulled the drain plug the fluid
was<00:00:19.560> black<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:21.800> there<00:00:22.800> were<00:00:22.890> pieces<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
was black and there were pieces in the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.620 
was black and there were pieces in the
bottom<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.880> can't<00:00:24.090> pull<00:00:24.240> them<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.420> because

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
bottom but I can't pull them out because

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.390 
bottom but I can't pull them out because
the<00:00:24.689> hole<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.900> too<00:00:25.140> small<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.310> going

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the hole is too small so what I'm going

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.560 
the hole is too small so what I'm going
to<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.580> right<00:00:26.760> now<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> take<00:00:27.449> it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
to do right now is I'm going to take it

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.109 
to do right now is I'm going to take it
apart<00:00:27.840> obviously<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> can't

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
apart obviously because well I can't

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.339 
apart obviously because well I can't
hurt<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.359> any<00:00:30.510> more<00:00:30.660> than<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:30.960> already<00:00:31.019> hurt

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
hurt it any more than it's already hurt

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.250 
hurt it any more than it's already hurt

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
easy to pop a park just tap a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
easy to pop a park just tap a
screwdriver<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.540> between<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.380> because

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
screwdriver in between here and because

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.620 
screwdriver in between here and because
this<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.430> broken<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.390> care<00:01:09.450> about

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
this is broken I really don't care about

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.740 
this is broken I really don't care about
it<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.799> point<00:01:11.270> but<00:01:12.270> yeah<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.510> looks<00:01:12.689> like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it at this point but yeah it looks like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.109 
it at this point but yeah it looks like
there's<00:01:12.930> some<00:01:13.200> broken<00:01:13.500> stuff<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
there's some broken stuff in there so

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.830 
there's some broken stuff in there so
I'll<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.750> apartment<00:01:16.080> second<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
I'll have that apartment second so this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.219 
I'll have that apartment second so this
was<00:01:18.990> definitely<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.470> source<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.920> my<00:01:20.070> plastic

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
was definitely the source of my plastic

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.640 
was definitely the source of my plastic
see<00:01:22.229> pieces<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.830> there<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> clutch<00:01:25.170> fork<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
see pieces in there the clutch fork is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
see pieces in there the clutch fork is
busted<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.400> somebody<00:01:26.700> had<00:01:26.880> suggested

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
busted just like somebody had suggested

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.929 
busted just like somebody had suggested
I<00:01:27.750> believe<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> clutch<00:01:28.619> fork<00:01:28.950> metal

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I believe it's the clutch fork metal

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.960 
I believe it's the clutch fork metal
pieces<00:01:30.710> plastic<00:01:31.710> pieces<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.280> over<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.670> place

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pieces plastic pieces all over the place

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.800 
pieces plastic pieces all over the place
the<00:01:33.270> pump<00:01:33.479> looks<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> blew<00:01:34.320> apart<00:01:34.619> too<00:01:35.810> so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the pump looks like it blew apart too so

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
the pump looks like it blew apart too so
this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.100> fun<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> don't<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.700> if

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
this is going to be fun I don't know if

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.890 
this is going to be fun I don't know if
I'm<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> bother<00:01:39.210> rebuilding<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
I'm going to bother rebuilding this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.560 
I'm going to bother rebuilding this
because<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:41.280> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.820> destroyed<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
because it's kind of destroyed and the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
because it's kind of destroyed and the
gears<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:42.990> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.229> worn<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.710> bit<00:01:43.979> but

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
gears are kind of worn a little bit but

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.240 
gears are kind of worn a little bit but
I<00:01:44.790> don't<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.119> we'll<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.649> so<00:01:46.649> let<00:01:46.950> me<00:01:47.009> get<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I don't know we'll see so let me get it

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.010 
I don't know we'll see so let me get it
apart<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.549> little<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.630> guess<00:01:48.780> we'll<00:01:48.930> go

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
apart a little more and I guess we'll go

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.149 
apart a little more and I guess we'll go
from<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.710> definitely<00:01:50.070> my

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
from there that was definitely my

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.999 
from there that was definitely my
problem<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> truck<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.829> plastic<00:01:52.829> pieces

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
problem at the truck and plastic pieces

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.260 
problem at the truck and plastic pieces
somehow<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:54.360> from<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.430> inside<00:01:57.149> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
somehow got from this to the inside of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.980 
somehow got from this to the inside of
the<00:01:57.329> transmission<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:59.570> think<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.780> training

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the transmission so I think the training

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.330 
the transmission so I think the training
is<00:02:01.140> ok<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.469> I'm<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> replete<00:02:02.159> them

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
is ok but I'm going to replete them

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.899 
is ok but I'm going to replete them
going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> pull<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.119> check<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.909> I'm

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
going to pull it and check it and I'm

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.370 
going to pull it and check it and I'm
going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.119> replace<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> torque<00:02:06.869> converter<00:02:06.990> in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
going to replace the torque converter in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.469 
going to replace the torque converter in
it<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> better<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.099> because<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.300> real

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it with a better one because it's real

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.790 
it with a better one because it's real
easy<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.229> everything<00:02:10.560> apart

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
easy now that I have everything apart

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.030 
easy now that I have everything apart
anyway<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.680> probably<00:02:13.830> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
anyway so it's going to be probably a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.420 
anyway so it's going to be probably a
week

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
week

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.160 
week
before<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.790> truck<00:02:14.969> comes<00:02:15.150> back<00:02:15.359> up<00:02:15.569> I'm

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
before this truck comes back up I'm

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.679 
before this truck comes back up I'm
going<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.409> fix<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.250> exhaust<00:02:17.909> or<00:02:18.269> replace<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
going to fix the exhaust or replace the

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.990 
going to fix the exhaust or replace the
exhaust<00:02:18.900> probably<00:02:19.379> put<00:02:19.500> duals<00:02:19.739> on<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.280> I'm

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
exhaust probably put duals on it and I'm

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.580 
exhaust probably put duals on it and I'm
going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.180> replace<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.230> torque<00:02:22.469> converter

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
going to replace the torque converter

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.979 
going to replace the torque converter
and<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.069> whole<00:02:23.280> bunch<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.549> other<00:02:23.730> thing<00:02:23.939> so<00:02:24.359> stay

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
and a whole bunch of other thing so stay

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.449 
and a whole bunch of other thing so stay
tuned<00:02:25.200> I'll<00:02:25.409> have<00:02:25.590> some<00:02:25.769> more<00:02:25.859> videos<00:02:26.189> for<00:02:26.400> you

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
tuned I'll have some more videos for you

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.369 
tuned I'll have some more videos for you
guys<00:02:26.519> shortly<00:02:26.909> sorry<00:02:27.299> it's<00:02:27.480> been<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.959> while

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
guys shortly sorry it's been a while

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.660 
guys shortly sorry it's been a while
since<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.739> made<00:02:28.859> one<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.159> a<00:02:32.250> little<00:02:32.489> bit

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
since I made one so it's a little bit

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.110 
since I made one so it's a little bit
more<00:02:32.849> part<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.989> believe<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:35.120> what's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
more part and I believe this is what's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.270 
more part and I believe this is what's
what<00:02:36.659> is<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.930> oil<00:02:37.109> pump<00:02:37.439> itself<00:02:37.889> and<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.129> can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
what is the oil pump itself and you can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.220 
what is the oil pump itself and you can
see<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.549> hose<00:02:38.760> actually<00:02:39.269> snapped<00:02:39.689> off<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.109> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
see the hose actually snapped off of it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.619 
see the hose actually snapped off of it
so<00:02:40.349> my<00:02:40.469> guess<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.889> what<00:02:41.099> happened<00:02:41.459> was<00:02:41.629> even

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
so my guess is what happened was even

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.879 
so my guess is what happened was even
though<00:02:42.719> there<00:02:42.870> was<00:02:42.959> oil<00:02:43.109> in<00:02:43.379> this

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
though there was oil in this

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.839 
though there was oil in this
if<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.700> pump<00:02:44.909> couldn't<00:02:45.239> pump<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:47.700> would

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
if the pump couldn't pump then it would

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.520 
if the pump couldn't pump then it would
probably<00:02:48.030> ran<00:02:48.419> dry<00:02:48.689> and<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:48.900> probably<00:02:49.169> why

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
probably ran dry and that's probably why

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.009 
probably ran dry and that's probably why
it<00:02:49.590> grenaded<00:02:50.040> itself<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.510> got<00:02:51.840> some

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
it grenaded itself but it's got some

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.539 
it grenaded itself but it's got some
wear<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.709> got<00:02:52.829> two<00:02:52.980> hundred<00:02:53.040> thousand

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
wear in it it's got two hundred thousand

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.059 
wear in it it's got two hundred thousand
miles<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.590> I'm<00:02:55.590> going<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.769> talk<00:02:55.889> to<00:02:55.980> my

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
miles on it so I'm going to talk to my

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.319 
miles on it so I'm going to talk to my
dad<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.549> if<00:02:56.609> we're<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.849> rebuild<00:02:57.150> it

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
dad and see if we're going to rebuild it

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.440 
dad and see if we're going to rebuild it
or<00:02:57.450> replace<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:59.060> yeah<00:03:00.060> we'll<00:03:00.239> go<00:03:00.359> from

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
or replace it so yeah we'll go from

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.659 
or replace it so yeah we'll go from
there
