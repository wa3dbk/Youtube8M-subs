00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
actually really hard to do so you have

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.820 
actually really hard to do so you have
to<00:01:58.659> kind<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.900> resort<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.290> doing<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.650> death

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
to kind of resort to doing it in death

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.590 
to kind of resort to doing it in death
matches<00:02:00.040> like<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:00.369> I<00:02:00.820> think<00:02:01.240> there's<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
matches like this I think there's the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.780 
matches like this I think there's the
whole<00:02:01.810> side<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.560> map<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.189> lined<00:02:03.460> with

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
whole side of the map is just lined with

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.060 
whole side of the map is just lined with
rocket<00:02:04.240> launchers<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:05.049> that<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.380> itself<00:02:05.470> is

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
rocket launchers so that in itself is

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.999 
rocket launchers so that in itself is
the<00:02:06.369> i<00:02:06.880> guess<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.659> small<00:02:07.960> demonstration<00:02:08.649> of

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
the i guess the small demonstration of

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.440 
the i guess the small demonstration of
the<00:02:09.160> quality<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:09.729> mat<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.270> i<00:02:10.300> haven't

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the quality of this mat so i haven't

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.030 
the quality of this mat so i haven't
died<00:02:10.690> yet<00:02:10.720> needs<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.380> be<00:02:11.470> taking<00:02:11.800> out<00:02:11.890> them

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
died yet needs to be taking out them

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.010 
died yet needs to be taking out them
tanks<00:02:12.340> there's<00:02:12.850> not<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> thing<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.780> is
