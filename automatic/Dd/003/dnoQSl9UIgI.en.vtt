00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.159
 I'm learning to play the drums 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.159
 to enter a rock group 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.370
 How great they dress, how they look 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.370
 dress 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.890
 and I also think that they dress 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 funny 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.119
 here and I liked the battery a lot 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.810
 new weak and touching it seemed very 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.810
 funny 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.990
 I can play your drums if you already 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.240
 we can 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.240
 Well, I'm afraid I'm not 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.390
 because it's new and you're too small to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.149
 touching it you could break something 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.150
 years 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.860
 it's my battery and those are my rules 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.819
 Batteries are for adults not for children 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.819
 sorry 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.940
 it's not fair we're not so small no 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.330
 we are as small as rossi we can 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.840
 do things that adults do 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.670
 what 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.910
 we have to prove to Billy that he does not 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.910
 we are small children and so we go 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.439
 hello mom I'm going to make a sandwich for 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.439

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:07.490
 and I'm going to take the milk that I was 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.520
 very proud of having poured milk 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:17.570
 weak and without throwing a single drop here 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:20.030
 you have there you can take away the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:28.910
 mom elena parties like sandwiches in 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:32.050

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.640
 peanut alone mother has taken him 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.380
 the edges but it's been my idea to take 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.819
 Billy has been careful and I have not thrown 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.890
 nothing 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.590
 you had never brought me the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.900
 snack but that's because before only 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.910

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.110

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.590

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.169
 fell wondered how clement ainielle 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.120
 could show billy that they were already 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.120
 older to play their drums 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:28.210

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.290
 past 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.210

 There is a pedal down there trodden with the foot

 that's called hype here and julen sang 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.389
 that each drum would sound different but 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.600
 he liked the sound of the cymbal 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.600
 plus 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.600

 I'm looking for a little boy called k 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:30.830
 it has seen the mass and I am a 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.020
 adult 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:38.470
 but I can not believe it 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.539
 but if you're good if you're already a 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.180
 adult I guess you do not want to play in 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:46.490

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:55.240
 pretending to pay him take care clement added 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.620
 here and I liked to do as it was 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.630
 adult but decided that the time of 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.630
 have fun being a child again
