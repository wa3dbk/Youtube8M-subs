weekend but there wasn't one scheduled

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.080 
weekend but there wasn't one scheduled
so<00:00:35.020> it<00:00:36.020> was<00:00:36.199> a<00:00:36.230> choice<00:00:36.650> between<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.790> ice

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
so it was a choice between this and ice

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.090 
so it was a choice between this and ice
fishing<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:38.780> they<00:00:38.900> decided<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.470> track<00:00:39.860> some

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
fishing and they decided to track some

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.560 
fishing and they decided to track some
cross-country

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.530 

you're<00:00:43.960> doing<00:00:44.200> great<00:00:44.440> Ryan<00:00:45.250> qualified<00:00:46.059> first

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
you're doing great Ryan qualified first

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.430 
you're doing great Ryan qualified first
in<00:00:47.020> crow<00:00:47.829> Oakland<00:00:48.309> and<00:00:48.550> then<00:00:48.850> qualified<00:00:49.809> first

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
in crow Oakland and then qualified first

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.330 
in crow Oakland and then qualified first
in<00:00:50.770> semi-pro<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:53.220> guess<00:00:54.220> like<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.760> went<00:00:55.750> out<00:00:55.840> last

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
in semi-pro I guess like I went out last

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.979 
in semi-pro I guess like I went out last
right<00:00:57.340> behind<00:00:57.579> DJ<00:00:58.000> which<00:00:58.180> was<00:00:58.360> perfect<00:00:58.720> so<00:00:58.870> he

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
right behind DJ which was perfect so he

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.990 
right behind DJ which was perfect so he
could<00:00:59.140> set<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.379> pace<00:00:59.559> I<00:01:00.309> ended<00:01:00.730> up<00:01:00.790> qualifying

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
could set the pace I ended up qualifying

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.479 
could set the pace I ended up qualifying
first<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:02.739> in<00:01:02.800> front<00:01:02.949> of<00:01:03.010> him<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:03.280> it<00:01:03.339> went

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
first right in front of him so it went

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.280 
first right in front of him so it went
well<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.060> lot<00:01:07.240> more<00:01:07.479> endurance<00:01:07.960> than<00:01:08.200> I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
well it's a lot more endurance than I

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.050 
well it's a lot more endurance than I
originally<00:01:08.410> thought<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:09.640> know<00:01:09.759> it's<00:01:09.910> no

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
originally thought you know it's no

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.609 
originally thought you know it's no
cross<00:01:10.300> obviously<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.900> got<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.110> be<00:01:11.200> an<00:01:11.290> awesome

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619

lot<00:01:45.050> it's<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.320> lot<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.560> fun<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.890> know<00:01:45.950> that

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
lot it's a lot of fun you know that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.270 
lot it's a lot of fun you know that
people<00:01:46.610> around<00:01:46.820> here<00:01:47.150> really<00:01:47.330> nice<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.280> USCT

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
people around here really nice and USCT

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.160 
people around here really nice and USCT
circuit<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.180> an<00:01:50.360> awesome<00:01:50.630> circuit<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.080> know

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
circuit is an awesome circuit you know

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.900 
circuit is an awesome circuit you know
very<00:01:51.410> healthy<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.770> lot<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.070> following<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.670> I

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
very healthy a lot of following and I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.400 
very healthy a lot of following and I
think<00:01:53.390> it's<00:01:53.510> gonna<00:01:53.600> be<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.780> growing<00:01:53.990> circuit

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
think it's gonna be a growing circuit

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
think it's gonna be a growing circuit
and<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.590> lot<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.830> fun<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.160> years<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.430> come

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.219 

speed<00:01:59.430> ahead<00:01:59.610> number<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.899> used<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
speed ahead number one I'm not used to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.459 
speed ahead number one I'm not used to
going<00:02:01.789> fast<00:02:02.789> at<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:04.259> we're

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
going fast at all and now now we're

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.059 
going fast at all and now now we're
cooking<00:02:05.100> pretty<00:02:05.219> good<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.450> speed<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.289> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
cooking pretty good so speed this the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.190 
cooking pretty good so speed this the
smaller<00:02:08.399> bumps<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.450> sleds<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.929> way

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
smaller bumps and the the sleds are way

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
smaller bumps and the the sleds are way
different<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:10.920> I'm<00:02:11.009> used<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
different from what I'm used to the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.780 
different from what I'm used to the
normal<00:02:12.720> sleds<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.170> way<00:02:13.379> stiffer<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.519> know

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
normal sleds are way stiffer and I know

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.940 
normal sleds are way stiffer and I know
these<00:02:15.030> are<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.390> soft<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.959> they're<00:02:16.800> cool

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
these are just soft and they're cool

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.559 
these are just soft and they're cool
