00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.859
 people welcome good previously 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.920
 about a video of how to import models 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:12.130
 of world of warcraft opening but what 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.630
 What happens is that I did not have bones or 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.820
 animations then what filter today is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.800
 explain how to import them or 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 models with animations and bones that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.310
 you can animate in 3ds max 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.880
 that makes our work much easier 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.030
 for this we are going to use a leader 13 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.030
 max 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.490
 this program is called autodesk fx 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.810
 turn good let's start 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.810
 opening a motor or seeing 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.610
 We click on the sector if they want to open 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.910
 any character in a good case 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.370
 sky will not emit an error but does not pass 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.559
 nothing 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.130
 if you would be giving the same 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.290
 error 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.000
 good what you think in this program is 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.360
 the truth of anything of the vote 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.540
 strong and modify it and export it or 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.550
 use it here too 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.760
 can you modify it have these panels 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.730
 here it is the basis for the creation of 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.660
 character can change it 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.980
 the face the color of the hair everything what is 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.150
 does with the creation of the character the 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.840
 principle and put the equipment here 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.770
 we have the animations 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.770
 that are all 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.990
 and good what I'm going to do 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.300
 is to export the ladies you come to create 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.990
 a tutorial 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.990
 banxico 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.189
 to export it cristian the sector 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.030
 in fire 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:06.250
 export mother 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.100
 leave this liquidated with tic and fx 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.820
 let's make a new folder 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.820
 person 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.750
 fx let's delete it there 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.400
 do not skip this window that tells us that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.799
 let's put the animation name that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.769
 we may want to export and that 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.950
 we will continue to export all just do not 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.440
 We said nothing and when I use that in my case 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.440
 I want to export one no more as it is 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:43.480
 a video that I want to do fast 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.480
 and I'm going to write run which is to run 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.909
 and we could have 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.909
 or it explodes very fast let's do this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.050
 let's open 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.270
 the fx convert 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.560
 in this program we can visualize a 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.560
 animation that we export too 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.460
 is 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.880
 because only x 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.680
 if they realized the last one facing 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.480
 one of the last ones is wrong but this is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.610
 solves easy with each other max 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.670
 we continue to do nothing good what you have 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:33.000
 what to do is click on this button 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.850
 of fx take manager click on ante fx 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.780
 and we look 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.780
 domination 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.820
 good but we click in my case I have 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.100
 an extra animation if you do not 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.070
 write anything and putting key 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.060
 would be exported to all and at the time of 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.550
 create the fx files 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.550
 three weeks can matter 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.750
 it's going to be very late 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.310
 good for this we click on that is fx 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.710
 let's say in the latest and the 3d version 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.380
 max they are using 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:20.459
 I put 2010 because it has 13 more than one 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:23.699
 10 ok and we believe 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.710
 as unicef â€‹â€‹to credit is that I do not believe the 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.250
 fx file that is 13 meters but 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.710
 important we close this we're going to have 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.710
 finally and we will import 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:42.629
 and we go to the folder of our image 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.339
 they see what we did was create a 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:48.289
 folder inside the folder that 

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:52.040
 we export and come back with the animation 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.890
 fx configured 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.740
 and we are going to import and they throw us many 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.830
 options 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.680
 we put it ok innovative an error of 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.080
 the textures but nothing else happens 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.509
 still 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:13.400
 we must open and as you can see we have 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.400
 our crazy running 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:24.520
 and it's all fine normally it stretches 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.210
 oh no because I too 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.190
 they have it this way normally and as 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.590
 come, we have 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:38.220
 this last broken faith what we do is 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.220
 select the whole character 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.560
 let's change the size of frames 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:52.180
 let's put 25 for now to see it 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.400
 better and in a cycle what always 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.980
 does is leave the last frame the same as 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.110
 the first then let's grab the 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.330
 last great that is damaged we are going to 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.819
 cut your first we make 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.460
 but the animal is incomplete what 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.770
 we do now is grab the first and 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.930
 press back shift and the shift key 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.860
 and with the left click of drag 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.590
 towards the forehead is the last and then 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.330
 we have the first fem and the last ones 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.060
 They are equal 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.770
 and now what we do is adjust the 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.190
 number of frames 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:31.190
 how do we finish the mind let's put that 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.830
 finish 19 since 20 is equality to the 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.169
 first 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.529
 and if we give you that the whole project is 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:44.090
 in terms of the textures if I put render 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:46.070
 It's pretty good so I'll leave you there 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.980
 once I am I hope that you have 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.810
 served a lot 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.810
 and he had been
