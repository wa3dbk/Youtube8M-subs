 maple briefly doesn't really matter 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.160
 it doesn't matter who you can do the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.899
 all the time my camo under that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.210
 no button press secretly hope that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.850
 you go up as it is now it was 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.410
 it's not what they call a feedback 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.579
 full i'm effe in could situation 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 mode 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.820
 I say if you jump on a boy like that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.680
 you then much higher res at six jolly 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 spread against zodiac thick as you 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.619
 do not press any button 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.049
 spain tree testing itself 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.700
 he doesn't go no kid here 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.439
 we and change forests that is thijs 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.210
 communicates 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.030
 but I think we play in the game 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.130
 was i was it an indie game or 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.840
 I don't have that on your own if we have this 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.970
 game was released yesterday is still free 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.440
 new and technical is not so good 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.060
 rated so you don't need much 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.280
 expect them from this gameplay now 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.720
 games front door also that they play for 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.440
 super nintendo loud life that I understand 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.790
 not quite 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.240
 yes he still has a life that 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.210
 still lie so that's right you can tell me 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 new game the mean I think so 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.460
 still pretty nice because there 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.970
 you no longer have competition in that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.399
 market 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.090
 no it will have been the idea they have 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.410
 costing tackled shows the should you 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.830
 To this game are also steamboat coat 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.950
 to buy 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.869
 I think that the whole idea was that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.929
 make a mistake let girls write it down 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:05.060
 music is jumping in the holes 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.289
 that is unstoppable oh yes their there 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.200
 across 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.850
 you could over it that could only do that 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.430
 points want that chance we know 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.500
 we are a bit sensitive about pressure 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.620
 is a bit radical 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.680
 we have the secret book from when 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.150
 while we know the what our book and 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.130
 something from mario makes something books 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.870
 Yes Yes 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.540
 underwater level they are known for 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.830
 people's favorite levels also ours 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.830
 releases different color 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.430
 Judith are the reason why it is so much fun 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.310
 it goes so quickly 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.470
 oh there and control the throw up 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.120
 that's how honest we are 7 again 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.860
 quality difference of the two 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.380
 that's right indeed it's good that you do it 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.050
 just emphasized and also just yourself 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.269

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.780
 you for him gone there you have such respect 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.780
 for me 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.709
 there are very strange physics in the game 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.260
 that it suddenly drops super a super fast 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.930
