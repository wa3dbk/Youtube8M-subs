00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.689
 my name is bobby baldwin the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.609
 chef in the dining room in bmw world 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.060
 in Munich 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.699
 and today we are going to shriek 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.610
 comes from New Caledonia we do 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.430
 paprika a little chili 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.960
 garlic and at the end bit 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.790
 fresh olive oil 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.519
 it is always important to barbecue 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.129
 that the pieces in principle the grill good 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.769
 not too small so it stays that way 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.520
 juicier and does not burn so fast 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.480
 so that something minimal for the services 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.859
 olive oil over it bit of pepper 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 you can see it's nice when 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.180
 she is done when the peppers are straight 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.510
 the skin of the particle bubbles throws up 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.970
 Going into the dark then is actually 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 understood the garlic gentleman leave 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.780
 quietly in the shell , the ten crowd 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.210
 just in the handball company the gambas 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.429
 then round the head, then every six months 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.320
 the channels and drag the ladies with you 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.240
 we do not have them out completely 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.430
 just cut it to the near to the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 Tail end by then unfold 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.740
 that's how we say it is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.860
 butterfly also cuts discreetly here 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.079
 season a little more salt with olive oil 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.350
 and more really need here is not 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.259
 Not 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.540
 a lemon because we are fresh 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.290
 with the bowl down on so that 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.290
 the flesh does not protect the flesh 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.229
 right on the fire is a bit whiter 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.700
 balsamic vinegar 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 Here we go for a while 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.039
 a still fresh basil the prawns 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.369
 it's almost over now 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.770
 by 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.030
 she's done it a bit 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.950
 because they are a bit further away 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.460
 So is the fire side turned away 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.869
 But it's already pretty good, so to speak 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.069
 the guests are already finished the will 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.630
 now nothing with the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.819
 vinaigrette go over the gambas because 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.260
 However, it is very strong for us 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.870
 actual sweetish meat from the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.630
 make Chamber seem as easy as 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.760
 it is rather the little nice about the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.330
 go paprika and then you can go 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.799
 pleasure 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.799
 the meat as well as some
