this FIFA 13 so overall I got to say

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279 
this FIFA 13 so overall I got to say
just<00:00:47.640> before<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.030> game<00:00:48.210> starts<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.140> game

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
just before the game starts up the game

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
demo felt like but it was pretty

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.300 
demo felt like but it was pretty
fast-paced<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.380> lot<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.740> plays<00:02:18.010> I'm

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
fast-paced in a lot of the plays I'm

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.180 
fast-paced in a lot of the plays I'm
kind<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.870> know<00:02:20.040> escalated<00:02:21.040> very

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
kind of a you know escalated very

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.710 
kind of a you know escalated very
quickly<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> little<00:02:22.540> bit

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
quickly I like this and a little bit

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.120 
quickly I like this and a little bit
more<00:02:22.870> because<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.320> gives<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.620> more<00:02:23.800> time<00:02:24.100> to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
more because it gives you more time to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.160 
more because it gives you more time to
kind<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.460> see<00:02:24.670> what's<00:02:24.880> going<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.540> when<00:02:26.140> you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
kind of see what's going on and when you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.410 
kind of see what's going on and when you
are<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.830> offense<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.760> really<00:02:28.090> need<00:02:28.240> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
are on the offense you really need to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.480 
are on the offense you really need to
figure<00:02:28.990> out<00:02:29.200> your<00:02:29.380> plays<00:02:29.710> and<00:02:29.740> figure<00:02:30.460> out

figure out your plays and figure out
your<00:02:30.760> tactics<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.690> kind<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.320> see<00:02:32.530> is

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
your tactics and you can kind of see is

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.440 
your tactics and you can kind of see is
the<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.100> know<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.580> sees<00:02:33.850> open<00:02:34.240> when<00:02:34.360> you're

of knocked off there but gets a shot off
and<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:11.530> goes<00:03:11.739> wide<00:03:12.070> yes<00:03:12.760> clean<00:03:13.120> not<00:03:13.239> able<00:03:13.420> to

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
and just goes wide yes clean not able to

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.000 
and just goes wide yes clean not able to
reach<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.900> but<00:03:14.020> still<00:03:14.260> doesn't<00:03:14.920> matter

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
reach it but still doesn't matter

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.910 
reach it but still doesn't matter
anyways<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.640> goes<00:03:15.790> off<00:03:16.000> into<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.410> back<00:03:17.590> there

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
anyways it goes off into the back there

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.560 
anyways it goes off into the back there
and<00:03:17.950> there's<00:03:18.340> another<00:03:18.610> chance<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.000> Dyer<00:03:19.299> here

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
and there's another chance for Dyer here

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.509 
and there's another chance for Dyer here
trying<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.870> cross<00:03:20.140> had<00:03:20.709> several<00:03:21.040> crossing

trying to cross had several crossing

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.400 
trying to cross had several crossing
chances<00:03:21.940> but<00:03:22.060> really<00:03:22.360> only<00:03:22.540> one<00:03:22.810> took<00:03:23.110> into

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
chances but really only one took into

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.830 
chances but really only one took into
effect<00:03:23.769> most<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.820> chances<00:03:25.269> weren't<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.720> know

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
effect most the chances weren't you know

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.780 
effect most the chances weren't you know

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
something that we weren't able to really

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.440 
something that we weren't able to really
activate<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.130> this<00:03:33.280> game<00:03:33.519> as<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.120> can<00:03:34.180> see

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
activate in this game as you can see

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.320 
activate in this game as you can see
after<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.780> first<00:03:34.989> half<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.500> shots<00:03:36.010> are

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330

after the first half the shots are
relatively<00:03:37.330> pretty<00:03:37.989> even<00:03:38.230> but<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.410> little<00:03:38.650> bit

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
relatively pretty even but a little bit

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.009 
relatively pretty even but a little bit
in<00:03:38.890> West<00:03:39.070> Ham's<00:03:39.310> favor<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.209> score<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.780> 1:1

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
going into the second half here another

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.470 
going into the second half here another
thing<00:03:45.160> kind<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.580> nose<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:46.030> well<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.390> I've

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
thing kind of the nose is well that I've

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.620 
thing kind of the nose is well that I've
really<00:03:46.720> kind<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.470> taken<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> lot<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
really kind of taken to a lot is the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.420 
really kind of taken to a lot is the
fact<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.500> ball<00:03:50.680> physics<00:03:51.160> nonetheless

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
fact that the ball physics nonetheless

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.910 
fact that the ball physics nonetheless
is<00:03:51.970> still<00:03:52.239> feel<00:03:52.420> great<00:03:52.720> but<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.680> actual

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
is still feel great but the the actual

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.979 
is still feel great but the the actual
player<00:03:54.670> interaction<00:03:55.239> with<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.420> ball<00:03:55.570> feels<00:03:55.840> a

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
player interaction with the ball feels a

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.259 
player interaction with the ball feels a
lot<00:03:56.110> better<00:03:56.320> than<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.769> did<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.070> demo<00:03:57.340> I'm

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
lot better than it did in the demo I'm

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.970 
lot better than it did in the demo I'm
not<00:03:58.420> sure<00:03:58.660> if<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.230> me<00:03:59.410> but<00:03:59.620> from

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
not sure if this is just me but from

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.979 
not sure if this is just me but from
what<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.130> kind<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.489> felt<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:00.850> far<00:04:01.060> in<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.780> demo

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
what I kind of felt so far in the demo

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.509 
what I kind of felt so far in the demo
it<00:04:02.200> really<00:04:02.470> sometimes<00:04:02.830> was<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.220> little<00:04:03.400> bit

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
it really sometimes was a little bit

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.250 
it really sometimes was a little bit
jittery<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.880> little<00:04:04.180> bit<00:04:04.269> jumpy<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:05.170> was

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
jittery a little bit jumpy and it was

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.690 
jittery a little bit jumpy and it was
kind<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.470> cool<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.709> see<00:04:05.980> obviously<00:04:06.310> because<00:04:06.580> it

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
kind of cool to see obviously because it

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.610 
kind of cool to see obviously because it
showed<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.180> ball<00:04:07.360> was<00:04:07.570> at<00:04:07.750> reacting<00:04:08.500> off

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
showed that the ball was at reacting off

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.199 
showed that the ball was at reacting off
the<00:04:08.739> players<00:04:09.010> bodies<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.640> was<00:04:09.700> reacting<00:04:10.120> a

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
the players bodies it was reacting a

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.240 
the players bodies it was reacting a
little<00:04:10.510> bit<00:04:10.600> too<00:04:10.780> much<00:04:10.930> and<00:04:11.260> uh<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:12.070> game

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
little bit too much and uh and the game

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.220 
little bit too much and uh and the game
so<00:04:12.489> far<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.790> feels<00:04:12.820> like<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.510> ball<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:13.750> still

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
so far it feels like the ball is still

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.680 
so far it feels like the ball is still
reacting<00:04:14.799> off<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.070> body<00:04:15.310> there<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:16.450> it's

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
reacting off the body there but it's

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.659 
reacting off the body there but it's
still<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.019> little<00:04:17.470> bit<00:04:17.560> better<00:04:17.739> than<00:04:18.340> what<00:04:18.549> we

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
still a little bit better than what we

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.210 
still a little bit better than what we
saw<00:04:18.850> in<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:19.000> demo<00:04:19.209> not<00:04:19.479> as<00:04:19.660> crazy<00:04:19.959> not<00:04:20.799> as<00:04:20.950> zany

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
saw in the demo not as crazy not as zany

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.490 
saw in the demo not as crazy not as zany
from<00:04:21.849> all<00:04:21.940> those<00:04:22.120> chances<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.660> whatnot<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
from all those chances of whatnot and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.990 
from all those chances of whatnot and
you<00:04:23.560> saw<00:04:23.770> right<00:04:23.950> there<00:04:23.979> we<00:04:24.280> got<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.430> nice<00:04:24.640> chance

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
you saw right there we got a nice chance

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.720 
you saw right there we got a nice chance
that<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:25.900> went<00:04:26.110> over<00:04:26.289> the<00:04:26.380> bar

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
that just went over the bar

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.370 
that just went over the bar
and<00:04:26.820> then<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.090> are<00:04:27.120> able<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.630> break<00:04:27.900> out<00:04:28.080> here

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
and then we are able to break out here

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.710 
and then we are able to break out here
trying<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.250> lob<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.640> ahead<00:04:29.730> to<00:04:29.910> Graham<00:04:30.450> but

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
just kind of did a bad pass up there and

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.970 
just kind of did a bad pass up there and
went<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.660> side<00:04:33.870> we're<00:04:34.470> still<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.740> little
