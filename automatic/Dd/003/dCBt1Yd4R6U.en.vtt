00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.070
 well it him everyone in greenhouse 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.250
 center today for a new 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.380
 video on mx vs atv supercross so 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.450
 again I put all alone because 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.170
 that it's a video I present to you 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:34.580
 the four circuits of supercross quebec 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.820
 in the pack and one to leave or that to 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.610
 know savannah albania it seems 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.710
 finally to albania alabama where wall month 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.350
 the Banat I know that it over there not me 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.970
 maybe at last brief there is also chicago 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.409
 and st louis so in this video I 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.040
 you just presented savannah and and 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.050
 Alabama 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.129
 yeah I think that's how it is 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.769
 must I check even simple it's 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.370
 like that and because me for me it's 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.750
 my two favorite 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.000
 good it's not the most beautiful precisely 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.460
 these two shorter but I find this 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.720
 let it be said country rage since 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.229
 the two are born two others are enough 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.210
 complicated and a lot more 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.729
 technique to have good it's not too much 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.040
 which bothers me is the other he has 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.659
 a lot a lot of two traces 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.189
 different so before exploiting it 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.930
 totally I prefer to do it a 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.159
 second story that I see what I 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.329
 see here I play a little better 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.299
 because for me it's a small 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.640
 little laborious so that's my first 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.619
 track laps gs my first two 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.420
 parts I'm doing on stage never 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.130
 played before so I do not know the 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.979
 sequences this for that I do not want 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.549
 super super good we'll try to do 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.310
 better tomorrow 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.939
 so what else is there to say 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.259
 yes so here I use the chassis the 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.729
 new chassis cades in motorcycle club 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:52.130
 deposits at 0 euros the act is free 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.570
 so they facilitate me I find that the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.820
 motorcycle is there it is much more 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.289
 much more fluid to roll kind 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.229
 know a lot easier to ride on 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.259
 go a little bit faster the scrabble 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.490
 and yes it does not change three years except Cuba 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.759
 and come back very quickly I think a 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.229
 little bit and also realizes the motorcycle 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.310
 when a lot a lot more angle and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.510
 that's something costs it's 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.950
 that stroll in the bins we have 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.530
 traces inside traces 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.700
 outside so what's good is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.989
 that in the interior traces we take 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.060
 many angles the limit do 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.069
 to touch the gift on the ground is to 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.409
 July having knotted in the tracks 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.030
 outside velodromes all that that's it 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.680
 goes very very fast and the bike for 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.030
 much more envied that it's really 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.590
 nice to see that's what will do 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.030
 that I keep playing with messi at 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.709
 early I was not too hot is that 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.670
 websites is still a small 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.129
 little different and served the enemy then 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.989
 I hope I have to say yeah 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.599
 boots so there you can see that some 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.819
 debut the second round I already have six 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.349
 seconds advance in divinity so that the 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.030
 boots they did the same problem as 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.940
 on and museums it's live tv on the dlc 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.329
 of supercross they had done that's 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.220
 the level is not homogeneous 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.500
 everything we quickly put a trick or 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.209
 five rounds you will see the gemmi qe3 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 turn but all alone still not at 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.989
 fourth round I think I'm giving them 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.099
 doctor all that kind of damage for the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.659
 people who are not playing online because 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.319
 suddenly they will hit the boots 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.340
 during 30 years in the tale the 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.870
 boxes and then well they have not 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.919
 the innocent four spaces this funny of 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.690
 play with them even if there are circuits 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.129
 like chicago and st louis or there the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.720
 circuit the level is a little bit 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.920
 homogeneous but here it is from there to see them 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.170
 that it's still a moment 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.780
 even if at the beginning on the second circuit 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.190
 I have a little trouble starting from 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.910
 work made the toy of a very very fast 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.930
 and strong our weekly before what is it 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.930
 than to translate 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.270
 so I think you take out the video of 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.560
 chicago and st louis tomorrow will try to 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.989
 out his little tonight 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.420
 so there it is 19:10 she I know you to 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.980
 go out for 23 hours max since 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.630
 crowded - I work either grown up 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.230
 platoon camus because morzine turns 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.880
 around a little bit simpler than 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.069
 never light in the eyes when 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.580
 they are together 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.769
 so it goes on this month I wanted it 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.019
 sure about these images and then tell you to 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.299
 the next finally finger tomorrow because 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.680
 I think I would also start the 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.239
 tomorrow if I was the least things 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.790
 a lot because there I said almost 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.169
 more why these two circuits and then 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.450
 web 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.900
 Hello everyone and see you next time 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.900
 saw everyone 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.230
