source<00:01:44.810> from<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:48.619> from<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.649> epic<00:01:50.009> there's<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
source from the from the epic there's a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.710 
source from the from the epic there's a
digital<00:01:50.909> second

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.130 

from<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.130> from<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> splitter<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
from the from the splitter well so that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.070 
from the from the splitter well so that
that<00:01:58.799> goes<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> compel<00:02:00.510> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
that goes on so compel the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.950 
that goes on so compel the
compressibility<00:02:01.619> goes<00:02:01.979> back<00:02:02.190> on<00:02:02.810> add<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
compressibility goes back on add the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.809 
compressibility goes back on add the
Texas<00:02:04.290> signal<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.909> signal<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> there<00:02:07.819> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
Texas signal so the signal is there this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:17.650 
Texas signal so the signal is there this
 camera<00:02:10.039> anyway<00:02:11.039> he<00:02:11.760> says<00:02:11.940> 720p<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:15.380> I

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
 camera anyway he says 720p and I

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.140 
 camera anyway he says 720p and I
don't<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:18.989> do<00:02:19.230> I've<00:02:19.410> tried<00:02:20.150> try

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
don't know what to do I've tried try

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.610 
don't know what to do I've tried try
changing<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.540> outputs<00:02:21.959> try<00:02:22.230> changing<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
changing the outputs try changing the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
changing the outputs try changing the
inputs<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.310> they<00:02:23.489> literally<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:24.030> nothing

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
inputs and they literally have nothing

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.259 
inputs and they literally have nothing
that<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.959> do<00:02:25.170> there<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.250> picture<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:27.000> does

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
that I can do there is picture that does

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.690 
that I can do there is picture that does
come<00:02:27.900> up<00:02:28.790> but<00:02:29.790> only<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.320> split<00:02:31.500> second<00:02:32.130> then

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
come up but only for a split second then

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.720 
come up but only for a split second then
the<00:02:32.820> color<00:02:33.060> cut<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.480> half<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:35.190> will<00:02:35.519> probably

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
the color cut in half it will probably

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.729 
the color cut in half it will probably
comp<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:36.209> actually<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:38.269> you<00:02:39.269> will<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.739> it

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
comp now actually and you will see it

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.620 
comp now actually and you will see it
does<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.600> if<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.780> thing<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:44.480> try<00:02:45.480> on

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
does it if that thing is I try on

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
does it if that thing is I try on
something<00:02:45.840> else<00:02:51.290> yes<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.440> done<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:52.890> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
that it actually works I mean this is

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.509 
that it actually works I mean this is
audio<00:03:39.359> that's<00:03:39.540> nothing<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:41.220> would<00:03:41.340> be<00:03:41.430> able

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
audio that's nothing that would be able

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.520 
audio that's nothing that would be able
to<00:03:41.609> change<00:03:41.850> anything<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.269> touching<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:43.079> HD

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
and so and so forth and that just opens

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.900

comes up on the TV at all means of
 brand-new<00:04:55.890> TV<00:04:56.100> 3d<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:58.850> mean<00:04:59.850> I've

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
 brand-new TV 3d I mean I've

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.190 
 brand-new TV 3d I mean I've
checked<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.450> microphone<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:01.020> was<00:05:01.110> the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
checked the microphone it was the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.510 
checked the microphone it was the
microphone<00:05:01.530> level<00:05:01.650> works<00:05:01.980> on<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.160> software

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
microphone level works on the software

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.800 
microphone level works on the software
so<00:05:02.640> it's<00:05:02.880> nothing<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.150> do<00:05:03.240> with<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.419> software

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
so it's nothing to do with the software

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.430 
so it's nothing to do with the software
is<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.169> do<00:05:04.320> with<00:05:04.500> how<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.990> out<00:05:07.080> ghetto<00:05:07.290> is
