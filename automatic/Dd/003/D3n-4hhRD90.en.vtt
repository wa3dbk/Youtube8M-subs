00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
environment where I'm just going to be

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.450 
environment where I'm just going to be
seen<00:04:23.800> as<00:04:23.830> some<00:04:24.310> Joe<00:04:24.790> Blow<00:04:25.090> tourist<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.460> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
seen as some Joe Blow tourist and I

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.490 
seen as some Joe Blow tourist and I
don't<00:04:27.970> know<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.180> don't<00:04:28.480> really<00:04:28.660> don't<00:04:28.930> see<00:04:29.230> how

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
don't know I don't really don't see how

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.159 
don't know I don't really don't see how
that<00:04:29.890> is<00:04:30.340> quote<00:04:31.120> paradise

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
that is quote paradise

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.890 
that is quote paradise
because<00:04:33.240> then<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.330> call<00:04:34.570> something

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
because then you call something

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.610 
because then you call something
paradises<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.950> then<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.220> becomes<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.910> hellhole

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
paradises and then it becomes a hellhole

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.800 
paradises and then it becomes a hellhole
so<00:04:38.790> that's<00:04:39.790> my<00:04:39.970> thought<00:04:40.210> on<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:41.490> and<00:04:42.810> then

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
so that's my thought on that and then

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.690 
so that's my thought on that and then
plus<00:04:44.140> having<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.560> get<00:04:44.680> all<00:04:44.860> new<00:04:44.890> gear<00:04:45.550> you
