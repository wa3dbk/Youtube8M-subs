00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.640
 after that are march for the outlook 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.150
 an attractive woman an idyllic landscape and plenty of armadillos 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.339
 to knock 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.570
 we were visiting Oskar ons Studio 2 and have a lot of scenes from the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.570
 Action role-playing sacks 2 added 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.710
 at the same time she may have come across the wrong word 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.159
 from two bags sacked me still far away 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.490
 much of the world it still about cath 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.480
 most quests exist so far among the top and balancing must 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.260
 also wait 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.350
 that's why the Graffiti government fall right at the first start 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.580
 makes nothing to the tumbling demonstrating physics right anyway 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.270
 By the way, here you see the blast furnaces in action a new heroine for the first time 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 and a classic spell character 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.840
 he already knows the Seraphim from the predecessor just so that they house it 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.050
 Players can enter sandbags own roof 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.980
 whether one or more contentious 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.060
 And that will not change, despite the new 3d engine 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.130
 already very impressive the detail-loving interior 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.590
 The entire game world they should explore without a single charge break 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.230
 can 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.240
 to the book another house or a whole yard 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.970
 in the field of humans 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 architecturally distinct from the countries of blast furnaces 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.250
 and stylistically very much the first Szeged Venet 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.320
 and no 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.590
 the dragon here is not the pet 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.590
 Kim actually forgot a Belize accidentally 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.520
 but hey imposing shudder always pity us in the fight against the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 Wolves can not help yet 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.710
 well and again a house 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.909
 this time to demonstrate the dynamic day and night change 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.280
 practically that can accelerate a little for the decided 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280
 pay attention to the light and shadow games 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.710
 and now let's see where he did not come out of the house 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.779
 even in fast motion to recognize 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.409
 the nights will be significantly shorter in sacks 2 than they should days 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.139
 but playful 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.859
 they can find out about a quest at night, for example 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.859
 which inhabitants of a village drive themselves into werewolves 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.000
 there is no nee nee I have enough now 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 we prefer to look after and to the beach 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.559
 Mister here 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.879
 and let it rain a bit 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.879
 because even the weather can change at any time 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:52.499
 that does not have any playful it just looks gorgeous out front 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.499
 all the rippling raindrops in the water 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.980
 in our videos NBC already quite rumgekommen but still only one 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.999
 tiny fraction of what to expect later 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.339
 here you can see the current status of the world map of 6 2 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.339
 Of course, many designers still have to take care of the empty spaces 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:20.479
 Around 15 km² of his career played 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.609
 Of course only on the surface 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.859
 because of course there are still a lot of dungeons 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 Heights and Qatar come 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.689
 and right there now accompany the shadow warriors to sell skeletons 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:41.329
 Listen to every character for a few seconds on the music 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.689
 gets its a tailor made soundtrack that is 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.819
 the Nama Stefes adapts to action 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.249
 while singing along Shadow Warrior Day in the game Kosslick Rock music 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.449
 Of course, the privacy of the new 3d graphics benefit 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:09.089
 they would be much more credible than in Platten predecessors 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.510
 so back to the fresh air here visit a troche 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.079
 Spielfeld had only lost so 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.770
 the developers promise that their inhabitants what daily routines and professions 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.620
 Of course, nothing has yet to be seen 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.159
 Therefore, we are skeptical about it 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.159
 we are now much more confident about the promised ones 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.340
 Ride mounts 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.340
 That's how we saw the horse in action for the first time 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.259
 and the fight on horseback is already working 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.259
 Care proof follows 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.860
 Has 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.110
 After about a third of the campaign, they would of course be athletic 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.259
 how to do without 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.879
 because then each character gets his whole in the context of a special quest 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.210
 personal mount 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.210
 Accident of our shadow warriors here Dr for the dog 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.589
 Advantage over the horse 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.989
 they can perform almost any special ability on the saddle 

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:15.180
 interpreted accordingly differently 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.170
 from the jump attacks shadow existence 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.170
 will then be in the jump at Giftes Höhn dog 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.409
 At the moment, though, it's still moving up and down 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.559
 continue to fight badly on foot 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:32.009
 Finally, no no house but a boss 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.520
 Although this fire Demon can not show any special attacks but already does 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.689
 vividly on which caliber we can look forward to 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.020
 because these colleagues here are the place developers the relatively early in the 

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.449
 Encounter game
