because that's what most Combinator's
day<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.280> let<00:01:08.460> its<00:01:09.710> games<00:01:10.710> his<00:01:10.920> recent

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
day and I so let its games his recent

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.080 
day and I so let its games his recent
games<00:01:12.380> he's<00:01:13.380> got<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.950> team<00:01:14.580> deathmatch<00:01:14.909> on

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
games he's got a team deathmatch on

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.050 
games he's got a team deathmatch on
Bakura<00:01:15.420> he<00:01:15.630> lost<00:01:15.900> he<00:01:16.439> goes<00:01:16.619> 0<00:01:16.860> 0<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.970> he

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
Bakura he lost he goes 0 0 so he

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
Bakura he lost he goes 0 0 so he
probably<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.479> join<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> game<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.710> something

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.100 
probably just join a game or something
he<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> ground<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.659> kill<00:01:21.840> confirm

he's<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> 0<00:01:22.830> 1<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> appalling<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.950> 11

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
he's got a 0 1 this is appalling a 11

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.870 
he's got a 0 1 this is appalling a 11
using<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> MSR<00:01:27.780> looks<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.579> 11<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:31.880> don't

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
using the MSR looks like a 11 I don't

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.210 
using the MSR looks like a 11 I don't
think<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> find<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.659> game<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:33.960> him<00:01:33.990> in

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
think I find actually a game with him in

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.450 
think I find actually a game with him in
111<00:01:35.220> k<00:01:35.369> over<00:01:35.549> phone<00:01:35.759> life<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.390> 11<00:01:37.460> it's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
111 k over phone life there a 11 it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
111 k over phone life there a 11 it's
almost<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.420> purpose<00:01:39.570> he<00:01:39.900> got<00:01:40.049> 11<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> 15

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
almost like on purpose he got 11 to 15

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
almost like on purpose he got 11 to 15
so<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:42.150> very<00:01:42.390> good<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.899> there

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so I see is not very good but that there

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.190 
so I see is not very good but that there
is<00:01:43.320> plain<00:01:43.560> drop<00:01:44.340> zone<00:01:44.750> that<00:01:45.750> looks<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is plain drop zone that looks like a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.810 
is plain drop zone that looks like a
private<00:01:46.530> match<00:01:46.680> playing<00:01:47.009> joking<00:01:47.369> over<00:01:47.640> there

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
private match playing joking over there

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.460 
private match playing joking over there
but<00:01:48.299> yeah<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.920> his<00:01:49.920> classes<00:01:50.369> uses<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.880> crh<00:01:51.479> ak-74

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
but yeah so his classes uses a crh ak-74
