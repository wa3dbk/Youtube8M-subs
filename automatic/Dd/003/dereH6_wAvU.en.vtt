00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
out as every new Samsung device comes

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.110 
out as every new Samsung device comes
out<00:03:38.660> as<00:03:38.900> from<00:03:39.530> past<00:03:39.739> experiences<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.820> video

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
out as from past experiences the video

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.090 
out as from past experiences the video
recording<00:03:41.600> capabilities<00:03:41.630> were<00:03:42.500> absolutely

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
recording capabilities were absolutely

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.840 
recording capabilities were absolutely
amazing<00:03:43.720> especially<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:44.900> samsung<00:03:45.410> devices

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
amazing especially on samsung devices

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.099 
amazing especially on samsung devices
last<00:03:46.850> but<00:03:46.970> not<00:03:47.060> least<00:03:47.120> let's<00:03:47.450> talk<00:03:47.720> about<00:03:47.870> the

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
last but not least let's talk about the

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.289 
last but not least let's talk about the
software<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:48.829> we<00:03:49.220> all<00:03:49.340> know<00:03:49.549> samsung<00:03:50.000> devices

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
software as we all know samsung devices

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.170 
software as we all know samsung devices
use<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.959> TouchWiz<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.920> as<00:03:52.280> we<00:03:52.730> compare<00:03:53.060> the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
use the TouchWiz and as we compare the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.059 
use the TouchWiz and as we compare the
devices<00:03:53.630> over<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.109> years<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.650> seems<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:55.040> be

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
devices over the years it seems to be

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.920 
devices over the years it seems to be
that<00:03:55.459> Samsung<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.239> heading<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.780> right

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
that Samsung is heading the right

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.229 
that Samsung is heading the right
direction<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:58.190> hopefully<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:58.670> number<00:03:59.000> Alan

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
direction so hopefully this number Alan

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.420 
direction so hopefully this number Alan
Samsung<00:03:59.630> continues<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.290> tone<00:04:00.530> down<00:04:00.560> its<00:04:00.799> skin

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
Samsung continues to tone down its skin

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.349 
Samsung continues to tone down its skin
as<00:04:01.640> it<00:04:02.150> ships<00:04:02.389> with<00:04:02.540> Android<00:04:02.989> 5.0<00:04:03.590> lollipop

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
as it ships with Android 5.0 lollipop

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.490 
as it ships with Android 5.0 lollipop
but<00:04:05.359> aside<00:04:05.569> from<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:05.780> this<00:04:06.049> has<00:04:06.200> just<00:04:06.380> been

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
but aside from that this has just been

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.620 
but aside from that this has just been
my<00:04:06.829> final<00:04:07.190> predictions<00:04:07.730> of<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.000> samsung
