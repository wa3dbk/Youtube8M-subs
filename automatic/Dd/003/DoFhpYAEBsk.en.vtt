characters any more any better than
Jesse<00:02:08.610> did<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.910> I'll<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.060> put<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> link<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.869> the

Jesse did so I'll just put a link to the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.020 
Jesse did so I'll just put a link to the
video<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.730> describes<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.510> and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
video that he describes it in and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.980 
video that he describes it in and
actually<00:02:13.240> at<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.390> very<00:02:13.540> beginning<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.930> the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
actually at the very beginning of the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.570 
actually at the very beginning of the
video<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.440> there's<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.890> few<00:02:15.130> references

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
video and there's a few references

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.280 
video and there's a few references
throughout<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.970> video<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.360> go<00:02:16.750> watch<00:02:17.230> that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
throughout the video so go watch that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.870 
throughout the video so go watch that
and<00:02:17.830> you'll<00:02:18.040> understand<00:02:18.580> who<00:02:18.760> these

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
and you'll understand who these

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.900 
and you'll understand who these
characters<00:02:19.150> are<00:02:19.450> there<00:02:20.380> it's<00:02:20.920> basically<00:02:21.520> a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
characters are there it's basically a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.449 
characters are there it's basically a
parody<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> whole<00:02:22.930> anime<00:02:23.740> Shandra<00:02:24.430> in

parody of the whole anime Shandra in

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.460 
parody of the whole anime Shandra in
general<00:02:27.270> drawing<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.450> wasn't<00:02:28.810> really<00:02:29.050> wasn't

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
general drawing it wasn't really wasn't

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.449 
general drawing it wasn't really wasn't
that<00:02:29.590> hard<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.489> outlined<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.870> an<00:02:32.380> HB<00:02:33.280> pencil

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
that hard I outlined it in an HB pencil

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.710 
that hard I outlined it in an HB pencil
that's<00:02:33.910> what<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.060> used<00:02:34.239> at<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.390> very<00:02:34.600> beginning

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
that's what I used at the very beginning

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.170 
that's what I used at the very beginning
that's<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.470> your<00:02:35.590> regular<00:02:35.709> standard<00:02:36.280> run

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
that's just your regular standard run

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.830 
that's just your regular standard run
the<00:02:37.270> mill<00:02:37.420> pencil<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.970> from<00:02:39.970> there<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.239> erased

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
the mill pencil and from there I erased

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.750 
the mill pencil and from there I erased
all<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.050> lines<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.470> didn't<00:02:41.860> need<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.310> I'll<00:02:42.430> and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
all the lines I didn't need and I'll and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.470 
all the lines I didn't need and I'll and
I<00:02:42.880> darkened<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.170> B<00:02:44.650> or<00:02:44.920> 2b<00:02:45.820> pencil<00:02:46.060> I

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
I darkened it in with a B or 2b pencil I

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.030 
I darkened it in with a B or 2b pencil I
think<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.780> used<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.170> be<00:02:47.530> because<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
think I used it to be because it's a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.340 
think I used it to be because it's a
little<00:02:48.310> darker<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.300> can<00:02:49.480> do<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:49.840> well

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
little darker and you can do this well

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.740 
little darker and you can do this well
you<00:02:50.739> can<00:02:50.920> use<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.700> outlines<00:02:52.090> for<00:02:52.360> these<00:02:52.540> types

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
you can use the outlines for these types

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.530 
you can use the outlines for these types
of<00:02:52.870> drawings<00:02:53.200> because<00:02:53.350> it's<00:02:54.030> anime<00:02:55.030> based<00:02:55.209> or

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
of drawings because it's anime based or

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.320 
of drawings because it's anime based or
cartoon<00:02:55.989> based<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:57.430> most<00:02:57.640> cases<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.300> have

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
cartoon based and in most cases you have

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.030 
cartoon based and in most cases you have
to<00:02:58.569> have<00:02:58.690> these<00:02:58.900> kinds<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.350> outlines<00:02:59.709> but<00:02:59.950> if

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
to have these kinds of outlines but if

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.860 
to have these kinds of outlines but if
it's<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.340> more<00:03:00.550> natural<00:03:01.180> drawing<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.690> more

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
it's a more natural drawing a more

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.840 
it's a more natural drawing a more
realistic<00:03:02.440> drawing<00:03:02.980> you're<00:03:03.489> not<00:03:03.640> going<00:03:03.790> to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
realistic drawing you're not going to

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.670 
realistic drawing you're not going to
want<00:03:04.000> you're<00:03:04.360> going<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.540> want<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.780> try<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.350> stay

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
want you're going to want to try to stay

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.250 
want you're going to want to try to stay
away<00:03:05.920> from<00:03:05.980> these<00:03:06.340> very<00:03:06.670> dark<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.420> very

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.320 

opposing<00:03:11.280> outlines<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.730> picture<00:03:13.209> as<00:03:13.300> a

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
opposing outlines to the picture as a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.370 
opposing outlines to the picture as a
whole<00:03:13.510> because<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.810> really<00:03:13.959> takes<00:03:14.230> your<00:03:14.350> eye

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
whole because it really takes your eye

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.500 
whole because it really takes your eye
away<00:03:14.590> from<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.130> realism<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.390> you're

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
away from the realism of it so you're

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.539 
away from the realism of it so you're
going<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.660> want<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.930> create<00:03:17.530> very<00:03:18.010> subtle

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
going to want to create very subtle

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.810 
going to want to create very subtle
natural<00:03:19.269> outlines<00:03:19.750> through<00:03:20.110> shading<00:03:20.530> or

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
natural outlines through shading or

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.550 
natural outlines through shading or
texturing<00:03:21.820> whatever<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.269> do<00:03:22.560> that's

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
texturing whatever you do that's

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.810 
texturing whatever you do that's
something<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:24.040> still<00:03:24.310> need<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.459> work<00:03:24.610> on

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
something that I still need to work on

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.940 
something that I still need to work on
and<00:03:25.090> I'm<00:03:25.209> working<00:03:25.660> on<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.079> for<00:03:26.560> now<00:03:26.709> you're

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
and I'm working on it but for now you're

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.699 
and I'm working on it but for now you're
looking<00:03:27.310> at<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.570> rather<00:03:28.570> cartoony<00:03:29.200> drawing<00:03:29.500> so

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
looking at a rather cartoony drawing so

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.880 
looking at a rather cartoony drawing so
the<00:03:30.010> outlines<00:03:30.310> are<00:03:30.579> there<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:32.410> person<00:03:32.769> in

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
the outlines are there the person in

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.910 
the outlines are there the person in
front<00:03:32.920> right<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.269> not<00:03:34.630> fujimura<00:03:35.320> pantsu

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
front right there is not fujimura pantsu

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.610 
front right there is not fujimura pantsu
but<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.730> me<00:03:37.090> character<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.230> title<00:03:38.560> I

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
but the me character in the title I

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.250

totalbiscuit TV and that's supposed to

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.170 
totalbiscuit TV and that's supposed to
be<00:04:01.720> his<00:04:01.930> character<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:03.579> know<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:04.060> it's

be his character and I know that it's

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.430 
be his character and I know that it's
not<00:04:04.329> an<00:04:04.630> exactly<00:04:05.290> one<00:04:05.470> hundred<00:04:05.590> percent
