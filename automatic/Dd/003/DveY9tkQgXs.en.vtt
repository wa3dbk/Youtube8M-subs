00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:28.390

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.110
 in spain are already doing this level 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.790
 behind also sometimes also 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.739
 done not because I want to spend 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.390
 will say as it is in real life if 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.010
 they have done a spectacular job they have 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.570
 recovered something that is important not 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.699
 because I see clearly here in Peru the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.080
 we see but travel around the world and in 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.220
 everyone will see how nice it is 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.629
 machu picchu chest of course 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.879
 we need to be proud to have been able to 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.879
 make the location in Peru 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.410
 look where the man who deals posters 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.190
 is selling the truth he liked the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.190
 movie loved 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.430
 I have to recover brother because 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.410
 finally from h 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.240
 problems and equipment increased by 3,000 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.970
 meters to carve in the history of the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.280
 story a very good anecdote when 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.080
 we started to see Tadeo's co -production 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.440
 the original story was based on 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.690
 Mexico 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.120
 and when we decided to enter we was 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.010
 that we change the story to make it 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.290
 because people should go see it because 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.180
 it's a family movie it's not a 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.500
 child movie he likes big me 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.470
 like guys have characters 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.150
 endearing and also that respects very 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.040
 well what is the historical parts of the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.229
 Peru will see us at tadeo the explorer 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.330
 lost and do not miss the power 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.330
 of the film in mind 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.729
 tell me what you liked most 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.530
 children 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.970
 if you like to get conscious 3d if the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.420
 I would recommend until people come to 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.800
 see her 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.790
 and something that you do not like 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.990
 we already had the girl 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.860
 because if she was pretty and had a 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.860
 wedding dress that you like the most
