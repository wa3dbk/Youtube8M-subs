00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.610
 my other issue of the Kapsch Memo Bike is like a video-podcast 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.330
 in the bakery package from Baidu com that must be the money the Cloud 2100 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.969
 one for a netbook 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.329
 the 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.329
 this woman is 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.169
 v 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.989
 he is 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.509
 the pre-project Kurzarbeit will be the pack at Hemberg Sam 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 a few programs that are sought after by the people 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.350
 Pfaff almost 40 percent for that is just so says Fitz 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.090
 forget the 2003 flood 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.010
 what a closer look 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.480
 Budapest 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.750
 this is a leading software and doll 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 and having a few games 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 the surface i here thats mostly 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.390
 the BKA in the committee 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.410
 based 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.440
 Dec seemed a fan I think five pieces of yellow-black Bambi here 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 Blue and so on are also founding 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.360
 and that she is now a rubber Dorsten talent for netbooks 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.890
 should also for statements 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 the criticism was close to nothing 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.750
 Manual aside, students can 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.830
 her name 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.770
 just short and governments 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.520
 we have here 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.650
 a kilo kilogram 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.140
 a vw driver out of gear 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.139
 March via USB 2 4 0 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.609
 the input between head and output for the headphones 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.469
 There we have a partner at your side 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 another fan a sd-card slot 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.669
 who more two USB time 0 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.529
 Ethernet connection 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.519
 no connection sharing the bed 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.299
 and another Kandinsky log 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.079
 I think you can not buy such a trailer without any retroactive effect 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.529
 included 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.599
 which you can fix here and here mixed but can contain 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.009
 Okumus let's just think that now 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.699
 yes a 3-cell battery clock 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.939
 because that should be for about 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.239
 instead of three levels 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.579
 and Petra often have a jacket 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 so the device sells 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.719
 So that's the plate Thut 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.179
 2100 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:11.499
 Here she came a 10 inches 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:12.909
 Scully Med 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.849
 with the case of Bremer hat 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.949
 when spraying 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.259
 Hieber in the bar loudspeaker and young still clarify a lawyer 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.849
 the keyboard 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.520
 should confirm now 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.239
 greater than 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.239
 every other Tarthun Epoque 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.279
 that have been tested 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:37.279
 We saw each other here very often is the credo happy 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.439
 Honors, we still have one here 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.049
 also wait 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.579
 and here 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.579
 BG construction spokesman 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.400
 as we can see, it's one again 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.619
 English is at full speed 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:57.719
 but and the thing buys for pm roughly denounces Euro Fri a little less 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.689
 Art has developed German keyboard when you become the Porsche 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:06.079
 dying okay Cnet 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.079
 on buttons 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.739
 make a Ulsan comparison 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:15.699
 that beg the CPI CEE 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.150
 the 91st 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.430
 a freshman 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.799
 a 9 inches 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.789
 the bigger one 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.050
 You can clearly see differences here 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.520
 because as I said 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.559
 the plates take you that 10 inch display 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:32.620
 Nikci 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.550
 one because another picture 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.319
 Aron most interesting 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.639
 is probably the comparison with the Intel league 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.809
 TTL Toko because the St for disillusionment 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.719
 a 9 inches for your netbook 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.050
 also the Las Matas smaller 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.870
 at Saint 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.999
 a ninth of the black has 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.999
 since we are shopping 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.069
 and there are also the size difference 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.969
 at the keyboard 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.009
 but I also think here if children have no problems 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.699
 and there painting 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.699
 even adults do not have a case 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.469
 Steidle the device ran 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.749
 been 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.819
 Vacano TTN hard to buy with Windows XP I also believe in Twitter and with 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.279
 Ubuntu 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.379
 we have the intellectual here 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:45.379
 All clear gives the processor with 1 06 gigahertz 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.379
 passed on a beer 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:49.969
 a hard disk with 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.249
 up to 2 50 the work I do not know how fit he is Ramos 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.369
 as I said you are 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:57.490
 You can also do that from one 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.360
 Get SSD 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 we have wifi here 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.520
 Has 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.319
 nevertheless it is getting heavier and heavier 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.349
 Windows XP 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.349
 the touchscreen of the reaction friendly 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.619
 have more details 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.029
 but what we notice that does not reflect that 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.300
 especially at the GP offender Northern Lights saw more that the netbook he taught 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.389
 reflects 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.919
 but this display 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.119
 only slightly 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:40.119
 by Georg Kern Steidl 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.919
 take as it looks 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.509
 was here 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.990
 Kainz childminders the ride 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.990
 but we see the problems 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.020
 I will become the Data Cloud 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.669
 2100 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.669
 at most compare with the class field 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.669
 That was the first time 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.280
 until the next Vida podcast
