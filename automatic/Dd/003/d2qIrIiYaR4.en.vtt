00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
and how much I've worked hard at work to

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.180 
and how much I've worked hard at work to
achieve<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.550> rating<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.420> 21<00:00:27.990> years<00:00:28.260> to

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
achieve that rating for 21 years to

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.740 
achieve that rating for 21 years to
achieve<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.730> goal<00:00:29.970> which<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.360> be<00:00:30.510> one

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750

testing we've been sharing a lot of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.890 
testing we've been sharing a lot of
information<00:01:16.880> it's<00:01:17.060> been<00:01:17.210> working<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:17.720> us

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
information it's been working for us

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.870

quite<00:01:18.140> well<00:01:18.320> he's<00:01:18.890> an<00:01:19.009> exceptional<00:01:19.310> driver<00:01:19.759> i

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
quite well he's an exceptional driver i

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.520

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
think you know he's achieved a lot in

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.680 
think you know he's achieved a lot in
the<00:01:21.650> sport<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.610> very<00:01:22.820> short<00:01:22.910> period<00:01:23.210> and

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
the sport in a very short period and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.960 
the sport in a very short period and
he's<00:01:24.590> also<00:01:24.770> had<00:01:24.950> difficult<00:01:25.369> times<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:25.820> i

he's also had difficult times and i

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.940 
he's also had difficult times and i
think<00:01:26.180> that's<00:01:26.360> important<00:01:26.900> for<00:01:27.110> for<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.710> driver

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
think that's important for for a driver

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.460 
think that's important for for a driver
and<00:01:28.130> an<00:01:28.729> individual<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.990> learn<00:01:30.200> from<00:01:30.320> your

and an individual you learn from your
mistakes<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.850> become<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.149> stronger

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
mistakes and you become a stronger

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.200 
mistakes and you become a stronger

because<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.070> don't<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.430> setup<00:02:05.640> work

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
because you don't know this setup work

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.059 
because you don't know this setup work
with<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.659> basic<00:02:06.990> car<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.950> you're

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
with with the basic car and you're

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.770 
with with the basic car and you're
thinking<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.729> quite<00:02:09.000> what<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> want<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
thinking it's not quite what I want and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.290 
thinking it's not quite what I want and
I'm<00:02:10.619> not<00:02:10.830> entirely<00:02:11.130> happy<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.820> then<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.180> put

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
I'm not entirely happy and then you put

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.270 
I'm not entirely happy and then you put
the<00:02:12.390> package<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.560> downforce<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.070> and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the package on and the downforce on and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.800 
the package on and the downforce on and
suddenly<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> car<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.209> stuck<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.660> road

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
suddenly the car is stuck to the road

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.990 
suddenly the car is stuck to the road
and<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.140> feels<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.890> expect<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.489> feel<00:02:17.970> very

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and it feels what you expect I feel very

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.030 
and it feels what you expect I feel very
ready<00:02:18.330> going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.780> Bahrain<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:19.769> we<00:02:19.890> have

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
ready going to Bahrain with what we have

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.340 
ready going to Bahrain with what we have
and<00:02:20.209> there's<00:02:21.209> only<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.540> an<00:02:21.630> area<00:02:21.930> really<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
and there's only is an area really that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.290 
and there's only is an area really that
we're<00:02:22.500> weaken

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.270 

I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:32.290> at<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> beginning<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.860> season<00:02:33.010> yin

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
I think at the beginning the season yin

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.220 
I think at the beginning the season yin
it's<00:02:33.550> not<00:02:33.760> about<00:02:33.970> being<00:02:34.330> confident<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.080> can

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
it's not about being confident you can

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.600 
it's not about being confident you can
take<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.500> championship<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.190> being

confidently<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.180> prepared<00:02:37.480> yourself<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
confidently you prepared yourself in the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.960 
confidently you prepared yourself in the
best<00:02:38.050> way<00:02:38.230> possible<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.770> then<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.760> take<00:02:39.910> your

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
best way possible and then you take your

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:49.020 
best way possible and then you take your
day<00:02:40.180> by<00:02:40.330> day<00:02:40.560> race<00:02:41.560> by<00:02:41.710> race<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.880> really

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
day by day race by race it's really

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.390 
day by day race by race it's really
difficult<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.630> know<00:02:49.780> who's<00:02:49.930> going<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.400> our

I<00:03:06.520> even<00:03:06.880> think<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.090> salvage<00:03:07.420> would<00:03:07.540> be<00:03:07.660> so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
I even think the salvage would be so

I even think the salvage would be so
there's<00:03:07.960> so<00:03:08.140> many<00:03:08.260> cars<00:03:08.590> out<00:03:08.830> there<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.160> I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
there's so many cars out there that I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.460 
there's so many cars out there that I
think<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.550> going<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.700> be<00:03:09.760> at<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.940> front

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
think it's going to be at the front
