 hello to all and fed 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.179
 this quest today we find ourselves 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.910
 for a little tutorial how to play 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.859
 wii games on pc so that's it takes a 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.759
 emulator so an emulator only 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.640
 reproduce your console 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:28.460
 so sorry know how to produce your 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.289
 concept on your computer and so you 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.370
 can play wii games so 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.780
 look at the result 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.040
 this is like the wii but we 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.880
 can not access the menus where we can 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.130
 Judging in the game Well, that's all we get 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.610
 found for a partition my ipod and 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.550
 here we are for the party at home 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.830
 so I have the game the game I'm going nuts 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.660
 and so monster hunter tri and maui so 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.270
 here I am legally 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.900
 we find ourselves here so I'm going 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.280
 take the game first here i'm doing this 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.979
 episode actually at the same time that I 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.729
 do my series so looked at my computer 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.719
 look at tons choice then we have a 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.700
 new computer 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:20.299
 at the moment I put the cd in the cd player 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.460
 here and we meet for the part 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.619
 on my computer 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.729
 and here we are again we find ourselves on 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.979
 here after putting the cd and there we have it 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.439
 so we say what are we doing 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.039
 already you have to create the iso image so with 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.969
 damon jude 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.310
 in fact you do very disk image 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.719
 there it will put your cd player so that 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.340
 I have one so that can not be 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.469
 deceive 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.799
 then no I have the image so mh3 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.840
 monster hunter tri mh3 for the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.310
 destinations of the disk image there you 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.289
 put that creates a directory said 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.329
 now and there you do iso 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.719
 standard normally his image a trick 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.329
 like that 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.630
 cochet but this is iso standard that 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.639
 must tick and all that we do not touch 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.979
 property remove the image in case 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.259
 of error ok so there let you and you 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.000
 get started 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.599
 so that's okay you create your image everything 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.519
 that for me I have not done it myself 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.989
 I got there when it's over 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.030
 you no longer need monster hunter 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.950
 sort you or you open the emulator 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.040
 so dolphin 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.980
 here we go we get opened 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.629
 office you go down you click you 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.739
 take monster hunter sort of it's okay 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.379
 open automatically 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.629
 and so we'll see and here we can 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.750
 play it like it was on a wii 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.310
 it's really excellent look 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.049
 how is it I have already started the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.150
 sorry excuse me here is my part I 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.579
 did not play a lot I played three 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.470
 three o'clock hours on this I know 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.790
 really not much and I want to 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.090
 specify is that slab three hours 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.440
 on this game so that it starts there 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.750
 ring a little focus they make a good 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.030
 processor me I'm doing something with 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.709
 windows movie maker plus all be to 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.150
 I have a good graphic card 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.290
 so it's not my card it's my 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.440
 processor 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.159
 so keep in fact I'm already doing some 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:17.400
 killer stuff to other software so 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:20.470
 in ranks of the moviemaker scion and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.829
 so it's basically not it makes me a little 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.590
 buggy 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.959
 but otherwise it does not bug if you have a 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.109
 i7 normally Haitians who should that 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.419
 not buggy normally since I think 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.359
 that this application is mono trade is 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.760
 so in fact it's hillis a heart I 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:40.750
 think so it's intel processors 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.549
 at the rank of best rendering of the best 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.169
 fluidity since I have a processor 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:49.060
 amd to eight hearts so 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.980
 so basically the apps with who 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.590
 used to make her bar they go 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.989
 much faster than on intel by 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.739
 example I have a friend canine tell him and 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.329
 half a half day to make a 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.150
 rendering cinema that was then that I 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.949
 put 10 minutes maximum 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.019
 I put 10 minutes to make a report 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.940
 it's really extremely fast 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.099
 that was all for the 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.530
 processors so I hope this 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.160
 pretty simple tutorial I find them 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.950
 quite simple you will have liked 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.680
 and so it works with almost every 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.090
 games I think it's just that and if you 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.430
 travel to yes I almost forgot a 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.160
 trick if you want to use a real 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.910
 wii controller you need a bluetooth 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.440
 so basically a pc laptops pc 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.110
 laptops normally they are the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.200
 recent are equipped with bluetooth 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.800
 so you can play on there is a 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.690
 tutorial on the page so on the page 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.830
 dolphin 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:51.110
 look how to play in this is where 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.480
 than download them how to play that's 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.500
 on pc with your joystick me I play 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.780
 on sure with the mouse there is the 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.940
 I remove them there are lyall the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.190
 tutorial mans in english and went away 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.450
 so if you run so that's a lot 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.730
 further how to download it down 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.500
 you go on it you do download 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.170
 and you download your version in 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.030
 done it's very simple there he has in 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.740
 English and in addition they try writing 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.600
 so it's a little further and it's a 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.630
 bit boring so say you can the 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.850
 do it at the same time as you do it 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.760
 here it is but there it is true it a little more 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:34.280
 complete this tutorial it's frankly 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:37.430
 here you have to download the fixie too

 good luck y'a after must know the 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.310
 info button it takes a little 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:58.340
 familiar with the pc keys of the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.169
 mouse and keyboard so it's jeffrey 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.910
 next one a tutorial on 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.010

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.540
 I have the ps1 I could do on the 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.620
