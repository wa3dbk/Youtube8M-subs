00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
like black clips to begin with you know
less<00:01:28.439> noticeable<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.850> yeah<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.270> thought<00:01:30.479> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
less noticeable so yeah I thought this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.410 
less noticeable so yeah I thought this
was<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:30.900> cool<00:01:31.079> idea<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:33.299> know<00:01:33.360> how

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
was really cool idea I don't know how

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
was really cool idea I don't know how
much<00:01:33.509> they're<00:01:33.689> gonna<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.960> available<00:01:34.439> once

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
much they're gonna be available once

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.399 
much they're gonna be available once
they<00:01:34.890> hit<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> stores<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.020> think<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.320> this

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
they hit the stores but I think if this

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
they hit the stores but I think if this
one<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:37.740> 15<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.340> shipping<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.689> made

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
one was 15 with shipping and it's made

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
one was 15 with shipping and it's made

really<00:03:57.130> cool<00:03:57.340> idea<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.019> said<00:03:59.320> there's

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
really cool idea like I said there's

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.470 
really cool idea like I said there's
other<00:03:59.650> styles<00:04:00.100> available<00:04:00.190> chrome<00:04:00.880> ones<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:01.450> I

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
other styles available chrome ones but I

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.830 
other styles available chrome ones but I
went<00:04:01.630> with<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.049> black<00:04:02.260> finish<00:04:02.500> obviously<00:04:03.070> and

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
went with the black finish obviously and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.180 
went with the black finish obviously and
let<00:04:04.840> me<00:04:04.930> see<00:04:05.049> if<00:04:05.140> I<00:04:05.200> get<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.380> better<00:04:05.620> angle<00:04:05.980> this

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
let me see if I get a better angle this

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.000 
let me see if I get a better angle this
for<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:07.079> there<00:04:08.079> you<00:04:08.170> go<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.560> can<00:04:08.709> even<00:04:08.829> have

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
for you there you go you can even have

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.920 
for you there you go you can even have
it<00:04:09.040> hanging<00:04:09.310> out<00:04:09.549> more<00:04:09.760> too<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:10.269> it's<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.570> if

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
it hanging out more too so it's like if

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.300 
it hanging out more too so it's like if
people<00:04:11.290> are<00:04:11.500> thinking<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:11.799> have<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.950> knife<00:04:12.160> you

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
people are thinking you have a knife you

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.920 
people are thinking you have a knife you
can<00:04:12.400> actually<00:04:12.670> pull<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:12.940> out<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.209> this<00:04:13.329> this

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
can actually pull it out to this this

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.610 
can actually pull it out to this this
far

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
far

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.469 
far
and<00:04:14.980> look<00:04:15.340> at<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.459> looks<00:04:15.880> just<00:04:16.000> like<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.209> pin

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
and look at that looks just like a pin

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.710 
and look at that looks just like a pin
pretty<00:04:16.870> cool<00:04:18.299> hopefully<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.329> get<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.510> better

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
pretty cool hopefully I get a better

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.599 
pretty cool hopefully I get a better
angle<00:04:20.049> for<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.380> I'm<00:04:20.470> not<00:04:20.590> too<00:04:20.769> sure<00:04:21.039> let's

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
got a nice weight to it really cool idea

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.610 
got a nice weight to it really cool idea
that<00:04:51.340> I<00:04:51.460> said<00:04:51.640> it's<00:04:51.760> called<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:51.970> city<00:04:52.180> dweller

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
that I said it's called a city dweller

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.660 
that I said it's called a city dweller
you<00:04:53.620> could<00:04:53.740> I<00:04:53.860> could<00:04:54.010> probably<00:04:54.310> wrap<00:04:54.550> it

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
you could I could probably wrap it

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.180 
you could I could probably wrap it
around<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:55.480> you<00:04:55.540> had<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.720> normal<00:04:56.140> pot<00:04:56.740> clip<00:04:57.010> you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
around so you had a normal pot clip you

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
around so you had a normal pot clip you
don't<00:04:57.310> want<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.550> shown<00:04:57.790> you<00:04:57.910> could<00:04:58.030> probably

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
don't want that shown you could probably

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.970 
don't want that shown you could probably
just<00:04:58.510> wrap<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.260> through<00:04:59.440> your<00:04:59.530> clip<00:04:59.770> and

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
just wrap that through your clip and

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.320 
just wrap that through your clip and
then<00:05:00.070> do<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.250> same<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:00.490> have<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.760> Daniel<00:05:01.150> so

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
then do the same and have a Daniel so

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.660 
then do the same and have a Daniel so
it's<00:05:01.810> really<00:05:01.990> cool<00:05:02.290> I'm<00:05:03.010> looking<00:05:03.310> forward<00:05:03.610> to
