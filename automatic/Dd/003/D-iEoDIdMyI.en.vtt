so if you have a web form that's going
to<00:01:53.250> appear<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> time<00:01:54.149> down<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> side

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
to appear all the time down the side

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.459 
to appear all the time down the side
that<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:56.040> an<00:01:56.100> inline<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:57.210> popover<00:01:58.079> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that would be an inline a popover and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.130 
that would be an inline a popover and
that<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.460> simply<00:01:59.640> where<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.479> comes<00:02:00.990> up

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that is simply where it just comes up

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.679 
that is simply where it just comes up
right<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.100> light<00:02:02.610> box<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.509> I

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
right up the light box is the one that I

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
right up the light box is the one that I
use<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.740> blog<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.969> makes<00:02:06.119> everything

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
use on the blog it just makes everything

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.990 
use on the blog it just makes everything
dark<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> background<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> pop

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
dark in the background and then the pop

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
dark in the background and then the pop
up<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> pop-up<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.649> actually<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.190> separate

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
up so the pop-up is actually a separate

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.090 
up so the pop-up is actually a separate
window<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.569> as<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.050> see<00:02:13.080> there<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.620> says

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
window and as you can see there it says

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.060 
window and as you can see there it says
it<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.760> sometimes<00:02:15.300> blocked<00:02:15.720> by<00:02:16.020> browser<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:16.740> I

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
it is sometimes blocked by browser so I

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.590 
it is sometimes blocked by browser so I
tend<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.550> stay<00:02:17.760> away<00:02:17.790> from<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.480> either

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
tend to stay away from that so if either

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.920 
tend to stay away from that so if either
the<00:02:18.990> pop<00:02:19.230> over<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.460> light<00:02:20.700> box<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.420> then

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the pop over or the light box and then

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.750 
the pop over or the light box and then
what<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.830> there's<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.550> couple

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
what you do is there's a couple

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.450 
what you do is there's a couple
different<00:02:24.240> options<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.410> use<00:02:26.100> with

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
different options that you can use with

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.760 
different options that you can use with
the<00:02:26.640> light<00:02:26.820> box<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.440> only

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the light box so you can have it so only

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.180 
the light box so you can have it so only
ever<00:02:29.220> displays<00:02:29.760> once<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.990> each<00:02:31.410> person<00:02:31.830> you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
ever displays once for each person you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.660 
ever displays once for each person you
can<00:02:32.820> have<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.840> appears<00:02:34.410> every<00:02:34.980> certain

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
can have it so it appears every certain

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.210 
can have it so it appears every certain
amount<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.000> days<00:02:36.150> or<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.830> always

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
amount of days or you can have it always

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.850 
amount of days or you can have it always
display<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.360> i<00:02:39.390> choose<00:02:39.630> always<00:02:40.140> display<00:02:40.590> and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
display so i choose always display and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.490 
display so i choose always display and
then<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> delay<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.350> if

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
then you can have a delay so you can if

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.250 
then you can have a delay so you can if
you<00:02:43.620> want<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.040> maybe<00:02:44.430> pop<00:02:44.730> up<00:02:44.970> 30<00:02:45.720> seconds

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
you want it to maybe pop up 30 seconds

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.230 
you want it to maybe pop up 30 seconds
in<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.950> when<00:02:47.160> they're<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.310> your<00:02:47.520> website<00:02:47.970> i

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
in to when they're on your website i

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.100 
in to when they're on your website i
like<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.110> keep<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.440> 10<00:02:50.010> under<00:02:50.880> 15<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
like to keep it 10 under 15 because the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.400 
like to keep it 10 under 15 because the
average<00:02:52.260> attention<00:02:53.070> span<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.910> an<00:02:54.810> internet

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
average attention span of an internet

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.750 
average attention span of an internet
browser<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:56.310> usually<00:02:56.880> about<00:02:57.500> 16<00:02:58.500> seconds<00:02:59.190> so

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
browser is usually about 16 seconds so

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.610 
browser is usually about 16 seconds so
you<00:02:59.820> really<00:03:00.330> want<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> capture<00:03:00.780> them<00:03:01.140> right

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
