channel a seven playful pause but I

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.390 
channel a seven playful pause but I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
thought it would be a good idea to

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.000 
thought it would be a good idea to
upload<00:00:21.670> it<00:00:21.790> to<00:00:21.970> both<00:00:22.090> my<00:00:22.270> main<00:00:22.480> channel<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:23.010> my

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
upload it to both my main channel and my

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.800 
upload it to both my main channel and my
collab<00:00:24.280> channel<00:00:24.640> because<00:00:25.000> I<00:00:25.029> meant<00:00:25.510> to<00:00:25.660> do

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
collab channel because I meant to do

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.740

meet<00:00:26.320> all<00:00:26.410> my<00:00:26.529> pets<00:00:26.760> updated<00:00:27.760> one<00:00:28.029> because

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
meet all my pets updated one because

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.970

family<00:00:30.490> but<00:00:30.670> I<00:00:30.730> also<00:00:31.029> thought<00:00:31.300> it<00:00:31.360> would<00:00:31.509> be<00:00:31.599> a

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
family but I also thought it would be a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.780 
family but I also thought it would be a
good<00:00:31.810> idea<00:00:31.960> just<00:00:32.200> upload<00:00:32.710> this<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.950> both<00:00:33.100> so

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
good idea just upload this to both so

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.010 
good idea just upload this to both so
that's<00:00:34.090> why<00:00:34.330> it's<00:00:34.510> kind<00:00:34.630> of<00:00:34.780> like

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
that's why it's kind of like

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.050 
that's why it's kind of like
multi-purpose<00:00:35.440> video<00:00:36.040> and<00:00:36.400> so<00:00:36.820> if<00:00:36.970> you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.060 
multi-purpose video and so if you

in our old house there was this lady who

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.099 
in our old house there was this lady who
was<00:03:38.160> behind<00:03:38.639> us<00:03:38.790> who<00:03:38.940> was<00:03:39.090> pretty<00:03:39.299> crazy<00:03:39.690> and

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
was behind us who was pretty crazy and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
she really liked cats and dogs and we

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.270 
she really liked cats and dogs and we
think<00:03:43.139> he<00:03:43.440> went<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.680> live<00:03:43.889> with<00:03:43.919> her<00:03:44.129> and

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
think he went to live with her and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.009 
think he went to live with her and
that's<00:03:44.400> what<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.639> like<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.819> believe<00:03:45.030> but<00:03:45.930> we

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
that's what we like to believe but we

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.539 
that's what we like to believe but we
still<00:03:46.139> have<00:03:46.260> Charlie<00:03:46.620> he's<00:03:46.799> very<00:03:46.980> sweet

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
and the reason we didn't get any cats

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.659 
and the reason we didn't get any cats
before<00:03:49.680> him<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.099> reason<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.370> didn't<00:03:50.609> get

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
before him and the reason we didn't get

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:51.949 
before him and the reason we didn't get
in<00:03:50.790> as<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> kitten<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.359> got<00:03:51.510> him<00:03:51.660> when<00:03:51.750> he<00:03:51.780> was

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
in as a kitten we got him when he was

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.970 
in as a kitten we got him when he was
nine<00:03:52.139> years<00:03:52.169> old<00:03:52.609> was<00:03:53.609> um<00:03:54.620> because<00:03:55.620> my<00:03:55.680> mom

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
nine years old was um because my mom

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.650 
nine years old was um because my mom
wanted<00:03:56.220> declawed<00:03:56.549> cats<00:03:56.819> but<00:03:57.000> she<00:03:57.150> wasn't<00:03:57.329> okay

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
wanted declawed cats but she wasn't okay

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.390 
wanted declawed cats but she wasn't okay
with<00:03:57.690> declawed<00:03:58.139> cat<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:58.889> we<00:03:59.040> think<00:03:59.190> it's

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
with declawed cat because we think it's

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.210 
with declawed cat because we think it's
inhumane<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.660> we<00:04:01.560> had<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.769> find<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:01.980> cat<00:04:02.129> that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
was already clogged front and back and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.960
