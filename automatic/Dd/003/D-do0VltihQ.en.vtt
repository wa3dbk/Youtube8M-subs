now<00:01:01.960> these<00:01:02.110> comments<00:01:02.860> have<00:01:02.920> been<00:01:03.040> left<00:01:03.310> over

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
now these comments have been left over

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.249 
now these comments have been left over
and<00:01:03.910> over<00:01:04.180> so<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.360> thought<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.659> would<00:01:04.780> clear<00:01:05.049> up<00:01:05.080> a

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
and over so I thought I would clear up a

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.190 
and over so I thought I would clear up a
few<00:01:05.290> things<00:01:05.500> now<00:01:06.400> if<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.820> do<00:01:07.119> recall<00:01:07.750> back<00:01:07.990> to

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
few things now if you do recall back to

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.230 
few things now if you do recall back to
title<00:01:08.409> update<00:01:08.710> 9<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:08.920> believe<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.520> was<00:01:09.670> when

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
title update 9 I believe it was when

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.870 
title update 9 I believe it was when
they<00:01:10.450> were<00:01:10.510> able<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:11.110> reset<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.920> nether<00:01:12.160> by

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
they were able to reset the nether by

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.000 
they were able to reset the nether by
resetting<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.420> nether<00:01:13.720> would<00:01:14.110> change<00:01:14.680> the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
resetting the nether would change the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.650 
resetting the nether would change the
way<00:01:15.130> when<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.580> entered<00:01:15.910> never<00:01:16.150> knew<00:01:16.420> things

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
way when you entered never knew things

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.780 
way when you entered never knew things
were<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.170> different<00:01:17.380> places<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:18.250> I<00:01:18.520> thought

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
were in different places and I thought

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.550 
were in different places and I thought
that<00:01:18.970> was<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.120> great<00:01:19.450> addition<00:01:19.900> to<00:01:20.020> Minecraft

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
that was a great addition to Minecraft

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.200 
that was a great addition to Minecraft
because<00:01:20.710> you<00:01:21.310> didn't<00:01:21.610> have<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.820> visit<00:01:22.000> the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
because you didn't have to visit the

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.540 
because you didn't have to visit the
nether<00:01:22.420> say<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.350> likes<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.340> nether

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
nether say the likes of the nether

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.640 
nether say the likes of the nether
fortress<00:01:24.640> wasn't<00:01:25.480> there<00:01:25.720> well<00:01:26.050> then<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.500> are

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
fortress wasn't there well then you are

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.160 
fortress wasn't there well then you are
all<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.920> could<00:01:27.070> do<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.340> reset<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:27.820> then

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
all you could do is reset and then

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.480 
all you could do is reset and then
model-t<00:01:29.170> resets<00:01:29.620> and<00:01:29.860> then<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.130> fortress

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
model-t resets and then the fortress

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.980 
model-t resets and then the fortress
would<00:01:30.670> be<00:01:30.760> there<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.510> could<00:01:31.659> carry<00:01:31.870> on

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
would be there and you could carry on

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.170 
would be there and you could carry on
planning<00:01:32.409> your<00:01:32.440> old<00:01:32.770> world<00:01:33.100> now<00:01:33.370> this<00:01:33.850> one<00:01:34.030> and
