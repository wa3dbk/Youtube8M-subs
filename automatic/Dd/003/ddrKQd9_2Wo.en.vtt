00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
I think i'm going to try something

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.900 
I think i'm going to try something
different<00:01:05.449> i<00:01:05.840> think<00:01:06.190> you<00:01:07.190> get<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.340> lot<00:01:07.550> more<00:01:07.580> out

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.249 
different i think you get a lot more out
of<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.060> training<00:01:08.300> here<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.780> think<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
of the training here I think the

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.499 
of the training here I think the
lifestyle<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.040> lot<00:01:10.190> more<00:01:10.460> relaxed<00:01:11.119> here

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
lifestyle is a lot more relaxed here

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.820 
lifestyle is a lot more relaxed here
where<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:11.990> focus<00:01:12.380> on<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.740> little

where I can just focus on the little
things<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:14.300> a<00:01:14.360> great<00:01:14.540> place<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.869> bring

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
while I lay out now three weeks of solid

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:33.280 
while I lay out now three weeks of solid
working<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:32.060> translates<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.690> lot<00:01:32.870> of<00:01:32.990> us<00:01:33.080> are

working this translates a lot of us are

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.430 
working this translates a lot of us are
a<00:01:34.250> very<00:01:35.090> quantitive<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.900> know<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:36.170> have<00:01:36.320> these

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
a very quantitive you know we have these

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.800 
a very quantitive you know we have these
target<00:01:36.979> kilometres<00:01:37.580> reached<00:01:37.970> on<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.390> per

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
target kilometres reached on and per

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.120 
target kilometres reached on and per
week<00:01:39.049> or<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.560> know<00:01:39.650> we<00:01:39.740> want<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.950> get<00:01:40.010> these

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
week or you know we want to get these

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.800 
week or you know we want to get these
targets<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:40.760> weeks<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.299> think<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.690> most

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
targets in weeks I think the most

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.690 
targets in weeks I think the most
important<00:01:42.350> thing<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:42.740> your<00:01:42.770> base<00:01:43.070> phase<00:01:43.369> in

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
important thing in your base phase in

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.280 
important thing in your base phase in
this<00:01:43.820> initial<00:01:44.299> phase<00:01:44.510> especially<00:01:45.140> when

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
this initial phase especially when

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.500 
this initial phase especially when
you're<00:01:45.409> adding<00:01:45.560> heat<00:01:45.830> humidity<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.940> equation

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
you're adding heat humidity the equation

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.830 
you're adding heat humidity the equation
is<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:48.350> need<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.619> very<00:01:48.830> flexible<00:01:49.190> in<00:01:49.840> in

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
is you need to be very flexible in in

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.570 
is you need to be very flexible in in
how<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.170> structure<00:01:51.830> your<00:01:51.860> training<00:01:52.340> so

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
how you structure your training so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.980 
how you structure your training so
people<00:01:52.880> go<00:01:52.970> what<00:01:53.210> are<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.420> doing<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:53.750> week

session and now i can't believe i missed
a<00:02:18.290> session<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.250> be<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.400> end<00:02:19.489> of<00:02:19.550> my

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
a session it's going to be the end of my

a session it's going to be the end of my
day<00:02:19.700> nothing's<00:02:20.150> going<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.330> do<00:02:20.510> right<00:02:20.690> over<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
day nothing's going to do right over the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.809 
day nothing's going to do right over the
years<00:02:21.380> I've<00:02:21.530> realized<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.069> consistent<00:02:22.670> work

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
years I've realized that consistent work

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.240 
years I've realized that consistent work
is<00:02:23.000> what<00:02:23.150> wins<00:02:23.300> races<00:02:23.599> no<00:02:24.200> set<00:02:24.560> amount<00:02:24.980> of

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
is what wins races no set amount of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.250 
is what wins races no set amount of
kilometers<00:02:25.819> or<00:02:26.000> no<00:02:26.150> set<00:02:26.420> amount<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.750> structure

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
kilometers or no set amount of structure

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.470 
kilometers or no set amount of structure
wins<00:02:27.650> races<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.459> being<00:02:28.700> consistent<00:02:29.330> and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
wins races it's being consistent and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.960 
wins races it's being consistent and
there's<00:02:29.599> triathletes<00:02:30.050> were<00:02:30.200> borderline<00:02:30.970> over

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
there's triathletes were borderline over

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.210 
there's triathletes were borderline over
trainers<00:02:32.390> anyway<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:33.680> making<00:02:34.069> sure

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
trainers anyway and so it's making sure

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.759 
trainers anyway and so it's making sure
you<00:02:34.340> stay<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.819> fresh<00:02:35.150> side<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.810> of

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
you stay on the fresh side of of

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.299 
you stay on the fresh side of of
training<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.819> that's<00:02:38.060> key
