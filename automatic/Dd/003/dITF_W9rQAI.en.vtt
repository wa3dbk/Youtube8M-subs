00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.120 
trying a 250 million battery and see how
it<00:00:17.640> flies<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.330> windy<00:00:18.740> probably<00:00:19.740> five<00:00:19.890> mile

an<00:00:20.160> hour<00:00:20.369> something<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.410> I've<00:00:22.410> flown<00:00:22.650> at

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
an hour something like up I've flown at

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.040 
an hour something like up I've flown at
Moore's<00:00:23.119> we<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.330> boned<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> dx7<00:00:25.410> so

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
Moore's we just boned it to the dx7 so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.500 
Moore's we just boned it to the dx7 so
it<00:00:28.050> probably<00:00:28.949> will<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.670> trim<00:00:30.000> but

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
it probably will be out of trim but

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.760 
it probably will be out of trim but
we'll<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> might<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.349> fly<00:00:31.439> great<00:00:33.649> set<00:00:34.649> my

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
we'll see it might just fly great set my

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:44.750 
we'll see it might just fly great set my
timer<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.460> go<00:00:42.469> go<00:00:43.550> don't<00:00:44.550> know

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
see how what the difference is in the

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:51.400 
see how what the difference is in the
flight<00:02:40.260> characteristics

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:59.270

the monster fur and yeah this thing will
fly<00:02:59.430> more<00:02:59.670> than<00:02:59.850> 15<00:03:00.270> minutes<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.900> battery

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
fly more than 15 minutes on this battery

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.920 
fly more than 15 minutes on this battery
that's<00:03:02.300> pretty<00:03:03.300> cool
