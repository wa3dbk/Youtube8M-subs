00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.100
 in this video we will see the declarations of type d while nash with tables 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.670
 in fact they really are 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.600
 in declaring in the table yes as we have seen so far that just look 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.599
 int 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.239
 we have mentioned some variables that all life 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 in tournaments 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.800
 and then if well 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.599
 Japan the earthquake there is no table 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.720
 of 100 whole sometimes that day 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.290
 and in a program like this in this way a table of cemeteries is no longer 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.400
 difficult that is then 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.700
 imagine that a lot of August is set in the light in the entire program 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.860
 the time times is like 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.470
 was very typical in the program and many of them and such 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:55.670
 and what you want is to say well this table of 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.620
 it's as if as the doubted aware to the table of 100 integers is 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.610
 as 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.940
 swim 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.420
 very typical and then hamas and use eta then 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.520
 once you can do it's the next one you take air 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.420
 I did that is sad and sixth fixed housing 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.549
 that top part will somehow be the number one way 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.070
 to do this and 10 in the morning minus two pallets 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.520
 the morning I will go directly to the sixth day we have seen how sasieta de 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 a program with that extensive and space one way is to be here look is like 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.610
 in two steps in fact 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.070
 instead of directly defining a specific table it is required to declare what is 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.060
 called a guy 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.300
 of table 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.300
 and to make those corners filmmaker interest 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.250
 to be followed in English then taek definition 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.480
 chopped up 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.820
 the slow interest 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.030
 type definition 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.010
 and then what is done is we go to masters yesterday is what is fair and what is aligned 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.100
 so why do we go the analogy exactly what is 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.590
 then the type of the squares of the table would come 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.170
 that is defining 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.060
 then the name comes and I will not love numbers in capital letters 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.770
 distinguish it from 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.860
 get out of there 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.240
 and I'm going for the size that is required and the left part 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.739
 it's almost the same 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.469
 that the one that we have above or this is a lot like this is a lot 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.889
 perera significant significant differences 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.319
 I will be 15 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.459
 I am here is what is called a statement 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.319
 iara aráoz teaches the consequences of those declaration of quito 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.900
 with it start a time 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.310
 it really is a declare in a particular variable it's worth I do not know to 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.179
 what do I do in a program and do nothing 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.450
 all he does is tell the compiler to inform him 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.299
 that there is now a new type in the program that I put 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.199
 apart from the fifth dubé throw strike then well apart there is a there was a 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.859
 emotional that is called like numbers 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.789
 I have already defined that I had the name that serves me 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.319
 what interested me is not the name of the new team 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.019
 let's put here name 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.019
 of the new team 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:16.180
 iquique has happened that in the pge this part here from the inta to the sky 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.290
 is that it is the same as the tables I believe it and saw it grow is precise 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.989
 contracting parties 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.450
 but I have is in a program and it just overcomes 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.169
 over the year boards 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.639
 outside the functions put up next to the included new logos what 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.739
 he taught an example 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.459
 for a home and not that out there at any point of the program can be 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:34.999
 A) Yes 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.789
 numbers 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.979
 and for example let's say that three numbers 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.439
 percent and then we also have numbers s 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.999
 and it turns out that now it has to be three this from here 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.109
 these two 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.109
 variables 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.849
 of team 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.180
 for him by analogy with juan since I do char 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.019
 the CD 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.059
 that time 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.059
 these is a variable char team 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.710
 then téllez are variable type numbers and what 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.410
 and what was the number one type since we have defined it here above and the type does not 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.560
 you deserve a table of 100 integers so what happens if I gave you are tables of 100 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.180
 whole 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.550
 Kate was quite healthy I remain implied 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.949
 here is what it means that the one that is a table of ende 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:36.259
 neighbors with which the box efe exists if it is in the box uu 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.809
 and there we can not oppose a 1 to propose a 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:40.890
 - 3 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.860
 nz 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.029
 I am here is possible with the variable t 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:48.679
 and with that the same pull out as much as this one are variables of 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.300
 n 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.819
 they are variables of type numbers that means that they are tables of 100 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.960
 whole each of them two not 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.490
 then with the type definitions what you do a bit is to say good to see 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.330
 I will be in all my program using 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.029
 it was this kind of tables of 100 integers no 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.059
 then you know what he owns can be a guy and when he gets numbers that's 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.800
 avoidable accident two points to art and that are tables recent earthquake 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.460
 the delagation little is in defining a new team that what allows us is 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.319
 to write 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.839
 in it where before we could take the secret summer the guys we had 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.839
 not of temples that you will use we have one of our 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.309
 which we have created is worth 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:31.689
 then to stop to show you an example you will pass it to the Alicante 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.760
 i will not be extraordinary 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.500
 I am going to show him the example he is interested in intesa peralta left 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 it comes as a statement of a table 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.610
 the name of that table 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.620
 in her 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.580
 now there is not a variable but it is a guy that you love me and whipped 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.620
 andahuasi 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.689
 numbers 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.529
 the hell s 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:00.239
 bugle inn to be so recorded it the cinema realizes and I put it 

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:02.009
 blue will keep in mind 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.449
 if I do like this third time 1 1 sd 3 I put a minus 3 years 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.699
 then make it to the third 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:12.759
 i 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.629
 st jose 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.469
 creams that are tables clearly 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.689
 but what saving banesto position could have done nothing I'm here 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.240
 fifteen 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.069
 yes ys 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.679
 but the fact of another way first deserved a type numbers and then it creates 

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:32.089
 Numancia type variables that I will be here 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.889
 n is not necessary as another way 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.360
 that's going very well so as not to be repeating all the time 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.150
 elia the lynx 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.440
 the car you feel osuna one part and the other part is that if you wanted to change the 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.300
 number of 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.589
 that is, the number of boxes in the table 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:51.529
 yes yes I have it from the ams theme but also a site 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.349
 messi other side maradona everywhere 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.830
 ok but it shows us that this compiles well Balearics is simply 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.699
 honda huge interests more crumb 1-3 is not what we expected not 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.449
 but she insists that he 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:05.240
 this defines a new team 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.720
 that allows us to create variables of that type be of the type on the left and then 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.309
 such 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:12.229
 by the high and feces are just 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:15.940
 of equipment numbers that the numbers type is native so telex calls for 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.309
 the recent 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:19.939
 the scene is harder than that is simply 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:25.309
 is this statement fronts the opposite lined up for a little bit will help 

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:29.289
 remember the idle declare tables declare types very easy with the prefix 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.369
 and here they give me the name to variable by him the name of the type
