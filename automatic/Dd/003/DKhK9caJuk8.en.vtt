00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello to all here I am for new 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.779
 video to make you a little nougat 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.360
 miniature so for that I used to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.910
 the white vine and to make the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.779
 small nuggets in quotation marks 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 so the fines 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.669
 I used white and louse for 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.630
 make a color a little more pastel 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.079
 paypal and I covered with dry pastels 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.820
 brown all around the little ball and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.210
 I'll let you watch the tutorial for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.570
 see how I'm going to work this this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.230
 dough 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 so there you have the little balls 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 so see inside it's clear and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.930
 the outline is rather dark because 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.250
 I put dry pastels 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 so here I am going to cut slices 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.910
 clearly and put them on the white 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.030
 so I put a little bit around the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.310
 white square and then once that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.610
 any effect I flatten a little bit for 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.420
 that pasta hangs and that there is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.650
 pu that is more than two difference 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.370
 legs in fact that it does not make 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.909
 that one and then I'm going to come them 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.909
 textures and 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.120
 so that's how you can see the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.620
 two legs merged we'll say this 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:45.330
 which makes that there are more differences 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:48.170
 between the two we will come to do the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.170
 small effects 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.080
 So here is the nougat it's simple 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.820
 it's just that 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.720
 after trying to make the edges a little 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.910
 more square but it's really neat 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.720
 it will be more realistic even 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.280
 I who edges to SÃ©ron therefore said 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.870
 here I hope the little tutorial
