00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.069
 hello everybody i'm ai and vi 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.250
 I want to present our new channel 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.960
 together with me that is health I know well that 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.120
 what we do in this channel 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.210
 well in this channel we do 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.740
 reviews if you can call them that 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 of portable audio systems and not therefore 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 in most cases bluetooth 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.800
 as first ignition 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.519
 you want to do something pretty 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.399
 simple so let's start with the rock box 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.000
 one said also and rock box cube that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.950
 what is rockbox cube bay robox cube is a 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 cube of 5 x 5 x 5 cm and on which it is 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.860
 mounted a driver of 40 mm in diameter is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 supported by bluetooth technology 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.489
 3.0 and beyond that there is the possibility 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 also to connect the cashier directly 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.510
 our phone through the jack la 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.100
 recharge through micro usb and there is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 also the possibility of putting mine 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 voice through this microphone la 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.950
 400 million battery for and guarantees 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.610
 to this small case an autonomy 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.630
 Reproduction average of 6.5 hours 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.400
 output power is 3 watts is 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 available in seven colors 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.979
 different and we decided to 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.280
 buy this black precisely because 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:38.340
 the one that works best anyway 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.360
 let's hear how it turns on 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.930
 and how it works if you feel good or bad 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.689
 one thing though first in the part 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.700
 lower or in the part that is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.189
 will go to support on the ground or on a 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.579
 table preferably via el 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.619
 switch on off and this square of 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.409
 rubber that is really very important 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.229
 because it allows the device to not 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.570
 shake then guarantees to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.450
 reproduction a more pleasant sound more 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.410
 clean so let's turn it on like 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.370
 you have heard 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.520
 to ascension completed to me and put 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.890
 a little sound we are ready to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.130
 connect it to the file ip 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.110
 here is precisely to make a demonstration 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.800
 as you heard at the link 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.430
 bluetooth stability and stability e 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.410
 will put that classic sound back 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.050
 one thing is to be observed that it really is 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.840
 very comfortable in the ipod at the top right 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.830
 it is possible to observe beyond the normal 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.020
 battery pod icon and beyond 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.860
 a blue film indicating the connection 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.720
 bluetooth also another battery too 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.760
 if you don't see well why it's not set 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.370
 fire but between the two icons it is possible 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.420
 catch a glimpse of another battery that is 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.520
 that of the cash register therefore also 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.290
 if we'll be around we'll always be able to 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.340
 check the battery status 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:18.330
 through the bluetooth connection 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 we can leave now you make vi 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.180
 will present the song as it is called 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.730
 me too 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:40.470
 another one bites the dust from the queen 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:43.950
 very famous I know if I get the idea 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.360
 through the phone's microphones e 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.360
 then one of the audio and lights 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.210
 they had only made you feel this 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.440
 small demonstration why 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.420
 by stretching ourselves too far we could run into it 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.230
 in copyright we don't want 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.110
 then touch how you heard the 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.570
 audio quality is not excellent 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.870
 but it is very good the sound above all is 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.340
 very clear and there are no distortions 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.380
 on the scratch card tour 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:28.250
 the only problem is the bass where you just don't 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.740
 understand why being the cube a lot 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.730
 very small note 5 x 5 x 5 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.680
 centimeters 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.740
 lory is the presence of a volume 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 enough to create enough discounts 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.540
 as powerful as it happens in the rock box 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.390
 of which we will make a new review more 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:52.970
 go ahead but let's take care of this for today 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.760
 the volume as I just said is too much 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.100
 small to make you low enough 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:05.180
 powerful and therefore cannot be heard 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:09.250
 the sharp and powerful way you do 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.250
 hear a demonstration for a moment 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.650
 how you feel the leaps there should be 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:34.819
 in this song but do not hear it is 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:39.430
 true that the true that is for such a tax 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:44.569
 small you can not wait too 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:47.090
 everything has to be said so it is to say 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.099
 above all this is the only flaw 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.500
 because really the rest does it 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:54.530
 really great 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.409
 the only flaw is the low is not that 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.259
 lame to why I'm not perfect 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.970
 obviously he is not a dirty person but he does not 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.340
 quite deep 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.470
 that is the only flaw for the rest are 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:13.090
 quite well and we say goodbye to you 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.090
 with another one bites the dust 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.960
 comment numerous and put a nice one 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.580
 thumb up if this video is there 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.580
