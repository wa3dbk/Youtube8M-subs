00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this because I knew that one the second

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
this because I knew that one the second
lap<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.939> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.330> harder<00:00:31.260> away<00:00:31.740> harder

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
lap it's going to be harder away harder

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.080 
lap it's going to be harder away harder
so<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.640> tried<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> keep<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.510> face<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.200> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
where were you at the midway point you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.340 
where were you at the midway point you
know<00:00:40.170> uh<00:00:40.430> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.670> I'm<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.540> only<00:00:42.960> pleased

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
know uh I think I'm so on I only pleased

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.630 
know uh I think I'm so on I only pleased
to<00:00:43.410> remember<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:43.920> six<00:00:44.190> seconds<00:00:44.520> down

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to remember it was six seconds down

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.520 
to remember it was six seconds down
after<00:00:45.030> two<00:00:45.270> kilometers<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> Stars

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
after two kilometers and then the Stars

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
after two kilometers and then the Stars
uphill<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> end<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
uphill and I think like at the end of

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
uphill and I think like at the end of
the<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:48.570> loop<00:00:48.809> i<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.110> already<00:00:49.289> 15<00:00:49.860> seconds

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the first loop i was already 15 seconds

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.319 
the first loop i was already 15 seconds
