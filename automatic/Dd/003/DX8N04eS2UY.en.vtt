a really good result the important thing
that<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:18.110> need<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.290> do<00:01:18.500> first<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.950> make<00:01:18.980> sure<00:01:19.160> we

that we need to do first is make sure we

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
it here you can see the cam chain

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.520 
it here you can see the cam chain
tension<00:02:11.420> up<00:02:11.540> which<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.230> obviously

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
tension up which is obviously

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.410 
tension up which is obviously
hydraulically<00:02:13.160> operated<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.150> one<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
big things obviously which is clearly

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.640 
big things obviously which is clearly
obviously<00:02:17.180> different<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.290> particular

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
obviously different in this particular

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.590 
obviously different in this particular
new<00:02:19.100> Evo<00:02:19.519> 10<00:02:19.790> engine<00:02:20.120> compared<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
new Evo 10 engine compared to the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.470 
new Evo 10 engine compared to the
previous<00:02:21.019> engines<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.920> no<00:02:22.100> longer<00:02:22.310> has<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.910> belt

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
previous engines it no longer has a belt

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.570 
previous engines it no longer has a belt
all<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.080> previous<00:02:24.470> models<00:02:24.830> had<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.070> rubber

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
all the previous models had a rubber

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.820 
all the previous models had a rubber
toothed<00:02:25.970> belt<00:02:26.360> which<00:02:26.810> was<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.320> outside<00:02:27.680> of

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
toothed belt which was on the outside of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.160 
toothed belt which was on the outside of
the<00:02:27.950> engine<00:02:28.250> not<00:02:28.820> within<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.720> engine<00:02:30.019> so

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
the engine not within the engine so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.080 
the engine not within the engine so
there's<00:02:30.380> no<00:02:30.530> oil<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.100> had<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.700> replace

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
there's no oil in it had to replace

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.940 
there's no oil in it had to replace
every<00:02:32.600> four<00:02:32.900> years<00:02:33.200> or<00:02:33.410> approximately

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
every four years or approximately

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.809 
every four years or approximately
hundred<00:02:34.370> thousand<00:02:34.730> kilometres

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
hundred thousand kilometres

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.179 
hundred thousand kilometres
now<00:02:35.999> is<00:02:36.269> no<00:02:36.480> longer<00:02:36.510> needed<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.230> case<00:02:37.469> on<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
now is no longer needed the case on the

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.360 
now is no longer needed the case on the
airboat<00:02:38.400> n<00:02:38.670> it's<00:02:39.239> all<00:02:39.569> internal<00:02:40.349> with<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> chain

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
airboat n it's all internal with a chain

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.610 
airboat n it's all internal with a chain
more<00:02:42.030> direct<00:02:42.329> drive<00:02:42.540> obviously<00:02:43.170> doesn't<00:02:43.499> have

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
more direct drive obviously doesn't have

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.429 
more direct drive obviously doesn't have
to<00:02:43.739> be<00:02:43.859> replaced<00:02:44.159> but<00:02:44.969> it<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.239> very<00:02:45.900> very<00:02:46.139> big

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
to be replaced but it is a very very big

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.280 
to be replaced but it is a very very big
job<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.069> we'll<00:02:47.219> do<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.849> we'll<00:02:48.810> go<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.049> top

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
job so what we'll do is we'll go up top

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.720 
job so what we'll do is we'll go up top
and<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.769> look<00:02:49.920> from<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.129> top<00:02:50.249> of<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> edge

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.860 

okay<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.299> top<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:54.750> engine

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
okay so now at the top of the engine

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.179 
okay so now at the top of the engine
obviously<00:02:55.739> with<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:57.120> airboat<00:02:57.480> n<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:58.379> rip<00:02:59.010> well

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
obviously with the airboat n a rip well

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.319 
obviously with the airboat n a rip well
actually<00:02:59.519> originally<00:02:59.879> had<00:03:00.000> an<00:03:00.120> aluminium

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
actually originally had an aluminium

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.259 
actually originally had an aluminium
rocker<00:03:00.989> cover<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.620> new<00:03:01.950> model<00:03:02.340> fo<00:03:02.939> 10<00:03:03.180> s

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
rocker cover now the new model fo 10 s

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.699 
rocker cover now the new model fo 10 s
got<00:03:03.419> actually<00:03:03.689> a<00:03:03.750> plastic<00:03:04.019> rocker<00:03:04.409> cover

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
got actually a plastic rocker cover

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.959 
got actually a plastic rocker cover
which<00:03:04.859> I<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.099> show<00:03:05.249> you<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.519> picture<00:03:05.669> here

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
which I can show you in a picture here

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.559 
which I can show you in a picture here
from<00:03:06.120> another<00:03:06.269> car<00:03:06.629> these<00:03:07.530> are<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.040> two

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
from another car these are the two

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.149 
from another car these are the two
variable<00:03:09.569> valve<00:03:09.810> control<00:03:10.260> sprockets<00:03:11.010> that

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
variable valve control sprockets that

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.009 
variable valve control sprockets that
attached<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.790> chain<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.599> bottom<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
attached the chain to the bottom of the

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.629 
attached the chain to the bottom of the
crank<00:03:13.260> shop<00:03:13.500> which<00:03:13.680> obviously<00:03:14.010> connects<00:03:14.519> the

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
crank shop which obviously connects the

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.979 
crank shop which obviously connects the

top and bottom of the engine together

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.379 
top and bottom of the engine together
the<00:03:16.859> next<00:03:17.040> step<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.699> physically<00:03:18.150> pull

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
the next step is to physically pull

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.720 
the next step is to physically pull
those<00:03:18.599> camshafts<00:03:19.230> out<00:03:19.530> replace<00:03:20.340> them<00:03:20.609> with

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
those camshafts out replace them with

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.220 
those camshafts out replace them with
the<00:03:20.879> up<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.209> market<00:03:21.569> camshafts

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the up the market camshafts

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.110 
the up the market camshafts
and<00:03:22.349> then<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.859> critical<00:03:23.250> element<00:03:23.669> is<00:03:23.819> putting

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and then the critical element is putting

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.509 
and then the critical element is putting
it<00:03:24.209> back<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.599> dyno<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.500> doing<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.280> custom
