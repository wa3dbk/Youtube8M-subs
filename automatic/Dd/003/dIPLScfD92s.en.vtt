 disney world in orlando florida and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.320
 Of course this is because of the workshow case 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.399

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.250
 perfect restaurant as well as being 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.590
 served breakfast lunch and dinner 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.960
 you can find the most 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.060
 required by the small ones within the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 little mermaid 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.200
 these are just some of the examples of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.420
 disney princesses who are part of the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
 meals from restaurants and can 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 sit take a picture and spend some time 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.210
 with your little princess 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.219
 talking about food in this restaurant 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.719
 have a bit of Norwegian taste then 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.820
 you will find besides food 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.490
 classic american breakfast 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.290
 such as bacon on toast 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.869
 lots of bread and so on. 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.520
 For lunch and dinner you will find 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.390
 many seafood as well as cheeses 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.010
 imported meats and milk 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.200
 Finally a restaurant one day 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.840
 a little more chic but it's very cool 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.610
 now about the price and if as you should 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.470
 imagine is a restaurant a little bit 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.420
 more expensive not only by the experience of 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.920
 meet the princesses you go 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 have a good time there to spend with 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.760
 they would not rush to take a photo 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.410
 that happens in the middle of the park but 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.720
 also because the food is a bit 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.000
 more chic then for the adults you 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.489
 will get a price between 30 and 60 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.470
 dollars per person for the child 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.090
 little - but then you already know more or 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.069
 less what is the value base 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.920
 the second tip is the restaurant that is 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.730
 in the pavilion of germany is the beer garden 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.890
 This is one of my restaurants. 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.420
 favorites not only for German food 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.700
 mixed with a touch of touch 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.459
 but by the complete experience 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.830
 Do you really feel oktoberfest? 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.440
 there is a lot of dancing in munich 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.709
 party music at the restaurant 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.030
 very funny 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.860
 all the people who work in the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.019
 restaurant are obviously German 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.700
 work there says what completes the 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.450
 very cool weather to experience 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.920
 over there 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.170
 This restaurant is also going to enter 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.320
 in that average cost between 30 and 60 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.540
 dollars per person it serves lunch and 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.180
 dinner and have everyone 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.280
 tastes beyond of course the German beer that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.700
 There comes a giant glass like you saw there. 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.700
 on video 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.370
 The third tip is one thing that you only 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.320
 could you find at disney world a 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.500
 end where else could you 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.010
 dinner next to an aquarium with 5.7 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.530
 million gallons of water and 5 thousand 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.770
 fish species the name of the restaurant 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.560
 is corrupt and it stays in the 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.310
 delivery in gray part of the sea of the ego and 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.990
 obviously serves seafood but in this 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.910
 restaurant the best is not 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.020
 specifically the food though 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.880
 she is very good 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.860
 the best of this restaurant is obviously 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.440
 you sit in the place extremely 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.470
 covered by a giant tip aquarium 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.130
 from the floor to the ceiling and stay 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.840
 in that spectacular setting 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.760
 the kids make the adults crazy 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.770
 go crazy and are going to be the best photos 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.870
 that you can take in a restaurant 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.280
 disney about costs this is the restaurant 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.320
 a little bit cheaper then 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.770
 adult meals will stay around 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.910
 $ 15 to $ 30 per person is clear 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.750
 that all these prices that I 'm talking about 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.250
 do not include the rates the fourth tip comes 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.350
 following restaurants 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.740
 extremely popular from disney 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.280
 le le le in the Canadian flag is the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.010
 most popular restaurant in the city and 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.100
 disneyworld and smoking 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.690
 reservations here only at the base of the slap here 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.190
 expensive that the restaurant is very beautiful 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.800
 like everything that is done in disney 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.070
 but the highlights are the 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.750
 food and here is prime beef then 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.300
 If you're looking for a ban it was 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.110
 that steak of fillet mignon sensational to 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.790
 best part of salmon steak chicken or 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.160
 be all that is meat with much sauce 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.350
 barbecue very well served this is the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.360
 place the east food it is 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.520
 simply unbelievable 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.040
 this restaurant is also very famous and 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.190
 Looks the tip here for the soup of 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.580
 Cheddar cheese just looks at this 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.260
 soup gives me that tombini 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.000
 then book your reservation with 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.240
 advance and prepare to spend 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.460
 around $ 60 a head in that 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.830
 restaurant but if you like meat 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.440
 very well prepared very well seasoned 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.330
 you will not regret we came to 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.740
 fifth tip and now for lovers of 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.740
 oriental food like 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.090
 Japanese is the teppan and gift of course 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.069
 this restaurant is in the pavilion of the 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.080
 japan and the cool of this restaurant here 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.270
 it's not just a dinner it's a true 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.250
 show here you will sit with up to eight 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.680
 people so if the group is smaller 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.120
 the tables are eight people you will be 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.740
 sit together with other people if the 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.509
 group is eight or more 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.580
 I will try to lead everyone together and 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:10.740
 you face the boss who does 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.509
 juggle with food and prepare 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.530
 all there in front of you on a grill 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.710

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.060
 efficiency 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.590
 so if you are afraid of knives jumped from 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.050
 your front this is not the restaurant 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.319

 cook in the best possible way is 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.889
 really spectacular price around

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:43.199

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.690
