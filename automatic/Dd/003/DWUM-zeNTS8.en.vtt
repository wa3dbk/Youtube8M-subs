00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
it's wireless actually it's probably the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.750 
it's wireless actually it's probably the
main<00:02:24.980> reason<00:02:25.010> yet<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:27.340> one<00:02:28.340> thing<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.670> was

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
main reason yet and one thing that I was

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.130 
main reason yet and one thing that I was
worried<00:02:28.970> about<00:02:29.030> was<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.420> microphone<00:02:30.019> quality

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
worried about was the microphone quality

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.500 
worried about was the microphone quality
and<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.920> watched<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:31.670> for<00:02:31.819> example<00:02:31.910> linus

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
don't have to have it running outside

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.890 
don't have to have it running outside
like<00:03:04.280> from<00:03:04.519> your<00:03:04.610> PC<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.000> can<00:03:05.060> just<00:03:05.269> put<00:03:05.720> this

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
like from your PC you can just put this

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.800 
like from your PC you can just put this
up<00:03:06.079> it's<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.380> range<00:03:06.620> extender<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:07.489> guess

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
up it's like a range extender I guess

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.390 
up it's like a range extender I guess
you<00:03:08.810> just<00:03:09.019> like<00:03:09.579> hook<00:03:10.579> this<00:03:10.790> up<00:03:12.010> if<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.160> can<00:03:13.310> do

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
you just like hook this up if I can do

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.590 
you just like hook this up if I can do
that<00:03:13.840> boom<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.170> then<00:03:15.920> there's<00:03:16.850> like<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.450> is

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
that boom and then there's like this is

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.210 
that boom and then there's like this is
the<00:03:17.690> thing<00:03:17.810> if<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.019> run<00:03:18.139> out<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.290> battery<00:03:18.709> or

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the thing if you run out of battery or

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.250 
the thing if you run out of battery or
something<00:03:19.579> yeah<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.359> you<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:20.870> plug<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.170> in

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
something yeah and you just plug it in

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.050 
something yeah and you just plug it in
but<00:03:22.040> i<00:03:22.220> believe<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.549> battery<00:03:22.790> life<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:22.940> pretty

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
but i believe the battery life is pretty

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.370 
but i believe the battery life is pretty
good<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:23.329> it's<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.600> like<00:03:23.750> 10<00:03:23.930> hours<00:03:23.959> which<00:03:24.350> is
