way<00:02:05.159> too<00:02:05.219> volatile<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.719> make<00:02:06.990> such<00:02:07.290> bold

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
way too volatile to make such bold

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.830 
way too volatile to make such bold
predictions<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.550> such<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> rosy<00:02:09.390> picture

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
predictions and have such a rosy picture

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.750 
predictions and have such a rosy picture
painted<00:02:10.379> I'm<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:11.069> saying<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.489> all<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.730> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
painted I'm not saying it's all going to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.700 
painted I'm not saying it's all going to
be<00:02:11.819> doom<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.330> gloom

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
be doom and gloom

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.830 
be doom and gloom
either<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.910> know<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> say<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.660> they're

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
either but you know to say that they're

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.200 
either but you know to say that they're
gonna<00:02:14.960> sell<00:02:15.290> like<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.860> know<00:02:15.970> 150<00:02:16.970> million

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
gonna sell like you know 150 million

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.540 
gonna sell like you know 150 million
consoles<00:02:17.780> each<00:02:18.020> I'm<00:02:18.530> exaggerating<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.460> know

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
consoles each I'm exaggerating you know

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.980 
consoles each I'm exaggerating you know
because<00:02:19.730> they<00:02:20.000> said<00:02:20.240> their<00:02:20.390> hundred<00:02:20.690> million

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
because they said their hundred million

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.810 
because they said their hundred million
number<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.320> conservative<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.460> I'm<00:02:22.610> wondering

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
number is conservative so I'm wondering

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.300 
number is conservative so I'm wondering
what<00:02:23.180> they<00:02:23.330> think<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.660> would<00:02:23.780> be<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.310> Amazon

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
what they think it would be if Amazon

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.970 
what they think it would be if Amazon
and<00:02:25.610> Apple<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.710> Nintendo<00:02:27.710> weren't

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
and Apple and Nintendo weren't

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.490 
and Apple and Nintendo weren't
competitors<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.780> know<00:02:29.810> there's<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.290> way

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
competitors you know there's just way

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.470 
competitors you know there's just way
too<00:02:30.530> much<00:02:31.010> but<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> bottom<00:02:31.610> line<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.880> just<00:02:31.910> way

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
too much but the bottom line is just way

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.940 
too much but the bottom line is just way
too<00:02:32.540> much<00:02:32.900> going<00:02:33.110> on<00:02:33.290> right<00:02:33.350> now

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
too much going on right now

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.190 
too much going on right now
with<00:02:34.460> like<00:02:34.790> I've<00:02:34.910> talked<00:02:35.180> about<00:02:35.330> before<00:02:35.450> cloud

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
with like I've talked about before cloud

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.550 
with like I've talked about before cloud
gaming<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.040> how<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.090> industry<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.990> just<00:02:39.020> like

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
gaming and how the industry is just like

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.430 
gaming and how the industry is just like
in<00:02:39.710> this<00:02:39.830> awkward<00:02:40.610> state<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.360> no<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:42.230> knows

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
in this awkward state of no one knows

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.350 
in this awkward state of no one knows
where<00:02:42.710> it's<00:02:42.890> gonna<00:02:43.010> go<00:02:43.280> it's<00:02:43.700> not<00:02:43.880> just<00:02:44.150> me

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
where it's gonna go it's not just me

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.750 
where it's gonna go it's not just me
saying<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.530> it'll<00:02:46.220> be<00:02:46.370> interesting

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
saying this and and it'll be interesting

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.100 
saying this and and it'll be interesting
that<00:02:46.850> maybe<00:02:47.000> they'll<00:02:47.210> be<00:02:47.360> right<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:48.020> know

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
that maybe they'll be right you know

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.990 
that maybe they'll be right you know
maybe<00:02:48.350> I'll<00:02:48.590> be<00:02:48.620> totally<00:02:48.980> wrong<00:02:49.490> in<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.820> whole

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
maybe I'll be totally wrong in the whole

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.150 
maybe I'll be totally wrong in the whole
cloud<00:02:50.360> gaming<00:02:50.840> thing<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.710> won't<00:02:51.950> just
