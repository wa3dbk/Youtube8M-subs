is<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.829> pool<00:02:31.010> forms<00:02:32.019> now<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.829> get

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
is the pool forms now so now we can get

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.400 

yep<00:02:47.000> because<00:02:47.420> we're<00:02:47.780> going<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:47.930> be<00:02:48.019> using<00:02:48.170> our

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
yep because we're going to be using our

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.930 
yep because we're going to be using our
metal<00:02:48.680> break<00:02:48.889> right<00:02:49.310> over<00:02:49.459> here<00:02:49.579> on<00:02:49.670> our<00:02:49.760> bench

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
metal break right over here on our bench

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.030 
metal break right over here on our bench
vise<00:02:50.209> I'm<00:02:50.900> gonna<00:02:51.109> take<00:02:51.290> time<00:02:51.470> now<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:51.889> Wold

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
vise I'm gonna take time now on the Wold

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:01.520 
vise I'm gonna take time now on the Wold
on<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:52.310> tubing<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.750> bottom<00:02:54.250> same<00:02:55.250> way

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.839 

so<00:03:02.530> one<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.859> reasons<00:03:03.189> we've<00:03:03.340> decided<00:03:03.700> to

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
so one of the reasons we've decided to

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.390 
so one of the reasons we've decided to
use<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.269> three-eighths<00:03:04.719> and<00:03:04.870> dry<00:03:05.400> because

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
use this three-eighths and dry because

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.819 
use this three-eighths and dry because
it's<00:03:06.579> easy<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.569> bend<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:08.230> one<00:03:08.379> of<00:03:08.469> these<00:03:08.560> birds

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
it's easy to bend in one of these birds

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.199 
it's easy to bend in one of these birds
without<00:03:09.549> any<00:03:09.819> heat<00:03:10.030> here<00:03:10.659> I'll<00:03:10.750> show<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.019> just

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
before you figure up now this is the

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.030 
before you figure up now this is the
point<00:03:50.630> fall<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.260> when<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.620> can<00:03:51.650> really
