is in with the elbow joint now finally

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.100 
is in with the elbow joint now finally
in<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.860> correct<00:01:10.130> position<00:01:10.610> nomes<00:01:11.270> secured<00:01:11.960> it

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
in the correct position nomes secured it

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.440 
in the correct position nomes secured it
with<00:01:12.380> steel<00:01:12.740> pins<00:01:13.160> come<00:01:13.730> on<00:01:16.120> good<00:01:19.390> now<00:01:20.390> he

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
with steel pins come on good now he

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.840 
with steel pins come on good now he
builds<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.110> scaffold<00:01:21.650> frame<00:01:21.980> to<00:01:22.310> support<00:01:22.460> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
builds a scaffold frame to support the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.680 
builds a scaffold frame to support the
bones<00:01:23.090> as<00:01:23.420> they<00:01:23.450> heal<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.820> wire<00:01:26.000> scaffold

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
bones as they heal the wire scaffold

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.710 
bones as they heal the wire scaffold
frame<00:01:27.050> is<00:01:27.620> really<00:01:28.369> quite<00:01:28.610> an<00:01:28.729> amazing<00:01:28.820> device

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
frame is really quite an amazing device

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.790 
frame is really quite an amazing device
it<00:01:30.820> suspends<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.000> bone<00:01:32.240> within<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.590> wire

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
it suspends the bone within the wire

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.490 
it suspends the bone within the wire
frame<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.450> little<00:01:35.810> bit<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.260> bounce

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
frame and there's a little bit of bounce

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.310 
frame and there's a little bit of bounce
in<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.010> so<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.460> as<00:01:37.610> Jasper<00:01:38.240> grows<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.930> as<00:01:39.050> he

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
in it so that as Jasper grows and as he

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.680 
in it so that as Jasper grows and as he
moves<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.670> bone<00:01:40.960> remodels<00:01:41.960> into<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.440> new<00:01:42.619> elbow

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
moves the bone remodels into a new elbow

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.390 
moves the bone remodels into a new elbow
after<00:01:44.690> six<00:01:45.380> hours<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.729> surgery<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.420> complete

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
after six hours the surgery is complete

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.890 
after six hours the surgery is complete
alright<00:01:49.400> that<00:01:49.729> looks<00:01:49.760> pretty<00:01:50.060> good<00:01:50.270> it's

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
alright that looks pretty good it's

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.440 
alright that looks pretty good it's
getting<00:01:51.110> cleaned<00:01:51.350> off<00:01:51.470> let's<00:01:51.680> go<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.860> x-ray

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
getting cleaned off let's go to x-ray

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.510 
getting cleaned off let's go to x-ray
won't<00:01:53.450> be<00:01:53.600> going<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.470> before<00:01:54.830> Jasper<00:01:55.280> can<00:01:55.430> be

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
won't be going but before Jasper can be

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.940 
won't be going but before Jasper can be
taken<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.000> wards<00:01:56.420> no<00:01:56.990> one<00:01:57.140> needs<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.500> scan

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
taken to the wards no one needs to scan

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.040 
taken to the wards no one needs to scan
the<00:01:58.160> legs<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.670> be<00:01:58.790> certain<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.630> elbow

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
the legs to be certain that the elbow

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.410 
the legs to be certain that the elbow
joints<00:02:00.470> are<00:02:00.620> now<00:02:00.920> correctly<00:02:01.610> aligned

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
joints are now correctly aligned

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.270 
joints are now correctly aligned
I<00:02:02.450> need<00:02:02.720> this<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:03.050> his<00:02:03.230> chest<00:02:03.500> lift<00:02:03.920> temple

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
I need this on his chest lift temple

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.100 
I need this on his chest lift temple
wait<00:02:05.000> let's<00:02:05.180> go<00:02:05.330> other<00:02:05.630> leg

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
wait let's go other leg

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.950 
wait let's go other leg
do<00:02:06.770> it

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.240 

well<00:02:09.960> it's<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.230> perfect<00:02:10.710> but<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:10.980> the<00:02:11.010> best

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
well it's not perfect but it's the best

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.060 
well it's not perfect but it's the best
that<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.490> could<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:12.290> my<00:02:13.290> hope<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.800> be<00:02:13.890> that

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
that I could do my hope would be that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.530 
that I could do my hope would be that
that<00:02:15.000> will<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.300> enough<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:18.120> he<00:02:18.270> should

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that will be enough and that he should

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.320 
that will be enough and that he should
be<00:02:18.720> okay<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.860> elbows<00:02:20.190> as<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.850> they<00:02:21.180> are

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
be okay with the elbows as as they are

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.320 
be okay with the elbows as as they are
but<00:02:21.990> my<00:02:22.170> worry<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.520> is<00:02:23.640> his<00:02:24.030> two

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
but my worry now is that is his two

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.870 
but my worry now is that is his two
bones<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:25.650> make<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:25.890> his<00:02:26.160> forearms<00:02:26.220> are

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
bones that make up his forearms are

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.710 
bones that make up his forearms are
actually<00:02:27.330> growing<00:02:27.600> at<00:02:27.870> different<00:02:28.230> rates
