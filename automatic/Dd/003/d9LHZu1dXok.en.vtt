00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
of top and bond we're going to fill that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
of top and bond we're going to fill that
in<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.230> I've<00:00:34.230> already<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.650> little<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:34.949> of

that's much wetter than we we want for

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.150 
that's much wetter than we we want for
the<00:01:03.000> final<00:01:03.329> consistency<00:01:03.920> but<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.009> going<00:01:05.129> to

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
the final consistency but I'm going to

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.590 
the final consistency but I'm going to
take<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.489> area<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.420> I'm<00:01:06.570> just

area that I'm going to be filling what

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.120 
area that I'm going to be filling what
this<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.789> is<00:01:21.000> give<00:01:21.959> us<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.709> really

this will do is give us a really really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.880 
this will do is give us a really really
good<00:01:23.340> bond<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.360> material<00:01:25.020> contains

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
good bond this material contains

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609 
good bond this material contains
polymers<00:01:26.520> which<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.509> themselves<00:01:27.720> provide<00:01:28.470> an

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
polymers which by themselves provide an

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.370 
polymers which by themselves provide an
excellent<00:01:28.950> bond<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.599> to<00:01:30.690> add<00:01:30.840> more

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
excellent bond now I'm going to add more

bond<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> proper<00:01:34.590> consistency<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:36.030> we're

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
bond to the proper consistency and we're

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.790 
bond to the proper consistency and we're
going<00:01:36.599> to<00:01:36.660> put<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.929> right<00:01:37.050> in<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.679> the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
going to put it right in here with the

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:48.770 
going to put it right in here with the
margin<00:01:38.190> trowel

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.960 

now<00:01:49.780> if<00:01:50.049> you'll<00:01:50.290> notice<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.829> crack<00:01:51.189> that<00:01:51.909> I

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
now if you'll notice this crack that I

that's<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.640> really<00:01:57.789> small<00:01:58.119> crack<00:01:58.450> why<00:01:58.689> bother

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that's a really small crack why bother

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.779 
that's a really small crack why bother
well<00:02:00.430> small<00:02:01.060> cracks<00:02:01.420> become<00:02:01.869> big<00:02:02.110> cracks

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
well small cracks become big cracks

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.070 
well small cracks become big cracks
you'll<00:02:03.789> notice<00:02:04.090> along<00:02:04.330> here<00:02:04.630> I'm<00:02:04.750> running<00:02:04.840> my

you'll notice along here I'm running my

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.330 
you'll notice along here I'm running my
finger<00:02:05.439> through<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.679> little<00:02:05.920> channel<00:02:06.189> here

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
finger through a little channel here

finger through a little channel here
this<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.789> not<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.939> crack<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:07.840> was

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
this is not a crack this was

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.589 
deliberately put in when the concrete
was<00:02:11.380> first<00:02:11.650> poured<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.790> was<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.209> allow

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
was first poured and this was to allow

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.479 
was first poured and this was to allow
for<00:02:14.380> cracking<00:02:15.180> concrete<00:02:16.180> cracks<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> I'm<00:02:18.280> just

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
for cracking concrete cracks so I'm just

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.009 
for cracking concrete cracks so I'm just
running<00:02:18.640> my<00:02:18.910> finger<00:02:19.269> through<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.690> channel

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
running my finger through that channel

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.410 
running my finger through that channel
to<00:02:20.590> keep<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:20.950> channel<00:02:21.430> open<00:02:21.819> we<00:02:22.030> don't<00:02:22.269> want

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
to keep that channel open we don't want

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.870 
to keep that channel open we don't want
to<00:02:22.510> fill<00:02:22.720> overtop<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.500> channel<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.760> was

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
to fill overtop of that channel it was

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.580 
to fill overtop of that channel it was
also<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.239> tiny<00:02:25.540> little<00:02:25.750> crack<00:02:26.080> running<00:02:26.410> through

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
also a tiny little crack running through

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.960 
also a tiny little crack running through
the<00:02:26.680> bottom<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.220> which<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.459> might<00:02:27.790> not

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the bottom of that which you might not

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.120 
the bottom of that which you might not
have<00:02:28.239> been<00:02:28.360> able<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.660> see<00:02:29.019> but<00:02:29.590> by<00:02:29.739> running<00:02:29.890> my

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
have been able to see but by running my

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.130 
have been able to see but by running my
finger<00:02:30.489> along<00:02:30.730> through<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.299> I've<00:02:31.690> pushed

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
finger along through here I've pushed

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.350 
finger along through here I've pushed
the<00:02:32.349> top<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.769> bond<00:02:32.950> down<00:02:33.250> into<00:02:33.849> that<00:02:34.000> crack

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the top and bond down into that crack

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.589 
the top and bond down into that crack
you're<00:02:35.110> not<00:02:35.260> real<00:02:35.470> good<00:02:35.650> with<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.830> trowel

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
you're not real good with a trowel

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.870 
you're not real good with a trowel
itself<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.660> paintbrush<00:02:38.049> this<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.860> an<00:02:39.220> expensive

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
itself a paintbrush this is an expensive

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.250 
itself a paintbrush this is an expensive
cheap<00:02:40.360> paintbrush

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
cheap paintbrush

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.460 
cheap paintbrush
now<00:02:42.220> you've<00:02:42.459> blended<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.180> with<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
now you've blended it in with the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.370 
now you've blended it in with the
existing<00:02:44.920> concrete
