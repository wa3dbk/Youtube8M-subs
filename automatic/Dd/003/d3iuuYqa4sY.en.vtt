00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello everyone I will explain 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.030
 how to change a hydronic receiver 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.040
 on a 2 liter hdi engine 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.620
 so first you have to clear the space 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.030
 superior completely remove the box 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.100
 r 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.470
 so for that we first have a necklace to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 loosen that level then 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 plugs and at the level of the flow m so 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.009
 this pin with a small screwdriver 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.980
 to press 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.620
 system that it maintains by subscripted 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.899
 currency by deported so removed the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.050
 super part of the air box remove 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.430
 the filter remove the bottom part 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 of the box r so we have access now 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.549
 to our hydraulic receiver which is a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.559
 piston that is pushed by a transmitter 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:59.010
 hydraulic that is right behind the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.379
 pedal and so that uses the liquid of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.689
 brakes as fluid 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.789
 so we will already unscrewed that this 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.560
 possibly eclipsed element here 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.750
 to see a little more freedom but this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.050
 is not necessarily necessary so the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 cdu 11 then the hydraulic receiver in 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.700
 himself 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:24.560
 well here it is btr hexagonal hollow 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 we will unlock the deal without problem 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.330
 this is the lower one a superior 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.890
 then we 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.030
 bring you back to man height so 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.470
 we see him there perfectly 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 hydraulic receiver and its piping 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.899
 we prepare 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.990
 here is a piece of cardboard from the sopalin 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.610
 finally and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.670
 we must say the paper towel for so 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 avoid putting this liquid everywhere 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.860
 corrosive Roman attention one has to get 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.340
 wash your hands right after 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.800
 otherwise wear waterproof gloves 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.330
 French 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.350
 you have to be very cautious with 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.830
 the franc liquid that's for the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.170
 gloves so it's just a clip his 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.040
 lifting a centimeter to be able to 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.580
 therefore separate the piping from the transmitter 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.110
 of the receiver here I did the 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.510
 manipulation so here we are ready to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.160
 remove their receivers so as soon as we 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.160
 sells the green by seeing a small flow 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.250
 of the order of 2 3 drops per second 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.770
 because the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.800
 e 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.580
 brake fluid reservoir and time 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.110
 so by gravity it's cool 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.569
 so here is a receiver 9 you have there 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.270
 find you 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:01.180
 the clip c then here the protection so 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.600
 here I am ready to take off my old 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:09.850
 receiver and already remove them so that 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:13.570
 flows slowly so I check that 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.950
 so I have this little soft seal in 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.690
 pipe end so this little joint 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.350
 which is not an O-ring that has a 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.790
 very special form has put me worry 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.880
 because when you take off your 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.000
 receiver and well it must be done 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.720
 attention that does not stay in the void 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.820
 and if you have you got yourself back to 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.980
 the case where you buy a sector 9 and 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.470
 has been confirmed that there are none in the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.050
 name you so 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.110
 should be none at all 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.240
 two otherwise you have problems if 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.950
 you put two without giving it back 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.260
 account you will not get in plug to 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.740
 put the knot udder if you do not put any 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.850
 it'll run away as soon as you start 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.850
 press the pedal 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.870
 so be very careful at this level 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.180
 it can be a problem 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.970
 once one is sure of one's 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.190
 So we put back the new system and 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.920
 we put the club back so we will be interested 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.700
 to the purge now that we put in 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.580
 the rubber 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.900
 we take it off and then have it 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.690
 took a key we bend over to 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.380
 so do not damage because it's 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.370
 100% plastic 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.790
 this screw purge so I'm going to two 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.830
 three laps before starting to open 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.990
 my purge 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.570
 unlike the pure classic game sure 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.160
 let's say the brake calipers there it 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.020
 must turn 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.970
 3 it takes two or three turns before 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.370
 that here we can have the first 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.460
 drops of liquid that flows through 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.980
 gravity the liquid is going to go up 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.740
 go down in the piston is so voila 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.419
 you give up 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.800
 a good package drops to be sure that 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.479
 the purge is well done 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.669
 this is a tip the oreco this purge to 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.199
 do so by putting your receiver on 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.130
 will say upside down and purge in water 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.530
 naturally she will be 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.330
 if you want you can put that's it 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.220
 a system to recover the liquid and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.120
 run more liquid for 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.550
 do a full purge has arrived 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.810
 with liquid 2 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.360
 9 if you add to them 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.410
 the reservoir here is so we complete the 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.320
 progressively to stay level 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.050
 match of course not gauges and the 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.050
 trick so once that's all done 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.860
 properly my bed am happy but 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.380
 the little cap 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.080
 we put back in place but be careful here a 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.230
 spring and it's very stiff 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.540
 so we'll have to go one more 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.260
 little trick so my little tip 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.260
 that's for sure the top element of a 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.400
 smaller diameter obviously coming 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:05.380
 maintain like these the receiving water 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.700
 so what helps to strongly press on this 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.880
 that it's still pretty resident 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.740
 it's a spring inside on the 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.500
 receiver head for a momentum that is 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.630
 in 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.790
 the 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.930
 here is the move the clutch fork 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.780
 so we keep as 100 positions 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.120
 higher and after we can life it's 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.610
 just so we 'll take off board 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.300
 we serve it blocks and its ranks we put back 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.659
 in position this 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.509
 this element maintaining the piping on 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:42.280
 check so that's where we're doing 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:44.050
 a point on his max level we put a 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.960
 clean cardboard under the car 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.699
 we will pump a good dozen times 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.680
 and in addition it will allow the 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:54.060
 receivers to put themselves in good 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.870
 position we will say for a clutch 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:03.169
 standard that is to say about 2 cm 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:05.689
 of the pedal fund we check that 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.449
 there are not two drops on the cardboard 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:11.569
 so no cop has run out so 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:18.159
 this is the case and well here we go back 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:18.159
 completely the reed box 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.950
 m and then we do a test drive on 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.170
 stop the car again on the 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:31.080
 cardboard and then we redid a 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.540
 checking the next day I hope that 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.860
 this tutorial will be useful 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.860
 thank you for your attention
