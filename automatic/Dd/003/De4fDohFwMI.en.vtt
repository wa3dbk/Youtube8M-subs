00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.039 
coverage it's more light to medium but I
have<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.260> stop<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.829> can't<00:03:19.400> do<00:03:19.610> no<00:03:19.880> more<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.569> this

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
have to stop I can't do no more so this

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.110 
have to stop I can't do no more so this
was<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.560> darker<00:03:21.890> shade<00:03:22.099> which<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.430> chestnut

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
was the darker shade which is chestnut

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.630 
was the darker shade which is chestnut
so<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.230> they<00:03:24.470> don't<00:03:24.709> have<00:03:24.860> nothing<00:03:25.040> darkening

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
so if they don't have nothing darkening

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.670 
so if they don't have nothing darkening
this<00:03:25.849> then<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.420> would<00:03:26.600> never<00:03:26.810> purchase<00:03:27.350> another
