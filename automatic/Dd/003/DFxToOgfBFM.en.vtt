00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
brand that really took us forward I'm

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.470 
brand that really took us forward I'm
always<00:00:41.830> a<00:00:41.950> big<00:00:42.190> advocate<00:00:42.400> of<00:00:42.700> change<00:00:42.790> I<00:00:43.270> think

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
always a big advocate of change I think

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.660 
always a big advocate of change I think
it's<00:00:43.600> not<00:00:43.750> only<00:00:44.020> reinventing<00:00:44.650> myself<00:00:44.860> but

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
it's not only reinventing myself but

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.400 
it's not only reinventing myself but
also<00:00:45.700> taking<00:00:46.270> a<00:00:46.300> look<00:00:46.450> at<00:00:46.570> the<00:00:46.630> company<00:00:47.080> change

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
also taking a look at the company change

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.320 
also taking a look at the company change
is<00:00:47.590> good<00:00:47.620> because<00:00:48.130> change<00:00:48.640> means<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.210> you're

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
is good because change means that you're

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.780 
is good because change means that you're
moving<00:00:49.600> forward<00:00:50.080> I<00:00:50.440> want<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.370> be<00:00:51.490> able<00:00:51.640> to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
moving forward I want it to be able to

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.000 
moving forward I want it to be able to
change<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.360> logo<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.620> it's<00:00:53.740> going<00:00:53.830> to<00:00:53.890> be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
change the logo so that it's going to be

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.880 
change the logo so that it's going to be
a<00:00:54.040> fresh<00:00:54.430> contemporary<00:00:55.090> very<00:00:56.050> very<00:00:56.230> new<00:00:56.500> look

kind of analyzing that and doing some

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.289 
kind of analyzing that and doing some
research<00:01:05.590> it<00:01:06.280> really<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:06.759> collaborative

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
cookie lee 48 half years now and so I

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.749 
cookie lee 48 half years now and so I
knew<00:01:17.109> that<00:01:17.439> she<00:01:17.950> was<00:01:18.100> looking<00:01:18.219> for<00:01:18.579> something

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759

that<00:01:18.969> was<00:01:19.060> clean<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.869> modern<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:21.130> think<00:01:21.460> we

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
that was clean and modern I think we

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.160 
that was clean and modern I think we
might<00:01:21.759> have<00:01:21.909> gone<00:01:22.060> for<00:01:22.329> about<00:01:22.450> 20<00:01:23.020> different

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
might have gone for about 20 different

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.380 
might have gone for about 20 different
type<00:01:23.530> treatments<00:01:24.039> before<00:01:24.219> we<00:01:24.579> zoned<00:01:24.999> in<00:01:25.210> on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.730 
the final logo I think what we came out
was<00:01:27.729> really<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.329> best<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.960> most<00:01:29.079> exciting

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740
