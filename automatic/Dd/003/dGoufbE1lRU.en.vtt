have<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.710> say<00:02:10.950> i<00:02:11.310> really<00:02:11.580> think<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.390> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
have to say i really think that this is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.170 
have to say i really think that this is
managed<00:02:12.930> by<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.470> time<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.550> mean<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.850> really

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
managed by the time I mean I really

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.610 
managed by the time I mean I really
think<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.540> he's<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:15.930> going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.290> go<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
think that he's just going to go in the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.310 
think that he's just going to go in the
ring<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:18.150> let<00:02:18.360> everybody<00:02:18.570> know<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
ring and just let everybody know you

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.010 
ring and just let everybody know you
know<00:02:19.440> who<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.310> best<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.880> really<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.630> I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
know who is the best but I really I I

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.720 
know who is the best but I really I I
think<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.650> looking<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.070> him<00:02:23.220> he's<00:02:23.459> just<00:02:23.610> very

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
think so looking at him he's just very

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.840 
think so looking at him he's just very
strong<00:02:24.209> really<00:02:24.600> into<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:26.310> think<00:02:26.550> it's

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
strong really into it and I think it's

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.130 
strong really into it and I think it's
going<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.209> really<00:02:27.450> good<00:02:27.720> match<00:02:27.930> either

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
going to be a really good match either

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.110 
going to be a really good match either
way<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:28.440> any<00:02:29.220> round<00:02:29.490> prediction<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:29.910> I'll

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
way but any round prediction that I'll

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.660 
way but any round prediction that I'll
