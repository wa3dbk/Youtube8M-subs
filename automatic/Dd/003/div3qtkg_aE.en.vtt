and<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> pulls<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.199> whole<00:01:01.410> fly

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and when we do this it pulls a whole fly

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.020 
and when we do this it pulls a whole fly
sheet<00:01:01.949> against<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> frame<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> tent

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
every guy line a guy lane retainer so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.130 
every guy line a guy lane retainer so
when<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.030> comes<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.329> packing<00:01:18.509> down<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.930> tent

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
when it comes to packing down the tent

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.719
