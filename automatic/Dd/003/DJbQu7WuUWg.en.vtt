00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
with you take and split the front half

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.440 
with you take and split the front half
of<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.290> board<00:02:46.300> like<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:49.090> these<00:02:50.090> black

separate from the tops of the skateboard
and<00:03:04.970> they<00:03:05.480> make<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.660> real<00:03:05.960> good-looking<00:03:06.470> little

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.190 
legs flip down to the outside and these
will<00:03:17.240> become<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.570> arms<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.500> combiner

we go he's standing now and now this is

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.110 
we go he's standing now and now this is
the<00:03:45.050> laziest<00:03:45.580> transformation<00:03:46.580> I've<00:03:46.730> ever

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
the laziest transformation I've ever

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.670 
the laziest transformation I've ever
ever<00:03:47.540> ever<00:03:48.470> seen<00:03:49.340> on<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.210> transformer<00:03:51.340> okay

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
ever ever seen on a transformer okay

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.119 
ever ever seen on a transformer okay
you<00:03:54.370> take<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:55.030> these<00:03:55.780> little<00:03:56.109> props<00:03:56.620> on<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
you take in these little props on the

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.000 
you take in these little props on the
back<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:58.150> pull<00:03:58.390> them<00:03:58.629> straight<00:03:59.349> down<00:03:59.590> but<00:03:59.859> not

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
back you pull them straight down but not

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.089 
back you pull them straight down but not
so<00:04:00.219> hard<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:00.730> pop<00:04:00.969> his<00:04:01.629> feet<00:04:02.019> off<00:04:02.230> pull

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
so hard that you pop his feet off pull

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.280 
so hard that you pop his feet off pull
them<00:04:03.219> straight<00:04:03.549> down<00:04:06.659> rotate<00:04:07.659> them<00:04:08.170> around

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
them straight down rotate them around

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.039 
them straight down rotate them around
like<00:04:09.069> so<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.790> his<00:04:09.939> toes<00:04:10.209> face<00:04:10.540> forward

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
like so so that his toes face forward

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.979 
like so so that his toes face forward
and<00:04:11.579> then<00:04:12.579> split<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.359> front<00:04:13.719> of<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
and then split the front of the

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.229 
and then split the front of the
hovercraft<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:15.819> is<00:04:16.090> his<00:04:16.660> entire

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
hovercraft and that is his entire

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.320 
hovercraft and that is his entire
transformation<00:04:19.500> three<00:04:20.500> steps<00:04:20.910> get<00:04:21.910> them<00:04:22.150> out

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
transformation three steps get them out

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.090 
transformation three steps get them out
of<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.449> way

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.930 

and<00:04:25.280> here<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.000> have<00:04:26.360> sure<00:04:26.990> shock<00:04:27.940> again

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
and here we have sure shock again

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.490 
and here we have sure shock again
Energon<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.900> Armada<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:32.570> transform<00:04:33.320> him<00:04:33.560> into

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
Energon and Armada to transform him into

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.980 
Energon and Armada to transform him into
his<00:04:36.500> robot<00:04:36.920> mode<00:04:36.950> not<00:04:37.490> you<00:04:37.670> split<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.630> front

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
his robot mode not you split the front

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:47.440 
his robot mode not you split the front
half<00:04:39.230> apart<00:04:40.190> like<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:44.830> see<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:47.300> is

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
half apart like that and see and that is

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.640 
half apart like that and see and that is
it<00:04:47.690> he<00:04:47.990> is<00:04:48.790> transformed<00:04:49.790> at<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.090> point<00:04:50.450> so<00:04:51.380> if

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
it he is transformed at that point so if

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.190 
it he is transformed at that point so if
you<00:04:51.770> consider<00:04:51.980> splitting<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.910> folding<00:04:53.600> two

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
you consider splitting and folding two

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.140 
you consider splitting and folding two
steps<00:04:54.590> for<00:04:55.100> his<00:04:55.190> transformation<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:56.000> this

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
steps for his transformation and this

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.500 
steps for his transformation and this
guy<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.390> weak<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:58.070> didn't<00:04:58.940> like<00:04:59.180> the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
guy is weak this is I didn't like the

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.620 
guy is weak this is I didn't like the
high<00:05:00.170> wire<00:05:00.410> but<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:00.860> guy<00:05:01.040> is<00:05:01.070> worse<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.820> here

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
high wire but this guy is worse in here

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.340 
high wire but this guy is worse in here
is<00:05:03.580> Energon<00:05:04.580> sure<00:05:04.790> shock<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.690> start<00:05:05.960> off<00:05:06.080> by

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
is Energon sure shock you start off by

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.490 
is Energon sure shock you start off by
taking<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:06.920> flipping<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:08.390> back<00:05:08.900> tires<00:05:09.230> out
