00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello very good to quart history with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.970
 these today I wanted to show you one of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.470
 them who died another day that is how 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.170
 make an incubator for these stops 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.480
 African cichlids a summit I think that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.130
 is in good English without the need of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 insulator these are the materials a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 glass of these of the vinillo of what 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.990
 be these glass kids 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.609
 then a chicken paste and a slice 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.769
 of average of these old but that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.820
 nor is it too rough for it not to be 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.810
 the eggs come out 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.000
 and now it's going to proceed to the assembly 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.060
 to start riding it we take the glass 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.030
 and good we take the female and we end 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.010
 in the glass to be eggs it is very easy 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 to take them out because you're going to open it fall 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.180
 by its own weight we make sure that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.890
 there is none left and well the glass has 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.660
 to be full of water obviously 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.540
 then we take the fabric from the stocking and 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.840
 we hold it strong with the rubber to the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.930
 We paste a few lacito 2 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.820
 as well as those of the cards and nothing is 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.159
 we put on 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.150
 and that the fabric is tight 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.550
 against less wrinkles have better 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.980
 making sure that it will not be released 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.050
 why 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.030
 the brown liamos 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.170
 it's worth then once we have it here 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 now let's see how it works in the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.180
 Aquarius 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.860
 very good so here we have the aquarium and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.940
 now let's see how the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.200
 pothole look here we see there the 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.850
 eggs that the water circulates 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.880
 perfectly and oxygenates in what is it 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.700
 what good is what the function that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.509
 does the mother's mouth then here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.520
 we have the filter flute output and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.970
 we put it a little vertical so that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.500
 between water but not much in a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.970
 through the mesh 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.190
 well diagonally 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.950
 and that makes it stir and 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.640
 good and there we have them and well this at 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.610
 already a few days will already be formed 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.200
 all the fry are already out of 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.360
 here we put them in a normal paridera 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 and current or in an aquarium that we have 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 breeding is already and this is the mode of 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.410
 do it without good aerator the way that 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.410
 has invented until then
