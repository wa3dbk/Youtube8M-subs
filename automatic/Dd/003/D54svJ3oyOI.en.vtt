00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.859
 hello to all these sharks we get 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.760
 found for a new video on gta 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.129
 we are today 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.039
 it's a first video on the series 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.019
 visit their swinton so the first 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.789
 video is to go see the lienne 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.230
 so if you do not know where the line is going 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.050
 find it's very simple actually it's 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.019
 found under the bridge that passes over 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.570
 from the river we will go there all 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.829
 then we will go see the liana and I 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.899
 leave you all this in comment with 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.760
 soul reaver that helped me go to 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.550
 northampton and with whom we were well 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.900
 laughing while visiting all this on this month I 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.100
 you say good viewing and especially 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.870
 do not forget that if you have 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.400
 tips or tutorials to email sent by 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.780
 email and I will be happy to 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.640
 show on video 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:57.500
 not to break the cargo bob bazaar cat 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.080
 I am equipped for the season there I 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.290
 think what they do the cheapest 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:12.710
 in shirt 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:14.390
 yeah if we jump when it applies and 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.920
 that it's funny because I've never 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.310
 planned to make a video to come on the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.659
 see in the prologue and it annoyed me 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.680
 in fact of just reverses the prologue for 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.620
 that ah it really allows me to see it 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.330
 it's cool is really a dirty mouth 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.430
 still, but still 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.380
 and for that still sure that they had to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.430
 engage say it they had to hide it 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:47.479
 another tense in cash and the other in 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:50.060
 in the capital a possible blow I 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.500
 ask which way to go or the same roof recoil 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.500
 so the geipan of which two out of eight 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.060
 Normally you could have my number 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.819
 and so for that I think they endure 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.860
 years hidden in the map the original because 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.220
 that if they put it there is that there is 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.599
 something 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.489
 the thing is, I wonder too 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.410
 how anyone could 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.819
 find out what she is what idea do you 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.319
 may have to leave the road ropes 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.879
 when you do the first mission it's 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.420
 that's pretty crazy 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.610
 why is he a rockstar guy 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:32.769
 she saw a guy see well at this time 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:36.120
 that's where we see what on the map 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.120
 because we see nothing in the ocean
