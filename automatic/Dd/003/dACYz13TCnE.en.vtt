00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 herself xanax stuff and this video 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.899
 on a in cloning 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.690
 I must tell you that as a child I was one 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.480
 great fan of scifi moment of 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.370
 sound I grew up with stargate one 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.289
 of the first adult books for the east is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.240
 was precisely the lemon of stargate and in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.609
 beach the fifth element how much 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.119
 nature wanted to understand what has grown 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.920
 with jason on the edge of reality in 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.599
 Italian who still loves today 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.609
 I think it's one of the most popular TV series 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.170
 beautiful never made for the first day 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.790
 I am interested in food 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.110
 school with hair like the princess 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.850
 leia and obviously then to cloning 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.700
 I loved a yen in looks like it was 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.140
 finally a woman going there 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 strafiga in his underwear and managed to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.260
 kill all the aliens black wings 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.000
 nation I saw him at the elementary even though 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.739
 I did not theoretically because it was 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.530
 forbidden to believe children under 12 years 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.020
 but I saw him at the cinema, I owe you 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.140
 say in my opinion the saga of alien is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.530
 very very beautiful and I don't mean 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 at the meeting predator run a little but 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.080
 no there is a lot of power because it sees all the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.170
 characters that are good that helps that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.350
 they are always women and the cloning is alien 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.479
 and she mother of the intense monster as a lady 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 gaga at gunpoint and at this seed 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 maternal conflict between the muzzle the col 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.500
 obviously the first few years are the best 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.390
 but even this is not to be thrown away 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 we see all actors we see trouble one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.189
 a beautiful and scenic raid is a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.780
 cool I think I love movies 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.799
 set in space and the spaceships 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 spatial 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.180
 but if those shuttles are a crap 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.990
 riders with all this is simple 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.659
 I think it's fantastic alien is a lot 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.960
 also a bit got with a setting 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.250
 indeed know that clothes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.860
 the people who have the new rock 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.130
 indeed it is very beautiful for this is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.479
 maybe I'm a little emotionally involved 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.520
 to say it 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.780
 but now because obviously it's not 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 up to the previous three though 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.090
 seen as we are used to advice and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.330
 embarrassing like the prequel trilogy 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.850
 of star wars that he can look at himself not 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.430
 the levels of halimi are to be thrown down 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.060
 versus predator that predator 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.070
 it will be said no no the plot there is little to do 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.420
 in conclusion 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.970
 I find these people find there and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.870
 they want to crown the fantastic 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.180
 sigourney weaver who made me as a child 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.730
 so scared the scene in which she sees 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.100
 his clones, however, is absolutely 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.959
 fantastic for how ford is not that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.400
 we are here talking about shots 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.730
 blog because roma is a film that has a 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.819
 science fiction thriller and so it's not that 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.950
 that is the point, however, from many 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.709
 other aspects sure yes you liked it 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.900
 this ran to see the others 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.000
 first yes I tell you in my opinion the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.690
 lights and set design are an idea 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.690
 absurd
