the middle I workflow just thought I'd

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.000 
the middle I workflow just thought I'd
give<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.550> little<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:48.390> shot<00:00:48.860> this<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
give you a little little shot this is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.110 
give you a little little shot this is
what<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> looked<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.430> straight<00:00:50.940> out<00:00:51.059> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
what it looked like straight out of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
what it looked like straight out of
photomatix<00:00:53.449> mildly<00:00:54.449> tonemapped<00:00:54.840> nothing

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
photomatix mildly tonemapped nothing

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
photomatix mildly tonemapped nothing
outrageous<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.760> i<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.449> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
outrageous because i like to do all that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200 
outrageous because i like to do all that
stuff<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.960> Photoshop<00:00:58.640> just<00:00:59.640> enough<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.059> me

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
stuff in Photoshop just enough to get me

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.200 
stuff in Photoshop just enough to get me
you<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.379> next<00:01:01.559> level<00:01:01.969> so<00:01:02.969> I'm<00:01:03.090> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
you know to that next level so I'm in

you know to that next level so I'm in
the<00:01:03.270> middle<00:01:03.390> my<00:01:03.539> post<00:01:03.719> processing<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the middle my post processing and I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.929 
the middle my post processing and I
realize<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.159> need<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:05.549> noise<00:01:05.729> reduction

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
realize I need some noise reduction

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.240 
realize I need some noise reduction
because<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.540> i<00:01:06.570> zoom<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.080> BAM<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:08.070> some

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
because when i zoom in BAM I got some

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.219 
because when i zoom in BAM I got some
noise<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.080> ahead<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
noise right so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
noise right so I'm going to go ahead and
use<00:01:10.409> topaz<00:01:10.860> denoise<00:01:11.400> 5<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.520> preferred

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
use topaz denoise 5 that is my preferred

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.970 
use topaz denoise 5 that is my preferred
method<00:01:14.939> for<00:01:15.299> noise<00:01:15.659> reduction

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.020 

alright<00:01:22.730> so<00:01:24.370> there<00:01:25.370> are<00:01:25.460> all<00:01:25.550> these<00:01:25.700> settings

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
alright so there are all these settings

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.430 
alright so there are all these settings
on<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.240> left<00:01:26.450> hand<00:01:26.570> side<00:01:26.660> these<00:01:26.930> presets<00:01:27.320> are

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
on the left hand side these presets are

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
on the left hand side these presets are
actually<00:01:27.680> really<00:01:27.800> great<00:01:28.070> for<00:01:28.220> noise

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
actually really great for noise

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.210 
actually really great for noise
reduction<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:29.060> prefer<00:01:29.450> jpg<00:01:30.260> moderate<00:01:30.740> even<00:01:31.100> if

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
reduction I prefer jpg moderate even if

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.130 
reduction I prefer jpg moderate even if
I'm<00:01:31.340> working<00:01:31.610> with<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.820> raw<00:01:31.970> image<00:01:32.360> or<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.630> tiff

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
I'm working with the raw image or a tiff

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.610 
I'm working with the raw image or a tiff
file<00:01:33.610> sometimes<00:01:34.610> I'll<00:01:34.760> do<00:01:34.940> JPEGs<00:01:35.450> strong<00:01:35.840> but

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
file sometimes I'll do JPEGs strong but

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.140 
file sometimes I'll do JPEGs strong but
sometimes<00:01:36.980> it's<00:01:37.160> too<00:01:37.340> strong<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.940> image

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
sometimes it's too strong for the image

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.550 
sometimes it's too strong for the image
i'm<00:01:38.300> working<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:38.960> i<00:01:39.020> start<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.380> lose

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
i'm working on and i start to lose

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.510 
i'm working on and i start to lose
detail<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:41.540> can<00:01:41.660> see<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:42.250> topes<00:01:43.250> does<00:01:43.490> a

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
detail you can see that topes does a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.310 
detail you can see that topes does a
great<00:01:43.760> job<00:01:43.790> though<00:01:44.180> of<00:01:44.420> handling<00:01:44.960> noise

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
great job though of handling noise

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.620 
great job though of handling noise
without<00:01:48.910> destroying<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.030> detail<00:01:50.450> within

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
without destroying the detail within

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.390 
without destroying the detail within
your<00:01:50.810> image<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:51.260> I'm<00:01:51.500> going<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.680> go<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.070> go

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
your image so I'm going to go and go

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.670 
your image so I'm going to go and go
with<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.640> JPEG<00:01:53.360> moderate<00:01:53.810> because<00:01:54.170> it's<00:01:54.320> not<00:01:54.470> as

let's<00:02:01.670> run<00:02:01.850> through<00:02:01.970> this<00:02:02.060> process<00:02:02.270> that

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
let's run through this process that

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.930 
let's run through this process that
there<00:02:03.650> are<00:02:03.770> many<00:02:03.980> different<00:02:04.610> ways<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.910> you

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
there are many different ways that you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.020 
there are many different ways that you
can<00:02:05.180> do<00:02:05.330> your<00:02:05.480> noise<00:02:05.720> reduction<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.030> I've

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
can do your noise reduction and I've

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.870 
can do your noise reduction and I've
used<00:02:08.690> several<00:02:08.960> ways<00:02:09.230> to<00:02:09.680> reduce<00:02:09.800> noise<00:02:10.130> in<00:02:10.520> HDR

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
used several ways to reduce noise in HDR

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.940 
used several ways to reduce noise in HDR
especially<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.960> high<00:02:12.140> dynamic<00:02:12.350> noise<00:02:12.770> i

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
especially like the high dynamic noise i

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.890 
especially like the high dynamic noise i
like<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.220> call<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.670> there's<00:02:14.630> no

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
like to call it and there's no

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
tried-and-true method that can get rid

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
tried-and-true method that can get rid
of<00:02:17.390> these<00:02:17.690> high<00:02:18.410> dynamic<00:02:18.620> noise<00:02:18.980> areas<00:02:19.460> where

of these high dynamic noise areas where

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.100 
of these high dynamic noise areas where
it's<00:02:19.940> these<00:02:20.210> pixels<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.020> been

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
it's these pixels that have been

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.200 
it's these pixels that have been
compacted<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.860> tight<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.400> they've<00:02:22.880> become

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210

part<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.570> image<00:02:24.220> you'll<00:02:25.220> see<00:02:25.490> what<00:02:25.580> I'm

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
part of the image you'll see what I'm

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.430 
part of the image you'll see what I'm
talking<00:02:25.730> about<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.330> about<00:02:26.570> one<00:02:26.810> percent<00:02:27.260> and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
talking about and about one percent and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.930 
talking about and about one percent and
after<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.070> banner<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.459> gone<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.280> let's<00:02:31.520> go

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
after this banner is gone so let's go

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.810 
after this banner is gone so let's go
ahead<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.150> zoom<00:02:32.270> out<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.570> little<00:02:32.660> bit<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.310> zoom

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
ahead and zoom out a little bit and zoom

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.030 
ahead and zoom out a little bit and zoom
around<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.270> I'm<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.200> deselect<00:02:36.650> that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
around so I'm going to deselect that

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.220 
around so I'm going to deselect that
area<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.700> reselect<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.690> area<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.050> can

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
area and reselect that area so you can

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.840 
area and reselect that area so you can
see<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.770> amount<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.130> noise<00:02:40.250> reduction<00:02:40.580> that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
see the amount of noise reduction that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.820 
see the amount of noise reduction that
happened<00:02:41.239> in<00:02:41.420> these<00:02:41.840> areas<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.350> would<00:02:42.680> have

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
happened in these areas that would have

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.400 
happened in these areas that would have
been<00:02:42.890> highly<00:02:43.220> concentrated<00:02:43.400> noise<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:45.230> how

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
been highly concentrated noise but how

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.560 
been highly concentrated noise but how
does<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.620> affect<00:02:46.100> areas<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.790> extremely<00:02:47.330> high

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
does it affect areas of extremely high

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.420 
does it affect areas of extremely high
concentrated<00:02:48.200> noise<00:02:48.440> like<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.130> we've<00:02:49.250> gone

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
concentrated noise like what we've gone

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.610 
concentrated noise like what we've gone
through<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> tone<00:02:50.090> mapping<00:02:50.270> process<00:02:50.620> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
through with the tone mapping process it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.310 
through with the tone mapping process it
makes<00:02:52.520> no<00:02:52.730> change<00:02:53.030> because<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.989> looks<00:02:54.170> at

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
makes no change because it looks at

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.020 
makes no change because it looks at
those<00:02:54.440> areas<00:02:54.830> as<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.250> they<00:02:55.459> are<00:02:55.489> part<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:55.910> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
those areas as if they are part of the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.660 
those areas as if they are part of the
image<00:02:56.180> they've<00:02:56.570> become<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.230> compact<00:02:57.680> that

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
image they've become so compact that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.880 
image they've become so compact that
noise<00:02:59.360> becomes<00:02:59.690> so<00:02:59.870> compact<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.530> appears

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
noise becomes so compact that it appears

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.800 
noise becomes so compact that it appears
as<00:03:01.040> if<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.700> part<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> image<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
as if it's part of the image so the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.900 
as if it's part of the image so the
algorithms<00:03:03.440> skip<00:03:04.130> over<00:03:04.280> these<00:03:04.550> areas

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
algorithms skip over these areas

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.710 
algorithms skip over these areas
assuming<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.020> they're<00:03:06.320> part<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.650> image

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
assuming that they're part of the image

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.670 
assuming that they're part of the image
so<00:03:08.720> there's<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.959> couple<00:03:09.050> ways<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.350> can<00:03:09.500> fix

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
so there's a couple ways you can fix

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.920 
so there's a couple ways you can fix
this<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.250> way<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.760> prefer<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.660> pinch

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this the way that I prefer and a pinch

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.290 
this the way that I prefer and a pinch
is<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.500> use<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:13.010> blur<00:03:13.280> tool<00:03:13.550> is<00:03:13.760> found<00:03:14.209> right

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
is to use the blur tool is found right

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.910 
is to use the blur tool is found right
in<00:03:14.390> here<00:03:14.660> with<00:03:14.780> these<00:03:14.930> sharpens<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.650> smudge

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
in here with these sharpens and smudge

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.220 
in here with these sharpens and smudge
tool<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.550> perfect<00:03:16.700> blur<00:03:17.000> tool<00:03:17.209> give<00:03:18.140> it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
tool it's the perfect blur tool give it

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.500 
tool it's the perfect blur tool give it
a<00:03:18.290> setting<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.920> no<00:03:19.310> more<00:03:19.550> than<00:03:19.610> about<00:03:20.030> forty

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
a setting of no more than about forty

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.559 
a setting of no more than about forty
percent

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.390 

41<00:03:23.569> that's<00:03:23.690> fine<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.860> then<00:03:25.010> i'm<00:03:25.190> going<00:03:25.310> to

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
41 that's fine so then i'm going to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.430 
41 that's fine so then i'm going to
start<00:03:25.610> painting<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.480> this<00:03:26.690> with<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.200> blur

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
start painting in on this with that blur

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.080 
start painting in on this with that blur
tool<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:30.220> it's<00:03:31.220> going<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.400> start<00:03:31.670> blending

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
tool and it's going to start blending

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.690 
tool and it's going to start blending
those<00:03:32.599> highly<00:03:33.379> concentrated<00:03:33.620> noise<00:03:34.280> areas

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
those highly concentrated noise areas

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.729 
those highly concentrated noise areas
but<00:03:35.000> not<00:03:35.330> destroying<00:03:36.170> them<00:03:36.319> so<00:03:36.500> much<00:03:36.680> that

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
but not destroying them so much that

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.320 
but not destroying them so much that
they<00:03:36.950> appear<00:03:37.459> as<00:03:37.610> if<00:03:37.640> they<00:03:37.970> are<00:03:38.000> completely

we're<00:04:46.900> dead<00:04:47.080> anytime<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.740> do<00:04:47.860> any<00:04:48.040> noise

reduction you're going to be losing

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.890 
reduction you're going to be losing
detail<00:04:49.930> but<00:04:50.860> in<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:51.310> case<00:04:51.580> it's<00:04:51.910> pixels<00:04:52.690> that

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
detail but in this case it's pixels that

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.110 
detail but in this case it's pixels that
are<00:04:53.460> distracting<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:54.610> from<00:04:54.639> the<00:04:55.000> image

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
are distracting you from the image

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.300 
are distracting you from the image
rather<00:04:55.510> than<00:04:55.720> helping<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.620> move<00:04:56.770> along<00:04:57.100> the

rather than helping you move along the

selective noise reduction again don't

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.180 
selective noise reduction again don't
take<00:05:07.990> this<00:05:08.440> as<00:05:09.130> a<00:05:10.320> one<00:05:11.320> hundred<00:05:11.530> percent<00:05:11.560> fix

all<00:05:12.340> method<00:05:12.880> for<00:05:13.150> noise<00:05:13.330> reduction<00:05:13.540> but<00:05:14.050> it

all method for noise reduction but it

all method for noise reduction but it
does<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.470> great<00:05:14.740> job<00:05:14.770> use<00:05:15.700> it<00:05:15.850> liberally<00:05:15.970> and

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
does a great job use it liberally and

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.930 
does a great job use it liberally and
don't<00:05:17.710> go<00:05:17.860> overboard<00:05:18.130> with<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.430> because<00:05:18.700> you

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
don't go overboard with it because you

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.730 
don't go overboard with it because you
