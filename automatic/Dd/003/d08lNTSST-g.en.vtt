00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.700 

mr.<00:00:48.640> vez<00:00:48.760> is<00:00:48.910> actually<00:00:49.360> really<00:00:49.660> useful<00:00:49.810> in<00:00:50.560> the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
mr. vez is actually really useful in the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.420 
mr. vez is actually really useful in the
beginning<00:00:50.980> of<00:00:51.100> this<00:00:51.160> game<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:54.070> kind<00:00:54.370> of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
beginning of this game it's it's kind of

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.180 
beginning of this game it's it's kind of
crazy<00:00:54.970> good<00:00:55.660> actually<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:59.680> sure<00:00:59.950> it<00:01:00.070> gets

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
crazy good actually I'm sure it gets

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.010 
crazy good actually I'm sure it gets
less<00:01:00.640> useful<00:01:00.910> later<00:01:01.239> on<00:01:01.390> since<00:01:01.900> I<00:01:01.989> can't

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
less useful later on since I can't

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.680 
less useful later on since I can't
evolve<00:01:02.440> but<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:03.400> really<00:01:03.640> annihilates<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
evolve but it really annihilates the

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.480 
evolve but it really annihilates the
beginning<00:01:07.290> take<00:01:08.290> care<00:01:08.470> skinny<00:01:08.830> first<00:01:09.100> because

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
beginning take care skinny first because

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.940 
beginning take care skinny first because
he'd<00:01:10.119> smile

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.700 

how<00:01:14.610> dare<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.360> happy<00:01:15.750> skinny

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.530 

also<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:21.799> has<00:01:21.920> confused<00:01:22.340> right<00:01:22.490> which<00:01:22.909> is<00:01:22.939> one

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
also it has confused right which is one

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.219 
also it has confused right which is one
hundred<00:01:23.630> percent<00:01:23.840> accuracy<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.750> can<00:01:27.079> go

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
hundred percent accuracy so it I can go

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:38.490 
hundred percent accuracy so it I can go
shove<00:01:27.829> right<00:01:28.040> off

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.690 

calling<00:01:39.500> does<00:01:39.650> not<00:01:39.830> snap<00:01:40.070> how<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:40.250> confusion

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
calling does not snap how to confusion

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.359 
calling does not snap how to confusion
does<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:43.180> now<00:01:44.180> no<00:01:44.540> it<00:01:44.600> doesn't<00:01:44.900> just<00:01:45.369> double

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
does it now no it doesn't just double

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.700 
does it now no it doesn't just double
checking

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.830 

then<00:01:51.710> that's<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.550> lot<00:01:52.730> because<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:53.690> this

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
then that's it a lot because in this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.420 
then that's it a lot because in this
generation<00:01:54.170> Shadow<00:01:54.590> Ball<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:55.010> physical

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
generation Shadow Ball is physical

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.480 
generation Shadow Ball is physical
because<00:01:55.580> it's<00:01:55.820> ghost<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:57.620> also<00:01:57.770> confuses<00:01:58.310> me

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
because it's ghost it also confuses me

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.350 
because it's ghost it also confuses me
when<00:01:58.670> people<00:01:58.900> who<00:01:59.900> are<00:01:59.990> like<00:02:00.230> I<00:02:01.150> guess<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.270> a

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
when people who are like I guess I a

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.200 
when people who are like I guess I a
reason<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.930> but<00:02:03.110> people<00:02:03.410> who<00:02:04.310> insist<00:02:04.790> that

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
reason to but people who insist that

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.200 
reason to but people who insist that
things<00:02:06.080> have<00:02:06.260> always<00:02:06.440> been<00:02:06.850> physical<00:02:07.850> special

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
things have always been physical special

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.639 
things have always been physical special
split<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.810> fourth<00:02:09.020> generation<00:02:09.500> they

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
split like in the fourth generation they

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.050 
split like in the fourth generation they
get<00:02:09.830> confused<00:02:10.160> when<00:02:10.399> they<00:02:10.490> watch<00:02:10.700> all<00:02:10.940> their

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
get confused when they watch all their

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.650 
get confused when they watch all their
games<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.730> see<00:02:13.760> why<00:02:14.120> they<00:02:14.360> think<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
games like I can see why they think that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.380 
games like I can see why they think that
but<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.590> irritates<00:02:15.800> me<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.370> much<00:02:16.580> because<00:02:16.940> it's

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
but it irritates me so much because it's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.950 
but it irritates me so much because it's
a<00:02:17.480> recent<00:02:17.690> change

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960

think there's a way to select multiple
Pokemon<00:06:23.180> at<00:06:23.300> once<00:06:23.770> unlike<00:06:24.770> in<00:06:24.980> other<00:06:25.400> games

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
actually pressing Y allowed me to grab

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.430 
actually pressing Y allowed me to grab
and<00:06:31.820> move<00:06:31.850> without<00:06:32.390> going<00:06:32.660> to<00:06:32.810> a<00:06:32.840> menu<00:06:33.110> and
