just depending on the changes and so on
now<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:51.090> I'd<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> talk<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.719> today<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
now what I'd like to talk about today is

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.069 
now what I'd like to talk about today is
a<00:00:52.800> specific<00:00:53.489> technique<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.210> use<00:00:54.390> for

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a specific technique you can use for

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.470 
a specific technique you can use for
building<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.739> soloing<00:00:56.190> over<00:00:56.340> such<00:00:57.000> bebop

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
building up your soloing over such bebop

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
building up your soloing over such bebop
tunes<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> whatnot<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:59.129> instead<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
tunes and whatnot now instead of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
tunes and whatnot now instead of
starting<00:00:59.820> with<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.180> those<00:01:00.480> changes<00:01:01.020> moving

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
starting with all those changes moving

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.569 
starting with all those changes moving
so<00:01:01.469> fast<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> use<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.520> one

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so fast we're going to use just one

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
so fast we're going to use just one
chord<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> we're<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> build<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.960> line

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
chord and we're going to build a line

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.649 
chord and we're going to build a line
off<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.739> now<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.549> build<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> line<00:01:06.119> off<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.510> one

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
off of it now to build a line off of one

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.810 
off of it now to build a line off of one
chord<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.290> goal<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> sound<00:01:08.549> of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
chord your goal is to get the sound of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
chord your goal is to get the sound of
the<00:01:08.939> chord<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.420> using<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.020> your<00:01:10.080> line<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the chord you're using in your line and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.390 
the chord you're using in your line and
you<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.820> by<00:01:12.510> accent<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.619> court<00:01:13.950> tones<00:01:14.189> on

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
you do this by accent in court tones on

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460 
you do this by accent in court tones on
the<00:01:14.460> strong<00:01:14.939> beats<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.509> measure<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the strong beats of a measure like the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
the strong beats of a measure like the
one<00:01:16.650> two<00:01:16.830> three<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.159> four<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.240> add<00:01:18.390> all

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
one two three or four and you add all

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
one two three or four and you add all
your<00:01:18.570> chromatic<00:01:19.170> approaches<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.100> upbeats

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
your chromatic approaches on the upbeats

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.370 
your chromatic approaches on the upbeats
like<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> end<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:21.960> three<00:01:22.200> or<00:01:22.350> four

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
like the end of one two three or four

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.320 
like the end of one two three or four
and<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> add<00:01:23.610> other<00:01:23.790> chromatic

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and you can add other chromatic

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.510 
and you can add other chromatic
approaches<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.049> long<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.710> land<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
approaches as long as you land on a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
approaches as long as you land on a
chord<00:01:27.360> tone<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> strong<00:01:28.229> beat<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.680> will

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
chord tone on a strong beat it will

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.380 
chord tone on a strong beat it will
solidify<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.430> sound<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> chord<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
solidify the sound of the chord that

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.999 
solidify the sound of the chord that
you're<00:01:30.540> trying<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.960> imply<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.860> I've

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
approaches around those chord tones so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.489

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
showed you today you can hear the cord

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.690 
showed you today you can hear the cord
that<00:02:08.019> I'm<00:02:08.170> implying<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.519> from

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
that I'm implying and that is from

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.030 
that I'm implying and that is from
accent<00:02:10.299> in<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.660> chord<00:02:10.959> tones<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.620> strong

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
accent in the chord tones on the strong

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.160 
accent in the chord tones on the strong
beats<00:02:12.370> all<00:02:12.610> those<00:02:13.090> chromatic<00:02:13.629> notes<00:02:13.840> go<00:02:14.049> on

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
beats all those chromatic notes go on
