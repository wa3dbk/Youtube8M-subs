00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello people today i will show you how to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.230
 very fast a delicious breakfast or 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.400
 bad for in between and makes 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.030
 Although it is about a super delicious 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.770
 gratinated cheese despite the first 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 question is of course what is needed only 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.160
 even the first very important, of course, 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.920
 two slices of toast can irritate the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.250
 and unsuccessful then you need gouda 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.040
 slices of cheese he then so justly 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.460
 he cuts that to a letter 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:40.200
 to be able to gratinate and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 so there is no more you need 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.350
 a commercial toaster 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.620
 but if you do not stand upright 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 but it is important that it is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.699
 can fall out comforting set for it 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 we simply place the toaster with the edge 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.640
 on a board which is also very convenient 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 is it then directly in the direction of red 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 comes out so then you put this disc 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 just between the two 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.220
 but toast on the sides 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 nothing stands out because otherwise 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.150
 dripping in the toaster then this is her 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.740
 whole in the bottom toaster compartment 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 after the kiss and pushes time 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.299
 the hand one because it then by itself 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.630
 do not go in and then let it be that way 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.329
 long as you want to be unfair in there though 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.720
 I would say no more than one 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.650
 minute 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.840
 because the cheese otherwise burns and ever 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.600
 After how big your stores participate 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 wanted to put the toaster in which a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.040
 the normal level as always 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.140
 hires and sharp dance and now 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.979
 it is only to wait as long as we 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.899
 the system want to be in there and wait 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.969
 that the cheese melts that he could 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.579
 Great watch if you are so in the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.040
 Toaster purely looks best 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.599
 this carver from the monastery on the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.520
 side itself with the finger firmly 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.410
 with it 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.070
 a bit against it if 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.260
 it's done because that's what you do 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.790
 contrary to the mustang flies with the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.950
 schnapper go with the thumb 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.830
 slowly and the gate is slowly out 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.100
 let what comes out in the end 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.410
 could see now is a lexus consolation 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.290
 which is good button and the cheese 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.400
 molten 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.020
 Of course you can do it yourself 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.640
 then still season with salt and 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.500
 pepper you can also tomatoes then 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.730
 and so on as you are 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.730
 would like to enjoy
