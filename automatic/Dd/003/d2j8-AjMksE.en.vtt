00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.509
 lorem ipsum generator the one with the Argentine for the Italians does not start 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.909
 particular the game you need 10 at what level we are world level ùù 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.550
 lapo da sewing rt 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.719
 but surely it is always a particular challenge 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.800
 bar at the moment we win in argentina norinco italia so we know that we will have to 

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:34.580
 start to upset a moment 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.960
 all the cards on the table anyway is not 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.590
 that is, not me always if not to like winning in front of your audience e 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.280
 however it is one is a growth factor here nissan scope we have 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.589
 air does not enter the field at most 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.829
 currently the best will reveal in the school field while with the final result 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.609
 now we are working hard from all points of view trying to improve 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.140
 already to what we did in the past 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.530
 hoping of course finding the right keys the reaper puts you in trouble 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.410
 will succeed tip the game 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.390
 no it is a banana team that creates many problems ater who loves to play a lot 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.960
 very aggressive so it will be important for us to be closer to them 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.850
 eeeh keep possession of the golden ball balloon - they will then be of 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.870
 consequently we have more chances than you can score 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.270
 obviously we are working really hard is the important thing is 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.740
 that 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.140
 I am aware that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.050
 in the possibilities for friends we have and we must make the most of it 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.860
 to Argentinian multiplayer boushi due to the fact that I play French 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.660
 the games that you 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.909
 is already spoken a little 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.009
 what we should do to win the game by trying to write 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.020
 these Argentine sports teams use three quarters 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 cunnilingus how to write them what they have in more than two seas - of us 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 I don't know if they have something more or less or me and what I saw 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.310
 in the games of the past and that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.380
 al have always managed to impose their own game ahahh scarar for by 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.450
 setting up your own game is to drop the channel team 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.989
 in the confusion therefore it is a 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.750
 a game in which they are at ease in which 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.969
 but where I'm finding the keys to bring the game home 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.999
 style while those who schools that pizza a game more or more clear more 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.999
 anselmo cola. that possessed ball obviously their history of security 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.849
 because I can't find the way to 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.299
 ddd let's say pierce ddd create shoulder problems will be then 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.010
 to the thing that I think Argentina has 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.010
 in addition on the brenta it shows to have one that you try incredible siena enemy 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.180
 leftovers and with inter quaritch I love that easter that never gives up for 80 minutes 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.580
 yes with or at least to create you and obviously to solve problems 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.370
 that I was looking for is d 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.190
 Argentina is aware of this strength 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.880
 understand how to put in difficulty e 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.020
 perhaps through the technique and the mythical more than aggression succeed anyway 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.040
 to put in difficulty and make him understand that mini-competition will be difficult 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.469
 it will be difficult to get to the end 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:20.540
 when we talk about Veneto 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.129
 Senate president and mystically supervisor 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.370
 this problem with bad weather causes so many inconveniences to the population 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.859
 federation initiatives to donate part of the collection 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.439
 precisely Veneto region to support the regions at this time are in the 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.079
 end did the land values ​​you see left &amp; catid these choices 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.479
 obscuration as well as you said in Veneto at rain level is one is one of the 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.029
 majorettes regions that offered offered gave more players or 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:49.910
 above all 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.970
 samana scones concentration of of square therefore tarascona mind of the alarm 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.470
 fraction initiative is very important 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.549
 however I am al are 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.379
 they are families that have note on home and work harry so sum are in 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.850
 station with a critical mind 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.540
 surely we will try the damages in our small through the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.780
 match of Verona we will say then to make as many public as possible 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.530
 in short, a declaration we make directly. that of being numerous e 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.270
 however among the aids are important we will try through the match d 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.780
 to perhaps give more motivation to these people ahahaha more 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.370
 that he is working hard he is fighting against. bad weather e 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.100
 and these and these floods and therefore sum 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.100
 we hope so unfortunately i don't know we can't be there physically we have nemo 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.880
 of the commitments to respect but we are with them with the heart we hope of you 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.480
 they field to show him that we are close
