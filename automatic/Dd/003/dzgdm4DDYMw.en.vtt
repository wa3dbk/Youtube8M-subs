00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.820 

basically<00:00:08.519> it's<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:08.670> harmonic<00:00:09.300> minor<00:00:09.830> stuff

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
basically it's just harmonic minor stuff

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.110 
basically it's just harmonic minor stuff
that<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.099> do<00:00:11.160> all<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> time<00:00:11.639> really

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
that I do all the time really

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.330 
that I do all the time really
so<00:00:12.780> let<00:00:13.019> me<00:00:13.049> rather<00:00:13.500> than<00:00:13.650> bang<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
so let me rather than bang on about the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.129 
so let me rather than bang on about the
theory<00:00:14.670> that's<00:00:14.820> plenty<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.450> theory<00:00:15.780> stuff<00:00:15.990> on

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
theory that's plenty of theory stuff on

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.450 
theory that's plenty of theory stuff on
my<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.529> my<00:00:16.680> channel<00:00:16.980> let<00:00:17.070> me<00:00:17.160> just<00:00:17.310> actually

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
my on my channel let me just actually

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.849 
my on my channel let me just actually
show<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:17.970> some<00:00:18.300> shapes<00:00:18.600> I've<00:00:19.529> got<00:00:19.680> two

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
show you some shapes I've got two

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
show you some shapes I've got two
cameras<00:00:20.279> set<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.939> should<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.300> able<00:00:21.390> to

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
cameras set up so you should be able to

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.570 
cameras set up so you should be able to
see<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> left<00:00:22.740> hand<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.070> doing<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
see what the left hand is doing and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.450 
see what the left hand is doing and
right<00:00:23.760> hands<00:00:24.000> doing<00:00:24.060> plus<00:00:25.220> listen<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> me

right hands doing plus listen to me

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.769 
right hands doing plus listen to me
banging<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.420> well<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> same

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
banging on about it as well at the same

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.980 
banging on about it as well at the same
time<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.859> let<00:00:29.789> me<00:00:29.880> give<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.150> an<00:00:30.300> example<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
time so let me give you an example of it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.120 
time so let me give you an example of it
first<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.650> I'm<00:00:31.710> talking<00:00:32.070> about

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
first so you know what I'm talking about

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:44.420 
first so you know what I'm talking about
it's<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.030> kind<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.329> stuff<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:44.250> quite

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's this kind of stuff it's quite

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's this kind of stuff it's quite
simple<00:00:44.820> really

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
simple really

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.600 
simple really
you've<00:00:45.510> got<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.350> same<00:00:46.620> thing<00:00:46.649> repeated<00:00:47.460> over

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you've got the same thing repeated over

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
you've got the same thing repeated over
octaves<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.390> three<00:00:48.629> different<00:00:48.930> shapes<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
octaves with three different shapes so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.410 
octaves with three different shapes so
let<00:00:50.219> me<00:00:50.309> break<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.879> little<00:00:51.030> bit<00:00:51.180> for

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
let me break it down a little bit for

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.560 
let me break it down a little bit for
you<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.170> first<00:00:52.440> thing<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.460> play<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you the first thing to play is kind of a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.790 
you the first thing to play is kind of a
power<00:00:55.379> chord<00:00:55.820> which<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> beat<00:00:58.140> or<00:00:58.350> b5

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
power chord which is from a beat or b5

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
power chord which is from a beat or b5
if<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.940> we're<00:01:00.090> looking<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
if you like so we're looking at the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.860 
if you like so we're looking at the
second<00:01:00.960> fret<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.680> string<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.870> then

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
second fret on the a string and then

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
second fret on the a string and then
with<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.199> third<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:04.619> probably<00:01:05.549> third

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
with your third or probably third

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
with your third or probably third
probably<00:01:06.270> where<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.630> third<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
probably where you third but if you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.660 
probably where you third but if you
can't<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> stretch<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.430> little

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
can't do the stretch to your little

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
can't do the stretch to your little
finger<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.720> third<00:01:09.960> finger<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
finger would be third finger on the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
finger would be third finger on the
fourth<00:01:10.740> fret<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> d-string<00:01:12.200> you've<00:01:13.200> got

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
fourth fret on the d-string you've got

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
fourth fret on the d-string you've got
those<00:01:13.530> two<00:01:13.860> notes<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> never

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
those two notes there see that never

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.960 
those two notes there see that never
camera<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.100> stick<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.640> pinky

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
camera and then if you stick your pinky

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.039 
camera and then if you stick your pinky
underneath<00:01:18.830> your<00:01:19.830> third<00:01:20.070> finger<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.930> get

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
underneath your third finger and you get

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.590 
underneath your third finger and you get
that<00:01:22.170> octave<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> fourth

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that octave as well so that's the fourth

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
that octave as well so that's the fourth
fret<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.320> g<00:01:25.650> string<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> want

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fret on the g string and then you want

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.950 
fret on the g string and then you want
the<00:01:26.790> open<00:01:27.150> nose<00:01:27.740> sit<00:01:28.740> underneath<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> BME

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
the open nose sit underneath it the BME

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.179 
the open nose sit underneath it the BME
so<00:01:30.960> we're<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.140> hitting<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> bass<00:01:31.710> note<00:01:31.979> here

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so we're not hitting the bass note here

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.030 
so we're not hitting the bass note here
we're<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.340> 88<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> ATM<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
we're not 88 just from the ATM the a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.720 
we're not 88 just from the ATM the a
string<00:01:35.430> down

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.640 

that's<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:38.850> first<00:01:39.090> shape<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:40.230> I<00:01:40.260> do<00:01:40.350> what

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that's the first shape what I do what

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
that's the first shape what I do what
I'm<00:01:40.770> doing<00:01:40.800> is<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.250> moving<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.670> first<00:01:41.910> thing

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
I'm doing is I'm moving the first thing

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.840 
I'm doing is I'm moving the first thing
girl

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
girl

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.440 
girl
and<00:01:44.390> then<00:01:44.540> off<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.940> then<00:01:46.940> back<00:01:47.180> to

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
and then off to the a and then back to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.700 
and then off to the a and then back to
the<00:01:47.690> B<00:01:47.870> which<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.530> second<00:01:49.130> fret

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
the B which is the second fret

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.050 
the B which is the second fret
I<00:01:50.740> think<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.369> can<00:01:51.490> come<00:01:51.609> up<00:01:51.700> with<00:01:51.729> your<00:01:52.000> own

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
I think you can come up with your own

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.260 
I think you can come up with your own
little<00:01:52.270> pattern<00:01:52.750> without

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:04.170 

you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.830 

I<00:02:04.470> like<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.590> use<00:02:05.710> compound<00:02:06.580> times<00:02:06.940> because

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
I like to use compound times because

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.220 
I like to use compound times because
they<00:02:07.990> sound<00:02:08.200> more<00:02:08.619> kind<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.040> Arabic<00:02:09.940> and

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
they sound more kind of Arabic and

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.050 
they sound more kind of Arabic and
different<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.740> typical<00:02:12.040> for<00:02:12.490> for<00:02:12.760> stuff

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
different to the typical for for stuff

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.600 
different to the typical for for stuff
that<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.300> get<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.570> western<00:02:14.020> music<00:02:14.710> so<00:02:14.890> yeah

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
that you get in western music so yeah

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.040 
that you get in western music so yeah
just<00:02:15.910> adds<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.150> bit<00:02:16.270> more<00:02:16.300> flavor<00:02:16.690> that's<00:02:16.930> in

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
just adds a bit more flavor that's in

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.720 
just adds a bit more flavor that's in
nine<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.320> think<00:02:20.520> so

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
nine I think so

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.760 
nine I think so
have<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.630> go<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.990> rhythm<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.470> want<00:02:23.620> but

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
have a go that rhythm if you want but

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.620 
have a go that rhythm if you want but
that's<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.040> basic<00:02:24.400> premise<00:02:25.060> behind<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.510> and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
that's the basic premise behind it and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.080 
that's the basic premise behind it and
then<00:02:25.720> what<00:02:25.840> I'm<00:02:25.930> doing<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.410> I'm<00:02:26.980> taking<00:02:27.220> three

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
then what I'm doing is I'm taking three

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.730 
then what I'm doing is I'm taking three
different<00:02:28.420> shapes<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.110> moving<00:02:29.410> them<00:02:29.530> round

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
different shapes and moving them round

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.040 
different shapes and moving them round
so<00:02:30.130> let<00:02:30.250> me<00:02:30.340> show<00:02:30.490> you<00:02:30.550> those<00:02:30.790> two<00:02:31.120> those<00:02:31.750> three

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
so let me show you those two those three

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.530 
so let me show you those two those three
that<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> first<00:02:33.640> one<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.180> go<00:02:34.360> out

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
that and the first one to have a go out

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.510 
that and the first one to have a go out
are<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.670> fourth<00:02:36.970> fret<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.390> D<00:02:37.810> string

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
are is a the fourth fret on the D string

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.490 
are is a the fourth fret on the D string
fourth<00:02:39.520> fret<00:02:39.580> on<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.880> g<00:02:40.150> string<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
fourth fret on the g string and then the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.420 
fourth fret on the g string and then the
fourth<00:02:41.800> fret<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.280> B<00:02:42.400> string<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.190> play

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
fourth fret on the B string you can play

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.070 
fourth fret on the B string you can play
them<00:02:45.610> with<00:02:45.910> individual<00:02:46.450> fingers<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.870> like

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
them with individual fingers if you like

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.420 
them with individual fingers if you like
where<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.410> borrow<00:02:47.650> them<00:02:47.770> whichever

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
where you can borrow them whichever

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.730 
where you can borrow them whichever
feels<00:02:48.700> easier<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.360> then<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.320> play<00:02:50.500> that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
feels easier and then you can play that

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.580 
feels easier and then you can play that
fret<00:02:51.640> higher

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.880 

so<00:02:58.590> that's<00:02:58.770> shape<00:02:59.040> one<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.520> like<00:03:00.890> so

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
so that's shape one if you like so

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.380 
so that's shape one if you like so
mixing<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> two<00:03:02.580> together<00:03:02.760> from<00:03:03.210> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
mixing the two together from the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.750 
mixing the two together from the
original<00:03:03.990> kind<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.440> rhythmical<00:03:05.310> stuff<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
original kind of rhythmical stuff and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:18.259 
original kind of rhythmical stuff and
then<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.510> get<00:03:06.660> this

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.220 

laughter<00:03:19.269> nod<00:03:19.420> your<00:03:19.599> head<00:03:19.719> like<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:19.900> if<00:03:20.140> you

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
laughter nod your head like that if you

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.770 
laughter nod your head like that if you
don't<00:03:20.319> want<00:03:20.530> to

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.180 

anyway<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.960> idea<00:03:29.050> then<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.070> we're

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
anyway you get the idea then all we're

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.850 
anyway you get the idea then all we're
going<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> do<00:03:30.490> is<00:03:30.610> we're<00:03:30.700> going<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.880> repeat<00:03:31.860> the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
going to do is we're going to repeat the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.590 
going to do is we're going to repeat the
tonality<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:33.940> further<00:03:34.300> up<00:03:34.480> the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
tonality if you like further up the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.660 
tonality if you like further up the
fretboard<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:36.010> time<00:03:36.340> we're<00:03:36.640> playing

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
fretboard so this time we're playing

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.690 
fretboard so this time we're playing
half<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.540> B<00:03:38.440> major<00:03:38.800> Barre<00:03:39.220> chord<00:03:39.460> if<00:03:39.610> you

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
half of a B major Barre chord if you

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.120 
half of a B major Barre chord if you
like<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:41.350> we're<00:03:41.470> going<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.680> go<00:03:41.800> from<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
like so we're going to go from the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.190 
like so we're going to go from the
seventh<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.210> ninth<00:03:43.420> fret<00:03:43.630> on<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.960> D

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
seventh so in the ninth fret on the D

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.700 
seventh so in the ninth fret on the D
string<00:03:45.420> then<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.630> eighth<00:03:46.930> fret<00:03:47.200> on<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.470> g

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
string then the eighth fret on the g

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.300 
string then the eighth fret on the g
string

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
string

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.360 
string
and<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> seventh<00:03:50.230> fret<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.770> B

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
and then the seventh fret on the B

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.250 
and then the seventh fret on the B
string<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:54.660> then<00:03:55.660> we're<00:03:55.750> going<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.900> move<00:03:56.080> that

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
string and then we're going to move that

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:05.130 
string and then we're going to move that
up<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.440> semitone<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:04.120> you're<00:04:04.600> mixing<00:04:04.900> matching

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
up a semitone and you're mixing matching

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:24.629 
up a semitone and you're mixing matching
all<00:04:05.470> three<00:04:05.800> now<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.130> you

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.420 

got<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.699> idea<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.180> in<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.840> next<00:04:27.080> bit<00:04:27.430> again

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
got the idea and in the next bit again

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.219 
got the idea and in the next bit again
it's<00:04:28.610> just<00:04:28.639> an<00:04:28.850> octave<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.479> those<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:30.020> it's<00:04:30.110> in

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
it's just an octave of those and it's in

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.990 
it's just an octave of those and it's in
this<00:04:30.320> kind<00:04:30.530> of<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:31.250> think<00:04:31.400> about<00:04:31.580> your<00:04:31.729> caged

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
this kind of you think about your caged

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.900 
this kind of you think about your caged
shape<00:04:32.660> we're<00:04:33.650> up<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:33.979> kind<00:04:34.160> of<00:04:34.220> D<00:04:34.490> shape

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
shape we're up with the kind of D shape

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.439 
shape we're up with the kind of D shape
here<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:39.650> is<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.490> 11th<00:04:40.850> fret<00:04:41.060> on<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.210> g

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
here and that is the 11th fret on the g

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.620 
here and that is the 11th fret on the g
string<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:42.280> then<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.430> 12th<00:04:43.760> fret<00:04:43.910> on<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.510> B

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
string and then the 12th fret on the B

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.830 
string and then the 12th fret on the B
string<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.490> then<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.610> 11th<00:04:46.940> fret<00:04:47.090> on<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.510> E

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
string and then the 11th fret on the E

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.230 
string and then the 11th fret on the E
string<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:49.520> it's<00:04:49.639> kind<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:49.970> can<00:04:50.120> actually

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
string and it's kind of you can actually

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.100 
string and it's kind of you can actually
know<00:04:50.450> how<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.570> play<00:04:50.780> an<00:04:51.050> open<00:04:51.169> D<00:04:51.560> major<00:04:51.800> chord

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
know how to play an open D major chord

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.270 
know how to play an open D major chord
it<00:04:54.110> sounds<00:04:54.290> lonely<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.919> sounds<00:04:55.130> like<00:04:55.190> the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
it sounds lonely that sounds like the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.879 
it sounds lonely that sounds like the
Warner<00:04:55.550> Brothers<00:04:55.669> fiend<00:04:56.000> wasn't<00:04:56.889> the

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
Warner Brothers fiend wasn't the

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:58.650 
Warner Brothers fiend wasn't the
beginning<00:04:58.280> of<00:04:58.370> it

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
beginning of it

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.450 
beginning of it
anyway<00:04:59.660> that's<00:04:59.780> that's<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.229> shape<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.889> then

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
anyway that's that's the shape and then

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.090 
anyway that's that's the shape and then
you're<00:05:01.610> moving<00:05:01.880> that<00:05:02.000> up<00:05:02.240> by<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.540> semitone<00:05:09.100> and

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
you're moving that up by a semitone and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.629 
you're moving that up by a semitone and
all<00:05:10.220> those<00:05:10.430> shapes<00:05:10.760> belong<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.539> sit<00:05:11.900> within<00:05:12.169> e

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
all those shapes belong and sit within e

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.370 
all those shapes belong and sit within e
harmonic<00:05:13.639> minor<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.840> there<00:05:14.960> we<00:05:15.050> are<00:05:15.080> that's<00:05:15.260> a

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
harmonic minor so there we are that's a

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.310 
harmonic minor so there we are that's a
really<00:05:15.650> quite<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.889> simple<00:05:16.690> little<00:05:17.690> rhythmical

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
really quite a simple little rhythmical

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.080 
really quite a simple little rhythmical
thing<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.680> have<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.830> go<00:05:19.070> out<00:05:19.190> really<00:05:19.400> once<00:05:19.970> you

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
thing to have a go out really once you

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.760 
thing to have a go out really once you
get<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.389> idea<00:05:20.690> around<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.110> shapes<00:05:21.410> that

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
get the idea around the shapes that

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.800 
get the idea around the shapes that
you're<00:05:21.860> moving<00:05:22.190> around<00:05:22.419> it's<00:05:23.419> really<00:05:23.479> quite

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
you're moving around it's really quite

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.050 
you're moving around it's really quite
simple<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.410> try<00:05:24.680> out<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.130> have<00:05:25.639> it<00:05:25.669> just<00:05:25.940> have

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
simple to try out and have it just have

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.760 
simple to try out and have it just have
a<00:05:26.090> go<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.360> rhythmical<00:05:26.810> element<00:05:27.169> really<00:05:27.500> and

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
a go the rhythmical element really and

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.990 
a go the rhythmical element really and
just<00:05:27.889> make<00:05:28.130> something<00:05:28.340> up<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:28.789> sight

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000
