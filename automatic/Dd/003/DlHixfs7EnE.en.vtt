00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.109 
be on PlayStation now that is
disappointing<00:01:34.259> indeed<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.610> an<00:01:35.790> Xbox

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
great to use

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
great to use
and<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.250> stuff<00:02:14.550> like<00:02:14.760> team<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.150> season

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
quite average there's still an incentive

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.020 
quite average there's still an incentive
to<00:02:19.410> open<00:02:19.770> packs<00:02:20.010> because<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.580> still<00:02:20.819> pull

to open packs because you can still pull

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.760 
to open packs because you can still pull
a<00:02:21.060> legend<00:02:21.480> even<00:02:21.630> though<00:02:21.840> they're<00:02:21.989> quite<00:02:22.110> rare

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
a legend even though they're quite rare

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.190 
a legend even though they're quite rare
you<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.340> still<00:02:23.610> potentially<00:02:24.270> find<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.840> legend

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
you can still potentially find a legend

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.800 
you can still potentially find a legend

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
legends but to be quite honest view so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.190 
legends but to be quite honest view so
many<00:02:35.850> PlayStation<00:02:36.390> users<00:02:36.720> might<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:37.080> even

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
many PlayStation users might not even

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
many PlayStation users might not even
care<00:02:37.530> about<00:02:37.709> legend<00:02:38.190> cards<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.819> they're
