crawlers<00:02:09.209> you're<00:02:09.360> gonna<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.840> hold<00:02:10.050> them

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
crawlers you're gonna have to hold them

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.170 
crawlers you're gonna have to hold them
all<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.610> you're<00:02:11.790> gonna<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
all up and then you're gonna have to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.800 
all up and then you're gonna have to
shoot<00:02:12.569> them<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> Thunder<00:02:13.319> gun

shoot them with the Thunder gun

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.380 
shoot them with the Thunder gun
so<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.290> one<00:02:14.560> wave<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:15.100> basically<00:02:15.580> only<00:02:15.850> use

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
so in one wave you basically only use

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.120 
so in one wave you basically only use
two<00:02:16.780> thundergun<00:02:17.380> bullets<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:17.950> you're

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
two thundergun bullets so you're

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.160 
two thundergun bullets so you're
restricting<00:02:18.730> homo<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> lot<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.630> you're<00:02:19.750> hardly

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
restricting homo a lot so you're hardly

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.990 
restricting homo a lot so you're hardly
using<00:02:20.530> any<00:02:20.740> ammo<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.340> strategy<00:02:21.819> guide

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
using any ammo and this strategy guide

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.710 
using any ammo and this strategy guide

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
map because there's a zombie limit to

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.880 
map because there's a zombie limit to
the<00:05:24.660> amount<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:25.020> zombies<00:05:25.440> that<00:05:25.470> are<00:05:25.650> allowed

the amount of zombies that are allowed
in<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.250> map<00:05:26.430> at<00:05:26.790> one<00:05:27.000> time<00:05:27.300> so<00:05:28.050> I'm<00:05:28.170> waiting<00:05:28.500> to

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650

all the zombies and crawlers get in the
map<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:30.870> then<00:05:31.020> after<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.890> throw<00:05:32.280> my

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
map and then after that I throw my

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.370 
map and then after that I throw my
monkey<00:05:32.790> bomb<00:05:32.970> when<00:05:33.660> they're<00:05:33.900> close<00:05:34.140> behind

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
monkey bomb when they're close behind

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.910

into a ball well that's what I call it a
ball<00:05:44.190> but<00:05:44.520> basically<00:05:45.180> what<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.450> is<00:05:45.690> is<00:05:45.900> the

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
ball but basically what it is is the

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.230 
ball but basically what it is is the
right<00:05:46.230> train<00:05:46.560> strategy<00:05:47.220> guys<00:05:47.430> as<00:05:47.940> you<00:05:48.090> would

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
like what you see by some of their map

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.140 
like what you see by some of their map
packs<00:05:58.650> they're<00:05:58.890> a<00:05:58.920> lot<00:05:59.250> cheaper<00:05:59.280> than<00:05:59.970> the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
packs they're a lot cheaper than the

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.720 
packs they're a lot cheaper than the
normal<00:06:01.140> pace<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:01.650> map<00:06:01.890> packs<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.520> all<00:06:02.580> that

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
normal pace and map packs and all that

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.790 
normal pace and map packs and all that
stuff<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.330> they<00:06:03.570> get<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.840> all<00:06:04.050> sorted<00:06:04.620> out<00:06:04.740> for

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
stuff and they get it all sorted out for

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.590 
stuff and they get it all sorted out for
you<00:06:05.190> guys<00:06:05.340> so<00:06:05.760> you<00:06:05.790> don't<00:06:06.090> need<00:06:06.270> to<00:06:06.330> worry

you guys so you don't need to worry
about<00:06:06.750> one<00:06:07.170> thing<00:06:07.370> so<00:06:08.370> that's<00:06:09.890> basically<00:06:10.890> it

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
about one thing so that's basically it

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.640 
about one thing so that's basically it
is<00:06:11.370> so<00:06:11.700> I<00:06:11.730> don't<00:06:11.970> die<00:06:12.480> here<00:06:12.840> I<00:06:12.900> just<00:06:13.080> throw<00:06:13.530> the

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
is so I don't die here I just throw the

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.340 
is so I don't die here I just throw the
monkey<00:06:13.830> bomb<00:06:14.190> and<00:06:14.460> be<00:06:15.150> careful<00:06:15.660> with<00:06:15.810> monkeys

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
monkey bomb and be careful with monkeys

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.780 
monkey bomb and be careful with monkeys
because<00:06:16.680> as<00:06:16.890> you<00:06:17.070> could<00:06:17.250> see<00:06:17.430> there<00:06:17.640> the

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
because as you could see there the

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.970 
because as you could see there the
zombies<00:06:18.210> didn't<00:06:18.930> notice<00:06:19.290> for<00:06:19.500> a<00:06:19.560> minute<00:06:19.830> that

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
zombies didn't notice for a minute that

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.620 
zombies didn't notice for a minute that
they<00:06:20.100> were<00:06:20.160> monkey<00:06:20.580> bombs<00:06:20.790> so<00:06:21.210> what<00:06:21.420> they<00:06:21.570> did

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
they were monkey bombs so what they did

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.410 
they were monkey bombs so what they did
was<00:06:21.810> they<00:06:22.500> went<00:06:22.710> for<00:06:23.010> me<00:06:23.160> and<00:06:23.190> I<00:06:23.640> was<00:06:23.820> like<00:06:24.090> sort

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
was they went for me and I was like sort

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.930 
was they went for me and I was like sort
of<00:06:24.450> panicking<00:06:24.960> because<00:06:25.380> like<00:06:25.680> they<00:06:26.460> went<00:06:26.670> for

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
of panicking because like they went for

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.120 
of panicking because like they went for
me<00:06:27.090> and<00:06:27.120> then<00:06:27.690> they<00:06:28.440> took<00:06:28.470> them<00:06:28.830> a<00:06:28.920> while<00:06:29.070> to

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
me and then they took them a while to

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.920 
me and then they took them a while to
realize<00:06:29.640> that<00:06:29.760> the<00:06:29.880> monkey<00:06:30.180> bombs<00:06:30.390> there<00:06:30.690> so

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
realize that the monkey bombs there so

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.720 
realize that the monkey bombs there so
don't<00:06:31.260> stay<00:06:31.590> too<00:06:31.650> close<00:06:31.950> when<00:06:32.610> you're

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
don't stay too close when you're

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.610 
don't stay too close when you're
throwing<00:06:32.970> the<00:06:33.150> monkey<00:06:33.480> bomb<00:06:33.660> because<00:06:34.260> it

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
throwing the monkey bomb because it

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.110 
throwing the monkey bomb because it
could<00:06:34.830> mean<00:06:35.040> the<00:06:35.220> difference<00:06:35.520> between<00:06:35.580> life

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
could mean the difference between life

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.150 
could mean the difference between life
or<00:06:36.390> death<00:06:36.450> so<00:06:37.320> as<00:06:37.410> you<00:06:37.530> can<00:06:37.650> see<00:06:37.710> they<00:06:38.010> were<00:06:38.070> all

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
or death so as you can see they were all

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.790 
or death so as you can see they were all
crawlers<00:06:38.910> so<00:06:39.060> I<00:06:39.090> took<00:06:39.210> them<00:06:39.540> all<00:06:39.780> out<00:06:39.810> and

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
crawlers so I took them all out and

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.409 
crawlers so I took them all out and
now<00:06:40.919> I'm<00:06:41.190> on<00:06:41.370> to<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:41.610> second<00:06:42.030> group<00:06:42.210> of

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
now I'm on to the second group of

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.610 
now I'm on to the second group of
zombies<00:06:42.870> in<00:06:43.080> that<00:06:43.259> horde<00:06:43.560> so<00:06:44.490> um<00:06:45.199> yeah<00:06:46.199> so<00:06:46.530> I'm

on to the second group and what I got I
was<00:06:48.750> lucky<00:06:49.229> to<00:06:49.259> get<00:06:49.470> an<00:06:49.590> atom<00:06:49.889> bomb<00:06:50.069> there<00:06:50.340> you

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
was lucky to get an atom bomb there you

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.969 
was lucky to get an atom bomb there you
don't<00:06:51.180> really<00:06:51.479> need<00:06:51.720> that<00:06:51.930> much<00:06:52.139> points<00:06:52.740> in

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
don't really need that much points in

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.469 
don't really need that much points in
this<00:06:53.159> type<00:06:53.460> in<00:06:53.699> it<00:06:53.879> when<00:06:54.060> you're<00:06:54.210> in<00:06:54.330> these

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
this type in it when you're in these

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:56.089 
this type in it when you're in these
high<00:06:54.690> waves<00:06:54.990> well<00:06:55.409> I'm<00:06:55.500> not<00:06:55.650> high<00:06:55.860> at<00:06:56.039> the

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099 
high waves well I'm not high at the

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.010 
high waves well I'm not high at the
moment<00:06:56.129> in<00:06:56.520> the<00:06:56.610> way<00:06:56.729> ifs<00:06:57.000> but<00:06:57.300> when<00:06:57.780> you<00:06:57.900> get

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
moment in the way ifs but when you get

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.899 
moment in the way ifs but when you get
to<00:06:58.080> wave<00:06:58.289> 100<00:06:58.800> and<00:06:58.889> that<00:06:59.009> points<00:06:59.490> isn't<00:06:59.639> much

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
to wave 100 and that points isn't much

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.700 
to wave 100 and that points isn't much
of<00:06:59.940> an<00:07:00.180> issue<00:07:00.300> atom<00:07:00.810> bombs<00:07:01.020> just<00:07:01.259> get<00:07:01.500> them

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
of an issue atom bombs just get them

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.219 
of an issue atom bombs just get them
whenever<00:07:01.860> they<00:07:02.069> pop<00:07:02.340> up<00:07:02.550> and<00:07:02.819> basically<00:07:03.539> yeah

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
whenever they pop up and basically yeah

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.760 
whenever they pop up and basically yeah
so<00:07:05.210> yeah<00:07:06.210> just<00:07:06.449> get<00:07:06.599> atom<00:07:07.050> bombs<00:07:07.259> whenever<00:07:07.620> you

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
so yeah just get atom bombs whenever you

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.070 
so yeah just get atom bombs whenever you
can<00:07:08.039> but<00:07:08.340> normally<00:07:08.819> use<00:07:09.030> the<00:07:09.300> normal<00:07:09.539> strategy

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
can but normally use the normal strategy

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.230 
can but normally use the normal strategy
just<00:07:10.259> hoard<00:07:11.190> them<00:07:11.370> up<00:07:11.520> for<00:07:11.669> the<00:07:11.759> second<00:07:12.120> group

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
just hoard them up for the second group

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.300 
just hoard them up for the second group
and<00:07:12.479> shoot<00:07:12.750> them<00:07:12.900> with<00:07:13.050> a<00:07:13.080> thunder<00:07:13.440> gun<00:07:13.590> so

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
and shoot them with a thunder gun so

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.070 
and shoot them with a thunder gun so
starting<00:07:14.849> a<00:07:14.909> new<00:07:15.060> round<00:07:15.300> I'd<00:07:15.629> do<00:07:15.750> the<00:07:15.870> same

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 
starting a new round I'd do the same

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.110 
starting a new round I'd do the same
thing<00:07:16.349> because<00:07:16.469> every<00:07:16.919> round<00:07:17.129> you<00:07:17.400> regain<00:07:17.759> one

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
thing because every round you regain one

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.959 
thing because every round you regain one
monkey<00:07:18.569> bomb<00:07:18.780> so<00:07:19.259> and<00:07:19.680> you<00:07:20.009> only<00:07:20.190> use<00:07:20.310> one<00:07:20.490> per

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
monkey bomb so and you only use one per

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:22.879 
monkey bomb so and you only use one per
round<00:07:21.210> so<00:07:21.599> you<00:07:21.659> always<00:07:21.960> have<00:07:22.259> full<00:07:22.469> monkey

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889 
round so you always have full monkey

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:24.800 
round so you always have full monkey
bombs<00:07:23.099> as<00:07:23.430> long<00:07:23.610> as<00:07:23.729> you<00:07:23.819> only<00:07:24.000> use<00:07:24.300> one<00:07:24.599> per

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
bombs as long as you only use one per

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.439 
bombs as long as you only use one per
round<00:07:25.080> and<00:07:25.530> yeah<00:07:26.370> so<00:07:26.639> you<00:07:26.699> always<00:07:26.909> regain

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449 
round and yeah so you always regain

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.709 
round and yeah so you always regain
monkey<00:07:27.870> bombs<00:07:28.080> and<00:07:28.819> normal<00:07:29.819> bombs<00:07:30.030> towards

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:30.719 
monkey bombs and normal bombs towards

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:34.219 
monkey bombs and normal bombs towards
the<00:07:30.780> end<00:07:30.930> of<00:07:31.020> the<00:07:31.080> round<00:07:31.259> so<00:07:31.759> um<00:07:32.759> yeah<00:07:33.229> that's
