00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello here is daniel by comparison us 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:14.700
 and in this video I introduce you to the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 bose companion 20 speakers in front of the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.859
 bose companion 20 speakers are for 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.180
 250 euro at bose available however can 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.840
 you can currently for 200 euros over Amazon 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.410
 to order 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.779
 this is a 2.0 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.620
 speaker system 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.420
 therefore there is no subwoofer available 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.770
 Included is a control board 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.579
 connect to the speakers 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.329
 can 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.110
 this is the volume 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:50.670
 regulate and the speakers just in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.910
 the standby mode to put the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.520
 speakers sufficient back on 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.890
 again a short tap on the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.210
 On top of that, you can also get his own 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.110
 headphones or other audio devices 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 connect 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.060
 the operation is done very well 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:16.880
 so simple and short the sound quality too 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.880
 I want to show a song 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.009
 So you can definitely hear that 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.270
 the speakers a super natural 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.590
 and, above all, have room-filling sound 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.130
 because it does not make any 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.679
 difference where you are in the room 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 the sound stays absolutely the same 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:02:00.179
 right in front of the speakers or 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.670
 somewhere on the other side of the room 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:07.119
 I like the sound all the time 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.369
 My conclusion to the speakers is that 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.849
 the purchase was definitely worth it 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.840
 the investment of 200 euros is up 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:23.110
 every case very well laid out as the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.790
 sound quality is really very good 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.430
 and the speakers too 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.049
 are processed high quality 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.049
 and I definitely find pose shows 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:40.180
 again that one is not really one 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:44.680
 subwoofer needs to get better better 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.709
 Present and hereby the video would be 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.670
 already over I hope this video 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.730
 could help you with your purchase resp 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.160
 can help before purchase and as I said 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.910
 I the great speakers all 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.620
