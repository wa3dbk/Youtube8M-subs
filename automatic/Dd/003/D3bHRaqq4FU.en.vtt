top<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.250> also<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> bottom<00:02:39.519> I<00:02:39.849> got<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> bottom

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
top and also the bottom I got the bottom

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.420 
top and also the bottom I got the bottom
with<00:02:41.049> cardboard<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:41.830> place<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
with cardboard and then I place the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.220 
with cardboard and then I place the
aluminum<00:02:42.760> foil<00:02:42.970> on<00:02:43.239> everything<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:43.780> could<00:02:44.019> I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
aluminum foil on everything I could I

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.990 
aluminum foil on everything I could I
didn't<00:02:44.650> do<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.890> area<00:02:45.220> because<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.549> mean<00:02:45.700> too

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
didn't do this area because I mean too

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.670 
didn't do this area because I mean too
difficult<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.989> know<00:02:47.080> on<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.230> light<00:02:47.349> bulb<00:02:47.500> and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
difficult you know on the light bulb and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.910 
difficult you know on the light bulb and
stuff<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.569> could<00:02:49.569> now<00:02:49.720> because<00:02:50.049> heat<00:02:50.620> lamps

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
stuff I could now because heat lamps

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.770 
stuff I could now because heat lamps
isn't<00:02:51.160> on<00:02:51.250> because<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.760> did<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.180> actually<00:02:52.569> as

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
isn't on because I did this actually as

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.440 
isn't on because I did this actually as
I<00:02:53.290> was<00:02:53.319> doing<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.680> testing

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
I was doing a testing

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.960 
I was doing a testing
I<00:02:55.500> actually<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.920> don't<00:02:57.099> really<00:02:57.459> have<00:02:57.670> anything

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
I actually I don't really have anything

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.390 
I actually I don't really have anything
to<00:02:58.299> use<00:02:58.599> Idzik<00:02:59.049> as<00:02:59.290> a<00:03:02.280> as<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:05.040> mesh<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.370> I

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
to use Idzik as a as a mesh so I

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.170 
to use Idzik as a as a mesh so I
actually<00:03:06.579> used<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.970> paper<00:03:07.209> tray<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.560> worked

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
actually used a paper tray and it worked

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.120 
actually used a paper tray and it worked
so<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.810> actually<00:03:11.110> fits<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.440> perfectly<00:03:11.920> in

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
so it actually fits like perfectly in

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.080 
so it actually fits like perfectly in
mine<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:13.269> what<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.959> did<00:03:14.200> basically<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.850> wired

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
mine so what I did basically is I wired

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.809 
mine so what I did basically is I wired
up<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.299> fan<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.109> it<00:03:17.350> would<00:03:17.440> blow<00:03:17.650> up<00:03:17.829> air<00:03:18.340> out

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
up the fan so it would blow up air out

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.059 
up the fan so it would blow up air out
of<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.440> reason<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.859> fan<00:03:21.040> is

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
of it and the the reason this fan is

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.400 
of it and the the reason this fan is
fuse<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:22.030> just<00:03:22.480> sunk<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.989> moisture

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
fuse is just sunk out the moisture

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.949 
fuse is just sunk out the moisture
moisture<00:03:24.040> will<00:03:24.400> actually<00:03:24.819> the<00:03:25.540> good<00:03:25.660> moisture

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
moisture will actually the good moisture

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.629 
moisture will actually the good moisture
does<00:03:26.139> come<00:03:26.319> out<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.560> bananas<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.310> it'll

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
does come out of the bananas but it'll

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.729 
does come out of the bananas but it'll
collect<00:03:27.940> at<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:29.079> top<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:30.549> your<00:03:30.940> box<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.230> you

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
collect at the top of your box and you

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.259 
collect at the top of your box and you
don't<00:03:33.040> want<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.489> because<00:03:33.639> that<00:03:33.850> still<00:03:34.030> keeps

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
don't want that because that still keeps

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.640 
don't want that because that still keeps
the<00:03:34.359> moisture<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.750> there<00:03:35.019> another<00:03:35.200> process

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
the moisture in there another process

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.530 
the moisture in there another process
takes<00:03:35.859> longer<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:37.120> don't<00:03:37.150> even<00:03:37.359> know<00:03:37.510> if

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
takes longer and I don't even know if

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.259 
takes longer and I don't even know if
there's<00:03:37.750> work<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.799> put<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.010> fan<00:03:39.250> on<00:03:39.280> here<00:03:39.700> it

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
there's work so you put a fan on here it

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.710 
there's work so you put a fan on here it
sucks<00:03:40.569> out<00:03:40.750> all<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.109> moisture<00:03:42.540> make<00:03:43.540> sure<00:03:43.660> you

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
sucks out all the moisture make sure you

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.030 
sucks out all the moisture make sure you
don't<00:03:43.840> have<00:03:43.989> air<00:03:44.200> blowing<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:44.620> there<00:03:44.739> excess

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
don't have air blowing in there excess

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.629 
don't have air blowing in there excess
just<00:03:45.160> can't<00:03:45.400> put<00:03:45.549> moisture<00:03:45.850> into<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.150> box<00:03:46.389> and

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
just can't put moisture into the box and

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.550 
just can't put moisture into the box and
usually<00:03:48.639> PC<00:03:49.000> fans<00:03:49.389> only<00:03:49.660> get<00:03:49.930> wired<00:03:50.139> one<00:03:50.380> way

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
usually PC fans only get wired one way

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.140 
usually PC fans only get wired one way
that<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:51.160> only<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.489> power<00:03:51.670> in<00:03:51.819> one<00:03:51.940> way<00:03:52.090> so

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
that you only can power in one way so

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.979 
that you only can power in one way so
you<00:03:53.019> want<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.739> sticker<00:03:54.040> phasing<00:03:54.970> outward<00:03:55.269> as

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
you want the sticker phasing outward as

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.440 
you want the sticker phasing outward as
you<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.769> see<00:03:56.920> there<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.190> no<00:03:57.400> sticker<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.389> that

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
you can see there is no sticker on that

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:07.970 
you can see there is no sticker on that
side<00:03:58.720> so<00:04:01.019> that's<00:04:02.019> basically<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.489> have<00:04:03.940> this

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.309 

humidity<00:04:09.420> temperature<00:04:10.420> thing<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.810> put<00:04:11.049> it<00:04:11.170> in

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
humidity temperature thing I put it in

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.710 
humidity temperature thing I put it in
there<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:11.799> this<00:04:12.250> actually<00:04:12.880> gets<00:04:13.030> down<00:04:13.269> under

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
there and this actually gets down under

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.590 
there and this actually gets down under
10%<00:04:14.049> humidity<00:04:14.590> which<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.190> really<00:04:15.459> dry<00:04:15.669> nobody

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
10% humidity which is really dry nobody

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.890 
10% humidity which is really dry nobody
knows<00:04:16.900> what<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.079> is<00:04:17.350> your<00:04:18.009> average<00:04:18.509> house<00:04:19.509> is

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
knows what that is your average house is

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.509 
knows what that is your average house is
50<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:20.979> 60

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
50 to 60

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.809 
50 to 60
we<00:04:21.990> basements<00:04:22.990> are<00:04:23.110> usually<00:04:23.500> sixty<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.550> over

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:32.900 

anyway<00:04:27.819> so<00:04:27.940> what<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.210> did<00:04:28.479> is<00:04:29.099> I<00:04:30.099> got<00:04:30.819> some<00:04:31.120> cans

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
anyway so what I did is I got some cans

00:04:32.910 --> 00:05:08.790 
anyway so what I did is I got some cans
there's<00:04:33.910> places<00:04:37.830> my<00:04:38.830> lip<00:04:39.069> or<00:04:39.610> my<00:04:39.819> rack<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:08.440> what

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800

it<00:05:23.919> will<00:05:24.099> be<00:05:24.250> really<00:05:24.430> high<00:05:24.550> at<00:05:24.699> first<00:05:24.729> but<00:05:25.180> then

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
it will be really high at first but then

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.230 
it will be really high at first but then
as<00:05:25.599> the<00:05:25.930> time<00:05:26.139> goes<00:05:26.320> it<00:05:26.590> took<00:05:26.710> about<00:05:27.090> 16<00:05:28.090> hours

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
the hot air in there so you close up the

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.480 
the hot air in there so you close up the
fan<00:06:53.230> you<00:06:53.440> can<00:06:53.560> actually<00:06:53.860> get<00:06:53.950> this<00:06:54.070> up<00:06:54.220> to<00:06:54.370> like

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
fan you can actually get this up to like

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.020 
fan you can actually get this up to like
probably<00:06:54.670> 115<00:06:55.540> or<00:06:55.570> something<00:06:55.960> like<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.200> well

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
probably 115 or something like that well

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.850 
probably 115 or something like that well
actually<00:06:58.030> haven't<00:06:58.240> tried<00:06:58.780> that<00:06:58.810> but<00:06:59.650> because

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
actually haven't tried that but because

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.440 
actually haven't tried that but because
there's<00:07:00.100> really<00:07:00.280> no<00:07:00.430> need<00:07:00.610> to<00:07:00.790> because<00:07:01.090> you

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
there's really no need to because you

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.900 
there's really no need to because you
