flavor that goes with it there's a
slight<00:00:51.190> twinge<00:00:54.519> one<00:00:55.519> of<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.760> speakers<00:00:56.210> it's

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
slight twinge one of the speakers it's

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.329 
slight twinge one of the speakers it's
very<00:00:56.839> easy<00:00:57.170> on<00:00:57.500> your<00:00:57.710> ears<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.309> can

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
very easy on your ears and you can

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.460 
very easy on your ears and you can
listen<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:58.729> it<00:00:58.820> all<00:00:59.059> day<00:00:59.089> well<00:00:59.989> that's<00:01:00.199> great

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
listen to it all day well that's great

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.950 
listen to it all day well that's great
but<00:01:00.680> you're<00:01:00.829> not<00:01:00.860> getting<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.399> true<00:01:01.640> sound

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
but you're not getting the true sound

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.810 
but you're not getting the true sound
therefore<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.050> might<00:01:03.229> mix<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:04.009> piece<00:01:04.789> that

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
therefore you might mix in a piece that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.880 
therefore you might mix in a piece that
might<00:01:05.330> be<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.479> little<00:01:05.750> harsh<00:01:05.990> on<00:01:06.229> other

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
might be a little harsh on other

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.310 
might be a little harsh on other
speakers<00:01:07.429> or<00:01:07.670> on<00:01:07.789> any<00:01:08.000> true<00:01:08.330> sound<00:01:08.600> but

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
speakers or on any true sound but

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.719 
speakers or on any true sound but
because<00:01:09.619> they've<00:01:09.800> got<00:01:10.009> this<00:01:10.250> nice<00:01:10.490> little

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
because they've got this nice little

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.359 
because they've got this nice little
cutout<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.570> don't<00:01:11.750> see<00:01:12.200> it<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.560> that's<00:01:13.220> not

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
cutout you don't see it and that's not

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
that's really really true it's the only

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.840 
that's really really true it's the only
one<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:30.110> I<00:01:30.289> know<00:01:30.679> that<00:01:31.190> what<00:01:31.399> I'm<00:01:31.520> listening

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850
