00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.300
 returns 2 vélez 2 to 1 video does not seem to be 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.190
 that according to a supposed source because it 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.440
 they filter different details about call 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.030
 of duty black ops 3 let's call it 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.490
 black ops 3 because all the rumors 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.219
 and how are you rumored to go to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.310
 love basically at the source because not 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.130
 it is very clear 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.900
 of whether it is true or not true and so on 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.240
 this has basically caught 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.430
 because you martín that is a channel of two 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.110
 millions and peak of subscribers 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.699
 he made a video saying all these 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.670
 details and good because basically it has 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.680
 caught more value perhaps these rumors 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.199
 that otherwise would have happened 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.059
 unnoticed and let's say they are 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.710
 these rumors of to me in my opinion I do not 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.980
 I know some may be true for 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.839
 pure logic that they must move forward and others 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.390
 I would not like anything to be like that or not 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.699
 I think that they will be like that according to those 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.290
 rumors the good campaign will be that 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.720
 it only extends the game 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.949
 it's just going to come out between 4 xbox one 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.629
 and pc 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.790
 there I have my doubts really if it's going to 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.660
 spend that year or more the year that 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.540
 the truth comes 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.050
 then the campaign looks very good 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.760
 better than in advance warfare the campaign 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.950
 it will be something of the open world but if 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.950
 thank you nonlinear 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.820
 jake pax or exoskeletons so good 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.070
 already 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 we'll see hopefully not because 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.790
 another source said that we are not going to have 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.010
 exoskeletons or anything but a 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.410
 different movement that could be the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.140
 jet pack or something not I hope not the 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.240
 true let's hope that no more shit yes a 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.060
 little more traditional all the truth I 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.979
 is what it is but it is good 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.930
 theme of choosing characters 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.710
 we have several characters in the mode 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.570
 story like gta 5 and like a madman 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.119
 as gta 5 we will basically have several 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.920
 characters to play the campaign and so on 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.800
 I imagine to keep changing and all this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.500
 I do not know how the operation will go then 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.140
 the sex or costumes will have a skill 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.400
 to run around the walls 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.740
 and the zombies will have map packs 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.630
 only for the UFOs or will they come then 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.760
 I imagine that refers to that of times 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.410
 they will come only from zombies so that 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.080
 we have the best four maps of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.230
 background and other software and graben post 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.330
 will attend 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.519
 make the zombies and so on then custom ap 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.580
 editor or a map editor are going to 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.290
 private parties alone and with the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.019
 ability with the possibility of 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.340
 share these maps I do not know if they will be 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.330
 also in zombie mode what we can 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.360
 share or if or if they will be only in the way 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.590
 normal and you're in the multiplayer and already 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 it is and well we can only play in 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.540
 private matches the picture king will 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.269
 come back the catch 13 so fuck you of things 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.150
 it returns as navas warfare if 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.019
 I'm not wrong and we can not go up 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.819
 level the gusts we will not be able to 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.400
 create the gusts with what that 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.260
 it would disappear but we could catch 13 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.890
 elements 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.689
 then dynamic time the maps and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.250
 elements of the maps that is the weather 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.590
 dynamic in terms of what of 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.939
 you suddenly can put you can put 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.640
 rain and I think it's a thing 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.620
 which it should already be implemented ago 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 much much much much very much time and 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.250
 that each map by is different from that of 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.440
 suddenly, I'm seeing how 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.510
 suddenly it's cloudy like suddenly 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.980
 to gasol like that suddenly to the best 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.920
 it is night not think soled 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.420
 playability to the title and to any already 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.420
 any game, I do not think they should 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.739
 so be all the shooters in fact 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.480
 I think that they should move forward for that 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.609
 I've done it already I did it 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.709
 two or three years that looked like this in the 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.739
 future all shooters that have 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.190
 at least minimal dynamic time and 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.220
 that the elements will affect the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.230
 person who becomes windy or if he is 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.909
 raining and so on that things happen 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.739
 it is not windy for example you have 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.510
 a grenade and go to the waves 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.480
 of the good wind 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.860
 wright and knock down that would be remakes 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.650
 again 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.170
 then the maps would be larger than 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.819
 the backward farc and we would have games 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.670
 of 16 verses 16 and 32 versus 32 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.759
 so good we will see to see I am 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.650
 sincere to go play I'm going to say that 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.650
 I do not think this is the truth 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.139
 I'm not going to play a lot but I do not think 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.600
 be true and I hope that many of the 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.190
 things are not true because they would fuck me 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.259
 quite above all of the facts suits 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.880
 again critical is something that 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.729
 the maps are bigger too what 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.190
 I'm a little bit up to the eggs if they are 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.840
 larger ones please do not have 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.570
 300,000 heights although you can not 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.539
 hide in 5,000 corners and if they are 17 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.970
 those 16 and 32 16 of his 32 he 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.930
 respond to this good from the beginning 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.210
 These are things that worry me a lot 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.849
 the truth otherwise there are things 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.620
 pretty good and pretty cool that 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.960
 be true, it would be pretty cool 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.690
 were true we will see to see that everything 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.009
 this will never be known until you eye 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.419
 until it's in the game in May already 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.979
 we will have the revelation we will be able to 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.599
 know if all this is true or false 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.009
 so well nothing more guys this if not 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.520
 I took nothing we see in the next video 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.520
 until next time
