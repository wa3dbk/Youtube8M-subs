freak who developed pogi yes okay you
guys<00:00:19.830> get<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.340> basically<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.939> came

guys get that but basically what came
with<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.109> dates<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> all<00:00:22.890> of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
with this was the dates that all of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.470 
with this was the dates that all of
their<00:00:23.130> copyrights<00:00:23.640> were<00:00:23.820> renewed<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
their copyrights were renewed and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.670 
their copyrights were renewed and
somebody<00:00:24.840> actually<00:00:24.960> compiled<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.500> very

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
somebody actually compiled a very

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.710 
somebody actually compiled a very
interesting<00:00:26.130> list<00:00:26.400> about<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.390> more

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
interesting list about this and was more

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.509 
interesting list about this and was more
or<00:00:27.779> less<00:00:27.840> speculation<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.769> Pokemon<00:00:29.220> X<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
or less speculation for Pokemon X and

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.400 
or less speculation for Pokemon X and
wide<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.060> gave<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.660> list<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.289> high

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
wide and it gave a list of high

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.500 
wide and it gave a list of high
potential<00:00:32.040> mega<00:00:32.189> evolutions<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.390> could

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
potential mega evolutions and you could

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.610 
potential mega evolutions and you could
see<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.899> screen<00:00:34.230> right<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
see that on screen right now and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.860 
see that on screen right now and
basically<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.489> he<00:00:35.640> did<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.059> compile<00:00:36.660> them

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
basically what he did was compile them

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
basically what he did was compile them
to<00:00:37.230> list<00:00:37.469> depending<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:38.010> when<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> trademark

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to list depending on when the trademark

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
to list depending on when the trademark
was<00:00:38.910> renewed<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.110> probability<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
was renewed and the probability of it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.500 
was renewed and the probability of it
getting<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.250> bike<00:00:41.340> evolution<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
getting on bike evolution was so if you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.729 
getting on bike evolution was so if you
look<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> list<00:00:43.020> you'd<00:00:43.170> probably<00:00:43.350> realized

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
look at the list you'd probably realized

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.350 
look at the list you'd probably realized
that<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> basically<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.180> mega

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that this is basically all the mega

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 
that this is basically all the mega
evolutions<00:00:45.870> there's<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.590> only<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.860> few

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
evolutions there's actually only a few

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.740 
evolutions there's actually only a few
that<00:00:47.520> actually<00:00:47.550> did<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.120> mega<00:00:48.300> evolutions

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that actually did get mega evolutions

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.299 
that actually did get mega evolutions
that<00:00:48.899> aren't<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> list<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.190> are

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that aren't on this list and there are

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
that aren't on this list and there are
four<00:00:50.640> pokemon<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> list<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.020> did<00:00:52.170> not

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
four pokemon on this list that did not

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
four pokemon on this list that did not
get<00:00:52.649> mega<00:00:52.860> evolutions<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.120> proud

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
get mega evolutions that would be proud

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.490 
get mega evolutions that would be proud
on<00:00:54.690> Kyogre<00:00:55.559> Rayquaza<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.960> sceptile<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.230> that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
on Kyogre Rayquaza and sceptile so that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.560 
on Kyogre Rayquaza and sceptile so that
should<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.829> extremely<00:00:59.820> interesting<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
should be extremely interesting to you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.180 
should be extremely interesting to you
if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.989> excited<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.559> alpha<00:01:02.039> sapphire

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
if you are excited for alpha sapphire

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.700 
if you are excited for alpha sapphire
and<00:01:02.579> Omega<00:01:02.820> Ruby<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.600> those<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.439> are

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and Omega Ruby because those all are

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
and Omega Ruby because those all are
from<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.369> generation<00:01:05.700> three<00:01:06.390> those

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
from that generation three those

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.210 
from that generation three those
generation<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.290> games<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.710> feel<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
generation of games I feel like this is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
generation of games I feel like this is
almost<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.549> guarantee<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.090> something<00:01:10.020> has<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
almost a guarantee that something has to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.719 
almost a guarantee that something has to
be<00:01:10.530> coming<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> mean<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
be coming with them I mean just this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
be coming with them I mean just this
list<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.570> accurate<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.409> x<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.770> y

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
list was so accurate with x and y

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
list was so accurate with x and y
there's<00:01:14.369> there's<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:14.939> some<00:01:15.240> kind<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
there's there's got to be some kind of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
there's there's got to be some kind of
combination<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.380> mean<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.680> feel<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.280> there

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
combination I mean I feel like if there

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.940 
combination I mean I feel like if there
is<00:01:17.700> mega<00:01:17.970> evolutions<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.619> gen<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
is mega evolutions in these that gen of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
is mega evolutions in these that gen of
games<00:01:20.189> there's<00:01:20.490> gotta<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.450> sceptile

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
games there's gotta be one for sceptile

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
games there's gotta be one for sceptile
and<00:01:22.259> swampert<00:01:22.950> otherwise<00:01:23.280> stepped<00:01:23.670> on

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and swampert otherwise stepped on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
and swampert otherwise stepped on
Swampert<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.600> immediately

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
Swampert would just be immediately

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
Swampert would just be immediately
overpowered<00:01:25.890> by<00:01:25.920> Blaziken<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> mean<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> can't

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
overpowered by Blaziken I mean you can't

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.999 
overpowered by Blaziken I mean you can't
compete<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.990> mega<00:01:28.229> Blaziken<00:01:28.710> versus
