when I picked up the Intel one same size

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.970 
when I picked up the Intel one same size
120<00:00:42.149> gigs<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.289> looks<00:00:46.289> great<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.950> far

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
120 gigs and this one looks great so far

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
120 gigs and this one looks great so far
so<00:00:47.430> good<00:00:47.640> everything's<00:00:48.180> were<00:00:48.360> bitching<00:00:49.140> with

so good everything's were bitching with
this<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.710> put<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.280> already<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.600> here's<00:00:51.899> an

this I put this in already so here's an
overview<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:53.449> there's<00:00:54.449> my<00:00:55.399> power

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
overview of it now there's my power

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.069 
overview of it now there's my power
supply<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.239> there<00:00:57.980> come<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.190> lie<00:00:59.430> I<00:01:00.079> swapped

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
supply in there come on lie I swapped

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
supply in there come on lie I swapped
the<00:01:01.230> power<00:01:01.410> supply<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.190> think<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> said<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the power supply I think I said that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
the power supply I think I said that
under<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> video<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.719> cut<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> hole<00:01:04.229> down<00:01:04.350> there

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
under the video I cut a hole down there

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219 
under the video I cut a hole down there
in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> bottom<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> case<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:07.049> works

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
in the bottom of the case that works

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
in the bottom of the case that works
good<00:01:08.119> got<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.360> finally<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.970> thermal

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
good got the finally I got the thermal

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.950 
good got the finally I got the thermal

drive the 300 gig Raptor drive that's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.100 
drive the 300 gig Raptor drive that's
going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> other<00:01:36.479> computer<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
going to go on the other computer and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.980 
going to go on the other computer and
then<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.460> Seagate<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.270> terabyte<00:01:39.659> drive

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
then the Seagate one terabyte drive

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.970 
then the Seagate one terabyte drive
that's<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> go<00:01:40.650> another<00:01:40.860> computer

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.700 

got<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.700> video<00:01:44.970> card<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.480> in<00:01:45.660> there<00:01:45.900> it's<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
got the video card all in there it's a

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.970 
got the video card all in there it's a
tight<00:01:46.950> fit<00:01:46.980> on<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> micro<00:01:48.150> ATX<00:01:48.360> board<00:01:48.990> there's

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
tight fit on the micro ATX board there's

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.900 
tight fit on the micro ATX board there's
probably<00:01:50.220> gonna<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.490> player<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
probably gonna be a player with the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.300 
probably gonna be a player with the
light<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.330> if<00:01:51.510> I<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.690> put<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.900> off

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
light when we see if I can put it off

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.030 
light when we see if I can put it off
right<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.080> tight<00:01:55.410> a<00:01:55.440> fit<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
right there and see how tight a fit that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.920 
right there and see how tight a fit that
is<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.870> plans<00:01:58.170> were<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:59.250> this<00:02:00.150> stuff<00:02:00.780> was

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
is so the plans were the this stuff was

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.920 
is so the plans were the this stuff was
supposed<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.410> in<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:01.680> antec<00:02:02.610> 900<00:02:03.150> case<00:02:03.450> but

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
supposed to be in my antec 900 case but

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.680 
supposed to be in my antec 900 case but
end<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.740> getting<00:02:04.980> a<00:02:05.040> new<00:02:05.190> case<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.510> all<00:02:06.660> fits

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
end up getting a new case so it all fits

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.010 
end up getting a new case so it all fits
so<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.380> no<00:02:07.530> big<00:02:07.710> deal<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.840> thought<00:02:09.840> about

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
so that's no big deal I thought about

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.170 
so that's no big deal I thought about
moving<00:02:10.350> it<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.920> other<00:02:10.950> pci<00:02:11.580> slot<00:02:11.970> down

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
moving it to that other pci slot down

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.270 
moving it to that other pci slot down
there<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:12.870> only<00:02:13.080> an<00:02:13.260> 8x<00:02:13.710> instead<00:02:14.250> of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
there but that's only an 8x instead of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.500 
there but that's only an 8x instead of
the<00:02:14.400> 16<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.270> wouldn't<00:02:15.570> work<00:02:15.600> i<00:02:17.510> added

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the 16 so that wouldn't work i added

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.240 
the 16 so that wouldn't work i added
this<00:02:18.630> fan<00:02:18.900> right<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.740> because<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.160> how

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
this fan right here just because of how

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.690 
this fan right here just because of how
close<00:02:20.580> they<00:02:20.850> were<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.300> actually<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.140> works

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
close they were and actually that works

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.960 
close they were and actually that works
that<00:02:23.700> works<00:02:23.730> really<00:02:24.060> well<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:25.620> GPU<00:02:26.340> idles<00:02:26.820> at

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that works really well the GPU idles at

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.630 
that works really well the GPU idles at
about<00:02:27.180> 35<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.990> then<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.640> otha<00:02:30.270> temps<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
about 35 and then the otha temps on the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.100 
about 35 and then the otha temps on the
cpu<00:02:32.720> anywhere<00:02:33.720> from<00:02:33.990> 23<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.150> 28<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.540> all<00:02:36.810> cores

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
cpu anywhere from 23 to 28 on all cores

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.300 
cpu anywhere from 23 to 28 on all cores
so<00:02:38.070> that's<00:02:38.250> bitchin<00:02:38.990> that's<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.140> huge<00:02:40.620> heatsink

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
so that's bitchin that's a huge heatsink

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.510 
so that's bitchin that's a huge heatsink
actual<00:02:42.320> screen<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.680> side<00:02:43.920> panel<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.370> here

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
actual screen the side panel right here

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.490 
actual screen the side panel right here
comes<00:02:44.820> all<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.150> way<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.750> almost<00:02:46.170> hits

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
comes all the way out it almost hits

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.910 
comes all the way out it almost hits
these<00:02:46.710> things<00:02:47.390> if<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.780> see<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.230> that's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
these things if you can see that that's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.790 
these things if you can see that that's
a<00:02:50.130> huge<00:02:50.580> heat<00:02:51.090> sink<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.600> well<00:02:51.750> worth<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.230> this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
a huge heat sink and well worth it this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.670 
a huge heat sink and well worth it this
will<00:02:53.100> be<00:02:53.310> overclocked<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.850> 4.5<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:55.410> this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
will be overclocked to 4.5 on this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.650 
will be overclocked to 4.5 on this
cooler<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.550> more<00:02:56.760> that's<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.180> guaranteed

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
cooler if not more that's a guaranteed

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.820 
cooler if not more that's a guaranteed
and<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.500> card<00:02:58.770> will<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.010> overclocked<00:02:59.580> so

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
and this card will be overclocked so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.400 
and this card will be overclocked so
just<00:03:01.830> got<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.070> DVD<00:03:02.400> Drive<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.050> then<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.290> got

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
just got the DVD Drive and then I got

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.140 
just got the DVD Drive and then I got
the<00:03:04.880> one<00:03:05.880> terabyte<00:03:07.160> western<00:03:08.160> digital<00:03:08.190> down

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the one terabyte western digital down

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.600 
the one terabyte western digital down
there<00:03:09.739> 250<00:03:10.739> gigabyte<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.540> then<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.660> intel

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
there 250 gigabyte and then the intel

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.490 
there 250 gigabyte and then the intel
SSD<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.760> top<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.720> threw<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.930> up<00:03:16.080> here<00:03:16.320> just

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
SSD on top I just threw it up here just

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.140 
SSD on top I just threw it up here just
because<00:03:16.709> all<00:03:17.160> these<00:03:17.430> are<00:03:17.640> already<00:03:17.940> wired

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
because all these are already wired

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.479 
because all these are already wired
anyway<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.989> hot<00:03:19.140> swap<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.100> just<00:03:20.310> threw

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
anyway for the hot swap so I just threw

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.160 
anyway for the hot swap so I just threw
it<00:03:20.520> up<00:03:20.670> there<00:03:20.700> might<00:03:21.660> as<00:03:21.810> well

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
it up there might as well

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.000 
it up there might as well
so<00:03:24.170> that's<00:03:24.409> a<00:03:24.709> that's<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.430> setup<00:03:25.700> on<00:03:25.970> it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
so that's a that's the setup on it

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.319 
so that's a that's the setup on it
there's<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.129> side<00:03:28.340> panel<00:03:28.790> right<00:03:28.909> there<00:03:29.150> off

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
there's the side panel right there off

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.179 
there's the side panel right there off
for<00:03:29.599> now<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:32.480> yeah<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:33.349> works<00:03:33.530> out<00:03:33.680> bitching

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
for now but yeah it works out bitching

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:41.589 
for now but yeah it works out bitching
too<00:03:34.810> loving<00:03:35.810> this<00:03:35.930> setup<00:03:36.200> right<00:03:36.470> now<00:03:40.599> there's

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
too loving this setup right now there's

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.720 
too loving this setup right now there's
the<00:03:41.870> front

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.200 

on<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.390> side

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:57.510 

these<00:03:50.810> all<00:03:51.020> open<00:03:51.380> up

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.840 

see<00:03:58.180> inside<00:03:58.540> there<00:03:58.870> nice<00:03:59.560> airflow<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:00.640> thing

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
see inside there nice airflow this thing

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.580 
see inside there nice airflow this thing
does<00:04:01.330> grey<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:02.140> air<00:04:02.470> flow

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.990 

so<00:04:08.260> that's<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:11.980> um<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.040> guess<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.819> wire

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
so that's that um I guess the wire

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.180 
so that's that um I guess the wire
management<00:04:14.269> back<00:04:14.690> here<00:04:15.050> I<00:04:15.260> still<00:04:15.890> have<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.070> do

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
management back here I still have to do

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.319 
management back here I still have to do
that<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.370> still<00:04:16.609> got<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.820> do<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.910> lot<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.090> work

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
that I still got to do a lot of work

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.430 
that I still got to do a lot of work
just<00:04:17.720> straightening<00:04:18.560> up<00:04:18.590> everything<00:04:19.220> so<00:04:20.440> well

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
just straightening up everything so well

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.600 
just straightening up everything so well
yeah<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.680> wanted<00:04:21.979> to<00:04:22.040> show<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.430> wire

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
yeah I wanted to show you the wire

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.500 
yeah I wanted to show you the wire
management<00:04:22.880> inside<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:25.310> was<00:04:25.430> barely<00:04:25.790> able<00:04:26.240> to

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
management inside it was barely able to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.360 
management inside it was barely able to
get<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.840> 8-pin<00:04:27.530> connector<00:04:27.560> right<00:04:28.070> there

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
get that a 8-pin connector right there

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.480 
get that a 8-pin connector right there
and<00:04:28.940> then<00:04:29.570> there's<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.020> faint<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.770> CPU<00:04:31.190> fans

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
and then there's the faint the CPU fans

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.730 
and then there's the faint the CPU fans
right<00:04:31.940> there<00:04:32.210> since<00:04:32.570> there's<00:04:32.750> to<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.470> board

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
right there since there's to the board

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.100 
right there since there's to the board
supplies<00:04:34.130> two<00:04:34.430> spots<00:04:34.790> which<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.150> awesome<00:04:38.110> so

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
supplies two spots which is awesome so

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.680 
supplies two spots which is awesome so
wires<00:04:39.290> go<00:04:39.590> down<00:04:39.740> there<00:04:40.150> 24<00:04:41.150> pin<00:04:41.450> right<00:04:41.690> there

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
wires go down there 24 pin right there

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.100 
wires go down there 24 pin right there
on<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.750> CETA<00:04:45.370> pci<00:04:46.370> slots<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.330> USB<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:47.870> an

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
on the CETA pci slots and the USB is an

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.980 
on the CETA pci slots and the USB is an
audio<00:04:48.440> down<00:04:48.650> there<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:50.060> actually<00:04:50.240> if<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.690> um

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
audio down there so actually if it um

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.140 
audio down there so actually if it um
wire<00:04:51.889> management<00:04:52.160> is<00:04:52.520> actually<00:04:52.790> pretty<00:04:52.940> good

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
wire management is actually pretty good

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.140 
wire management is actually pretty good
there<00:04:53.360> are<00:04:53.479> no<00:04:53.660> wires<00:04:53.990> out<00:04:54.889> anywhere<00:04:55.580> exposed

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
there are no wires out anywhere exposed

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150 
there are no wires out anywhere exposed
it's<00:04:56.570> all<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:57.080> know<00:04:57.200> in<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.530> back<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:58.010> they're

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
it's all you know in the back so they're

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.659 
it's all you know in the back so they're
flows<00:04:58.460> great<00:04:58.880> with<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.900> side<00:05:00.139> panel<00:05:00.590> on<00:05:00.770> maybe

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
flows great with the side panel on maybe

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.550 
flows great with the side panel on maybe
the<00:05:01.880> degree<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.810> temperature<00:05:03.200> goes<00:05:03.350> up

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
the degree that the temperature goes up

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.590 
the degree that the temperature goes up
maybe<00:05:03.979> two<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.370> three<00:05:04.400> degrees<00:05:04.699> if<00:05:05.060> that<00:05:05.330> maybe

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
maybe two to three degrees if that maybe

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.090 
maybe two to three degrees if that maybe
even<00:05:05.810> two<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:09.289> complete<00:05:09.740> of<00:05:09.889> it

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
even two so that is the complete of it

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.129 
even two so that is the complete of it
and<00:05:12.430> yeah<00:05:13.430> so<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.300> works<00:05:14.450> out<00:05:14.570> pretty<00:05:14.690> bitchin

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
and yeah so it works out pretty bitchin

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.040 
and yeah so it works out pretty bitchin
if<00:05:16.100> you<00:05:16.340> have<00:05:16.460> any<00:05:16.610> questions<00:05:17.360> comment<00:05:17.960> rate
