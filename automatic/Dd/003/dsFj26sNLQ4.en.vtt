 such a thing so called firm 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.170
 mister called digital receiver 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.130
 terrestrial television with features 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.189
 Well, just a multimedia player 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 originally wanted to buy media 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.010
 player 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.720
 Well, so as to reproduce in the kitchen 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.550
 This TV is not worth it on the USB flash drive 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.190
 there is a movie what I throw off the TV show that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 There look so while there you eat 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.040
 Richardson cooks like Chris 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.050
 to diversify they are simply essential to this 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.320
 look here my choice fell on this one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.710
 on firm mister took the cheapest of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.340
 all in view of the fact that the most 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.859
 the cheap was flawlessly looked at 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.140
 Yandex market all the rest there are expensive 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.119
 there generally criticized them at all 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.869
 black this most loyal of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.130
 five out of five was the maximum 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.990
 he has a four on the reviews of people 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.640
 so well we look 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.920
 we get the game hotel media player 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.530
 take and then it turns out that it turns out and 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.820
 media player and as a digital prefix 2 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:34.490
 in 1 we look that he is so supported 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 video formats avi mic mf mov well here 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.259
 something like that who wants can pause 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.060
 watch so support video codecs 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.560
 mt4 mp2 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.679
 and there are such audio mp3 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:55.700
 I think everything else there you can watch 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:02:00.140
 also pictures so the audio outputs and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.670

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.739

 video output 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.200
 style and outs so completely 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.000
 accordingly, it turns out this 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.769
 Russian-speaking but 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.170
 Russified in his menu itself 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.440
 the good thing is that for this price comes the remote 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.209

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:33.609
