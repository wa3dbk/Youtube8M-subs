 the people we marked on the map are exactly here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.619
 that you have to be in this place that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.040
 It is a bit flat like a papaya with 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.280

 Are you going to have to do it? 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.819
 your precision rifle and will call 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:17.200
 attention from the inside of the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.290
 the dodo of the military base 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.900
 do not need so many people you 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.219
 need to call the precise call tank 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.500
 of war 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:34.560
 there he has to be more or less there 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.560
 So let's get his attention. 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.569

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.900
 It's more or less getting there. 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.780
 You do not need to be here right here, but 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.410
 for example here in front is up to 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.960
 better than giving more security to us 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.430
 came here is here whenever you have 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:18.490
 There you connect lecture lecture lecture 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.810
 discuss this and explain that removing 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.600
 wanted level 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.750
 ready the second thing that goes 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:32.230
 I 'll come here and get a gun. 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:35.020
 heavy and will jump from this place of head 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.000
 This is good, you have to kill yourself. 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.920
 Suicide why I recommend it 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.070
 that place because it is very high 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.630
 week there the second thing you will 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.110
 to make you will be born 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.600
 on the other side of the military base people 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.170
 was here so much that our bike stopped 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.690
 here I to mark this place right that 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.230
 then it's easier to find a bike and you 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.480
 will call your mechanic 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.790
 will ask him to get his bike that 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:14.250
 it's on the other side we're going to have a chemist ahq 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:14.250
 fire fighting and it's coming 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.470
 You can see that the bike disappeared from there. 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.610
 because he went to pick it up and she already arrived 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.740
 here left or kill him that there can 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.830
 until you get good face attentions, you take it 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.500
 your bike and goes to the same place where your 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.520
 bike was before because by what means 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.580
 that this was a cloning cycle 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:45.010
