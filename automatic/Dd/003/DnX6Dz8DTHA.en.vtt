00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the ab crunch works pretty well the seam

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.589 
the ab crunch works pretty well the seam
here<00:02:16.890> goes<00:02:17.220> almost<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.030> way<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.300> so

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
that's okay this is a separate piece and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.500 
that's okay this is a separate piece and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
it's fairly soft soft enough that it

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.530 
it's fairly soft soft enough that it
will<00:02:32.690> allow<00:02:32.990> you<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.470> use<00:02:33.710> his<00:02:34.010> standard<00:02:34.700> DCU<00:02:35.270> C

all<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> way<00:02:41.209> out<00:02:41.450> but<00:02:41.690> it's<00:02:41.810> not<00:02:41.930> bad<00:02:42.400> so

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
all the way out but it's not bad so

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.580 
all the way out but it's not bad so
that's<00:02:43.580> okay<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:44.450> have<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.660> thigh<00:02:45.050> swivel

that's okay we have a thigh swivel

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.430 
that's okay we have a thigh swivel
single<00:02:46.310> jointed<00:02:46.640> knee<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.180> then<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
single jointed knee and then the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.440 
single jointed knee and then the
standard<00:02:49.010> angle<00:02:49.220> which<00:02:49.730> works<00:02:49.910> really<00:02:50.030> well

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
standard angle which works really well

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.020 
standard angle which works really well
so<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.350> by<00:02:51.830> any<00:02:52.040> means<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.490> bad<00:02:52.670> figure
