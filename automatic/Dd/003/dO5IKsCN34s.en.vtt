00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.190
 Welcome back to how it is done. Initially considered as medicinal beverages, 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.320
 soft drinks were born in American pharmacies where pharmacists served water with 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.870
 gas of various flavors. These sodas became so popular, that customers wanted 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.400
 buy them in bottles to take home. That demand created the industry of 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.269
 soft drinks (coke, soda, pepsi, fanta ...) 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:37.210
 Billions of liters of soft drinks are sold around the world each year. 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.390
 These two-liter plastic bottles have just arrived from the bottle factory, 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.680
 Although they are new bottles, the soda factory has to clean them before filling them. 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.079
 This machine places the bottles upside down and then rinses them with water previously 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:04.420
 filtered. When the water has been drained, the machine puts the bottles back in the mouth 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.250
 up and send them to the filling station. Meanwhile in the mixing room, 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.110
 the technicians prepare the soft drink that will be bottled in this production lot. The basis of all 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.150
 the recipes is filtered water, which is 86% of the drink. The rest is syrup. The recipe 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.900
 of each syrup is a combination of well-measured ingredients, colorings and natural aromas 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.490
 and artificial, and one or several types of sugar, such as glucose or fructose, extracted from beet, 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.009
 the corn or the cane This machine pours the correct proportion of syrup into the 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.460
 filtered water, creating the final soda, minus the bubbles. Next, the drink 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.040
 travels to a pressurized tank called carbonator. There an injection of anhydride 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.110
 carbonic fills the drink with gas bubbles. The carbonated refreshing drink passes 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 then to the deposit. The machine removes air from each bottle 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:27.550
 and then fill it, in this case, with 2 liters of glue. 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.320
 Now go to the corker. The plugs fall through a canopy propelled by filtered air. 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.390
 The machine turns a plug on the neck of the bottle, joining the ring of the piece 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:48.950
 fluted and plug, and hermetically sealing the bottle. Next stop, labeling. 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.120
 One youngster applies hot glue to one metal plate after another. After each plate 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.030
 Take a label and stick it to a bottle. 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:09.530
 With some brushes the edges are smoothed to make sure the labels stick well. 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.120
 In another area of ​​the plant, a unloading machine picks up the glass bottles from the boxes 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.470
 reusable that have been returned to the factory. The boxes continue towards a machine 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.420
 of washing. The dirty bottles are directed towards a bottle washer, where 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.370
 devices line them up in rows of 16. Each bottle tilts and enters the washing machine 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.150
 By the neck. Inside, a combination of jets of water and soap, eliminate germs. 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.451
 Then the jet of water lightens all the soap residue. When they leave, they pass 

00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:47.760
 before a neon inspection light. The operators remove the bottles from the chain 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.400
 who have problems. Now the bottles go to the same bottling plant as before, only 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.010
 which has now been adjusted to fill each bottle with 300 ml of beverage, in this case, 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.950
 Orange soda. This company takes a sample of each production batch to make 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.460
 quality control Technicians check details such as dilution ratio 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.730
 of syrup in the water, the level of carbonation and the hermetic seal. In addition, they analyze the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:25.090
 purity of the drink and its container, passing the sample through a paper filter. 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.200
 Place the filter in a petri dish that contains the necessary nutrients to grow 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.410
 microorganisms. Then incubate at a precise temperature and observe if it grows 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.480
 some bacteria These glass bottles carry metal plugs, as each 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:53.310
 Stopper is placed on a bottle, the machine tightens it creating an airtight seal. 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.880
 The next time you want a sparkling drink, simply go to the supermarket.
