00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.000
 yes hello and welcome 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.940
 that is an attack of lorenz that is 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.849
 a player from my plan and he matures 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 Here against count of the khan from Turkish 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.690
 Army as you can imagine 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.439
 the 100% victory will excuse you 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.480
 spoiler alert in level 6 attack against 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.789
 a strategy where the walls are the first 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.730
 well over 50 percent and you are there 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.170
 easy to go through because he is after 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 distinguished a book about the sma 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.630
 can here would be difficult to obtain 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.770
 with coupies, it's nothing more than that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.270
 the boy jumps another hole 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.649
 that the rail king will go through it 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.040
 he can and makes her even when everything 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.480
 plans yes that's a quick attack that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.039
 You can feel like in the extreme league 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.079
 of course, imagine a difference though 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.270
 the interesting thing is of course is on 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.420
 At the end I will come back again 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.500
 that is a very long time it has 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 can always be attacked 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 and yes he is now lorenz is 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 now because ascended and now sees 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.589
 what has resulted from this he has 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.330
 30 trophies won 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.560
 if you've never had a weaker one and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.409
 a weaker one says the other 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 you get bow that means you can 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.200
 You can bring up to 60 professionals with you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.520
 win a fight so that's it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 double the average one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.869
 usually one commutes by which one 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.830
 you always do that for a normally 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.420
 the man between 20 and 30 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.380
 Yes, it does not matter with coupies is always 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.869
 abyss that is when we say for example 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.430
 an opponent have 35 degrees and you make 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.750
 who got a stand with him 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.330
 eleven professionals 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.920
 he would have had 36 degree because we 12 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.940
 points do not sound that always 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.560
 is rounded off 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.030
 and if you then sometime times 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.270
 really bad opponent where then the 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.920
 break style because so 0,0 what's up with that 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.260
 of course also 0 wrested and not 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.740
 so it can be 1 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.150
 here you attack only with one 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.430
 attack now 0 coup I can win 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.060
 that was thank you for watching and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 ciao
