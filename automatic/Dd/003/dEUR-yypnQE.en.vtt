00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
mechanics of doing this weird glitch

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.560 
mechanics of doing this weird glitch
maneuver<00:00:25.210> work<00:00:25.509> so<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:27.699> I'm<00:00:27.820> going<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.150> do<00:00:28.359> is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
maneuver work so what I'm going to do is

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.480 
maneuver work so what I'm going to do is
actually<00:00:28.750> show<00:00:29.050> you<00:00:29.109> that<00:00:29.380> without<00:00:29.710> going

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
through the whole nine very simply you

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.650 
through the whole nine very simply you
want<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.430> have<00:00:33.550> your<00:00:33.640> character<00:00:34.120> facing<00:00:34.600> away

want to have your character facing away

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.980 
want to have your character facing away
from<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:35.050> screen<00:00:35.380> as<00:00:35.740> you<00:00:36.640> hit<00:00:37.060> the<00:00:37.240> X<00:00:37.720> button

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
from the screen as you hit the X button

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.880 
from the screen as you hit the X button
to<00:00:38.920> breathe<00:00:39.220> fire<00:00:39.720> you<00:00:40.720> want<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.230> turn<00:00:41.680> the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
to breathe fire you want to turn the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.440 
to breathe fire you want to turn the
character<00:00:42.370> around<00:00:43.470> use<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.650> d-pad<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.700> move

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
character around use the d-pad to move

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.400 
character around use the d-pad to move
to<00:00:46.810> your<00:00:46.960> souls<00:00:47.380> and<00:00:48.780> when<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:49.870> do<00:00:50.020> that<00:00:50.170> let

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
to your souls and when you do that let

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.200 
to your souls and when you do that let
go<00:00:50.560> of<00:00:50.680> X<00:00:50.950> and<00:00:51.250> then<00:00:51.310> tap<00:00:51.550> it<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:51.790> hold<00:00:52.090> it

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
go of X and then tap it and hold it

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.810 
go of X and then tap it and hold it
again<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:53.500> in<00:00:53.620> order<00:00:53.740> to<00:00:53.920> do<00:00:54.160> that<00:00:54.340> there's<00:00:54.730> a

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
again so in order to do that there's a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.970 
again so in order to do that there's a
particular<00:00:55.540> way<00:00:55.990> that<00:00:56.200> you<00:00:56.290> can<00:00:56.440> hold<00:00:56.800> your

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
particular way that you can hold your

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.060 
particular way that you can hold your
controller<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.820> make<00:00:58.060> the<00:00:58.780> sequence<00:00:59.230> more

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
controller to make the sequence more

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.520 
controller to make the sequence more
likely<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.640> actually<00:01:00.730> pop<00:01:01.210> off<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.930> this<00:01:02.350> is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
likely to actually pop off and this is

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.679 
likely to actually pop off and this is
what<00:01:02.680> I<00:01:02.710> want<00:01:03.040> up<00:01:03.130> doing<00:01:03.400> with<00:01:03.520> Xbox<00:01:04.059> 360

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
what I want up doing with Xbox 360

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.760 
what I want up doing with Xbox 360

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
or middle finger right on the X button

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.230 
or middle finger right on the X button
here<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.460> my<00:01:13.120> right<00:01:13.360> hand<00:01:14.280> my<00:01:15.280> pointer<00:01:16.210> finger

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
here on my right hand my pointer finger

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.870 
here on my right hand my pointer finger
on<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.320> down<00:01:17.470> part<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.010> d-pad<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.640> course

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
on the down part of the d-pad of course

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.350 
on the down part of the d-pad of course
my<00:01:19.030> thumb<00:01:19.330> on<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:20.080> left<00:01:20.500> thumbstick<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.580> we're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
my thumb on the left thumbstick so we're

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.790 
my thumb on the left thumbstick so we're
going<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.540> try<00:01:22.690> this<00:01:22.810> out<00:01:23.140> and<00:01:23.200> see<00:01:23.409> how<00:01:23.650> it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
going to try this out and see how it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.040 
going to try this out and see how it
works<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.909> hopefully<00:01:25.300> everyone<00:01:25.750> will<00:01:25.780> be<00:01:26.020> able

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
works so hopefully everyone will be able

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.570 
works so hopefully everyone will be able
to<00:01:26.290> see<00:01:26.470> this<00:01:26.620> real-time<00:01:27.010> as<00:01:27.550> it's<00:01:27.850> going<00:01:28.090> on

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.800 

there<00:01:36.580> we<00:01:36.730> go<00:01:37.710> top<00:01:38.710> top<00:01:39.130> top

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.840 

that's<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.530> way<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:42.710> do<00:01:42.950> keep<00:01:43.430> holding<00:01:43.640> that

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that's the way you do keep holding that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:54.940 
that's the way you do keep holding that
down<00:01:44.090> sucking<00:01:46.899> that's<00:01:47.899> what<00:01:48.079> she<00:01:48.320> said

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.189 

I<00:01:55.270> caught<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.299> fish<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.930> was<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:57.770> big
