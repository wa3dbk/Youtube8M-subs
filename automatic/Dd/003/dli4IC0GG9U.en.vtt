00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
there's a real pumping heart and it was

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.350 
there's a real pumping heart and it was
a<00:03:59.650> pop<00:03:59.890> out<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.310> when<00:04:00.489> he<00:04:00.580> opened<00:04:00.940> up<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.150> pop

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
a pop out so when he opened up the pop

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.180 
a pop out so when he opened up the pop
out<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.660> was<00:04:01.750> like<00:04:01.840> pumping<00:04:02.320> this<00:04:02.620> just

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.520 
out it was like pumping this just
reminds<00:04:03.640> me<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.820> everything<00:04:04.330> that<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:05.230> think

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
reminds me of everything that you think

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.050 
reminds me of everything that you think
is<00:04:05.680> going<00:04:05.860> to<00:04:05.920> mistake<00:04:06.130> will<00:04:06.760> hope<00:04:07.030> that

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
is going to mistake will hope that

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.630 
is going to mistake will hope that
they'll<00:04:07.480> work<00:04:07.720> out<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.320> they<00:04:08.709> don't<00:04:08.950> maybe

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
they'll work out and they don't maybe

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.680 
they'll work out and they don't maybe
there's<00:04:09.940> going<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.090> be<00:04:10.150> something<00:04:10.540> better

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
there's going to be something better

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.090 
there's going to be something better
that<00:04:10.930> comes<00:04:11.170> out<00:04:11.380> of<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.770> this<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:11.920> just

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
that comes out of it and this is just

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.850 
that comes out of it and this is just
proof<00:04:12.610> of<00:04:12.850> that<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.450> just<00:04:13.600> reminds<00:04:13.959> me<00:04:14.110> to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
proof of that and it just reminds me to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.840 
proof of that and it just reminds me to
never<00:04:15.190> be<00:04:15.820> so<00:04:16.030> hard<00:04:16.330> on<00:04:16.450> yourself
