 school his boss told him there was a 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.059
 trick to be able to draw objects from 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.590
 an easy and fun way this trick 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.539
 was to make friends with the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.480

 teacher told them the story of the country 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.600

 look for other ways 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.399
 the country side of the block Dinesh 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.530
 was the country of the rectangular ones that 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.080
 they were distant cousins ​​of the block dinesh 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.690
 but the rectangle was not known 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.900
 immolated joined the group to continue 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.930
 looking for new ways 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.660
 they discovered in the distance a country where 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 all its inhabitants were round of 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.250
 different sizes and colors were the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 circulinas some characters very 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.320
 fun because they were always 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.930
 rolling the circulars thought that the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.740
 other forms were very rare full of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.000
 points and corners always very straight 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.240
 they decided among all that to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.210
