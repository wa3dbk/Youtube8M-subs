doing a unboxing today of the razor

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.860 
doing a unboxing today of the razor
Sabretooth<00:00:06.240> had<00:00:06.390> just<00:00:06.750> gotten<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.109> male<00:00:07.519> I

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
Sabretooth had just gotten a male I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.000 
Sabretooth had just gotten a male I
don't<00:00:09.870> know<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.170> mean<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> guess<00:00:10.469> we'll<00:00:10.769> dig

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
don't know I mean I guess we'll dig

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.910 
don't know I mean I guess we'll dig
right<00:00:11.130> into<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.670> saw<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.450> online<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.139> I

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
right into it I saw it online and I

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.259 
right into it I saw it online and I
really<00:00:14.309> need<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.639> control<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.150> thought

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
really need to control and I thought

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.710 
really need to control and I thought
this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.719> best<00:00:15.870> bet<00:00:16.430> so<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
this is the best bet so here it is the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.910 
this is the best bet so here it is the
saber-tooth<00:00:19.650> if<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.550> zoom<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.029> there

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
saber-tooth if it can zoom in there

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.939 
saber-tooth if it can zoom in there
focus<00:00:22.920> come<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:24.560> doesn't<00:00:25.560> look<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.680> it's

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
focus come on doesn't look like it's

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.080 
focus come on doesn't look like it's
kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.130> want<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> focus<00:00:27.080> there<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.199> go<00:00:29.090> so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
in like the irregular 360 controller

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
in like the irregular 360 controller
yeah<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.869> part<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.770> backing<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
yeah that's this part the backing of the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
yeah that's this part the backing of the
rocker<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.850> which<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.030> new<00:01:27.390> feature<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.409> put

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
rocker is which is new feature they put

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.480 
rocker is which is new feature they put
in<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> down<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:30.329> those<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.159> you're<00:01:32.159> able

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
in up and down on those and you're able

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.890 
in up and down on those and you're able
to<00:01:32.579> take<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:32.850> out<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> screwdriver

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
to take them out with the screwdriver

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
to take them out with the screwdriver
i'm<00:01:34.380> pretty<00:01:34.680> sure<00:01:34.860> i<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.250> where<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
i'm pretty sure i don't know where that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.630 
i'm pretty sure i don't know where that
is<00:01:36.079> mine<00:01:37.079> didn't<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.460> my

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
is mine didn't I don't have one in my

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.249 
is mine didn't I don't have one in my
box<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.630> don't<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.930> where<00:01:40.140> they

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
box actually I don't know where they

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.620 
box actually I don't know where they
would<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.470> put<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:42.540> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
would have put that but I think you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.090 
would have put that but I think you
might<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> use<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> Phillips<00:01:43.619> maybe

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
might just have to use a Phillips maybe

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.719 
might just have to use a Phillips maybe
I<00:01:45.500> think<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.979> use<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.490> i'm<00:01:47.579> not

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
I think that's all you use but i'm not

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.870 
I think that's all you use but i'm not
exactly<00:01:48.119> sure<00:01:49.460> what<00:01:50.460> i<00:01:50.490> read<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:50.850> were

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
exactly sure what i read they were

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.039 
exactly sure what i read they were
supposed<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> give<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> something<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.020> i

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
supposed to give you something but i

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.240 
supposed to give you something but i
guess<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.880> yeah<00:01:54.090> there's<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.250> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
guess not so yeah there's this the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
guess not so yeah there's this the
control<00:01:56.579> itself<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.659> pretty<00:01:57.869> nice<00:01:57.960> design

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
control itself it's pretty nice design

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.660 
control itself it's pretty nice design
it<00:01:59.189> fits<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.579> well<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> hand<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it fits really well in the hand the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
it fits really well in the hand the
response<00:02:03.240> time<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.509> pretty<00:02:03.780> instant<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
response time is pretty instant on the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.850 
response time is pretty instant on the
360<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.049> let's<00:02:07.049> check<00:02:07.290> what's<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> back

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
360 and let's check what's in the back

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.139 
360 and let's check what's in the back
here

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
here
