is I've shortened up the the lengths of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.040 
is I've shortened up the the lengths of
these<00:00:58.559> side<00:00:58.920> walls<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
these side walls because the the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
these side walls because the the
previous<00:01:01.379> modification<00:01:01.980> had<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.670> wider

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
previous modification had it a bit wider

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.929 
previous modification had it a bit wider
and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.840> didn't<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:05.100> my<00:01:05.189> my

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and I didn't like that I want my my

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
and I didn't like that I want my my
towers<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.500> able<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.740> hit<00:01:07.920> any<00:01:08.130> troops

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
towers here to be able to hit any troops

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.100 
towers here to be able to hit any troops
that<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.090> know<00:01:09.210> attacking<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.780> army

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that are you know attacking this army

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
that are you know attacking this army
camp<00:01:10.350> over<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.220> able<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
camp over here and I want to be able to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.000 
camp over here and I want to be able to
get<00:01:11.520> them<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> far<00:01:12.000> side<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.619> squished

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
get them on the far side so I squished

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
get them on the far side so I squished
everything<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.119> closer<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
everything in a little bit closer and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
everything in a little bit closer and
that<00:01:16.200> left<00:01:16.439> me<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.369> additional

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that left me with a bit of additional

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
that left me with a bit of additional
walls<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.200> I've<00:01:19.320> done<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.500> try<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> kind

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
walls so what I've done is try to kind

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310 
walls so what I've done is try to kind
of<00:01:20.640> curve<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.330> mini<00:01:21.450> pathway<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
of curve this little mini pathway here a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
of curve this little mini pathway here a
little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> slow<00:01:23.670> down<00:01:23.790> troops

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
little bit more to slow down troops

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
little bit more to slow down troops
hopefully<00:01:25.140> that'll<00:01:25.350> give<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.729> towers<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
hopefully that'll give my my my towers a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.840 
hopefully that'll give my my my towers a
little<00:01:27.390> bit<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.600> time<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.900> hit<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
little bit more time to hit them and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.130 
little bit more time to hit them and
it'll<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.900> bit<00:01:31.020> more

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it'll make me a little bit more

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
it'll make me a little bit more
successful<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.220> now<00:01:32.369> I've<00:01:32.579> already<00:01:32.820> run<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
successful so now I've already run this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200 
successful so now I've already run this
once<00:01:33.600> I've<00:01:34.170> run<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.740> once<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> base<00:01:35.939> set

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
once I've run be once with this base set

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.080 
once I've run be once with this base set
up<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:38.250> able<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.670> through<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.939> for

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
up and I was able to get through it for

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.480 
up and I was able to get through it for
the<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.240> first<00:01:39.479> time<00:01:40.189> previously<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> know

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the very first time previously you know

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149 
the very first time previously you know
I<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.790> doing<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.240> before<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.320> died<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> was

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
I was doing be before and I died I was

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.880 
I was doing be before and I died I was
away<00:01:44.399> my<00:01:44.670> mind<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.000> am<00:01:45.149> before<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.290> part<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
away my mind I am before and part of it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130 
away my mind I am before and part of it
might<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.610> I've<00:01:47.880> higher<00:01:48.810> level

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
might be because I've higher level

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.830 
might be because I've higher level
heroes<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.280> don't<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.329> that's<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
heroes but I don't think that's the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.780 
heroes but I don't think that's the
entire<00:01:52.200> story<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.979> good<00:01:53.280> chunk<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> its

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
entire story I think a good chunk of its

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.200 
entire story I think a good chunk of its
now<00:01:54.000> because<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.659> these<00:01:54.899> three<00:01:55.200> towers

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
now because I have these three towers

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.289 
now because I have these three towers
1203<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:58.140> lined<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.280> whenever<00:01:59.520> they<00:02:00.030> have

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
1203 all lined up so whenever they have

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.249 
1203 all lined up so whenever they have
a<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:01.469> enemy<00:02:02.189> heroes<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.030> troops<00:02:03.869> getting

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
a the enemy heroes and troops getting

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.560 
a the enemy heroes and troops getting
into<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.560> base<00:02:04.799> confines<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.820> three<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> these

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
into my base confines all three of these

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.999 
into my base confines all three of these
are<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.869> wailing<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> mean<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> think<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
are just wailing I mean I think that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.279 
are just wailing I mean I think that
increased<00:02:08.580> damage<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:09.209> really<00:02:09.840> helped<00:02:10.110> me

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
increased damage was really helped me

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.080 
increased damage was really helped me
get<00:02:10.410> through<00:02:10.619> be<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.670> let's<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> quick

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
get through be so let's do a quick

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it's laggy okay there now I never know

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.119 
it's laggy okay there now I never know
if<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.989> it'll<00:02:28.409> actually<00:02:28.590> show<00:02:28.859> up<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.069> the

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
if that in it'll actually show up in the

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.039 
if that in it'll actually show up in the
recording<00:02:29.549> because<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.000> know<00:02:30.150> how<00:02:30.299> report

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
recording because you know how report

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.319 
recording because you know how report
screen<00:02:31.230> recorders<00:02:31.769> go<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.310> hopefully<00:02:33.209> it's

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
screen recorders go but hopefully it's

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.879 
screen recorders go but hopefully it's
alright<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:33.719> now<00:02:33.840> you'll<00:02:34.139> see<00:02:34.290> I've<00:02:34.500> got<00:02:34.680> these

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
alright so now you'll see I've got these

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.729 
alright so now you'll see I've got these
I've<00:02:35.879> got<00:02:36.120> my<00:02:36.269> army<00:02:36.569> camps<00:02:36.870> squished<00:02:37.590> together

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
I've got my army camps squished together

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.610 
I've got my army camps squished together
actually<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.489> one's<00:02:38.750> down<00:02:39.750> here<00:02:40.079> is<00:02:40.170> one<00:02:40.409> off

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
actually this one's down here is one off

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.170 
actually this one's down here is one off
which<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.010> kind<00:02:41.579> of<00:02:41.609> weird<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.939> should<00:02:42.090> probably

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
which is kind of weird I should probably

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.379 
which is kind of weird I should probably
fix<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.739> but<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.829> idea<00:02:44.189> is<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.730> any<00:02:45.000> troops

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
fix that but the idea is if any troops

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.289 
fix that but the idea is if any troops
attack<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.169> hopefully<00:02:47.129> it'll<00:02:47.340> pull<00:02:47.639> both

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
attack one hopefully it'll pull both

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.390 
attack one hopefully it'll pull both
army<00:02:48.750> camps<00:02:49.169> giving<00:02:49.560> me<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.889> maximum<00:02:50.340> amount

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
army camps giving me the maximum amount

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.770 
army camps giving me the maximum amount
of<00:02:50.639> damage<00:02:51.060> possible<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:53.359> don't<00:02:54.359> want<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.629> just

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
of damage possible I don't want to just

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.509 
of damage possible I don't want to just
spread<00:02:55.109> them<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.650> only<00:02:55.799> have<00:02:56.010> one<00:02:56.250> army

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
spread them out and I only have one army

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.789 
spread them out and I only have one army
camp<00:02:56.760> worth<00:02:57.000> because<00:02:57.359> then<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.989> meanwhile<00:02:58.650> you

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
camp worth because then I meanwhile you

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.289 
camp worth because then I meanwhile you
will<00:02:58.829> get<00:02:59.099> some<00:02:59.310> damage<00:02:59.669> in<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.030> not<00:03:00.180> going

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
will get some damage in it's not going

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.479 
will get some damage in it's not going
to<00:03:00.389> be<00:03:00.480> as<00:03:00.689> much<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.859> have<00:03:02.069> both

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
to be as much as if you have both

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.819 
to be as much as if you have both
attacking<00:03:02.939> at<00:03:03.209> once<00:03:03.389> right<00:03:04.230> you'll<00:03:04.409> overwhelm

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
attacking at once right you'll overwhelm

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.619 
attacking at once right you'll overwhelm
them<00:03:05.099> with<00:03:05.129> your<00:03:05.489> your<00:03:05.969> Griffin's<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.510> this

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
them with your your Griffin's in this

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.990 
them with your your Griffin's in this
case<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.079> me<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:08.219> be<00:03:08.340> able<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.519> take<00:03:08.669> out<00:03:08.819> more

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
case for me and be able to take out more

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.270 
case for me and be able to take out more
of<00:03:09.060> their<00:03:09.180> troops<00:03:09.450> quicker<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.889> just<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
of their troops quicker so it just it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.520 
of their troops quicker so it just it
just<00:03:11.340> makes<00:03:11.969> it<00:03:12.060> easier<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.719> the<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.169> next

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
just makes it easier for the the next

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.459 
just makes it easier for the the next
waves<00:03:13.769> coming<00:03:14.129> along<00:03:14.629> as<00:03:15.629> you<00:03:16.049> see<00:03:16.200> right<00:03:16.230> now

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
waves coming along as you see right now

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.500 
waves coming along as you see right now
I<00:03:16.590> haven't<00:03:16.980> even<00:03:17.069> taken<00:03:17.579> any<00:03:17.879> damage<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.359> any

for<00:03:21.659> at<00:03:21.720> least<00:03:21.870> another<00:03:22.470> wave<00:03:22.829> or<00:03:23.069> two<00:03:23.250> we'll

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
most of these are level 10 but I've got

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.420 
most of these are level 10 but I've got
I've<00:04:09.900> got<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.139> good<00:04:10.319> number<00:04:10.500> still<00:04:10.949> there<00:04:11.099> level

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
I've got a good number still there level

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.590 
I've got a good number still there level
9<00:04:11.669> in<00:04:11.909> there

9 in there

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.480 
9 in there
and<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.840> definitely<00:04:13.380> need<00:04:13.770> an<00:04:13.860> upgrade<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.220> don't

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
and I definitely need an upgrade I don't

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.950 
and I definitely need an upgrade I don't
like<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.790> way<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.150> looks<00:04:15.180> when<00:04:15.570> there's<00:04:15.810> only

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
like the way it looks when there's only

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.100 
like the way it looks when there's only
half<00:04:16.170> and<00:04:16.530> half<00:04:17.480> so<00:04:18.480> look<00:04:18.600> at<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.840> we<00:04:18.959> got

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
half and half so look at that we got

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.410 
half and half so look at that we got
through<00:04:19.350> be<00:04:19.560> our<00:04:20.090> executioner<00:04:21.090> took<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.300> little

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
through be our executioner took a little

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.190 
through be our executioner took a little
bit<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.630> damage<00:04:21.870> but<00:04:22.260> not<00:04:22.560> very<00:04:22.950> much<00:04:23.400> right<00:04:24.200> so

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
bit of damage but not very much right so

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.270 
bit of damage but not very much right so
right<00:04:25.350> now<00:04:25.380> we're<00:04:25.590> still<00:04:25.800> sitting<00:04:26.010> pretty

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
right now we're still sitting pretty

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.750 
right now we're still sitting pretty
good<00:04:26.550> we<00:04:26.820> still<00:04:27.060> have<00:04:27.240> half<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.930> our<00:04:28.110> base<00:04:28.320> left

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
good we still have half of our base left

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.690 
good we still have half of our base left
if<00:04:29.760> any<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.390> waves<00:04:30.570> spawn<00:04:30.900> up<00:04:31.080> top<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.710> if

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
if any of the waves spawn up top and if

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.330 
if any of the waves spawn up top and if
they<00:04:32.910> don't<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.870> think<00:04:34.650> our<00:04:34.800> towers<00:04:35.130> will<00:04:35.250> be

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
they don't I think our towers will be

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.130 
they don't I think our towers will be
able<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.520> handle<00:04:35.730> some<00:04:36.210> good<00:04:36.390> damage<00:04:36.780> on<00:04:36.960> them

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
able to handle some good damage on them

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.260 
able to handle some good damage on them
before<00:04:37.410> they<00:04:37.650> can<00:04:37.830> walk<00:04:37.950> around<00:04:38.370> right<00:04:39.210> as

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
before they can walk around right as

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.550 
before they can walk around right as
we've<00:04:39.510> got<00:04:39.660> these<00:04:39.780> chunks<00:04:40.170> that<00:04:40.200> are<00:04:40.380> going

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
we've got these chunks that are going

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.470 
we've got these chunks that are going
towards<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.980> middle<00:04:41.160> for<00:04:41.400> some<00:04:42.090> weird<00:04:42.360> reason

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
towards the middle for some weird reason

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.680 
towards the middle for some weird reason
I<00:04:42.990> think<00:04:43.470> they're<00:04:43.590> trying<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.920> hit<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.160> tower

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
I think they're trying to hit that tower

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.480 
I think they're trying to hit that tower
let's<00:04:45.690> see<00:04:45.870> what<00:04:46.020> happens<00:04:46.350> here<00:04:46.560> oh<00:04:46.800> they're
