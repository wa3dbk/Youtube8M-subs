with red rosin paper it's cheap that

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.269 
with red rosin paper it's cheap that
comes<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.210> three<00:00:24.390> foot<00:00:24.630> rolls<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.279> what's

really<00:00:26.519> nice<00:00:26.640> about<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.939> there's<00:00:27.390> sort<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
really nice about this there's sort of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
really nice about this there's sort of
two<00:00:27.630> reasons<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.230> doing<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
two reasons for doing this the first I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820 
two reasons for doing this the first I
think<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> important<00:00:30.060> reason<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.439> that's

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
think is the important reason and that's

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.520 
think is the important reason and that's
it<00:00:31.949> provides<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> nice<00:00:32.520> clean<00:00:32.910> work<00:00:33.149> surface

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it provides a nice clean work surface

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.729 
it provides a nice clean work surface
you<00:00:35.070> know<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> under<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.570> subfloor<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.530> got

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
you know the under the subfloor has got

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.780 
you know the under the subfloor has got
sheetrock<00:00:38.250> patches<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.300> splinters<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
sheetrock patches and splinters and you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.610 
sheetrock patches and splinters and you
can't<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.180> draw<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
can't really draw on it one of the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.080 
can't really draw on it one of the
things<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.730> draw

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
things that I like to do is draw

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.500 
things that I like to do is draw
guidelines<00:00:46.219> very<00:00:47.219> specific<00:00:47.850> guidelines<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
guidelines very specific guidelines that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.869 
guidelines very specific guidelines that
I'm<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> use<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> progress<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.700> just

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I'm going to use as I progress to just

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.080 
I'm going to use as I progress to just
make<00:00:51.030> sure<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.539> getting<00:00:52.020> crooked

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
make sure that I'm not getting crooked

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
make sure that I'm not getting crooked
this<00:00:54.090> room<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.750> 20<00:00:55.140> feet<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.620> length<00:00:55.680> but

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this room is about 20 feet in length but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
this room is about 20 feet in length but
then<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> keep<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.109> way

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
then I'm going to keep going all the way

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.810 
then I'm going to keep going all the way
across<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> house<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.280> want<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> make<00:00:59.640> sure

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
across the house so I want to make sure

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.569 
across the house so I want to make sure
I<00:00:59.850> don't<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.210> crooked<00:01:00.449> um<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:02.129> second<00:01:02.460> reason

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
I don't get crooked um the second reason

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
I don't get crooked um the second reason
to<00:01:02.760> use<00:01:02.850> red<00:01:03.059> rosin<00:01:03.420> paper<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.930> any<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to use red rosin paper and any kind of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.780 
to use red rosin paper and any kind of
underlayment<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> provides<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.670> bit

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
underlayment is it provides a little bit

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.600 
underlayment is it provides a little bit
of<00:01:05.880> cushion<00:01:06.150> moisture<00:01:06.840> barrier<00:01:07.610> maybe

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of cushion moisture barrier maybe

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
of cushion moisture barrier maybe
minimizes<00:01:09.240> squeaks<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.659> little<00:01:09.900> bit<00:01:10.080> yeah<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
minimizes squeaks a little bit yeah I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620 
minimizes squeaks a little bit yeah I
think<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> first<00:01:11.820> reason<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
think the first reason is really the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.649 
think the first reason is really the
hard<00:01:12.810> core<00:01:13.020> reason<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> second<00:01:15.299> reason<00:01:15.540> might

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
hard core reason the second reason might

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.910 
hard core reason the second reason might
be<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:15.960> applicable<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.500> something<00:01:16.770> like

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
be more applicable for something like

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.780 
be more applicable for something like
pergola<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:18.439> in<00:01:19.439> any<00:01:19.710> case<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.640> thing

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
pergola like in any case the one thing

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.130 
pergola like in any case the one thing
that<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.970> want<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> point<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.600> before<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:21.990> get

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
that I want to point out before we get

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.340 
that I want to point out before we get
started<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:23.299> I'm<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.900> using<00:01:25.229> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
started is I'm going to be using this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.870

it and all that kind of ugly nasty work

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.569 
it and all that kind of ugly nasty work
it's<00:01:36.630> true<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.229> easy<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> have

it's true it is easy you have to have

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's true it is easy you have to have
the<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:38.909> tools<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.479> we'll<00:01:39.600> talk<00:01:39.810> about

those as we progress but what's what

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
those as we progress but what's what
tends<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.500> understated<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.369> how<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> lay

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
tends to be understated is how you lay
this<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.229> room<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.860> can't

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this out but the room you can't

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.780 
this out but the room you can't
anticipate<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.880> perfectly<00:01:48.329> square<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.790> I've

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
anticipate is perfectly square and I've

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.310 
anticipate is perfectly square and I've
watched<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.210> few<00:01:51.360> videos<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
watched a few videos on this and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310 
watched a few videos on this and
hopefully<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.250> that's<00:01:53.460> dated<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.240> those<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
hopefully see that's dated in those I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.380 
hopefully see that's dated in those I
can<00:01:56.280> tell<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> wall<00:01:57.240> I'm

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
can tell you that this is the wall I'm

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.590 
can tell you that this is the wall I'm
starting<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.229> hardwood<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.340> run

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
starting with and my hardwood will run

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.270 
starting with and my hardwood will run
perpendicular<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.960> joists<00:02:01.619> under<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
perpendicular to the joists under this

the<00:02:08.700> piece<00:02:08.939> of<00:02:09.119> molding<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.689> you<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the piece of molding that you see on the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.050 
the piece of molding that you see on the
left<00:02:10.469> here<00:02:10.769> is<00:02:10.890> about<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> half<00:02:11.609> of<00:02:11.790> an<00:02:11.939> inch

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
left here is about a half of an inch

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.420 
left here is about a half of an inch
further<00:02:12.389> in<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.109> then<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.709> piece<00:02:13.889> of<00:02:14.069> molding

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
further in and then the piece of molding

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.949 
further in and then the piece of molding
that<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.670> see<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:14.999> the<00:02:15.120> right<00:02:15.329> over<00:02:15.569> there<00:02:15.719> lie

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
that you see on the right over there lie

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.629 
that you see on the right over there lie
because<00:02:16.409> once<00:02:16.590> again<00:02:16.829> my<00:02:16.980> house<00:02:17.129> is<00:02:17.370> crooked

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
because once again my house is crooked

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.899 
because once again my house is crooked
so<00:02:18.590> one<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.799> things<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.310> find<00:02:20.609> very

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
so one of the things that I find very

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.160 
so one of the things that I find very
useful<00:02:22.249> are<00:02:23.249> these<00:02:23.459> these<00:02:23.760> laser<00:02:24.090> tools<00:02:24.480> now

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
useful are these these laser tools now

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.879 
useful are these these laser tools now
have<00:02:25.379> here<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.620> laser<00:02:25.920> level<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:28.170> wasn't

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
have here a laser level that I wasn't

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.009 
have here a laser level that I wasn't
using<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:29.489> all<00:02:29.639> for<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:29.969> level<00:02:30.180> capabilities

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
using at all for the level capabilities

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.220 
using at all for the level capabilities
I<00:02:31.260> was<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.859> using<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.370> laser<00:02:32.639> and<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.959> I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
I was just using for the laser and so I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.649 
I was just using for the laser and so I
want<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.739> get<00:02:34.859> a<00:02:34.919> nice<00:02:35.159> straight<00:02:35.549> line<00:02:35.609> so<00:02:36.599> if

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
want to get a nice straight line so if

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.659 
want to get a nice straight line so if
you<00:02:36.750> see<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:36.989> put<00:02:37.469> this<00:02:37.620> down<00:02:37.829> it<00:02:38.249> shoots<00:02:38.579> a

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:38.669 
you see I put this down it shoots a

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.179 
you see I put this down it shoots a
straight<00:02:38.939> line<00:02:39.120> across<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:40.739> see<00:02:40.889> it<00:02:41.099> up

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
straight line across you can see it up

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.670 
straight line across you can see it up
there<00:02:41.219> on<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.579> wall<00:02:41.609> on<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:41.939> other<00:02:42.000> side<00:02:42.419> if<00:02:42.840> I

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
there on the wall on the other side if I

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.729 
there on the wall on the other side if I
take<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.189> and<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.629> position<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.439> which<00:02:46.620> is

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
take this and I I position it which is

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.619 
take this and I I position it which is
what<00:02:46.889> I<00:02:46.919> had<00:02:47.099> done<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> little<00:02:47.459> bit<00:02:47.639> earlier<00:02:48.000> to

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
what I had done a little bit earlier to

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.689 
what I had done a little bit earlier to
get<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.019> guideline<00:02:49.260> right<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:50.069> I'm

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:50.699 
get this guideline right here I'm

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.189 
get this guideline right here I'm
anticipating<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.569> width<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.019> first

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:52.199 
anticipating the width of the first

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:55.909 
anticipating the width of the first
piece<00:02:52.469> of<00:02:52.650> wood<00:02:53.419> plus<00:02:54.419> a<00:02:54.689> little<00:02:55.109> gap<00:02:55.379> for

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
piece of wood plus a little gap for

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.500 
piece of wood plus a little gap for
expansion<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.579> contraction<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:57.419> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
expansion and contraction for the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.949 
expansion and contraction for the
manufacturer<00:02:58.169> specifications<00:02:59.099> if<00:02:59.909> I<00:03:00.540> just

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
manufacturer specifications if I just

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.500 
manufacturer specifications if I just
measure<00:03:01.260> from<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.219> put<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.209> mark

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
measure from here and put a little mark

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.559 
measure from here and put a little mark
on<00:03:03.659> my<00:03:03.780> paper<00:03:04.019> which<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.769> did<00:03:04.949> and<00:03:05.329> realized<00:03:06.329> it

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
on my paper which I did and realized it

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.479 
on my paper which I did and realized it
was<00:03:06.689> bad<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.349> do<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.919> same<00:03:08.069> thing<00:03:08.250> down<00:03:08.340> there

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
was bad and do the same thing down there

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.189 
was bad and do the same thing down there
when<00:03:08.609> I<00:03:08.669> draw<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.819> straight<00:03:08.939> line<00:03:09.180> I'll<00:03:09.629> find

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:10.199 
when I draw a straight line I'll find

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.129 
when I draw a straight line I'll find
them<00:03:10.260> well<00:03:10.469> unless<00:03:11.099> this<00:03:11.819> wall<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.180> crooked<00:03:12.449> so

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
them well unless this wall is crooked so

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.469 
them well unless this wall is crooked so
you<00:03:13.799> basically<00:03:14.009> want<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.939> use<00:03:15.060> something<00:03:15.329> that

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:15.479 
you basically want to use something that

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.589 
you basically want to use something that
you<00:03:15.689> know<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.079> really<00:03:16.680> true<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:18.299> really

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
you know is really true and I really

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.170 
you know is really true and I really
like<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> laser<00:03:19.109> tools<00:03:19.409> for<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.799> um<00:03:20.189> not

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
like the laser tools for this um not

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.939 
like the laser tools for this um not
terribly<00:03:21.569> expensive<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.199> really<00:03:22.530> worth<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
terribly expensive but really worth it

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.499 
terribly expensive but really worth it
so<00:03:23.430> I'm<00:03:23.669> going<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.879> lay<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.299> we're<00:03:24.419> going

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:24.509 
so I'm going to lay this out we're going

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.379 
so I'm going to lay this out we're going
to<00:03:24.569> get<00:03:24.689> started<00:03:25.019> um<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:27.030> we'll<00:03:27.150> see<00:03:27.239> where<00:03:27.359> it

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
to get started um and we'll see where it

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.979 
to get started um and we'll see where it
goes<00:03:27.979> okay<00:03:28.979> we're<00:03:29.729> going<00:03:29.879> now<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.689> first

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
goes okay we're going now the first

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.770 
goes okay we're going now the first
couple<00:03:31.199> of<00:03:31.500> rows<00:03:32.099> that<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.759> install<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.659> can

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
couple of rows that you install you can

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.839 
couple of rows that you install you can
need<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.169> face<00:03:34.409> now<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.489> mean<00:03:35.669> by<00:03:35.729> that

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
need to face now and what I mean by that
