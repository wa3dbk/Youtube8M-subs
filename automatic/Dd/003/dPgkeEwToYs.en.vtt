00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 since yesterday runs the first right 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 German youtuber film in cinemas and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:18.810
 this is about potato salad now 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:20.939
 Do not ask a new school if I am 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.680
 be the hero of the women start in team 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.720
 on which all stand and not all 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.890
 to earn 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:37.739
 so I think certainly not happy if 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:41.809
 I disappear with my cool then 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.809
 and somehow it's in front of me 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.040
 that is the location plan 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.610
 and sick 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.690
 as I do not have this morning 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.690
 tasted 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.229
 2000 let 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.170
 no noise now 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.390
 potato salad light is asking 81 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.170
 minutes is released from twelve years 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.550
 runs since yesterday in july 23, 2015 in 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.350
 the German cinema tells the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.540
 story of leo played by 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.100
 fresh days only one has he goes to one 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.750
 elite boarding school does not have there 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.460
 especially simple is bullied 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.260
 not really friends copies 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.090
 slate a situation in particular 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.619
 loudly the word must say penis and the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.210
 situation is absolutely not for that 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.530
 suitable and so he is their own 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.180
 dearest the school will leave but 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.380
 even the school itself does not like it that way 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.850
 really he does it on one 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 public school to come and hopes 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.780
 There to find new friends that works 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.490
 not really and in love 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.530
 he still in the top of the school 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.480
 but he could be too heroic than on 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.980
 once a virus breaks out and he 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.570
 maybe he is the last student 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.520
 manages to save the other students 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.780
 and that's the underdog a story 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.910
 you do not try the potato salad 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.260
 ask to be told as comedy packed 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.580
 Now this company to some 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 Special features he is the first correct 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.760
 youtuber film that means two felt 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.980
 third of the cast consists of german 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.990
 youtube from fresh days over the over 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.000
 baby over white city â€‹â€‹mister 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.280
 Dummy pack doctor know many others 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.840
 like davis schulz or flying uwe 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.280
 with it in so you can of course as 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.140
 spectators are happy about his youtube 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.790
 idole maybe if you call it that 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.410
 I do not know on the big one 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.730
 to experience cinema screen but for me 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.290
 As a film critic, the question remains 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.180
 raum it has become a good movie 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.900
 or a good comedy and I have to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.730
 to say honestly 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.980
 from the first teaser to potato salad because 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.480
 I'm not so overwhelmed by that 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.459
 I found the coach pretty mean and 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.930
 was absolutely signed when you look 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.000
 then you have to watch the film 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.650
 Honestly, you do not say that 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.790
 understand why you are so bad one 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.680
 so bad trailer to the movie 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.269
 has cut because of the film and that 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.310
 must be partly to the benefit of him 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.840
 elaborate has for many gags the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.610
 film tries to build up 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.170
 in the background has so elaborate things 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.730
 from dancing ballerinas to 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.709
 whole school adoption ceremony 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.910
 and the hundreds of extra feeling 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.709
 see are like a kind of small 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.120
 fireworks are fired and you already 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.430
 you will notice here for the scenery 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.900
 a lot of effort to operate and relative 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.070
 to create beautiful sets like the other one 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.989
 rarely combine German combine 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.220
 you have so much artwork that you look at yourself 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.420
 ask why could not you 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.920
 somehow a cooler trailer 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.230
 cut because the film is ultimately 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.280
 tailored to the youtuber of the index 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.320
 and so it is partly very 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.850
 not problematic in potato salad 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.260
 ask and I still think so 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.910
 Do not ask to put this German 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.019
 very difficult to try 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.470
 a story all the time 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.820
 fire 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.920
 the same one seeks one has in the 20 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.540
 seconds, the clock always happy 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.100
 same thinking structure makes and which 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.840
 jokes with eight that is still cheese contains 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.580
 A cheese slice up and try 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.770
 always the said joke by wordplay 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.060
 physically re- enacting in the movie and that 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.830
 you agree after a two times 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.600
 but if I look at it all 300 times 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.740
 guided in a movie then has to watch 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.299
 that is relatively difficult 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.060
 admittedly then get along 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.500
 The 20 to 30 also felt very funny 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.760
 moments in the film 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.200
 where I have to say here I had to 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.520
 really smile light laugh out loud 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.870
 the movie and there I was already one 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.820
 little surprised and the property tax 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.320
 b who wants to tell the film loses 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.210
 not really the whole time 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.520
 There is a cancellation 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.720
 plot is with which I have to say okay the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.610
 was a bit too predictable 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.960
 means the potato salad at the end 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.980
 Do not ask to become such a movie 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.080
 but has tried out 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.550
 For marketing reasons a bunch youtuber ago 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.260
 to ask the camera to hope that 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.670
 many spectators go to the cinema 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.960
 and I have it quite normal in the 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.340
 imagination looked with some 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.230
 watch the 13 to 17 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.360
 but also felt their reaction 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.860
 was relatively restrained and meant to mean 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.140
 Potato salad was with me personally 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.390
 never really the imagination that is one 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.160
 could be really good movie though 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.540
 he was very much trying to frame again 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.400
 to watch the film there is better 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.500
 become as the trailer suspect this 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.419
 but good or neat are still 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.770
 attributes the very very far away 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.450
 are and should mean that 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.260
 potato salad do not ask rent 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.030
 as a comedy 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.590
 Unfortunately you hardly have to laugh at that 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.450
 but now and then, as I said 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.650
 a really good gag and I have to 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.630
 Even actors have to say that one 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.490
 like for example there is absolutely positive 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.320
 also stands out trying 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.610
 of course his figure and main character the 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.140
 The action must somehow bear 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.500
 To meet mai plays for my 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.780
 taste 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.460
 around too many side characters still 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.840
 that did not have to be real and 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.250
 also willi did a good job in 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.960
 the over-twisted style I kinda like that 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.460
 inspired by a figure as chantal 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.200
 unpacks goethe thoroughly 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.880
 not so small acting 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.840
 Sternstunden but moment originated where 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.860
 got there that has me already 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.790
 I would have been a bit surprised now 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.710
 not at all dared 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.900
 At the end of the still a comedy but out 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.000
 comes the just is not really good 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.680
 that is not really funny many of 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.970
 the gags you've seen on youtube the 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.080
 works there too if you use it 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.280
 can watch for free 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.990
 why one is allowed to enter now 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.729
 I should be able to buy kinoticket 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.169
 but you did not explain it 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.370
 to give you a review of course 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.710
 present should mean 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.870
 Potato salad does not ask better than 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.340
 thought not for a long time okay 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.440
 by me as a comedy three out of ten 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.060
 possible points 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.220
 in total a movie gets from b2 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.960
 of 10 possible points and that is 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.910
 really a film where I say 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.020
 You do not necessarily have to do that 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.730
 especially if you are as youtuber 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.380
 maybe just this one time 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.880
 Chance has cinema on this big medium 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.830
 canvas to exist I am natural 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.700
 glad you tried it because it is 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.770
 of course a bit too 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.690
 certain courage is worth it at all 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.340
 try but here it would be more 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.750
 Potential has been there especially if 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.340
 As I said before, the scenes look like 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.960
 a lot is happening in the background 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.030
 I just shame you 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.560
 too much on too bad gags and the 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.850
 Marketing youtube on to this 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.830
 focused on making film successful 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.690
 I think it is a pity and why otto and 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.920
 coke permanently join in I know it 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.480
 it does not remain a mystery to me 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.310
 and there I have my role too 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.620
 Do not ask potato salad as I said 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.600
 since yesterday in july 23 in german 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.370
 Cinemas like to read a thumb there if you 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.080
 let's keep this review , let it stay 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.250
 not otherwise that you know there is 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.260
 still a few left around me and 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.810
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.400
 a new video and by that time I hope 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.750
 since tomorrow, of course, again 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.750
 on the 3rd
