because<00:00:17.650> raw<00:00:18.450> manipulation<00:00:19.450> is<00:00:19.600> really<00:00:20.260> part

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
because raw manipulation is really part

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.260 
because raw manipulation is really part
of<00:00:20.680> any<00:00:20.830> digital<00:00:21.250> photographers<00:00:21.820> workflow

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
of any digital photographers workflow

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.070 
of any digital photographers workflow
nowadays<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.890> you've<00:00:24.070> never<00:00:24.190> seen<00:00:24.340> raw<00:00:24.760> before

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
hundreds of sliders and tones and graphs

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.950 
hundreds of sliders and tones and graphs
and<00:00:36.010> details<00:00:36.399> and<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:36.790> on<00:00:36.910> but<00:00:37.420> today<00:00:37.690> i<00:00:37.720> want

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
could always change the lens aberration

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.170 
could always change the lens aberration
but<00:00:44.260> now<00:00:44.559> Adobe<00:00:45.280> have<00:00:45.399> provided<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.910> bunch<00:00:46.059> of

but now Adobe have provided a bunch of

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.780 
but now Adobe have provided a bunch of
profiles<00:00:46.630> which<00:00:47.440> are<00:00:47.680> well<00:00:48.190> perfectly

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
profiles which are well perfectly

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.030 
profiles which are well perfectly
tailored<00:00:49.059> to<00:00:49.360> the<00:00:49.480> lens<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.739> see<00:00:50.920> the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
tailored to the lens you see the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.340 
tailored to the lens you see the
vignette<00:00:51.370> thing<00:00:51.550> here<00:00:51.760> just<00:00:52.630> one<00:00:52.780> click<00:00:53.020> and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
vignette thing here just one click and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.310 
vignette thing here just one click and
it's<00:00:53.500> perfectly<00:00:54.129> removed<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:55.660> we<00:00:55.899> zoom<00:00:55.930> in<00:00:56.290> a

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
it's perfectly removed if we zoom in a

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's perfectly removed if we zoom in a
bit<00:00:56.410> you<00:00:57.309> can<00:00:57.460> also<00:00:57.579> see<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:59.260> chromatic

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
bit you can also see that the chromatic

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.830 
bit you can also see that the chromatic
aberration<00:01:00.340> which<00:01:00.700> is<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.149> color<00:01:01.570> either

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
aberration which is the color either

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.639 
aberration which is the color either
side<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.559> edges<00:01:03.119> that's<00:01:04.119> without<00:01:04.649> that

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
side of the edges that's without that

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.060 
side of the edges that's without that
with<00:01:06.070> now<00:01:07.060> it's<00:01:07.240> not<00:01:07.360> perfect<00:01:07.869> but<00:01:08.049> I<00:01:08.619> mean

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
with now it's not perfect but I mean

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.680 
with now it's not perfect but I mean
there's<00:01:09.369> also<00:01:09.549> a<00:01:09.729> slider<00:01:10.030> here<00:01:10.299> if<00:01:10.390> you<00:01:10.510> want

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
there's also a slider here if you want

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.500 
there's also a slider here if you want
to<00:01:10.780> correct<00:01:11.049> it<00:01:11.260> but<00:01:11.640> well<00:01:12.640> it's<00:01:12.970> pretty<00:01:13.270> damn

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
to correct it but well it's pretty damn

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.539 
to correct it but well it's pretty damn
good<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.200> Adobe<00:01:14.770> obviously<00:01:15.190> have<00:01:15.369> some

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
good and Adobe obviously have some

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.890 
good and Adobe obviously have some
engineers<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.150> house<00:01:16.299> that<00:01:16.479> have<00:01:16.570> worked<00:01:16.780> on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
engineers and house that have worked on

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.780 
engineers and house that have worked on
this<00:01:17.080> or<00:01:17.320> maybe<00:01:17.920> they've<00:01:18.159> interfaced<00:01:18.640> with

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
lens makers there are profiles for all

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.359 
lens makers there are profiles for all
the<00:01:23.830> five<00:01:24.010> major<00:01:24.340> lens<00:01:24.670> makers<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:26.560> it's

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
the five major lens makers and also it's

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.130 
the five major lens makers and also it's
a<00:01:27.580> fairly<00:01:27.790> comprehensive<00:01:28.180> list<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.900> lens

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
a fairly comprehensive list of lens

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.820 
a fairly comprehensive list of lens
profiles<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.960> really<00:01:32.200> want<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.710> show

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
profiles if you really want I can show

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.969 
profiles if you really want I can show
you<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.640> different<00:01:33.970> lens<00:01:34.119> but<00:01:34.799> there's<00:01:35.799> no

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
you the different lens but there's no

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.429 
you the different lens but there's no
point<00:01:36.250> oh<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:37.090> also<00:01:37.210> there<00:01:37.840> are<00:01:37.869> profiles<00:01:38.320> for

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
point oh and also there are profiles for

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.160 
point oh and also there are profiles for
different<00:01:38.770> fits<00:01:39.040> so<00:01:39.580> Sigma<00:01:39.970> on<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.270> canon<00:01:40.689> Sigma

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
different fits so Sigma on a canon Sigma

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.190 
different fits so Sigma on a canon Sigma
an<00:01:41.350> icon<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.220> on<00:01:42.369> if<00:01:42.759> your<00:01:43.720> lens<00:01:43.960> isn't

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
an icon and so on if your lens isn't

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.920 
an icon and so on if your lens isn't
there<00:01:44.530> for<00:01:45.040> example<00:01:45.460> i<00:01:45.610> have<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.880> canon<00:01:46.150> 100

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
there for example i have a canon 100

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.660 
there for example i have a canon 100
millimeter<00:01:47.320> which<00:01:47.770> isn't<00:01:48.070> listed<00:01:48.220> for<00:01:48.549> some

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
millimeter which isn't listed for some

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.719 
millimeter which isn't listed for some
reason<00:01:48.939> maybe<00:01:49.450> it's<00:01:49.630> not<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.780> berated<00:01:50.259> enough

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
reason maybe it's not a berated enough

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.060 
reason maybe it's not a berated enough
there's<00:01:51.729> always<00:01:51.909> manual<00:01:52.450> corrections<00:01:53.070> these

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
there's always manual corrections these

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.730 
there's always manual corrections these
have<00:01:54.250> always<00:01:54.460> been<00:01:54.610> here<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.060> raw<00:01:55.659> but<00:01:56.200> well

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
have always been here in raw but well

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.590 
have always been here in raw but well
they're<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.220> better<00:01:57.430> place<00:01:57.610> now<00:01:57.820> or<00:01:58.299> easier

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
they're in a better place now or easier

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.870 
they're in a better place now or easier
