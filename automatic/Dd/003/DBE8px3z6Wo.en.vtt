00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.250
 months not decided to do this thing 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.660
 I think of the marvel agent of child own 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.520
 today that is the day on which I leave 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.890
 the last episode of the first season in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.300
 america then marne reading out one 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 to the television broadcaster and told him 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.710
 the interpreter 72 is the neymar product 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.150
 me after rai saw the huge giant 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 successful the avengers movie is him 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.559
 now made to understand supreme super leaders 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.510
 of the marvel that cinecomics attract one 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.190
 disproportionate amount of people also of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.660
 comics never marks crap in his life 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.280
 has therefore decided to launch into 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 TV market trying to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.250
 chasing after what the dc kong is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.809
 already doing with the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 smallville tv series with the absence 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.840
 last year 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 manuele come out we find people 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.489
 phil course interpreted by a magistral 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 clark gregg miraculously invited to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.610
 needle seen dying inside his in 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 via managers who precisely following the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 orders of nick fury decides to form of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 a team a team they fight with e 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.329
 in fact, the shield's threats are found 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.309
 inside the cast clos bennet that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.020
 plays sky break dalton that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.270
 interprets the agent world needs now 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.490
 interprets the handicap mail agent who 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.110
 the telegraph it and elizabete tighten that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.640
 he is interpreting this TV series now earthquakes 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.770
 set after the events of the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.420
 avengers and the ainu while and throughout 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 the duration at least until today and that will be 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 transmitted the last episode through a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.850
 all the main films that have come out 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.259
 at the cinema or thor 2 and captain 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.630
 america 2 and from these widely 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.430
 influenced above all the events of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 captain america 2 you know elite 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.159
 etc. etc. 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.200
 in fact in some episodes are some in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.000
 this we say of the main threads like 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.020
 I told her that I think in episode 8 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.090
 Mary 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.710
 since this main summer present 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.990
 the last episode that I'm not going to tell you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.549
 but apparently written everywhere too less 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.520
 kept at least someone will do 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.490
 know it but read it exits let's say 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.649
 acts as a filler of what we have 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.060
 intermediate cine comic strips you have the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.009
 agents point of view inside 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.939
 of the outputs of the events they have 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.799
 hit the ground 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.560
 to me this is not sorry at all 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:06.229
 even if the first half of this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.329
 season is very anonymous because in short 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.829
 it is not clear at first I had to 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.870
 go to ward off the series if some were a 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.430
 main enemy to fight a 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.140
 in fact, the final goal reminds me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.030
 many of the seaside needs them 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.440
 we put it there for a case 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.540
 solve the episode after must 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.410
 solve another case go there and it 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.700
 they solve while after captain america 2 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.530
 the series is so influenced 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.480
 so much that it makes it clear that all that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.250
 we have seen before and connected together 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.709
 even all the episodes where maybe you see 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.400
 just the weapon they might have looked like 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.379
 useless 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 actually it is very useful for the plot 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.829
 based on how it is going to the development 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.359
 of history and this at least as far as 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.980
 concerns the fact well in the numerous 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.319
 points the second half indeed is 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.209
 truly up to expectations 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.950
 the influence of Captain America 2 can be seen 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.870
 it makes us enjoy it widely introduced 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.220
 from the movies to animate the episode 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.250
 final of the first season broadcast 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.170
 today I will not spoil province that to me 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.780
 liked it though I think they could 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.239
 managed in a bit better because here the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.010
 marvel has fallen back into its usual way 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.930
 story veil to finish everything or in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.730
 trance mode with battutine 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.200
 etcetera that is that mo destroyed tones 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.120
 slightly darker than they went to 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.549
 create with previous episodes 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.049
 and in fact this in my opinion lower than me 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.060
 I felt present as arrow that yes 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.579
 always takes much more seriously and 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.630
 much darker more somber and very 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.460
 more serious then in a nutshell 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.680
 but it is not egypt sheen i advise you 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.910
 to see it we also stop cinecomix 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.710
 you have all seen comic scenes 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.910
 look at it because I will show you some 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.440
 more interesting aspects 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.820
 let me know if you saw the series in 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.920
 English if you liked it he recovered 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.150
 in the final with a comment below 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.830
 let me know if you are living in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.220
 enjoying what you expect and center 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.540
