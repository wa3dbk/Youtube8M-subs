00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.950 
honest I died I think that there's a lot
working<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.500> likely<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.960> it's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
working here it's likely and it's it's

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
working here it's likely and it's it's
got<00:00:55.170> movement<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.980> fun<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> think<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.600> all

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
got movement it's fun but I think we all

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
got movement it's fun but I think we all
came<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> realization<00:00:58.710> that

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
came to the realization that

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.540 
came to the realization that
groaning<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:00.790> that<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:02.500> stepping<00:01:03.100> into<00:01:03.400> a

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
groaning and that we're stepping into a

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.020 
groaning and that we're stepping into a
more<00:01:04.089> sophisticated<00:01:04.590> place<00:01:05.590> now<00:01:05.890> it's<00:01:06.820> kind

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
more sophisticated place now it's kind

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.300 
more sophisticated place now it's kind
of<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.390> big<00:01:07.630> step<00:01:07.870> for<00:01:08.350> we<00:01:08.890> needed<00:01:09.130> something

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
of a big step for we needed something

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.680 
of a big step for we needed something
that<00:01:09.430> represented<00:01:10.060> that<00:01:10.240> sort<00:01:10.510> of<00:01:10.540> new

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
that represented that sort of new

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.830 
that represented that sort of new
technical<00:01:11.080> edge<00:01:12.510> well<00:01:13.510> when<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.720> need

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
technical edge well when you need

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.980 
technical edge well when you need
something<00:01:14.020> iconic<00:01:14.490> something<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.990> would

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
something iconic something that would

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.530 
something iconic something that would
stand<00:01:17.380> alone<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.830> eventually<00:01:18.250> over<00:01:18.490> time<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
stand alone and eventually over time and

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.840 
stand alone and eventually over time and
it's<00:01:19.690> not<00:01:19.810> easy<00:01:20.050> to<00:01:20.229> get<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.820> I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
it's not easy to get to that when I

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's not easy to get to that when I
first<00:01:22.060> started<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.390> project<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:23.050> did<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.229> giant

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
first started the project I did a giant

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.890 
first started the project I did a giant
brain<00:01:24.190> storm<00:01:24.670> came<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.300> realization<00:01:25.869> that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
brain storm came to the realization that

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.840 
brain storm came to the realization that
the<00:01:26.619> sort<00:01:26.800> of<00:01:26.830> most<00:01:26.950> iconic<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.729> most

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
the sort of most iconic and most

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.609 
the sort of most iconic and most
important<00:01:28.300> thing<00:01:28.510> in<00:01:28.630> football<00:01:29.050> is<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.440> bass

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
important thing in football is the bass

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
important thing in football is the bass
right<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:31.270> sort<00:01:31.510> of<00:01:31.570> like<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.020> know<00:01:32.250> this

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
right this sort of like you know this

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990 
right this sort of like you know this
live<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.110> die<00:01:35.229> for<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:36.430> I<00:01:36.520> so<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.700> delve

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
live and die for it and I so I delve

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.639 
live and die for it and I so I delve
deep<00:01:37.210> into<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.600> world<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.020> it's<00:01:38.500> sort<00:01:38.619> of

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
deep into that world and it's sort of

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.170 
deep into that world and it's sort of
the<00:01:38.740> heraldry<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.490> history<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.060> the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
the heraldry in the history and the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.510 
the heraldry in the history and the
colors<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:40.960> world<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.220> thought<00:01:42.369> for

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
colors of this world and I thought for

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.310 
colors of this world and I thought for
sure<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:42.910> is<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.060> solution<00:01:43.690> right<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.140> we

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
sure this is the solution right is we

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.800 
sure this is the solution right is we
can<00:01:44.470> make<00:01:44.619> this<00:01:44.830> joke<00:01:45.310> about<00:01:45.460> bash<00:01:45.880> into

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
can make this joke about bash into

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.020 
can make this joke about bash into
something<00:01:47.259> that's<00:01:47.410> editable<00:01:48.070> customizable

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
something that's editable customizable

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.609 
something that's editable customizable
by<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.240> players<00:01:49.540> and<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.050> they<00:01:50.170> could<00:01:50.350> take

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
by the players and so they could take

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.880 
by the players and so they could take
the<00:01:50.800> field<00:01:51.130> but<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.420> quickly<00:01:52.840> realized<00:01:53.170> that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
the field but I quickly realized that

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.670 
the field but I quickly realized that
the<00:01:54.220> concept<00:01:54.729> around<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.210> product<00:01:55.840> it's<00:01:56.500> more

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
the concept around the product it's more
