thinks<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:36.010> keep<00:00:36.160> them<00:00:36.309> open<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.540> spring

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
thinks to keep them open so the spring

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.710 
thinks to keep them open so the spring
doesn't<00:00:38.350> have<00:00:38.559> all<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:38.739> tension<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:40.600> the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
doesn't have all that tension well the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
short answer is yes it is better for the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.640 
short answer is yes it is better for the
knife<00:00:43.540> to<00:00:43.660> be<00:00:43.750> stored<00:00:43.960> open<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.440> let<00:00:44.560> me

inexpensive value spring-assisted knife

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.420 
inexpensive value spring-assisted knife
as<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:53.079> thumb<00:00:53.290> stud<00:00:53.500> or<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.800> spine<00:00:54.040> flipper

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
as the thumb stud or the spine flipper

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.090 
as the thumb stud or the spine flipper
and<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.000> way<00:00:55.090> these<00:00:55.240> knives<00:00:55.420> work<00:00:55.780> ah<00:00:56.079> this<00:00:56.980> is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
and the way these knives work ah this is

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.530 
and the way these knives work ah this is
a<00:00:57.160> basic<00:00:57.520> explanation<00:00:58.090> so<00:00:58.270> if<00:00:58.360> you<00:00:58.420> already

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
a basic explanation so if you already

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.450 
a basic explanation so if you already
know<00:00:58.660> this<00:00:58.930> bear<00:00:59.260> with<00:00:59.380> me

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
know this bear with me

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.510 
know this bear with me
you<00:01:01.210> get<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.570> knife<00:01:01.720> started<00:01:02.200> ten<00:01:03.100> thirty

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
you get the knife started ten thirty

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.940 
you get the knife started ten thirty
percent<00:01:03.940> out<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.390> handle<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.930> then<00:01:05.829> the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
percent out of the handle and then the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.219 
percent out of the handle and then the
knife<00:01:06.100> takes<00:01:06.399> over<00:01:06.850> if<00:01:07.540> I<00:01:07.659> were<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.899> slow<00:01:08.079> that

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
knife takes over if I were to slow that

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.889 
knife takes over if I were to slow that
down<00:01:08.409> it<00:01:08.680> would<00:01:08.770> be<00:01:08.799> right<00:01:09.159> about<00:01:09.310> here<00:01:09.899> the

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
down it would be right about here the

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.500 
down it would be right about here the
knife<00:01:11.049> will<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.560> spring<00:01:11.800> will<00:01:11.920> take<00:01:12.100> over<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
knife will the spring will take over so

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.510 
knife will the spring will take over so
this<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.350> art<00:01:14.530> hound<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.950> if<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.340> were<00:01:15.430> to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
this is the art hound and if you were to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.210 
this is the art hound and if you were to
take<00:01:15.670> off<00:01:15.820> this<00:01:15.970> pivot<00:01:16.360> screw<00:01:16.479> right<00:01:16.750> here

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
take off this pivot screw right here

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.110 
take off this pivot screw right here
underneath<00:01:18.220> you<00:01:18.640> would<00:01:18.790> find<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.880> this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
underneath you would find this and this

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.789 
underneath you would find this and this
is<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.300> coil<00:01:22.600> spring<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.630> part<00:01:25.930> sticks<00:01:26.530> in

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
is a coil spring so this part sticks in

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.940 
is a coil spring so this part sticks in
the<00:01:27.100> handle<00:01:27.490> then<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.330> other<00:01:28.450> part<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.950> this

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
the handle then the other part that this

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.520 
the handle then the other part that this
little<00:01:30.130> post<00:01:30.659> sticks<00:01:31.659> out<00:01:31.810> vertically<00:01:32.140> sticks

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
little post sticks out vertically sticks

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.200 
little post sticks out vertically sticks
in<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.770> blade<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.280> when<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:33.820> have<00:01:34.000> that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
in the blade and when you have that

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.380 
in the blade and when you have that
knife<00:01:34.420> closed<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:36.070> creates<00:01:36.490> all<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.850> tension

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
knife closed it creates all the tension

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.300 
knife closed it creates all the tension
on<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.630> coil<00:01:38.290> spring<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.770> tension<00:01:39.070> is

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
on the coil spring and that tension is

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.100 
on the coil spring and that tension is
stored<00:01:39.610> right<00:01:39.880> here<00:01:40.119> in<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.270> handle<00:01:40.479> then

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
stored right here in the handle then

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.230 
stored right here in the handle then
when<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:41.290> open<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.400> spring<00:01:42.670> takes<00:01:42.909> over

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
when you open it the spring takes over

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.350 
when you open it the spring takes over
so<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.979> reason<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.640> good<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.970> store<00:01:46.210> these

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
so the reason it is good to store these

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.120 
so the reason it is good to store these
knives<00:01:46.570> open<00:01:47.049> is<00:01:47.140> because<00:01:47.320> that<00:01:47.440> coil<00:01:47.740> spring

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
knives open is because that coil spring

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.250 
knives open is because that coil spring
has<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.970> tension<00:01:49.299> on<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.450> at<00:01:49.659> all<00:01:49.750> times<00:01:50.049> when

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
has the tension on it at all times when

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.700 
has the tension on it at all times when
it's<00:01:50.380> closed<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.810> long<00:01:53.020> answer<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.439> if

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
it's closed but the long answer is if

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's closed but the long answer is if
you<00:01:53.770> don't<00:01:53.950> have<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.130> place<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:55.119> safely<00:01:55.600> store

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
you don't have a place to safely store

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.950 
you don't have a place to safely store
your<00:01:56.140> knives<00:01:56.729> open<00:01:57.729> it's<00:01:58.119> fine<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.540> store<00:01:58.810> them

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
your knives open it's fine to store them

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.440 
your knives open it's fine to store them
closed<00:01:59.830> it's<00:02:00.070> not<00:02:00.250> going<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:01.000> know<00:02:01.119> maybe

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
closed it's not going to you know maybe
