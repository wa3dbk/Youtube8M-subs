00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
through that process so it would help if

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.420 
through that process so it would help if
we<00:00:38.239> have<00:00:38.540> clues<00:00:38.870> how<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.170> take<00:00:39.469> people<00:00:39.710> through

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
two basic types of decisions tactical

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.060 
two basic types of decisions tactical
decisions<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:10.399> technical<00:01:11.360> decisions

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
decisions and technical decisions

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.230 
decisions and technical decisions
tactical<00:01:13.070> decisions<00:01:13.520> are<00:01:13.640> what<00:01:13.909> a<00:01:13.939> player

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
tactical decisions are what a player

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.510 
tactical decisions are what a player
does<00:01:14.570> while<00:01:15.200> technical<00:01:15.740> decisions<00:01:16.219> are<00:01:16.369> how

does while technical decisions are how

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.850 
does while technical decisions are how
to<00:01:16.579> do<00:01:16.969> it<00:01:17.119> there<00:01:17.869> are<00:01:17.899> two<00:01:18.229> steps<00:01:18.619> and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
to do it there are two steps and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.890 
to do it there are two steps and
tactical<00:01:19.340> decision<00:01:19.790> making<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.450> first<00:01:20.720> is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
tactical decision making the first is

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.719 
tactical decision making the first is
intention<00:01:21.530> which<00:01:21.740> simply<00:01:22.130> means<00:01:22.159> having<00:01:22.580> a

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
intention which simply means having a

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.390 
intention which simply means having a
clear<00:01:23.030> goal<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.600> where<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.990> put<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.260> ball<00:01:24.440> the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
clear goal of where to put the ball the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.850 
clear goal of where to put the ball the
second<00:01:25.790> stage<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.330> differentiation<00:01:27.170> which

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
second stage is differentiation which

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.010 
second stage is differentiation which
basically<00:01:28.250> means<00:01:28.640> deciding<00:01:29.270> when<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:29.870> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
basically means deciding when is the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.039 
basically means deciding when is the
best<00:01:30.290> option<00:01:30.590> between<00:01:31.130> two<00:01:31.790> or<00:01:31.970> more

possibilities let's take a closer look
at<00:01:35.690> intention<00:01:36.909> players<00:01:37.909> should<00:01:38.150> have<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.299> clear
