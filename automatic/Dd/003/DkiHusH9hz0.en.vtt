00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.320
 hello I'm the professor and google graduate 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.510
 andolfi author of the book and the method of 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.860
 victim protagonist today I want to try 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.420
 in this video lesson one of the themes 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.020
 of the many issues that are dealt with in the 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.310
 book that is the subject of maturity 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.640
 existential 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:38.570
 sometimes it is simply spoken of maturity 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.970
 in life over people by 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.820
 example is said this or that person is 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.080
 mature or all of which other is more 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.030
 childish but I want to give it a spin 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.950
 of nut and dig a little more 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.800
 this concept of maturity 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.690
 because I want to talk about maturity 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.850
 existential the subject that we deal with in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.950
 depth in the victim book 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.550
 I'm going to leave it here in the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.550
 desk 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 a person usually is said or 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.329
 understands that a mature person is a 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.670
 let's say the first meaning that 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.360
 the culture or the people have about 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.179
 the maturity is implied to fulfill years a 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.500
 mature person is a person of 30 years 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.500
 of 40 of 50 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.490
 but not necessarily meet us 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.880
 ensures maturity in the sense 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.759
 existential in which I want to propose 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.759
 today the existential maturity 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.880
 may never be reached in life 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.820
 regardless of the amount of 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.659
 years that you have implies maturity 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:02.960
 existential taking a responsibility 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:07.310
 fundamental and essential about one's own 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.519
 life on one's existence taking 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.849
 in our hands the responsibility 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:17.060
 about our life about who we are 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.090
 in such a way that our path in the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.150
 life our existence in this world 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.390
 be a gradual to develop and 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.280
 bringing to the world all the potentials 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.220
 and all the potentialities and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.819
 They are sleeping capacities within 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:39.200
 us and that still did not see the light 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.079
 this is one of the features of my idea of 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.639
 existential maturity that I want 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.859
 transmit and that obviously as you 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.659
 you can give an account depending on what 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.799
 I 'm telling you it has nothing to do 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:54.590
 with fulfilling years is not fulfilling years 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.799
 how this existential maturity is achieved 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.730
 but it is achieved through a job 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.669
 introspective reflection of study and 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.950
 of deepening the issues more 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:12.000
 important of human existence 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.340
 so that I live who I am so I'm 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.489
 in this world where I'm going 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.480
 what is my purpose in this world 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:25.580
 what are my gifts and capabilities all 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.580
 those questions and many more 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.510
 if we do them on a daily basis and 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.580
 constant and deepen them 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.650
 philosophically through the study already 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.950
 through dialogue with other people 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.920
 they will be able to find answers 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.480
 of different degrees that we will be able to go 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.019
 giving a greater existential maturity and 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.000
 this will be able to favor us 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.780
 we go every time bringing to 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.290
 world over our potentials and 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.020
 our gifts that unfortunately in the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.400
 most people 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:15.420
 and they remain as in pure possibility bone 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.200
 sadly if one sees the world today 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.359
 what a note is 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.850
 that people are more 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.880
 what is stagnant 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.350
 the potentiality and the reality that in 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.139
 that transform the world into that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.990
 potentiality 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:39.900
 that is to say as a famous philosopher said 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.620
 the song of each of us what 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.539
 we are that it is not inside very 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.580
 in our dead without singing I do not know 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.759
 if you understand the purpose of life 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.469
 is that the song that sleeps in 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:05:01.740
 our that individual and essential being 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:04.650
 that we are called to do not 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.610
 remain as pure potentiality that 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.800
 song that we are we can bring it to 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:16.259
 world and we translate it into acts and works 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.469
 becoming fully what 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.599
 we can be and we have the aptitude 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.139
 but that is in power that is like 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.749
 pure possibility 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.080
 the invitation of these video elections 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:29.080
 what 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.639
 search daily and reserve for 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.189
 you self-reflection times of 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.550
 reading and study to go 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:44.400
 developing more and more his wood is 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.650
 existential getting into the issues 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.289
 deeper existential life 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.750
 that I mentioned to him a while ago the life the 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.030
 death who am I where I'm going so that 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.629
 I exist for what there are those who are at 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.259
 my side why are you here with me all 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.259
 these questions 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:08.490
 look for the answers look for 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.490
 a meaning to their life through them and 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.020
 go abandoning the distractions 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.160
 because many times the distractions of 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.740
 life they seem innocent they are not 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.970
 because the only thing they do is keep us 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.520
 away from these questions and therefore 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.280
 of the answers to these questions and 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.010
 hence these distractions we 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.370
 they keep away usually during 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.310
 our whole life of finding and going 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.590
 capturing our existential maturity in 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.100
 the same which implies as I said 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.800
 It took a little while to bring the whole world 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.480
 light our song all the 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.510
 possibilities that we have inside 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.670
 our to reality 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.090
 That is the invitation I want to make 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.620
 today to be aware of 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.750
 which has as tool for 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.970
 reach him the reflections that 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.310
 we teach and the methods in the book of 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.310
 victim protagonist but beyond 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.010
 this book or any other books 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:14.100
 to commit to studying now 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:17.040
 deepen these issues because they are in 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.600
 part the purpose of existence as well 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.510
 I say goodbye, I'm the teacher and 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.040

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.450
 book and the victim method
