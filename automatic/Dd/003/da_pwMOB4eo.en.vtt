tracks just a little bit over a mile

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
tracks just a little bit over a mile
short<00:00:28.920> wrecks<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.400> hard<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.760> this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
short wrecks are so hard at this

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.179 
short wrecks are so hard at this
elevation<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.720> know<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> put<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.859> serio

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
elevation you know and put your serio

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
elevation you know and put your serio
robic<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:32.940> no<00:00:33.059> air<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.360> breathe<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
robic and there's no air to breathe so

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.709 
robic and there's no air to breathe so
it's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:35.280> tougher<00:00:35.610> hang<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.480> short

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it's a little tougher hang on the short

it's a little tougher hang on the short
track<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.469> twentieth<00:00:38.010> time<00:00:38.250> grace<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> then

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
track is a twentieth time grace and then

track is a twentieth time grace and then
they<00:00:39.660> start<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> countdown<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.559> three<00:00:40.829> laps

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
they start a countdown from three laps

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.479 
they start a countdown from three laps
then<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.510> lap<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> bell<00:00:43.110> lap<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> final

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
then one lap the bell lap is the final

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.520 
then one lap the bell lap is the final
lap<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.649> saw<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.160> lead<00:00:47.460> changes<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:49.320> see

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
lap so I saw some lead changes you see

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.590 
lap so I saw some lead changes you see
three<00:00:49.829> guys<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.430> three<00:00:50.550> different<00:00:51.059> they<00:00:51.510> were

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
three guys and three different they were

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.700 
three guys and three different they were
in<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:51.870> positions<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.559> came

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
in different positions when they came

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.610 
in different positions when they came
back<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> say<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> climb<00:00:54.180> today<00:00:54.620> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
back down so I say the climb today you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.040 
back down so I say the climb today you
know<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.190> cause<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.489> guess<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
know I like this cause I guess it so

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.900 
know I like this cause I guess it so
it's<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.500> hilly<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.309> tough<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it's it's hilly you know it's tough and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.599 
it's it's hilly you know it's tough and
it<00:01:00.570> uh<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.469> fits<00:01:01.710> me<00:01:01.859> better<00:01:02.039> than<00:01:02.250> flat

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it uh it fits me better than flat

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.230 
it uh it fits me better than flat
courses

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.580 

you<00:01:07.240> get<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.450> little<00:01:07.600> technical<00:01:08.050> downhill

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
you get a little technical downhill

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.740 
you get a little technical downhill
which<00:01:08.740> is<00:01:08.860> also<00:01:09.040> great<00:01:09.400> because<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.630> know

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
which is also great because you know

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.160 
which is also great because you know
some<00:01:10.990> people<00:01:11.640> lose<00:01:12.640> energy<00:01:13.150> in<00:01:13.600> these<00:01:13.720> corners

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
some people lose energy in these corners

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.900 
some people lose energy in these corners
but<00:01:14.380> if<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.620> pick<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.190> ride<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.520> well<00:01:15.670> and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
but if you pick and ride and well and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.420 
but if you pick and ride and well and
just<00:01:16.120> stay<00:01:17.020> steady<00:01:17.320> on<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.800> can<00:01:17.920> actually

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
just stay steady on it you can actually

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.140 
just stay steady on it you can actually
save<00:01:18.880> some<00:01:19.060> energy<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:21.220> cars<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:21.640> me<00:01:21.760> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.940

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
top of the hill and got a little gap and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:44.910 
top of the hill and got a little gap and
then<00:01:36.070> was<00:01:36.160> able<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.520> keep<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.000> going<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.770> just

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
then was able to keep it going it's just

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.440 
then was able to keep it going it's just
so<00:01:45.430> short<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.910> intensities<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.330> lot

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
so short and the intensities a lot

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.360 
so short and the intensities a lot
higher<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.350> altitude<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.040> know<00:01:48.130> with

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
higher that the altitude you know with

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.000 
higher that the altitude you know with
the<00:01:48.450> being<00:01:49.450> an<00:01:49.540> almost<00:01:50.140> 8,000<00:01:50.590> feet<00:01:50.710> up<00:01:50.860> here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
the being an almost 8,000 feet up here

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.820 
the being an almost 8,000 feet up here
it's<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.280> it's<00:01:52.090> just<00:01:52.150> one<00:01:52.510> one<00:01:52.810> time<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.470> know<00:01:53.500> a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
it's a it's just one one time you know a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.200 
it's a it's just one one time you know a
little<00:01:54.220> little<00:01:54.580> harder<00:01:54.790> than<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:54.970> should<00:01:55.120> be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
little little harder than you should be

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.480 
little little harder than you should be
going<00:01:55.410> it's<00:01:56.410> almost<00:01:56.590> impossible<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.340> recover

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
going it's almost impossible to recover

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.650 
going it's almost impossible to recover
you<00:01:57.820> know<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.120> so<00:01:58.210> once<00:01:58.390> you're<00:01:58.510> over<00:01:58.540> your

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
you know and so once you're over your

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.150 
you know and so once you're over your
limit<00:01:58.780> man<00:01:59.110> that's<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.440> you<00:01:59.590> got<00:01:59.680> nothing<00:02:00.010> left

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
limit man that's it you got nothing left

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.220 
limit man that's it you got nothing left
so<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.940> kind<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.300> went<00:02:01.390> over<00:02:01.600> one<00:02:01.750> time<00:02:01.960> it<00:02:02.110> took

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
so I kind of went over one time it took

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.960 
so I kind of went over one time it took
me<00:02:02.350> about<00:02:02.470> three<00:02:02.860> or<00:02:02.920> four<00:02:03.010> laps<00:02:03.310> or<00:02:03.520> cover<00:02:03.760> and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970
