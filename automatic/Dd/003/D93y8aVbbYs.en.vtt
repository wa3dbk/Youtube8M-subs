very very disappointed so although this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.589 
very very disappointed so although this
is<00:02:10.259> good<00:02:10.500> news<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.069> they've<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.400> least

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
is good news that they've at least

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.990 
is good news that they've at least
launched<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.690> new<00:02:12.870> iphone<00:02:13.500> 5

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
launched a new iphone 5

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.830 
launched a new iphone 5
see<00:02:14.150> i<00:02:14.420> think<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.770> absolute<00:02:16.610> madness<00:02:16.970> if<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
see i think is a absolute madness if you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
see i think is a absolute madness if you
buy<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.080> particular<00:02:18.530> model<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.190> think

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
buy this particular model I think

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.190 
buy this particular model I think
they're<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:19.910> looking<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.570> get<00:02:20.690> in<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.900> very

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
they're just looking to get in a very

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.430 
they're just looking to get in a very
lower<00:02:21.680> price<00:02:22.040> point<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:23.390> think<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:24.200> they

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
lower price point and I think that they

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.780 
lower price point and I think that they
should<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.740> just<00:02:24.890> lowered<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.340> price<00:02:25.580> of

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
should have just lowered the price of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.780 
should have just lowered the price of
the<00:02:25.880> 16<00:02:26.270> gigabyte<00:02:26.630> model<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.130> said<00:02:28.550> let's

the 16 gigabyte model so that said let's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.670 
the 16 gigabyte model so that said let's
move<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:30.080> other<00:02:30.230> bit<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.470> news<00:02:30.650> that

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
and it's certainly something I will

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.080 
and it's certainly something I will
consider<00:03:08.330> using<00:03:08.770> instead<00:03:09.770> or<00:03:10.010> ever<00:03:10.310> know<00:03:10.520> what

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
I've got no real reason to change I do

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.250 
I've got no real reason to change I do
like<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.250> look<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:17.030> interface<00:03:17.600> on<00:03:17.900> one

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
like the look of the interface on one

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.690 
like the look of the interface on one
note<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.709> think<00:03:18.920> Microsoft<00:03:19.430> have<00:03:19.549> done<00:03:19.670> a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
note and I think Microsoft have done a

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.090 
note and I think Microsoft have done a
fantastic<00:03:19.910> job<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.440> comes<00:03:21.799> at<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> same

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
fantastic job and this comes at the same

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.729 
fantastic job and this comes at the same
time<00:03:22.549> as<00:03:22.760> there<00:03:22.910> are<00:03:23.030> rumors<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:24.140> office<00:03:24.590> is
