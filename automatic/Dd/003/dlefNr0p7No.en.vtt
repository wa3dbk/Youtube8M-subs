it wasn't too complicated

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.950 
it wasn't too complicated
it's<00:01:17.830> quite<00:01:18.010> nice<00:01:18.280> it's<00:01:18.730> not<00:01:19.090> too<00:01:19.360> much<00:01:19.510> just<00:01:19.660> I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
it's quite nice it's not too much just I

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.860

can<00:01:20.170> say<00:01:20.410> about<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.800> except<00:01:21.640> there<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:22.420> think

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
can say about it except there I think

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.540

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
there are a couple of plot holes or

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.420 
there are a couple of plot holes or
questions<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.610> really<00:01:28.060> confuse<00:01:28.480> me

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
questions that just really confuse me

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
Kate as a character she was a strong

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.570 
Kate as a character she was a strong
character<00:01:37.660> she<00:01:38.110> was<00:01:38.260> really<00:01:38.650> selfless<00:01:39.250> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
character she was really selfless and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.480 
character she was really selfless and
she's<00:01:40.030> basically<00:01:40.630> sacrificing<00:01:41.500> her<00:01:41.860> life<00:01:42.130> not

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.260 
to kind of save Ava as well as her
mother<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.520> think<00:01:45.730> she's<00:01:45.909> really

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
mother I think she's really

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.890 
mother I think she's really
compassionate<00:01:46.980> and<00:01:47.980> a<00:01:48.130> really<00:01:48.400> moral<00:01:48.900> person

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
compassionate and a really moral person

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.480 
compassionate and a really moral person
