middle here which is in cortex a9 and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
middle here which is in cortex a9 and
well<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.840> expect<00:00:27.960> from<00:00:28.470> Nvidia<00:00:29.430> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
well as you can expect from Nvidia the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.119 
well as you can expect from Nvidia the
name<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.060> computer<00:00:30.480> graphics<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.859> some

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
name in computer graphics we have some

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.299 
name in computer graphics we have some
nice<00:00:33.109> graphics<00:00:34.109> intensive<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.890> also

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
nice graphics intensive and also

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.669 
nice graphics intensive and also
computationally<00:00:35.960> intensive<00:00:36.960> applications

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
computationally intensive applications

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.799 
computationally intensive applications
running<00:00:38.749> so<00:00:39.920> there<00:00:40.920> are<00:00:41.039> two<00:00:41.190> screens

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
running so there are two screens

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.509 
running so there are two screens
connected<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> board<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.379> each<00:00:44.069> screen

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
connected to the board and each screen

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.450 
connected to the board and each screen
features<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.030> application<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.280> have

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
features one application so here we have

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.599 
features one application so here we have
a<00:00:47.489> touch<00:00:47.940> screen<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.559> running<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.979> sort

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
a touch screen that is running the sort

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.009 
a touch screen that is running the sort
of<00:00:50.699> head<00:00:51.210> unit<00:00:51.569> application<00:00:52.409> so<00:00:53.159> here<00:00:53.429> you<00:00:53.729> can

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
of head unit application so here you can

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.039 
of head unit application so here you can
well<00:00:55.019> here<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.620> control<00:00:56.449> while<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.479> climate

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
well here can control while the climate

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.349 
well here can control while the climate
and<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.459> of<00:00:59.519> stuff<00:00:59.579> within<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and all this kind of stuff within the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.559 
and all this kind of stuff within the
vehicle<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.280> while<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:03.089> have<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.389> other

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:03.569 
vehicle and while we have some other

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.520 
vehicle and while we have some other
applications<00:01:05.090> here<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.990> example<00:01:07.260> this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
applications here for example this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.580 
applications here for example this
navigation<00:01:07.979> época<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.490> very<00:01:08.670> nice<00:01:08.909> where<00:01:09.300> you

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
navigation época is very nice where you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.190 
navigation época is very nice where you
flying<00:01:10.590> throughout<00:01:10.980> sort<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.370> to<00:01:11.520> these

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
flying throughout sort of to these

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.860 
flying throughout sort of to these
buildings<00:01:13.200> transparently<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.690> well<00:01:15.690> then

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
buildings transparently and well then

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.330 
buildings transparently and well then
this<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.260> other<00:01:16.380> screen<00:01:17.090> which<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.480> a<00:01:19.340> very

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
this the other screen which is a very

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
this the other screen which is a very
special<00:01:20.940> because<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.600> has<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:21.960> wide

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
special because it has a very wide

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.220 
special because it has a very wide
aspect<00:01:22.860> ratio<00:01:23.190> 8<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.550> 3<00:01:23.760> and<00:01:24.120> resolution<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
aspect ratio 8 to 3 and resolution of

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.360 
aspect ratio 8 to 3 and resolution of
1280<00:01:25.770> x<00:01:26.070> 480<00:01:26.760> so<00:01:27.510> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.260> we<00:01:28.380> find<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.250> an

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
1280 x 480 so this is what we find in an

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.960 
1280 x 480 so this is what we find in an
automotive<00:01:29.730> environment<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.720> case<00:01:30.990> it's

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
automotive environment in this case it's

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.310 
automotive environment in this case it's
it<00:01:32.970> shows<00:01:33.210> an<00:01:33.450> instrument<00:01:33.960> cluster

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it shows an instrument cluster

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.290 
it shows an instrument cluster

can still run without jitter and the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.160 
can still run without jitter and the
same<00:03:07.830> way<00:03:08.340> as<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.790> would<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.780> would<00:03:09.960> be<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
same way as it would if it would be the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.480 
same way as it would if it would be the
only<00:03:10.440> thing<00:03:10.680> running<00:03:10.830> on<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.730> processor<00:03:11.850> and

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
only thing running on the processor and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.810 
only thing running on the processor and
all<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.700> while<00:03:14.880> we<00:03:15.300> are<00:03:15.450> allowing<00:03:15.780> some

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
all the while we are allowing some

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.590 
all the while we are allowing some
communication<00:03:17.820> between<00:03:17.940> these<00:03:18.210> partitions

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
communication between these partitions

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.960 
communication between these partitions
so<00:03:18.990> for<00:03:19.380> example<00:03:19.800> these<00:03:19.890> can<00:03:20.220> messages<00:03:20.640> with<00:03:20.940> a

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
so for example these can messages with a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.710 
so for example these can messages with a
speed<00:03:21.330> 12<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.320> canvas<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.160> are<00:03:23.400> then

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
Linux operating system and finally

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.220 
Linux operating system and finally
arrived<00:03:28.470> at<00:03:28.800> this<00:03:29.040> instrument<00:03:29.700> cluster

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
arrived at this instrument cluster

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.880 
arrived at this instrument cluster
application<00:03:32.570> we<00:03:33.570> also<00:03:33.600> feature<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.739> other

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
application we also feature the other

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.640 
application we also feature the other
way<00:03:35.040> around<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:36.660> outer<00:03:37.050> operating

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
way around so this outer operating

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.120 
way around so this outer operating
system<00:03:37.980> produces<00:03:38.550> some<00:03:39.650> heartbeat<00:03:40.650> messages

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
system produces some heartbeat messages

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.930 
system produces some heartbeat messages
that<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:42.630> inject<00:03:43.140> into<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.440> canvas<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:44.130> here

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
that it inject into the canvas and here

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.940 
that it inject into the canvas and here
on<00:03:45.090> our<00:03:45.300> desktop<00:03:45.720> application<00:03:46.650> we<00:03:46.770> can<00:03:46.800> see

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
on our desktop application we can see

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.840 
on our desktop application we can see
that<00:03:47.220> these<00:03:47.430> arrived<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.440> there<00:03:49.820> they<00:03:50.820> are

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
that these arrived and there they are

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.479 
that these arrived and there they are
sent<00:03:51.180> out<00:03:51.300> exactly<00:03:51.900> once<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.200> second<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.739> as

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
sent out exactly once a second and as

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.740 
sent out exactly once a second and as
you<00:03:53.610> can<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:53.790> here<00:03:54.120> from<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.420> numbers

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
you can see here from the numbers

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.770 
you can see here from the numbers
there's<00:03:55.170> no<00:03:55.470> jitter<00:03:55.860> there<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.390> exactly

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
there's no jitter there that is exactly

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.360 
there's no jitter there that is exactly
the<00:03:57.989> way<00:03:58.110> it's<00:03:58.380> supposed<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.800> because<00:03:58.920> lt's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
the way it's supposed to be because lt's

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.699 
the way it's supposed to be because lt's
is<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.580> real-time<00:04:00.000> operating<00:04:00.390> system<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.080> it

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
is a real-time operating system and it

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.740 
is a real-time operating system and it
has<00:04:01.830> very<00:04:02.070> strong<00:04:02.430> requirements<00:04:03.120> on<00:04:03.270> safety

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
has very strong requirements on safety

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.280 
has very strong requirements on safety
and<00:04:03.780> security<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:04.800> on<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.750> all<00:04:06.750> these<00:04:06.959> can

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
and security and so on and all these can

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.710 
and security and so on and all these can
still<00:04:07.530> be<00:04:07.680> enforced<00:04:08.239> on<00:04:09.239> our<00:04:09.570> virtualization
