just<00:01:34.860> cuz<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.070> didn't<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.400> these<00:01:35.549> sets<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
just cuz i didn't have these sets so

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
just cuz i didn't have these sets so
real<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:38.220> know<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> best<00:01:38.610> killstreak<00:01:38.850> set<00:01:39.150> up

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
real you know the best killstreak set up

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
real you know the best killstreak set up
for<00:01:39.450> running<00:01:39.659> non-lethal<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.409> opinion<00:01:40.680> is

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
for running non-lethal in my opinion is

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.179 
for running non-lethal in my opinion is
the<00:01:41.340> UAV<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.509> vsat<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> EMP<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> i<00:01:44.040> say

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the UAV the vsat and the EMP and i say

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.590 
the UAV the vsat and the EMP and i say
this<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.119> once<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> your

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this because you know once you get your

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.039 
this because you know once you get your
UAV<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.350> kind<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.119> kind<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> motivating

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
UAV it's kind of a kind of a motivating

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.480 
UAV it's kind of a kind of a motivating
factor<00:01:49.229> almost<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.009> motivating

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
factor almost not really motivating

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.550 
factor almost not really motivating
factor<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.450> kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.689> helps<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.320> your

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
factor but it kind of helps you get your

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.929 
factor but it kind of helps you get your
vsat<00:01:53.040> because<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.460> where<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> enemies

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
vsat because you know where the enemies

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.690 
vsat because you know where the enemies
are<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.750> once<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.200> visa<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
are and then once you get your visa you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
are and then once you get your visa you
call<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> call<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.360> obviously<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.930> get

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
call you call that in obviously you get

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
call you call that in obviously you get
a<00:01:58.079> kill<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:58.979> EMP<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
a kill and then get your EMP and then it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.149 
a kill and then get your EMP and then it
just<00:02:00.719> works<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.200> an<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> chain<00:02:01.740> over<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
just works like an in a chain over and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.350 
just works like an in a chain over and
over<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.430> over<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.090> such<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> great

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
over and over and it's just such a great

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.380 
over and over and it's just such a great
setup<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.229> once<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> EMP<00:02:05.390> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
setup because once you get that EMP the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.150 
setup because once you get that EMP the
enemies<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.110> totally<00:02:07.530> disoriented

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
enemies are just totally disoriented

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.499 
enemies are just totally disoriented
especially<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.700> they're<00:02:08.849> noobs<00:02:09.060> they'll<00:02:09.360> have

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
especially if they're noobs they'll have

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.940 
especially if they're noobs they'll have
absolutely<00:02:10.050> no<00:02:10.170> idea<00:02:10.200> what's<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.800> there

you can get you know 10 and under but

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.600 
you can get you know 10 and under but
for<00:02:50.350> non-lethal<00:02:50.620> you're<00:02:50.980> most<00:02:51.160> likely<00:02:51.370> going

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
for non-lethal you're most likely going

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.710 
for non-lethal you're most likely going
to<00:02:51.670> get<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.850> lot<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:52.060> deaths<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.510> just<00:02:52.630> gonna

result<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.090> dying<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.450> lot<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:01.930> for<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.800> i

result in you dying a lot so for that i

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.680 
result in you dying a lot so for that i
recommend<00:03:03.310> using<00:03:03.580> attack<00:03:03.940> insurgents<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.600> you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
recommend using attack insurgents so you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.940 
recommend using attack insurgents so you
don't<00:03:04.840> have<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.230> know<00:03:05.350> run<00:03:05.500> out<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.739> your

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
don't have to you know run out of your

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.500 
don't have to you know run out of your
spawn<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:06.400> all<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.610> way<00:03:06.730> back<00:03:06.880> in<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.090> enemy

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
spawn and all the way back in the enemy

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.390 
spawn and all the way back in the enemy
spawn<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.020> wasn't<00:03:08.680> using<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.340> game

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
spawn I wasn't using that in this game

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.590 
spawn I wasn't using that in this game
because<00:03:09.700> obviously<00:03:09.940> didn't<00:03:10.390> have<00:03:10.510> it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
because obviously didn't have it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.330 
because obviously didn't have it
unlocked<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.200> uh<00:03:11.260> now<00:03:11.830> I<00:03:11.860> finally<00:03:12.160> have

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
unlocked but uh now I finally have

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.850 
unlocked but uh now I finally have
everything<00:03:12.580> unlocked<00:03:13.150> but<00:03:13.510> anyway<00:03:14.440> back<00:03:14.800> on

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
everything unlocked but anyway back on

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.100 
everything unlocked but anyway back on
track<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.550> definitely<00:03:16.090> recommend<00:03:16.330> using<00:03:16.720> takn

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
track I definitely recommend using takn

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.690 
track I definitely recommend using takn
