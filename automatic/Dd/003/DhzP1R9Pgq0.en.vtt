00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.980
 as its name of gilberto that we are 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.020
 in technopark scene 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.460
 in the city of Cali this is the node 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.610
 Cali and is showing us a printer 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:22.330
 3d s Alberto forward explain us which one 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.800
 is the input how it works and nothing 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.390
 It is a machine that serves it for 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 perform with two types 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820
 functional 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.740
 and then we printed it to drop the 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.000
 machine for you for now to evaluate 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.190
 its geometry and its texture its shape 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.840
 visual aspect and its impact on the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.920
 client surely when they have it in 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.720
 the hand is correct if it was printed 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.370
 also first you did it in autocad or 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.460
 in a program almost capture program 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.629
 60 inventions of suns every day 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.480
 ok and then with this input that is 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.940
 that the machine I had the idea that 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.490
 put for example a square a cube 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.500
 and that the machine was taking pieces 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.570
 until leaving that will be my idea that would be 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.880
 one type of machining by starting 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.440
 chip the machine then the machine 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.440
 mind prints specifically where the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.440
 material 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.590
 and this I know then freezes or cools 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.810
 There is this resin called crystal 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.620
 basically it's a polymer type 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.620
 acrylic 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.860
 that is the material of this element 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:54.710
 the complexity and the white colors and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.930
 blue helps us to get another type of 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.030
 colors but there are others that do 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 color in the image 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.409
 it may be that maximum size can be 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.660
 pleasant fixed 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.229
 only for prototypes and there are some more 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.030
 large and 2 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 it is a way 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.790
 and already makes the planes of the guns 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.790
 Now I'm going to make them 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.000
 and he said he has guns internally 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.880
 with the nozzles they are doing the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.950
 suction of the resin she to the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.780
 flock making a micro mold for 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.370
 do the layered measurement the method of 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.590
 of making the agents by layers capable 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.130
 let's say five tenths of a height ago 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.270
 the micro mold injects happen 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.940
 immediately it moves backwards and 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.070
 makes a drying a peak 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.230
 he goes back to the work place 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.660
 again makes a micro mold of other 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.760
 five tenths of height inject review 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.590
 where you have to bring resin and go back to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.420
 element almost consecutively until 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:19.610
 reach the height zeta 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.610
 and ready all these auguries 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.719
 where it does not go 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:32.719
 resin and at home already because the support 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:33.980
 let's say already if all this is brought to a 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.269
 oven 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.269
 it's basically this 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.290
 if the temperature of 80 degrees also 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.290
 because there is 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.329
 and it would be to retire in the key you ask the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.329
 final object 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.189
 synthetically so that for 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.499
 evaluate and for there is not a production 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.819
 let's say 20 or 250 thousand days and for 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.359
 realize that today we committed a 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.359
 correct error 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.359
 3 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.889
 happy 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.769
 thank you very much, it's a pleasure
