00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.850
 new video I am Ã¡lvarez del vayo and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.470
 today we are with a video in what we 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.160
 I recommend a mobile below a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.910
 price in this case 400 euros we are going to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.910
 by the top of the range 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.410
 this time there are three mobile phones 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.640
 new that we have selected are three 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.770
 mobile phones that have a relationship 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.349
 very good quality-price are very mobile 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.050
 powerful but they do not get to be the most 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.379
 that we can buy on android the 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 first of them is the lg 3 a terminal 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.280
 top of last year's range that's going to be 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.080
 replaced shortly by axis 4 but 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.220
 that has a really tempting price 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.980
 between 300 and 350 euros we talk about a 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.620
 mobile with 2 cab screen with 2 gigs of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.600
 ram processor to 2.5 gigahertz 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.329
 four cores has a charge 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.969
 wireless infrared sensor the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.649
 truth is that they are quite benefits 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.140
 interesting as for example the approach 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.930
 by laser is my head mobile as 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.280
 you know many and today I follow 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.619
 recommending because in relation 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.410
 There are better quality-prices but no 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.780
 there are better is cheaper of course 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.729
 always from my point of view the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.810
 second of the terminals is the engine or 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.539
 the bike x2014 a smartphone that without being 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.060
 a stop range in performance as 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.859
 what happens to the g3 is still very 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.509
 interesting 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:31.460
 quality-price a few materials 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.609
 curious about everything that has the lid 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.009
 bamboo back and that also studies 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.049
 very good the screen size ratio 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.450
 thing that also happened to him the g3 that is to say 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.119
 that have very large screens for the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.490
 physical size of the mobile however is 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.090
 important to note that they are mobile that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.509
 they are great the g3 has 5.5 inches the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.969
 motor or the x2014 motorcycle has 5.2 inches 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.439
 and the truth is that this is something that 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.899
 what to keep in mind 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.810
 clean android of course control by 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.869
 quite advanced voice and especially a 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.269
 line of updates that good very 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.280
 happy are the users with her the 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.549
 third of the mobiles is also very 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.129
 Large 5.5 inches for the one plus one 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.780
 one of the surprises of last year and 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.790
 that surely this year with the second 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.620
 so let's also see how a 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.720
 interesting terminal the most remarkable thing 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 because it has a full hd screen is 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.640
 say that the battery is pretty much better 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.500
 that in the case of moto x2014 that the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.209
 axis 3 because they are not in any of the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.260
 two cases their strengths especially 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.090
 in the lg 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.329
 and the one plus one because it brings the truth 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.280
 a pretty decent autonomy a 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.140
 camera that meets an acceptable screen 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.250
 it's not a gamut but it's also 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.250
 We are talking about a mobile 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.849
 which is around 300 350 euros 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.590
 with 3 gigs of ram versions up to 64 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.510
 gigabytes of internal storage a 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.610
 back texture on the black model very 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.610
 curious that everyone who likes it has liked 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.069
 has tried and of course a version of 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.040
 android that without being android stock because 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.409
 does not come from the hand of google in both 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.299
 the same with nexus or motorola yes that 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.879
 comes from the hand of 100 or jim though 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.040
 Obviously the one plus company now 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.739
 has an alternative version of this 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.620
 Andrew's system they rely on today 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.360
 of disputes and others 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.430
 it is also a terminal really 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.190
 interesting are three terminals between 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.159
 300 and 400 euros because below 300 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.110
 we already recommend others all three 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.750
 we have tested the tests on android fax 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.659
 we really liked me personally 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.209
 I have the LG 3 I would choose it again but 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.099
 not for that reason discarded the other two for 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.780
 according to which user profiles as 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.690
 you always know the best mobile is the one 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.790
 more is adapted to your needs by the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.680
 lowest possible price if you liked the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.849
 video 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.590
 We appreciate a like I like it already 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.569
 you know if I had any questions with the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.459
 leave in the comments or on the blog 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.900
 in fast can drive dotcom and by 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.900
 course see you tomorrow in another video
