eight<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> nine<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:48.390> pretty<00:01:48.930> good

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
eight and nine and that's pretty good

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
eight and nine and that's pretty good
considering<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.310> only<00:01:50.579> knife<00:01:51.030> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
considering that it was only knife but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.109 
considering that it was only knife but
even<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.590> was<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.100> oh<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:53.909> so

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
even then it was like oh it was so

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.359 
even then it was like oh it was so
frustrating<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.920> playing<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
frustrating and I was playing the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.039 
frustrating and I was playing the
objective<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:57.060> no<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> don't<00:01:57.600> think<00:01:57.630> enough

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
objective but no I don't think enough

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
objective but no I don't think enough
and<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:59.700> was<00:01:59.820> just<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.090> whole<00:02:00.270> bunch<00:02:00.299> of

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and it was just a whole bunch of

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.639 
and it was just a whole bunch of
different<00:02:00.570> things<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.290> thought<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> know

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
different things that I thought you know

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
different things that I thought you know
what<00:02:01.770> I'll<00:02:02.280> try<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.939> different<00:02:03.270> time

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
what I'll try that a different time

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.330 
what I'll try that a different time
depending<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.619> guys<00:02:04.770> still<00:02:05.040> think

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
if you guys really care about the score

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.600 
if you guys really care about the score
if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> guys<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.770> wants<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.129> entertaining

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
not playing right now i'm recording this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.589 
not playing right now i'm recording this
afterwards<00:02:17.790> because<00:02:18.030> i<00:02:18.120> think<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.450> it's

better<00:02:18.930> if<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.230> could<00:02:19.290> talk<00:02:19.500> about<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.860> game

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
better if I could talk about the game

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.530 
better if I could talk about the game

plan what I did right what I did wrong

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.449 
plan what I did right what I did wrong
so<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.110> guys<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.500> actually<00:02:22.920> improve<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.390> so

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
so you guys can actually improve and so

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.710 
so you guys can actually improve and so
you<00:02:26.459> notice<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:26.940> game<00:02:27.180> i'm<00:02:27.390> using<00:02:27.629> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
you notice in this game i'm using the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.229 
you notice in this game i'm using the
orbital<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.440> dogs<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.129> swarm<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:29.790> you

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
orbital the dogs and the swarm if you

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.120 
orbital the dogs and the swarm if you
want<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.510> get<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.630> very<00:02:31.050> very<00:02:31.410> high<00:02:31.800> game

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
want to get a very very high game

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.660 
want to get a very very high game
gameplay<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.599> with<00:02:34.200> great<00:02:34.709> score<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.310> think

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
gameplay and with great score I think

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.059 
gameplay and with great score I think
this<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.390> best<00:02:36.660> possible<00:02:37.080> score<00:02:37.650> streaks

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
this is the best possible score streaks

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.920 
this is the best possible score streaks
to<00:02:38.250> be<00:02:38.370> going<00:02:38.670> look<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> turn<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
to be going look at that I turn the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470 
to be going look at that I turn the
corner<00:02:40.260> or<00:02:40.700> didn't<00:02:41.700> see<00:02:41.849> that<00:02:41.880> guy<00:02:42.090> comin<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
corner or didn't see that guy comin I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.940 
corner or didn't see that guy comin I
did<00:02:42.660> not<00:02:42.810> expect<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.230> coming<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.709> and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
did not expect that coming at all and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.600 
did not expect that coming at all and
one<00:02:44.610> pro<00:02:44.940> tip<00:02:45.209> um<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:46.680> notice<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.310> never

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
one pro tip um you notice that I never

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.180 
one pro tip um you notice that I never
ever<00:02:47.849> call<00:02:48.120> my<00:02:48.330> overall<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.870> don't<00:02:49.739> call<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:49.980> in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
ever call my overall I don't call it in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.770 
ever call my overall I don't call it in
the<00:02:50.280> first<00:02:50.519> like<00:02:51.030> right<00:02:51.239> when<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.420> get<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the first like right when I get it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.990 
the first like right when I get it
there's<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.440> reason<00:02:52.860> for<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.099> it's<00:02:53.489> because

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
there's a reason for that it's because

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.509 
there's a reason for that it's because
when<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.209> go<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.630> high<00:02:54.780> gameplay<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.440> trust<00:02:56.340> my

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
when I go for a high gameplay I trust my

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.339 
when I go for a high gameplay I trust my
instincts<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.090> trust<00:02:57.510> my<00:02:57.660> gun<00:02:57.870> enough<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.319> I

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
instincts I trust my gun enough that I

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.440 
instincts I trust my gun enough that I
think<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.040> get<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> dogs<00:02:59.549> because<00:03:00.239> if

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
think that I can get the dogs because if

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.229 
think that I can get the dogs because if
I<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.870> save<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.349> orbital<00:03:01.799> for<00:03:02.430> after<00:03:02.970> i<00:03:03.000> get

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
I can save that orbital for after i get

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.780 
I can save that orbital for after i get
that<00:03:03.360> swarm<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.530> will<00:03:04.680> almost<00:03:04.860> guarantee<00:03:05.099> me

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
that swarm it will almost guarantee me

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.020 
that swarm it will almost guarantee me
to<00:03:05.910> stack<00:03:06.239> my<00:03:06.269> killstreaks<00:03:06.660> again<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:08.099> i<00:03:08.400> use

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
to stack my killstreaks again so i use

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.750 
to stack my killstreaks again so i use
my<00:03:09.329> dogs<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.079> i<00:03:10.110> use<00:03:10.260> my<00:03:10.410> swarm<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.920> now<00:03:11.579> i'm

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
my dogs then i use my swarm and now i'm

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.390 
my dogs then i use my swarm and now i'm
alive<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.650> bringing<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.250> bar

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
alive and it's get it's bringing the bar

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.280 
alive and it's get it's bringing the bar
up<00:03:14.549> look<00:03:15.000> it's<00:03:15.180> getting<00:03:15.420> closer<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.019> my<00:03:16.110> next

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
up look it's getting closer to my next

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.140 
up look it's getting closer to my next
orbital<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.860> once<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.400> come<00:03:17.579> around<00:03:17.670> halfway

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
orbital and once I come around halfway

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.259 
orbital and once I come around halfway
to<00:03:18.450> my<00:03:18.600> next<00:03:18.780> orbital<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.380> will<00:03:20.370> call<00:03:20.609> in<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
to my next orbital I will call in the

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.300 
to my next orbital I will call in the
orbital<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.980> will<00:03:23.069> get<00:03:23.280> me

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
orbital that I have and that will get me

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.879 
orbital that I have and that will get me
my<00:03:23.609> next<00:03:23.940> orbital<00:03:24.299> vsat<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.900> then<00:03:25.560> from<00:03:25.829> there

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
my next orbital vsat and then from there

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.550 
my next orbital vsat and then from there
I'll<00:03:26.400> get<00:03:26.700> another<00:03:26.819> dog's<00:03:27.299> swarm<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.410> just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
I'll get another dog's swarm and I just

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.620 
I'll get another dog's swarm and I just
repeat<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:28.859> process<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:29.910> if<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.389> get

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
repeat that process so if you can get

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.349 
repeat that process so if you can get
the<00:03:31.019> dogs<00:03:31.319> won't<00:03:31.650> getting<00:03:31.950> nothing<00:03:32.400> else<00:03:32.609> you

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
the dogs won't getting nothing else you

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.500 
the dogs won't getting nothing else you
are<00:03:33.569> absolutely<00:03:33.920> set<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.850> very<00:03:36.359> very

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
are absolutely set and that is very very

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.599 
are absolutely set and that is very very
very<00:03:37.109> difficult<00:03:37.620> because<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.459> average

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
very difficult because the average

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.420 
very difficult because the average
player<00:03:39.060> not<00:03:39.090> gonna<00:03:39.989> lie<00:03:40.200> probably<00:03:40.920> cannot<00:03:41.160> get

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
player not gonna lie probably cannot get

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.809 
player not gonna lie probably cannot get
a<00:03:41.459> dog's<00:03:41.760> uh<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:43.530> with<00:03:43.829> nothing<00:03:44.370> else<00:03:44.489> that's

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
a dog's uh just with nothing else that's

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.629 
a dog's uh just with nothing else that's
like<00:03:44.910> just<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.329> straight<00:03:45.600> from<00:03:45.750> zero<00:03:46.139> to

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
like just going straight from zero to

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:49.550 
like just going straight from zero to
the<00:03:47.639> dogs<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.299> scorestreak<00:03:48.930> with<00:03:49.230> using

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the dogs in scorestreak with using

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.340 
the dogs in scorestreak with using
nothing<00:03:49.950> else<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.840> at<00:03:51.840> times<00:03:52.109> you<00:03:52.230> can

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
nothing else and so at times you can

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.750 
nothing else and so at times you can
have<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.500> get<00:03:52.620> lucky<00:03:52.920> yeah<00:03:53.190> sure<00:03:53.519> you're<00:03:53.639> gonna

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
have to get lucky yeah sure you're gonna

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.069 
have to get lucky yeah sure you're gonna
have<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.970> get<00:03:54.060> lucky<00:03:54.389> but<00:03:54.780> at<00:03:54.900> other<00:03:55.019> times

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
have to get lucky but at other times

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.589 
have to get lucky but at other times
look<00:03:55.709> at<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:55.889> watch<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.400> they<00:03:56.700> spawn<00:03:57.150> here

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
look at this watch this they spawn here

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.250 
look at this watch this they spawn here
as<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.470> went<00:03:58.739> deep<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.459> their<00:03:59.639> spawn<00:04:00.060> oh<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.870> did

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
as I went deep in their spawn oh I did

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.410 
as I went deep in their spawn oh I did
not<00:04:01.500> see<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.739> coming<00:04:01.889> when<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.670> went<00:04:03.180> into

not see that coming when I went into

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.809 
not see that coming when I went into
that<00:04:03.599> situation<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:04.470> was<00:04:05.130> not<00:04:05.400> looking<00:04:05.519> at<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
that situation I was not looking at the

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.250 
that situation I was not looking at the
map<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.120> was<00:04:06.239> completely<00:04:06.569> focused<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.170> the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
map I was completely focused on the

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.870 
map I was completely focused on the
players<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.739> usually<00:04:08.280> I'm<00:04:08.370> focused<00:04:08.700> on<00:04:08.760> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
players and usually I'm focused on the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.539 
players and usually I'm focused on the
map<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.209> lot<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.019> in<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.230> situation<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:11.010> was

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
map a lot but in that situation I was

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.770 
map a lot but in that situation I was
looking<00:04:11.700> straight<00:04:11.970> at<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.239> players<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.660> was

i can get my next kill streak and what
happened<00:04:19.019> is<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.200> all<00:04:19.349> spawned<00:04:19.889> right<00:04:19.979> there

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
happened is they all spawned right there

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
while I did not see them that was one of

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.710 
while I did not see them that was one of

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
not go into that room so I'm playing it

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.370 
not go into that room so I'm playing it
safe<00:04:30.940> I'm<00:04:31.360> trying<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.810> make<00:04:31.900> sure<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.290> i<00:04:32.320> do

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
safe I'm trying to make sure that i do

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.820 
safe I'm trying to make sure that i do
not<00:04:32.890> i<00:04:33.250> did<00:04:33.730> not<00:04:33.850> die<00:04:34.240> because<00:04:34.540> in<00:04:35.230> my<00:04:35.710> opinion

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
not i did not die because in my opinion

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.760 
not i did not die because in my opinion
and<00:04:36.370> i<00:04:37.150> think<00:04:37.360> most<00:04:37.660> good<00:04:38.020> players<00:04:38.260> opinions

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
and i think most good players opinions

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.460 
and i think most good players opinions
at<00:04:39.280> death<00:04:39.760> is<00:04:40.030> more<00:04:40.780> important<00:04:41.290> than<00:04:41.410> getting

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
at death is more important than getting

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.230 
at death is more important than getting
one<00:04:41.920> killed<00:04:42.220> because<00:04:42.430> if<00:04:42.670> you<00:04:42.760> can<00:04:42.880> stay<00:04:43.060> alive

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
one killed because if you can stay alive

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.060 
one killed because if you can stay alive
for<00:04:43.420> a<00:04:43.510> longer<00:04:43.660> period<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.990> time<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.530> means

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
for a longer period of time that means

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.590 
for a longer period of time that means
that<00:04:45.190> your<00:04:45.280> kill<00:04:45.430> streak<00:04:45.670> is<00:04:45.820> gonna<00:04:46.060> be<00:04:46.240> even

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
that your kill streak is gonna be even

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.570 
that your kill streak is gonna be even
better<00:04:46.780> um<00:04:47.110> because<00:04:47.860> you'll<00:04:48.100> be<00:04:48.130> getting<00:04:48.460> it

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
better um because you'll be getting it

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.780 
better um because you'll be getting it
right<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:49.570> i<00:04:49.960> always<00:04:50.470> think<00:04:50.830> death<00:04:51.310> is<00:04:51.550> more

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
right so i always think death is more

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.190 
right so i always think death is more
important<00:04:52.150> than<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.300> kill<00:04:52.570> that<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.840> one<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.140> the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
important than a kill that is one of the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.960 
important than a kill that is one of the
biggest<00:04:53.410> mindset<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.190> you<00:04:54.490> can<00:04:54.670> go<00:04:54.790> into<00:04:54.910> a

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
biggest mindset that you can go into a

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.970 
biggest mindset that you can go into a
game<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.570> think<00:04:56.260> but<00:04:56.500> when<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.710> when<00:04:56.860> i'm

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
game and think but when that when i'm

point<00:05:14.290> out<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.830> this<00:05:15.460> class<00:05:15.820> you'll<00:05:16.540> see<00:05:16.810> that

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
point out in this class you'll see that

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.880 
point out in this class you'll see that
i'm<00:05:17.290> always<00:05:17.500> I'm<00:05:18.070> always<00:05:18.370> using<00:05:18.870> my<00:05:19.870> cover<00:05:20.140> to

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
i'm always I'm always using my cover to

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.760 
i'm always I'm always using my cover to
my<00:05:21.040> advantage<00:05:21.400> okay<00:05:22.270> this<00:05:22.510> is<00:05:22.660> an<00:05:22.780> SMG<00:05:23.110> but<00:05:23.590> the

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
my advantage okay this is an SMG but the

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.180 
my advantage okay this is an SMG but the
MSMC<00:05:24.370> has<00:05:24.640> low<00:05:25.030> recoil<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.810> not<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.770> really

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
MSMC has low recoil and not a really

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.800 
MSMC has low recoil and not a really
high<00:05:27.400> fire<00:05:27.730> rate<00:05:27.880> so<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.210> can<00:05:28.360> go<00:05:28.480> long

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
high fire rate so it can go long

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.500 
high fire rate so it can go long
distance<00:05:29.230> if<00:05:29.350> it<00:05:29.440> needs<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.860> write<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:30.730> so<00:05:31.270> I'm

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
distance if it needs to write and so I'm

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.420 
distance if it needs to write and so I'm
doing<00:05:31.870> that<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.110> my<00:05:32.230> advantage<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.860> at<00:05:33.190> times

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
doing that to my advantage and at times

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.130 
doing that to my advantage and at times
I'm<00:05:33.610> pruning<00:05:34.060> I'll<00:05:34.300> try<00:05:34.660> and<00:05:34.690> just<00:05:34.930> take

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
I'm pruning I'll try and just take

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.930 
I'm pruning I'll try and just take
everything<00:05:35.290> that<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:35.860> can<00:05:35.950> to<00:05:36.310> bring<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.790> my

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
everything that I can to bring it to my

everything that I can to bring it to my
advantage<00:05:37.110> when<00:05:38.110> I'm<00:05:38.380> able<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.010> use<00:05:39.280> that

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
advantage when I'm able to use that

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
in Kill Confirmed the only reason why I

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.530 
in Kill Confirmed the only reason why I
tag<00:06:53.260> will<00:06:53.440> go<00:06:53.650> away<00:06:53.770> is<00:06:54.130> if<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:54.460> enemy<00:06:54.760> dies<00:06:55.060> or

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
tag will go away is if the enemy dies or

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.830 
tag will go away is if the enemy dies or
if<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.350> enemy<00:06:56.620> leaves<00:06:56.950> so<00:06:57.790> you<00:06:57.850> do<00:06:58.360> not<00:06:58.510> always

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
if the enemy leaves so you do not always

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.990 
if the enemy leaves so you do not always
need<00:06:59.140> to<00:06:59.260> get<00:06:59.380> that<00:06:59.470> tag<00:06:59.740> right<00:07:00.100> away<00:07:00.400> think

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
need to get that tag right away think

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.610 
need to get that tag right away think
about<00:07:01.180> that<00:07:01.240> when<00:07:01.840> you<00:07:01.990> guys<00:07:02.110> see<00:07:02.350> tags

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
about that when you guys see tags

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.080 
about that when you guys see tags
disappearing<00:07:03.220> it<00:07:03.340> isn't<00:07:03.610> because<00:07:03.700> it<00:07:03.970> has<00:07:04.060> a

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.090 
disappearing it isn't because it has a

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.790 
disappearing it isn't because it has a
time<00:07:04.390> limit<00:07:04.420> it's<00:07:04.840> because<00:07:05.110> they<00:07:05.290> died<00:07:05.500> again

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
time limit it's because they died again

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.890 
time limit it's because they died again
on<00:07:05.950> the<00:07:06.040> map<00:07:06.250> so<00:07:06.790> always<00:07:07.060> pay<00:07:07.450> attention<00:07:07.480> to

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
on the map so always pay attention to

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.540 
on the map so always pay attention to
where<00:07:08.470> your<00:07:08.560> teammates<00:07:08.680> are<00:07:09.040> and<00:07:09.250> where

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
where your teammates are and where

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.580

to pick up that tag right away or maybe

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.990 
to pick up that tag right away or maybe
in<00:07:14.230> ten<00:07:14.650> seconds<00:07:15.130> because<00:07:15.340> it<00:07:15.580> won't<00:07:15.850> make<00:07:15.940> a

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
in ten seconds because it won't make a

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.640
