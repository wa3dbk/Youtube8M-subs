to<00:01:23.899> have<00:01:24.109> it<00:01:24.289> in<00:01:24.439> four<00:01:24.829> different<00:01:25.039> positions

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
to have it in four different positions

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.419 
to have it in four different positions
based<00:01:25.969> upon<00:01:26.329> how<00:01:26.959> you<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:27.469> the<00:01:27.740> little<00:01:27.950> flaps

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
based upon how you do the little flaps

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.969 
based upon how you do the little flaps
up<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.029> you<00:01:29.090> can<00:01:29.209> go<00:01:29.569> from<00:01:30.139> a<00:01:30.319> low<00:01:30.709> angle

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
up here so you can go from a low angle

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.789 
up here so you can go from a low angle
to<00:01:31.399> a<00:01:31.429> steep<00:01:31.759> angle<00:01:31.999> just<00:01:32.869> by<00:01:33.020> adding<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.619> base

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
to a steep angle just by adding the base

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.480 
to a steep angle just by adding the base
to<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.099> bottom<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:35.749> screen<00:01:36.279> put<00:01:37.279> that

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
to the bottom of the screen put that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.469 
to the bottom of the screen put that
right<00:01:37.849> here<00:01:39.009> now<00:01:40.009> let's<00:01:40.310> see<00:01:40.609> on<00:01:40.969> top<00:01:41.209> of<00:01:41.389> that
