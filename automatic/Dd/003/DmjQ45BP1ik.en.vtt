00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.640 

we're<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> central<00:00:14.580> Serengeti<00:00:15.119> here<00:00:15.650> in

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
we're in the central Serengeti here in

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.269 
we're in the central Serengeti here in
front<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.099> me<00:00:17.220> are<00:00:17.550> three<00:00:18.420> cheetahs<00:00:19.290> who<00:00:20.099> are

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
front of me are three cheetahs who are

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.850 
front of me are three cheetahs who are
relaxing<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> afternoon<00:00:21.720> getting<00:00:22.680> ready

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
relaxing in the afternoon getting ready

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.609 
relaxing in the afternoon getting ready
for<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.579> guess<00:00:23.939> well<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:25.050> even<00:00:25.169> know<00:00:25.590> if

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
for I guess well I don't even know if

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.679 
for I guess well I don't even know if
they're<00:00:25.860> getting<00:00:25.950> ready<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.689> typically

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
they're getting ready but typically

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.089 
they're getting ready but typically
they'll<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.020> be<00:00:28.169> resting<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> afternoon

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
they'll just be resting in the afternoon

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.720 
they'll just be resting in the afternoon
and<00:00:29.340> perhaps<00:00:29.669> hunting<00:00:30.419> later<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> since<00:00:32.520> we

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and perhaps hunting later so since we

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.950 
and perhaps hunting later so since we
don't<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:33.059> we're<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.450> waiting<00:00:33.809> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
don't know we're just waiting and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.510 
don't know we're just waiting and
watching<00:00:35.120> one<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.450> woken<00:00:36.780> up

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
watching one of them is just woken up

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
watching one of them is just woken up
they're<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.730> 125<00:00:39.629> yards<00:00:39.840> away<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.290> even

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
they're about 125 yards away so even

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
they're about 125 yards away so even
with<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.629> 604<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.230> struggling

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
with my 604 I'm just really struggling

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.509 
with my 604 I'm just really struggling
to<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:44.010> some<00:00:44.249> detail<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> shot<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
to get some detail out of the shot and

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.680 
to get some detail out of the shot and
pretty<00:00:47.519> much<00:00:47.609> ready<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> give<00:00:48.089> it<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.829> but<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
pretty much ready to give it up but I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.220 
pretty much ready to give it up but I
have<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.839> handy<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.230> thing<00:00:52.769> called<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
have this handy little thing called the

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.040 
have this handy little thing called the
teleconverter<00:00:55.230> tc20<00:00:56.239> e3<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.569> like<00:00:57.839> I<00:00:58.019> just

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
teleconverter tc20 e3 but like I just

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.169 
teleconverter tc20 e3 but like I just
made<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.280> shorter<00:00:59.579> than<00:00:59.789> the

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
made it's a lot shorter than the

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.840 
made it's a lot shorter than the
previous<00:01:00.629> version<00:01:01.019> which<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.289> 20<00:01:01.819> eetu

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
previous version which is the 20 eetu

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280 
previous version which is the 20 eetu
and<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:04.589> fully<00:01:05.070> functions<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.210> AFS<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and it fully functions with the AFS and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.060 
and it fully functions with the AFS and
the<00:01:07.500> image<00:01:07.830> stabilization<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:10.200> don't<00:01:10.800> use

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the image stabilization so I don't use

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.950 
the image stabilization so I don't use
this<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.520> still<00:01:11.790> photography<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.690> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this with still photography because it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.590 
this with still photography because it's
just<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.159> loses<00:01:14.579> to<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.880> sharpness<00:01:15.240> I'd

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
just it just loses to the sharpness I'd

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
just it just loses to the sharpness I'd
rather<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.259> even<00:01:16.530> take<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> shot<00:01:17.100> but

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
rather just not even take the shot but

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060 
rather just not even take the shot but
with<00:01:18.240> video<00:01:18.450> being<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.899> lower<00:01:19.049> resolution<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
with video being a lower resolution and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160 
with video being a lower resolution and
it<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.969> nice<00:01:21.240> scene<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.719> there<00:01:21.930> I'm<00:01:22.079> going

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it is a nice scene out there I'm going

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.649 
it is a nice scene out there I'm going
to<00:01:22.259> go<00:01:22.380> ahead<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.920> install<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
to go ahead and install the

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.569 
to go ahead and install the
teleconverter<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.189> great

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
teleconverter so I can get some great

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.109 
teleconverter so I can get some great
closer<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> action<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:29.579> I'll<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:29.969> show

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
closer to the action so I'll just show

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
closer to the action so I'll just show
you<00:01:30.149> a<00:01:30.240> few<00:01:30.450> pointers<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.810> how<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you a few pointers on how I do it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.209 
you a few pointers on how I do it
I<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> special<00:01:32.969> locking<00:01:33.420> mechanism<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.219> my

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
I have a special locking mechanism on my

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:41.179 
I have a special locking mechanism on my
gimbal<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.530> will<00:01:37.530> prevent<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.950> lens<00:01:40.950> from

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
gimbal that will prevent the lens from

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.300 
gimbal that will prevent the lens from
tipping<00:01:41.549> once<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> apart<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.439> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
tipping once I take it apart and of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.510 
tipping once I take it apart and of
course<00:01:44.549> I'll<00:01:44.670> lock<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:45.590> my<00:01:46.590> vertical<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
course I'll lock down my vertical and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.870 
course I'll lock down my vertical and
horizontal<00:01:48.320> movement<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.939> also<00:01:50.939> lock<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:53.630> ring

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.940 

so<00:01:57.990> there's<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.049> lot<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.259> block<00:01:59.470> dust<00:01:59.710> blowing

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
so there's a lot of block dust blowing

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.249 
so there's a lot of block dust blowing
around<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.400> air<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.869> trick<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.229> to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
around the air and so the trick is to

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.359 
around the air and so the trick is to
get<00:02:03.040> this<00:02:04.380> together<00:02:05.380> with<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.770> as<00:02:05.979> fast<00:02:06.189> as

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
get this together with that as fast as

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.800 
get this together with that as fast as
possible<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:06.939> I<00:02:07.000> start<00:02:07.330> with<00:02:07.540> doing<00:02:07.659> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
possible and I start with doing the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.749 
possible and I start with doing the
highest<00:02:08.110> priority<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.220> city<00:02:09.489> image

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
highest priority to the city image

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.850 
highest priority to the city image
sensor<00:02:10.090> being<00:02:10.239> covered<00:02:10.479> up<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:10.750> less<00:02:11.680> that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
sensor being covered up so less that

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.680 
sensor being covered up so less that
with<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.040> back

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
with the back

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.440 
with the back
so<00:02:13.980> I've<00:02:14.980> already<00:02:15.280> loosened<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
so I've already loosened it and so the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180 
so I've already loosened it and so the
trick<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.780> grip<00:02:20.020> this<00:02:20.140> off<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.739> get<00:02:21.040> this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
trick is to grip this off and get this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:35.699 
trick is to grip this off and get this
on<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.900> on<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:33.989> hopefully<00:02:34.989> look<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.260> dust<00:02:35.440> so

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
on it's on and hopefully look to dust so

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.759 
on it's on and hopefully look to dust so
much<00:02:35.830> dust<00:02:36.069> got<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.370> there<00:02:36.569> alright<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
much dust got in there alright so the

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:39.930 
much dust got in there alright so the
next<00:02:38.799> thing<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.130> do<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.459> balance<00:02:39.790> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
next thing to do is to balance the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:50.640 
next thing to do is to balance the
gimbal<00:02:47.130> you'll<00:02:48.130> see<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:49.650> locking

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
gimbal you'll see that this locking

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.289 
gimbal you'll see that this locking
mechanism<00:02:51.100> has<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> little<00:02:51.610> bit<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.790> play<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.120> it

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
mechanism has a little bit of play in it

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.630 
mechanism has a little bit of play in it
and<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:53.290> allows<00:02:53.620> me<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:55.049> check<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.200> balance

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and that allows me to check the balance

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.690 
and that allows me to check the balance
without<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.970> going<00:02:58.660> too<00:02:58.840> far

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.950 

that's<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.880> that's<00:03:04.780> about<00:03:04.960> it<00:03:05.290> okay

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
that's a that's about it okay

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.360 
that's a that's about it okay
lock<00:03:07.960> it<00:03:08.080> down<00:03:08.760> open<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.790> up<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:11.190> let's<00:03:12.190> get

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
lock it down open it up and let's get

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:25.650 
lock it down open it up and let's get
ready<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.790> shoot<00:03:13.090> some<00:03:13.150> video<00:03:24.330> much<00:03:25.330> closer

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
ready to shoot some video much closer

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.210 
ready to shoot some video much closer
and<00:03:26.310> still<00:03:27.310> quite<00:03:27.550> sharp<00:03:27.850> I'm<00:03:28.750> now<00:03:29.050> zoom<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.100> on

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
and still quite sharp I'm now zoom in on

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.730 
and still quite sharp I'm now zoom in on
my<00:03:30.250> live<00:03:31.240> view<00:03:31.270> finder<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.200> make<00:03:32.380> sure<00:03:32.590> it

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
my live view finder and make sure it

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.590 
my live view finder and make sure it
looks<00:03:32.860> sharp<00:03:33.160> very<00:03:33.670> very<00:03:33.880> sharp<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.270> manually

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
looks sharp very very sharp and manually

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:56.640 
looks sharp very very sharp and manually
flip<00:03:34.870> focus<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.470> unlock<00:03:35.680> it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.589 

and<00:03:57.220> I'm<00:03:57.370> ready<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.670> go<00:03:57.849> so<00:03:59.760> that's<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.150> nikon

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
and I'm ready to go so that's the nikon

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.619 
and I'm ready to go so that's the nikon
