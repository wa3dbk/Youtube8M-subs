00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
got all the airway stuff up here so

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.350 
got all the airway stuff up here so
depending<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.189> what<00:00:08.340> level<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.760> paramedic

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
depending on what level of paramedic

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.089 
depending on what level of paramedic
you've<00:00:09.510> got<00:00:09.690> at<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.260> call<00:00:11.269> will<00:00:12.269> depend<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:13.099> but

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
you've got at a call will depend on but

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.980 
you've got at a call will depend on but
that<00:00:14.219> will<00:00:14.370> dictate<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.450> we<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.780> use

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
that will dictate what what we can use

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.320 
that will dictate what what we can use
and<00:00:16.139> what<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.320> can't<00:00:16.529> use<00:00:17.000> there<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.119> stuff

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
and what we can't use there is stuff

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.650 
and what we can't use there is stuff
here<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.670> do<00:00:20.670> advanced<00:00:21.359> Airways

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
here so that we can do advanced Airways

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
dollar piece of equipment we can differ

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
dollar piece of equipment we can differ
ability<00:01:18.540> somebody<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.140> 12<00:01:19.350> lessee<00:01:19.799> G's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
ability somebody we can do 12 lessee G's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.170 
ability somebody we can do 12 lessee G's
where<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.549> three<00:01:20.759> lead<00:01:20.909> ECGs<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:23.180> 12

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
where you can do three lead ECGs a 12

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 
where you can do three lead ECGs a 12
lead<00:01:24.270> ECG<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.840> diagnostic<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.100> can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
lead ECG is diagnostic so we can

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.110 
lead ECG is diagnostic so we can
actually<00:01:26.580> pretty<00:01:27.570> much<00:01:27.689> diagnose

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
actually pretty much diagnose

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.820 
actually pretty much diagnose
a<00:01:29.180> heart<00:01:29.870> attack<00:01:29.960> from<00:01:30.260> myocardial

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
a heart attack from myocardial

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.540 
a heart attack from myocardial
infarction<00:01:32.800> pretty<00:01:33.800> much<00:01:33.950> because<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.430> got

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
infarction pretty much because you got

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.680 
infarction pretty much because you got
back<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.730> novel<00:01:35.060> with<00:01:35.180> labs<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:38.360> can<00:01:38.540> also

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
back a novel with labs so we can also

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.370 
back a novel with labs so we can also
pay<00:01:39.290> somebody<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.010> if<00:01:40.970> somebody<00:01:41.300> has<00:01:41.330> a<00:01:41.480> slow

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
pay somebody so if somebody has a slow

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.140 
pay somebody so if somebody has a slow
heart<00:01:42.740> rhythm<00:01:43.690> then<00:01:44.690> we<00:01:44.930> can<00:01:45.140> actually<00:01:45.320> do<00:01:46.250> an

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
heart rhythm then we can actually do an

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.360 
heart rhythm then we can actually do an
external<00:01:47.570> pacer<00:01:48.200> on<00:01:48.410> it<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:48.950> it's

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
external pacer on it so it's like it's

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.770 
external pacer on it so it's like it's
like<00:01:49.460> what<00:01:49.700> an<00:01:49.790> internal<00:01:50.180> pacemaker<00:01:50.330> does

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
like what an internal pacemaker does

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.110 
like what an internal pacemaker does
except<00:01:51.320> we're<00:01:52.220> not<00:01:52.340> gonna<00:01:52.430> do<00:01:52.610> surgery<00:01:52.640> and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
except we're not gonna do surgery and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.180 
except we're not gonna do surgery and
insert<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.480> pacemaker<00:01:53.690> this<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:54.890> takes

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
insert a pacemaker this this this takes

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.250 
insert a pacemaker this this this takes
the<00:01:55.280> place<00:01:55.370> about<00:01:55.850> temporarily<00:01:56.750> until<00:01:57.200> they

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
the place about temporarily until they

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.510 
the place about temporarily until they
can<00:01:57.410> get<00:01:57.560> them<00:01:57.680> into<00:01:57.860> surgery<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.280> put<00:01:58.430> an

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
can get them into surgery and put an

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.580 
can get them into surgery and put an
internal<00:01:58.850> pacemaker<00:01:59.110> so<00:02:00.110> we've<00:02:00.230> got<00:02:00.380> that

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
internal pacemaker so we've got that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.040 
internal pacemaker so we've got that
we've<00:02:00.860> got<00:02:01.040> equipment<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.610> monitor<00:02:02.050> monitor

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
we've got equipment to monitor monitor

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.570 
we've got equipment to monitor monitor
our<00:02:03.350> endotracheal<00:02:03.710> tubes<00:02:04.160> once<00:02:04.400> they're

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
our endotracheal tubes once they're

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.220 
our endotracheal tubes once they're
inserted<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:10.130> then<00:02:10.490> our<00:02:11.090> trauma<00:02:11.390> bag<00:02:11.660> here<00:02:11.990> we

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
inserted and then our trauma bag here we

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
inserted and then our trauma bag here we
carry<00:02:12.530> we<00:02:13.190> carry<00:02:13.460> our<00:02:13.610> drugs<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.920> this

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
carry we carry our drugs in it this this

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.590 
carry we carry our drugs in it this this
gets<00:02:19.520> brought<00:02:19.730> into<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.060> scene

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
gets brought into a scene

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.310

some ID stuff in here we've got our
drugs<00:02:37.420> we've<00:02:38.140> got<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.800> dirty<00:02:39.580> side<00:02:39.819> intubation

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
drugs we've got a dirty side intubation

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.520 
drugs we've got a dirty side intubation
equipment<00:02:41.010> you've<00:02:42.010> got<00:02:42.870> we've<00:02:43.870> got<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.290> gear

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
equipment you've got we've got the gear

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.630 
equipment you've got we've got the gear
to<00:02:45.209> perform<00:02:46.800> what<00:02:47.800> we<00:02:47.920> call<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.100> surgical

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
to perform what we call a surgical

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.000 
to perform what we call a surgical
airway<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.150> if<00:02:49.270> somebody<00:02:49.569> have<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:50.650> somebody

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
airway so if somebody have a if somebody

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.760 
airway so if somebody have a if somebody
had<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> an<00:02:52.000> airway<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.959> obstructed<00:02:53.530> for

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
had a an airway that was obstructed for

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.170 
had a an airway that was obstructed for
whatever<00:02:53.920> reason<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.550> we<00:02:54.640> couldn't<00:02:54.850> clear

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
whatever reason and we couldn't clear

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.210 
whatever reason and we couldn't clear
the<00:02:55.300> obstruction<00:02:56.100> we<00:02:57.100> can<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:58.330> can<00:02:59.220> basically

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
the obstruction we can we can basically

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.280 
the obstruction we can we can basically
make<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> hole<00:03:00.819> in<00:03:01.000> there<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.480> their<00:03:01.750> throat<00:03:02.020> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
make a hole in there in their throat and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.380 
make a hole in there in their throat and
inserts<00:03:02.709> insert<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.459> tube<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.209> can

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
inserts insert a tube so that we can

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.020 
inserts insert a tube so that we can
help<00:03:04.750> them<00:03:04.930> breathe<00:03:05.140> through<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:06.030> we've

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
help them breathe through that we've

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.210 
help them breathe through that we've
also<00:03:07.209> got<00:03:07.540> equipment<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.170> do<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> chest<00:03:08.739> that

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
also got equipment to do a chest that

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.430 
also got equipment to do a chest that
chest<00:03:09.459> needles<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.300> just<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:11.380> a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
chest needles so it just it's a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.220 
chest needles so it just it's a
decompress<00:03:12.630> basically<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.660> collapsed<00:03:14.080> lung

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
decompress basically a collapsed lung

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.040 
decompress basically a collapsed lung
and<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.940> these<00:03:16.120> are<00:03:16.269> all<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.480> drugs<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.810> we

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
and then these are all the drugs that we

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.210 
and then these are all the drugs that we
can<00:03:17.260> we<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.769> administer<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.980> we've<00:03:20.980> got

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
can we can administer so we've got

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.110 
can we can administer so we've got
epinephrine<00:03:22.380> atropine<00:03:23.519> these<00:03:24.519> are<00:03:25.030> all

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
epinephrine atropine these are all

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:44.460 
epinephrine atropine these are all
frontline<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:41.170> also<00:03:41.320> have<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.049> heparin

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
frontline we also have this is heparin

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.330 
frontline we also have this is heparin
so<00:03:44.799> this<00:03:45.070> is<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:46.019> clot<00:03:47.019> busting<00:03:47.470> drug<00:03:47.500> basically

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
so this is a clot busting drug basically

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.830 
so this is a clot busting drug basically
that's<00:03:48.610> not<00:03:49.030> really<00:03:49.239> caught<00:03:49.420> last<00:03:49.600> year<00:03:49.750> it's

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
that's not really caught last year it's

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.160 
that's not really caught last year it's
more<00:03:49.959> than<00:03:50.430> blood<00:03:51.430> thinner<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.600> we<00:03:52.750> give<00:03:52.930> that

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
more than blood thinner but we give that

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.680 
more than blood thinner but we give that
to<00:03:53.410> people<00:03:54.010> who<00:03:54.579> are<00:03:55.090> having<00:03:55.239> what's<00:03:55.450> called<00:03:55.600> a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
to people who are having what's called a

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.449 
to people who are having what's called a
STEMI<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.620> sent<00:03:56.829> me<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.070> an<00:03:57.190> ST<00:03:57.430> elevation

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
STEMI and it sent me is an ST elevation

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.319 
STEMI and it sent me is an ST elevation
myocardial<00:03:58.390> infarction<00:03:59.320> and<00:03:59.850> that's<00:04:00.850> that's

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
myocardial infarction and that's that's

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.870 
myocardial infarction and that's that's
where<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.600> 12-lead<00:04:01.870> comes<00:04:02.230> in<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.739> when<00:04:03.070> we<00:04:03.280> do

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
where the 12-lead comes in so when we do

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.520 
where the 12-lead comes in so when we do
the<00:04:03.970> 12-lead<00:04:04.299> if<00:04:04.540> we<00:04:04.660> see<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.200> they're

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
the 12-lead if we see that they're

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.809 
the 12-lead if we see that they're
showing<00:04:05.859> signs<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.180> ST<00:04:07.570> elevation<00:04:07.660> mi

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
showing signs of this ST elevation mi

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.990 
showing signs of this ST elevation mi
we<00:04:10.209> talked<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.629> cardiologist<00:04:11.730> at<00:04:12.730> st.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
we talked to a cardiologist at st.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.719 
we talked to a cardiologist at st.
Boniface<00:04:13.360> in<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:16.829> interventionist<00:04:17.829> at<00:04:18.160> st.
