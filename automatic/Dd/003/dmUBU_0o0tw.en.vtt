 [Laughs] 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.240
 things that happen 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.580
 now if the time I wanted to operate 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.370
 that I was very scared until I 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.610
 I decided I'm glad it happened 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.640
 all this 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.540
 I did the gallbladder 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.000
 doctor waste and you that I did 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.390
 they opened me from here they found 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.100
 polyp and what do I know how many more things 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.540
 but it looks like the operation was 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.240
 everything a success because I already feel 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.980
 rather better than good and who does not 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.980
 the doctor moretti 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.340
 how 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.560
 what happens I understand that the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.870
 Dr. Monetti is the best of this 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.020
 clinic and the one of the best in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.020
 Venezuela 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.100
 Yeah sure 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.980
 I think what he has to say 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.930
 doctor moretti good 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.950
 it is true that one of the best 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.900
 surgeons 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:10.830
 but it has a reputation for being distracted 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.480
 he forgets removed but at least 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.480
 he did not forget to operate on me 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.049
 it seems that last week it operated on a 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.010
 sir who left him a few houses 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.590
 inside the stomach 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.569
 and without going very far he had to operate 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.560
 new to a lady to pull a clamp 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:37.020
 that had left him inside 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.220
 that nothing good has happened to him 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.220
 well, doctor moretti 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.040
