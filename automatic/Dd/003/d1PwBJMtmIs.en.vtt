so that when you're playing you're

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
so that when you're playing you're
actually<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.160> tone<00:00:47.399> from

placing your fingers just above these
frets<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:52.289> when<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.770> move<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.100> here

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
frets and then when we move up here

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.670 
frets and then when we move up here
further<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.930> something<00:00:55.199> called<00:00:55.500> the

further we get something called the
headstock<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.449> where<00:00:57.690> you're<00:00:58.079> going

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
like that like for a Stratocaster you're

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.010 
like that like for a Stratocaster you're
going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.610> six<00:01:23.970> all<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.180> way<00:01:24.299> across<00:01:24.630> or

Martin or for some other like Les Paul's
you're<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.090> both<00:01:30.390> sides

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you're going to see it on both sides

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.440 
you're going to see it on both sides
like<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:30.990> divide<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> up<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.939> next<00:01:33.150> part

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
like this divide it up the next part

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.300 
like this divide it up the next part
that<00:01:33.509> we're<00:01:33.720> talking<00:01:33.869> about<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.799> nut<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that we're talking about is the nut and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
that we're talking about is the nut and
this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.329> holds<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.810> strings<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this is what holds the strings in get in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.910 
this is what holds the strings in get in
place<00:01:38.340> for<00:01:39.299> your<00:01:39.479> guitar<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> don't

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
place for your guitar so that you don't

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
have as much tension going on on just

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.380 
have as much tension going on on just
your<00:01:43.860> tuning<00:01:44.220> pegs<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.939> allows<00:01:45.210> your

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
your tuning pegs and it allows your

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.480 
your tuning pegs and it allows your
guitar<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.990> stay<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> tune<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.100> longer

most acoustic guitars is a hollow body

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
most acoustic guitars is a hollow body
which<00:01:59.729> gives<00:01:59.969> means<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> sound

which gives means that you have a sound
hole<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:01.649> which<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.399> where<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.729> sound<00:02:03.000> is

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the sound hole and everything like that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.900 
the sound hole and everything like that
I<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> cutaway<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.739> body<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.459> to

I have a cutaway on this body here to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.590 
I have a cutaway on this body here to
make<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:12.959> reach

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
make it so that I can reach

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.420 
make it so that I can reach
higher<00:02:13.810> notes<00:02:14.140> when<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.590> comes<00:02:14.830> time<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.130> do

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
higher notes when it comes time to do

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.580 
higher notes when it comes time to do
that<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:16.150> all<00:02:16.390> guitars<00:02:16.750> have<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.290> that's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
that not all guitars have that that's

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.350 
that not all guitars have that that's
again<00:02:17.890> that's<00:02:18.070> personal<00:02:18.640> preference<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:19.210> to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
again that's personal preference as to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.200 
again that's personal preference as to
how<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.570> wish<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.110> play<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:21.700> followed<00:02:22.060> out

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
here this is the bridge of the guitar

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.580 
here this is the bridge of the guitar
and<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:25.300> is<00:02:25.450> what<00:02:25.660> keeps<00:02:25.900> your<00:02:26.140> guitar

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
on an acoustic guitar which applies

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.280 
on an acoustic guitar which applies
enough<00:02:36.730> tension<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.360> where<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.930> keep<00:02:38.110> it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
enough tension to where you can keep it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.370 
enough tension to where you can keep it
in<00:02:38.410> tune<00:02:38.650> when<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.430> put<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.760> into<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.390> then

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
in tune when you put it into and then

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.500 
in tune when you put it into and then
the<00:02:41.590> next<00:02:41.830> part<00:02:42.010> we<00:02:42.460> just<00:02:42.490> have<00:02:42.880> is<00:02:43.120> the
