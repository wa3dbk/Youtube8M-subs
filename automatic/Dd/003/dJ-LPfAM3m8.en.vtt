00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.960 
in the wiring it's just insane yep
I<00:01:38.540> reckon<00:01:39.020> more<00:01:39.530> low<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.979> terrain<00:01:40.280> timer<00:01:40.640> and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
I reckon more low and terrain timer and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.640 
I reckon more low and terrain timer and
we're<00:01:41.330> looking<00:01:41.630> at<00:01:41.720> another<00:01:41.990> 10<00:01:42.260> years<00:01:42.440> of

sort of bits in your truck before you go

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.210 
sort of bits in your truck before you go
there's<00:01:59.869> nothing<00:02:00.290> like<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.470> handful<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:00.979> new

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
there's nothing like a handful of new

there's nothing like a handful of new

especially<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.970> wheel<00:02:05.150> bearings<00:02:05.540> make<00:02:05.900> sure

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
especially the wheel bearings make sure

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.050 
especially the wheel bearings make sure
the<00:02:06.380> wheels<00:02:06.590> will<00:02:06.770> turn<00:02:07.009> because<00:02:07.729> if<00:02:07.909> the

the wheels will turn because if the

wheels will turn they'll get you there

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.709 
wheels will turn they'll get you there
and<00:02:09.739> back<00:02:09.799> and<00:02:10.639> that's<00:02:11.090> what<00:02:11.209> I'm<00:02:11.329> doing<00:02:11.389> now

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 
and back and that's what I'm doing now

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.240 
and back and that's what I'm doing now
get<00:02:12.109> a<00:02:12.139> bug<00:02:12.409> another<00:02:12.680> set

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
get a bug another set

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:30.900 
get a bug another set
there's<00:02:13.430> more<00:02:13.820> life

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.760 

it's<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.090> simple<00:02:32.450> isn't<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.900> changing<00:02:33.440> gears<00:02:33.650> I

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
it's so simple isn't it changing gears I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.110 
it's so simple isn't it changing gears I
mean<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.310> first<00:02:34.610> things<00:02:34.970> you

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
mean it's one of the first things you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.900 
mean it's one of the first things you
learn<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.709> thing<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:36.980> once<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:37.730> know

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
learn but the thing is once you know

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.100 
learn but the thing is once you know
what's<00:02:38.120> happening<00:02:38.480> down<00:02:38.660> there<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.020> the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
what's happening down there in the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.410 
what's happening down there in the
gearbox<00:02:39.349> it<00:02:40.010> can<00:02:40.250> change<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.790> whole<00:02:41.030> way<00:02:41.360> you

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
gearbox it can change the whole way you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.780 
gearbox it can change the whole way you
change<00:02:41.840> gears<00:02:42.140> forever<00:02:42.560> trust<00:02:43.250> me<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:43.580> that

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
change gears forever trust me on that

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.120 
change gears forever trust me on that
because<00:02:44.420> even<00:02:44.930> though<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.260> parts<00:02:45.709> simple

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
because even though this parts simple

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.309 
because even though this parts simple
the<00:02:46.280> actual<00:02:46.550> moving<00:02:46.790> around<00:02:47.150> what's<00:02:47.840> going<00:02:47.930> on

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
the actual moving around what's going on

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.110 
the actual moving around what's going on
in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.500> gearbox<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.190> not<00:02:49.430> at<00:02:49.550> all<00:02:49.819> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
in the gearbox is it not at all it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.330 
in the gearbox is it not at all it
involves<00:02:50.630> all<00:02:50.900> sorts<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.349> little<00:02:51.530> components

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
involves all sorts of little components

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.640 
involves all sorts of little components
going<00:02:52.819> into<00:02:53.060> place<00:02:53.300> lining<00:02:53.930> up<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.260> meshing

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
going into place lining up and meshing

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.940 
going into place lining up and meshing
together<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.540> really<00:02:57.170> need<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.440> be<00:02:57.739> very

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
together so you really need to be very

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.130 
together so you really need to be very
gentle<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.730> district<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.450> fact<00:02:59.780> it's<00:02:59.989> not

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
gentle in the district in fact it's not

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.350 
gentle in the district in fact it's not
just<00:03:00.349> a<00:03:00.440> trick<00:03:00.680> for<00:03:00.860> old<00:03:01.010> trucks<00:03:01.310> okay<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:02.209> is

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
just a trick for old trucks okay this is

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.270 
just a trick for old trucks okay this is
for<00:03:02.510> new<00:03:02.630> trucks<00:03:02.900> too<00:03:03.110> because<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.130> end

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
for new trucks too because in the end

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.699 
for new trucks too because in the end
delicate<00:03:05.269> gear<00:03:05.510> changes<00:03:05.989> will<00:03:06.290> keep<00:03:06.530> a

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
delicate gear changes will keep a

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.190 
delicate gear changes will keep a
gearbox<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:07.640> for<00:03:07.819> an<00:03:07.880> awful<00:03:08.420> long<00:03:08.600> time<00:03:08.959> it
