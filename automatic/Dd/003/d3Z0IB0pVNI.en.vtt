00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
unboxing this thing let's see what we've

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.230 
unboxing this thing let's see what we've
got

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
got

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.730 
got
so<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> box<00:00:31.260> came<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> little

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
so as you see here the box came a little

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
so as you see here the box came a little
bit<00:00:31.949> dented<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.450> inside<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
bit dented up it was actually inside of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.360 
bit dented up it was actually inside of
another<00:00:34.170> box<00:00:34.290> both<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.040> them<00:00:35.160> were<00:00:35.309> in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
another box both of them were in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
another box both of them were in
separate<00:00:35.850> boxes<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> other<00:00:37.920> boxes

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
separate boxes and the other boxes

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
separate boxes and the other boxes
looked<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:39.149> bit<00:00:39.270> rough<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.989> were

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
looked a little bit rough but they were

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.750 
looked a little bit rough but they were
these<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:40.379> both<00:00:40.469> packed<00:00:40.739> very<00:00:41.100> decently<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
these are both packed very decently so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.110 
these are both packed very decently so
I'm<00:00:41.910> not<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.690> terribly<00:00:43.079> concerned<00:00:43.910> this<00:00:44.910> part

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I'm not not terribly concerned this part

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510 
I'm not not terribly concerned this part
for<00:00:45.239> example<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.600> expand<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:47.219> really

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
for example is just expand so not really

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
for example is just expand so not really
much<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.420> could<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.780> wrong<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
much they could go wrong with it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
much they could go wrong with it
hopefully<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.300> fold

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
hopefully you see it's got these fold

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.700 
hopefully you see it's got these fold
out<00:00:51.750> legs<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.260> gonna<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> little

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
out legs that are gonna be a little

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.650 
out legs that are gonna be a little
difficult<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:55.340> all<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.640> appear<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
difficult to see all these appear to be

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.160 
difficult to see all these appear to be
very<00:00:57.809> sturdy<00:00:58.550> adjustable<00:00:59.550> knobs<00:00:59.870> by<00:01:00.870> adjust

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
very sturdy adjustable knobs by adjust

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.479 
very sturdy adjustable knobs by adjust
these<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.469> should<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.710> able<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> let<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> legs

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
these I should be able to let the legs

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.789 
these I should be able to let the legs
out<00:01:03.290> there<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.409> go

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
out there we go

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
out there we go
see<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.850> extend<00:01:06.470> all<00:01:07.470> right<00:01:08.510> extended

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
see they can extend all right extended

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.160 
see they can extend all right extended
they<00:01:09.630> actually<00:01:09.990> extend<00:01:10.140> quite<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.340> that's

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
they actually extend quite a bit that's

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.940 
they actually extend quite a bit that's
surprisingly<00:01:13.170> tall<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.590> actually

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
surprisingly tall that's actually

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.399 
surprisingly tall that's actually
probably<00:01:14.790> four<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> half<00:01:15.600> five<00:01:15.869> five<00:01:16.229> feet

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
probably four and a half five five feet

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.780 
probably four and a half five five feet
something<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.610> without

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
something like that that's without

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
something like that that's without
extending<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> top<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.619> take<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
extending the top at all if I take it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.200 
extending the top at all if I take it
back<00:01:20.040> down<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.430> decently<00:01:20.759> short<00:01:21.000> link

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
back down to a decently short link

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.260 
back down to a decently short link
though<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.049> tighten<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:24.090> see

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
though and tighten this down you see

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
though and tighten this down you see
I've<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.689> other<00:01:24.869> knobs<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
I've got these other knobs that I can

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.660 
I've got these other knobs that I can
extend<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.869> fine<00:01:28.080> new<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.740> raise<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
extend with the fine new one I raise and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
extend with the fine new one I raise and
lower<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.659> weight<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.079> air

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
lower it and if I weight it just air

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
lower it and if I weight it just air
cushioning<00:01:32.220> takes<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.610> stand<00:01:32.850> down<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.990> that's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
cushioning takes it stand down so that's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.569 
cushioning takes it stand down so that's
pretty<00:01:34.350> interesting<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.220> got<00:01:35.340> three

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
pretty interesting and it's got three

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.100 
pretty interesting and it's got three
separate<00:01:35.939> ones<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.329> different<00:01:36.689> height

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
separate ones for different height

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
separate ones for different height
levels<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.729> said<00:01:38.790> all

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
levels you can take it like I said all

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.310 
levels you can take it like I said all
the<00:01:39.180> way<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> nine<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> half<00:01:39.990> feet<00:01:40.259> tall

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the way up to nine and a half feet tall

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.710 
the way up to nine and a half feet tall
so<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:40.979> pretty<00:01:41.310> impressive<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.060> me<00:01:42.210> let<00:01:42.630> me

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so that's pretty impressive to me let me

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.780 
so that's pretty impressive to me let me
get<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.890> little<00:01:44.159> bitter<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.700> we

what happens alrighty so here is the
before<00:03:12.750> lighting<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.769> just<00:03:14.130> wanted<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.519> test<00:03:14.700> it

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
before lighting I just wanted to test it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.400 
before lighting I just wanted to test it
and<00:03:15.030> see<00:03:15.090> how<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.510> works<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.080> an<00:03:16.200> auto

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and see how it works this is an auto

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.910 
and see how it works this is an auto
white<00:03:16.709> balance<00:03:16.790> nothing<00:03:17.790> changed<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.560> this

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
white balance nothing changed and this

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.920 
white balance nothing changed and this
is<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.280> after<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.000> now<00:03:21.090> keep<00:03:21.300> in<00:03:21.480> mind<00:03:21.690> this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
is the after and now keep in mind this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.070 
is the after and now keep in mind this
is<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:23.340> light<00:03:23.700> this<00:03:24.300> is<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.780> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
is just the one light this is not the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.930 
is just the one light this is not the
the<00:03:25.620> four<00:03:25.890> lights<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.400> had<00:03:26.519> going<00:03:26.790> before

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
the four lights that I had going before

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.699 
the four lights that I had going before
so<00:03:27.450> I've<00:03:27.600> got<00:03:27.780> some<00:03:27.930> other<00:03:28.019> things<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.350> can<00:03:28.410> try

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
so I've got some other things I can try

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.220 
so I've got some other things I can try
out<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:29.610> want<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.209> see<00:03:30.330> if<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.540> color<00:03:30.810> balance

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
out I want to see if this color balance

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.009 
out I want to see if this color balance
works<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:31.800> one<00:03:31.950> thing<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.489> that's<00:03:33.420> enough<00:03:33.989> for

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
works for one thing so that's enough for

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:34.479 
works for one thing so that's enough for
now

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
now

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.920 
now
and<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.940> how<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.150> looks<00:03:36.330> with<00:03:36.540> two<00:03:36.690> lights

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and this is how it looks with two lights

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.540 
and this is how it looks with two lights
I've<00:03:37.110> got<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.320> softbox<00:03:37.709> over<00:03:38.040> here<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.459> I've

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
I've got the softbox over here and I've

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.090 
I've got the softbox over here and I've
actually<00:03:38.760> got<00:03:39.120> my<00:03:39.300> other<00:03:40.100> compact

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
actually got my other compact

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.259 
actually got my other compact
fluorescent<00:03:41.519> light<00:03:41.640> bulb<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.940> mentioned

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
fluorescent light bulb I mentioned

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.600 
fluorescent light bulb I mentioned
earlier<00:03:42.630> just<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.709> my<00:03:43.860> heat<00:03:44.130> lamp<00:03:44.340> over<00:03:44.489> there

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
earlier just in my heat lamp over there

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.820 
earlier just in my heat lamp over there
and<00:03:45.209> here's<00:03:45.720> one<00:03:45.900> more<00:03:46.050> test<00:03:46.290> just<00:03:46.380> for<00:03:46.739> good

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
and here's one more test just for good

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.500 
and here's one more test just for good
measure<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.190> turned<00:03:47.519> off<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.850> overhead<00:03:48.150> lights

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
measure I turned off the overhead lights

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.390 
measure I turned off the overhead lights
I<00:03:48.900> wanted<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.410> see<00:03:49.530> if<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.739> made<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> difference

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
I wanted to see if it made a difference

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:03.009 
I wanted to see if it made a difference
actually

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.599 

all<00:04:04.019> right<00:04:04.230> how<00:04:04.379> about<00:04:04.560> now

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
all right how about now

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:06.740 
all right how about now
that's<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> thing<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.299> might<00:04:06.420> have<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.659> get

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
that's the thing I might have to get

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.319 
that's the thing I might have to get
this<00:04:06.840> even<00:04:07.079> even<00:04:07.469> the<00:04:07.590> closer<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.640> don't

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
this even even the closer and I don't

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.349 
this even even the closer and I don't
know<00:04:09.480> how<00:04:09.569> close<00:04:09.719> I<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:09.989> get<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.290> without

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
know how close I can get this without

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:18.099 
know how close I can get this without
making<00:04:12.359> a<00:04:12.599> mess<00:04:12.780> of<00:04:12.810> things<00:04:16.430> yeah<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:17.639> hot

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
making a mess of things yeah that's hot

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.090 
making a mess of things yeah that's hot
literally<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.259> a<00:04:19.289> foot<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.650> half<00:04:19.769> from<00:04:19.829> my

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
literally like a foot and a half from my

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.600 
literally like a foot and a half from my
face<00:04:20.539> not<00:04:21.539> bad<00:04:21.780> though<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.289> mean<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.009> guess<00:04:23.250> a

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
face not bad though I mean I guess a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.400 
face not bad though I mean I guess a
second<00:04:24.360> one<00:04:24.449> over<00:04:24.630> here<00:04:24.780> would<00:04:24.900> probably<00:04:25.259> help

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
second one over here would probably help

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.980 
second one over here would probably help
things<00:04:25.680> significantly<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:27.270> alternative<00:04:27.840> is

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
things significantly the alternative is

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.820 
things significantly the alternative is
to<00:04:28.229> put<00:04:28.470> two<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.850> mean<00:04:30.690> one<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.169> right<00:04:31.199> there<00:04:31.620> I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
to put two I mean one like right there I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.820 
to put two I mean one like right there I
can't<00:04:32.460> get<00:04:32.520> it<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:32.669> play

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
can't get it to play

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.080 
can't get it to play
okay<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:34.979> here's<00:04:35.130> something<00:04:35.400> else<00:04:35.639> I'm<00:04:35.880> just

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
okay and here's something else I'm just

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.640 
okay and here's something else I'm just
trying<00:04:36.360> out<00:04:36.599> I<00:04:36.810> just<00:04:36.990> want<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.199> see<00:04:37.320> how<00:04:37.470> this

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
trying out I just want to see how this

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.219 
trying out I just want to see how this
lighting<00:04:37.889> looks<00:04:38.250> how<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.550> works<00:04:38.990> things<00:04:39.990> of

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
lighting looks how it works things of

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:40.999 
lighting looks how it works things of
that<00:04:40.320> nature

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
that nature

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.620 
that nature
just<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.400> slightly<00:04:41.639> different<00:04:41.849> video<00:04:42.120> layout

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
just a slightly different video layout

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.900 
just a slightly different video layout
that<00:04:43.259> light<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:43.620> awfully<00:04:44.190> big<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.580> awfully

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
that light is awfully big and awfully

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.719 
that light is awfully big and awfully
bright<00:04:45.560> let<00:04:46.560> me<00:04:46.620> try<00:04:46.800> something<00:04:47.009> different

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.040 

okay<00:04:50.729> so<00:04:50.789> now<00:04:51.030> we're<00:04:51.180> trying<00:04:51.419> it<00:04:51.599> with<00:04:51.810> the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
okay so now we're trying it with the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.070 
okay so now we're trying it with the
exposure<00:04:52.710> settings<00:04:53.250> turned<00:04:53.550> off<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.960> I've

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
exposure settings turned off and I've

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.960 
exposure settings turned off and I've
got<00:04:55.229> it<00:04:55.349> auto<00:04:55.500> what<00:04:55.800> or<00:04:56.039> I've<00:04:56.099> got<00:04:56.160> a<00:04:56.280> white

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
got it auto what or I've got a white

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.610 
got it auto what or I've got a white
balance<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.570> custom<00:04:57.960> white<00:04:58.139> balance<00:04:58.169> so<00:04:58.530> it

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
balance but custom white balance so it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.529 
balance but custom white balance so it
shouldn't<00:04:58.889> be<00:04:58.949> changing<00:04:59.340> at<00:04:59.520> all<00:04:59.699> I'm<00:05:00.180> gonna

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
shouldn't be changing at all I'm gonna

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:01.939 
shouldn't be changing at all I'm gonna
move<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.840> light<00:05:00.990> just<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.380> little<00:05:01.620> bit<00:05:01.770> I'm

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
move the light just a little bit I'm

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.200 
move the light just a little bit I'm
actually<00:05:02.099> gonna<00:05:02.340> move<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.760> side<00:05:02.940> and

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
actually gonna move it to the side and

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.460 
actually gonna move it to the side and
down<00:05:03.419> just<00:05:03.659> a<00:05:03.720> little<00:05:03.750> bit<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.169> just<00:05:04.349> see<00:05:04.440> if

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
down just a little bit and just see if

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.430 
down just a little bit and just see if
that<00:05:04.620> makes<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.860> difference<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:06.020> now<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.050> am

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
that makes a difference and now I am

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.020 
that makes a difference and now I am
super<00:05:08.099> dramatic<00:05:10.580> alright<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:11.729> since<00:05:11.909> you

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
super dramatic alright and since you

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.279 
super dramatic alright and since you
didn't<00:05:12.180> get<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.330> chance<00:05:12.389> to<00:05:12.720> see<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.020> full

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
didn't get a chance to see the full

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.860 
didn't get a chance to see the full
assembled<00:05:13.919> item<00:05:14.190> before<00:05:14.340> this<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.449> basically

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
assembled item before this is basically

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.629 
assembled item before this is basically
it<00:05:16.169> you<00:05:16.470> see<00:05:16.650> you've<00:05:16.770> got<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.039> softbox<00:05:17.430> with

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
it you see you've got the softbox with

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.850 
it you see you've got the softbox with
the<00:05:17.820> diffuser<00:05:18.180> on<00:05:18.300> top<00:05:18.720> you've<00:05:19.530> got<00:05:19.560> these

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
the diffuser on top you've got these

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.909 
the diffuser on top you've got these
stand<00:05:20.250> that's<00:05:20.820> holding<00:05:21.240> it<00:05:21.590> looks<00:05:22.590> pretty

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
stand that's holding it looks pretty

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.420 
stand that's holding it looks pretty
decent<00:05:23.539> the<00:05:24.539> one<00:05:24.900> big<00:05:25.470> issue<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:26.010> do<00:05:26.099> see

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
decent the one big issue that I do see

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.570 
decent the one big issue that I do see
with<00:05:26.580> this<00:05:26.729> so<00:05:26.909> far<00:05:27.259> it<00:05:28.259> doesn't<00:05:28.680> have<00:05:28.860> any<00:05:29.220> way

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
with this so far it doesn't have any way

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.649 
with this so far it doesn't have any way
to<00:05:29.610> flip<00:05:30.509> it<00:05:30.720> now<00:05:31.470> it's<00:05:31.680> 19<00:05:32.190> by<00:05:32.370> 28<00:05:32.909> or<00:05:33.120> 19<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:33.630> a

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
to flip it now it's 19 by 28 or 19 and a

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.570 
to flip it now it's 19 by 28 or 19 and a
half<00:05:33.870> by<00:05:34.139> 27<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:34.770> a<00:05:34.860> half<00:05:34.889> so<00:05:35.280> it's<00:05:35.430> actually

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
half by 27 and a half so it's actually

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.960 
half by 27 and a half so it's actually
like<00:05:35.759> 20<00:05:36.150> by<00:05:36.270> 27<00:05:37.169> technically<00:05:37.800> so<00:05:38.550> really<00:05:38.849> it's

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
like 20 by 27 technically so really it's

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.659 
like 20 by 27 technically so really it's
not<00:05:39.030> that<00:05:39.300> much<00:05:39.449> bigger<00:05:40.130> tall<00:05:41.130> than<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:41.550> is

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
not that much bigger tall than it is

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.610 
not that much bigger tall than it is
wide<00:05:41.909> so<00:05:42.509> it's<00:05:42.690> really<00:05:42.930> not<00:05:43.139> that<00:05:43.199> big<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.500> a

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
wide so it's really not that big of a

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.560 
wide so it's really not that big of a
deal<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.639> it<00:05:44.880> would<00:05:45.060> just<00:05:45.090> be<00:05:45.240> kind<00:05:45.539> of

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
deal but it would just be kind of

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.879 
deal but it would just be kind of
convenient<00:05:45.900> if<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.229> could<00:05:46.470> turn<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.860> other

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
convenient if I could turn it the other

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.310 
convenient if I could turn it the other
way<00:05:47.070> because<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.370> extra<00:05:47.729> 6<00:05:48.030> 7<00:05:48.419> 8<00:05:48.570> inches<00:05:48.930> does

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
way because that extra 6 7 8 inches does

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.040 
way because that extra 6 7 8 inches does
feel<00:05:49.650> like<00:05:49.860> quite<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.130> bit<00:05:50.310> of<00:05:50.400> extra<00:05:50.699> light

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
feel like quite a bit of extra light

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.210 
feel like quite a bit of extra light
however<00:05:52.050> if<00:05:52.169> I<00:05:52.259> do<00:05:52.320> get<00:05:52.560> a<00:05:52.590> second<00:05:53.009> one<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.130> think

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
however if I do get a second one I think

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.950 
however if I do get a second one I think
that<00:05:53.460> would<00:05:53.550> make<00:05:53.639> significant<00:05:54.599> difference

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
that would make significant difference

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.200 
that would make significant difference
in<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.169> long<00:05:55.349> run<00:05:55.590> so<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:56.729> don't<00:05:56.909> know<00:05:56.970> let's

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
in the long run so I don't know let's

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.460 
in the long run so I don't know let's
let's<00:05:57.449> take<00:05:57.539> another<00:05:57.810> look<00:05:58.020> at<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.139> just<00:05:58.349> from

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
let's take another look at it just from

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.779 
let's take another look at it just from
the<00:05:58.560> front<00:05:58.770> sorry<00:05:59.220> I'm<00:05:59.370> moving<00:05:59.490> you<00:05:59.729> around

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
the front sorry I'm moving you around

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.740 
the front sorry I'm moving you around
here<00:06:00.180> but<00:06:01.159> there<00:06:02.159> we<00:06:02.280> go<00:06:02.400> that's<00:06:02.699> how<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.539> looks

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
here but there we go that's how it looks

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.180 
here but there we go that's how it looks
directly<00:06:04.229> in<00:06:04.380> front<00:06:04.650> of<00:06:04.740> it<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:04.979> you<00:06:05.039> see

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
directly in front of it and you see

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.110 
directly in front of it and you see
you've<00:06:05.310> got<00:06:05.340> that<00:06:05.490> little<00:06:05.639> bit<00:06:05.789> of<00:06:05.880> a<00:06:05.940> hotspot

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
you've got that little bit of a hotspot

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.390 
you've got that little bit of a hotspot
there<00:06:06.539> in<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.690> middle<00:06:06.900> from<00:06:07.139> the<00:06:07.229> light<00:06:07.440> but

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
there in the middle from the light but

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.730 
there in the middle from the light but
really<00:06:08.760> it<00:06:09.180> doesn't<00:06:09.479> transfer<00:06:09.659> to<00:06:09.870> film<00:06:10.169> all

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
really it doesn't transfer to film all

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.510 
really it doesn't transfer to film all
over

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
over

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.740 
over
digital<00:06:11.910> I<00:06:12.000> guess<00:06:12.210> all<00:06:12.419> that<00:06:12.930> all<00:06:13.199> that<00:06:13.229> much<00:06:13.560> a

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
digital I guess all that all that much a

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.080 
digital I guess all that all that much a
little<00:06:15.750> bit<00:06:15.870> Steadicam<00:06:16.620> try<00:06:16.889> to<00:06:16.949> that's<00:06:17.759> the

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
little bit Steadicam try to that's the

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.640 
little bit Steadicam try to that's the
the<00:06:18.360> setup<00:06:18.720> that's<00:06:18.930> how<00:06:19.110> it<00:06:19.199> connects<00:06:19.560> and

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
the setup that's how it connects and

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.610 
the setup that's how it connects and
everything<00:06:20.009> you<00:06:20.940> got<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.180> cable<00:06:21.539> going<00:06:22.229> down

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
everything you got the cable going down

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.189 
everything you got the cable going down
to<00:06:22.979> the<00:06:23.129> power<00:06:23.849> plug<00:06:24.120> and<00:06:24.300> all<00:06:24.419> that<00:06:24.629> flip<00:06:25.080> on

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
to the power plug and all that flip on

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.740 
to the power plug and all that flip on
switch<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.650> everything<00:06:25.940> and<00:06:26.940> the<00:06:27.509> stand

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
switch and everything and the stand

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.559 
switch and everything and the stand
itself<00:06:28.050> is<00:06:28.319> working<00:06:28.830> very<00:06:28.860> admirably<00:06:29.639> I<00:06:30.000> can't

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
itself is working very admirably I can't

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.869 
itself is working very admirably I can't
say<00:06:30.720> anything<00:06:30.990> bad<00:06:31.169> about<00:06:31.349> it<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:32.430> light

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
say anything bad about it the light

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.809 
say anything bad about it the light
itself<00:06:33.210> it's<00:06:34.050> okay<00:06:34.409> actually<00:06:34.680> when<00:06:35.520> I<00:06:35.550> turn

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
itself it's okay actually when I turn

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.550 
itself it's okay actually when I turn
out<00:06:35.849> the<00:06:36.150> overhead<00:06:36.569> lights<00:06:36.780> it<00:06:37.110> has<00:06:37.259> the<00:06:37.409> most

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
out the overhead lights it has the most

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.460 
out the overhead lights it has the most
dramatic<00:06:37.889> effect<00:06:38.430> so<00:06:39.120> I<00:06:39.419> don't<00:06:40.020> know<00:06:40.080> I<00:06:40.110> might

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
dramatic effect so I don't know I might

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.589 
dramatic effect so I don't know I might
end<00:06:40.650> up<00:06:40.770> keeping<00:06:41.129> it<00:06:41.389> honestly<00:06:42.389> I<00:06:42.419> will

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 
end up keeping it honestly I will

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.540 
end up keeping it honestly I will
probably<00:06:43.050> end<00:06:43.169> up<00:06:43.319> buying<00:06:43.440> a<00:06:43.590> second<00:06:43.979> one<00:06:44.099> and

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
probably end up buying a second one and

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.170 
probably end up buying a second one and
I'll<00:06:44.669> probably<00:06:44.849> do<00:06:45.000> some<00:06:45.150> more

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
I'll probably do some more

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.029 
I'll probably do some more
experimentation<00:06:45.930> you<00:06:45.960> see<00:06:46.169> there<00:06:46.349> my<00:06:46.530> my<00:06:46.830> heat

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
experimentation you see there my my heat

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.089 
experimentation you see there my my heat
lamp<00:06:47.449> the<00:06:48.449> arish<00:06:48.840> that<00:06:49.380> has<00:06:49.560> that<00:06:49.740> extra

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
lamp the arish that has that extra

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.129 
lamp the arish that has that extra
swirly<00:06:50.520> bulb<00:06:50.699> in<00:06:50.849> it<00:06:50.880> that's<00:06:51.569> what<00:06:51.750> I<00:06:51.780> use<00:06:51.960> for

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
swirly bulb in it that's what I use for

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.930 
swirly bulb in it that's what I use for
a<00:06:52.199> couple<00:06:52.319> of<00:06:52.500> the<00:06:52.590> tests<00:06:52.979> the<00:06:53.310> final<00:06:53.759> ones

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
a couple of the tests the final ones

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.200 
a couple of the tests the final ones
were<00:06:54.090> actually<00:06:54.270> just<00:06:54.810> the<00:06:55.470> the<00:06:56.220> softbox<00:06:56.729> on<00:06:57.030> me

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
were actually just the the softbox on me

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.930 
were actually just the the softbox on me
alone<00:06:57.720> so<00:06:58.470> maybe<00:06:58.830> if<00:06:58.979> I<00:06:59.099> can<00:06:59.280> sort<00:06:59.520> of<00:06:59.550> combine

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
alone so maybe if I can sort of combine

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.760 
alone so maybe if I can sort of combine
the<00:07:00.120> two<00:07:00.270> have<00:07:00.539> the<00:07:00.659> heat<00:07:00.840> lamp<00:07:01.050> with<00:07:01.259> this<00:07:01.409> the

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
the two have the heat lamp with this the

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.499 
the two have the heat lamp with this the
swirly<00:07:02.310> bulb<00:07:02.490> punning<00:07:02.909> at<00:07:03.000> the<00:07:03.090> background

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
swirly bulb punning at the background

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.659 
swirly bulb punning at the background
and<00:07:03.780> one<00:07:04.380> or<00:07:04.500> two<00:07:04.530> soft<00:07:04.860> boxes<00:07:04.979> in<00:07:05.370> the<00:07:05.460> front

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
and one or two soft boxes in the front

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.300 
and one or two soft boxes in the front
to<00:07:05.880> get<00:07:06.000> that<00:07:06.150> three-point<00:07:06.659> light<00:07:06.840> effect<00:07:07.310> it

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
to get that three-point light effect it

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.339 
to get that three-point light effect it
might<00:07:08.490> actually<00:07:08.729> work<00:07:09.150> out<00:07:09.389> pretty<00:07:09.659> well<00:07:09.780> so

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:10.349 
might actually work out pretty well so

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:12.260 
might actually work out pretty well so
that's<00:07:11.129> all<00:07:11.340> for<00:07:11.520> right<00:07:11.550> now<00:07:11.669> though<00:07:12.030> I

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
that's all for right now though I

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.610 
that's all for right now though I
thought<00:07:12.659> I<00:07:12.719> would<00:07:12.870> just<00:07:12.900> give<00:07:13.110> you<00:07:13.199> a<00:07:13.289> look<00:07:13.469> at

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
thought I would just give you a look at
