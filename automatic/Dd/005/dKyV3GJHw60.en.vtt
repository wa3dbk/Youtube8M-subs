00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello , light of light is approaching 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.189
 Easter 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.900
 which means we will cook Easter cakes 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 Today I offer modern 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.920
 alternative to easter muffins i them 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 I just adore it because it's preparing 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
 fast and look very beautiful at first 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.270
 connect with 200 grams of melted 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 butter that is one pack 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.960
 a glass of sugar and grind now 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.070
 add 2 eggs and lemon zest all 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.070
 mix until smooth 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.480
 the center added the mood of our liquid 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 mixtures sugar is already dissolved in oil and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 now we add the main ingredient 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.390
 this is yogurt yes thanks to yogurt 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.740
 these muffins are always honest 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 servant 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.010
 such colossus is a win-win 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.690
 especially for those who spend whole days on 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.850
 work if in classical since 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.410
 mess around all day with tomatoes 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.900
 cook and fast and most importantly not 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.400
 100% oily 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.200
 liquid ingredients are ready now 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.670
 we combine all the dried flour a little soda 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.650
 or baking powder just a little bit and salt 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.680
 stir and now gradually 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.300
 add flour 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.660
 to our liquid ingredients and 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.680
 stir 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.540
 so i'm doing less 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.490
 lumps formed if you pour out 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.770
 immediately and the dry mixture is then very difficult 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.430
 will get rid of them and if you add 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.850
 gradually 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.619
 fat so simplify your life many 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.570
 my friends do not cook paski because 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.979
 it is long and difficult, but such 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.810
 one hundred percent easter muffins 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.700
 always turns out and most importantly ready for 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.440
 only takes an hour of time so 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.960
 this year you simply owe them 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.000
 cook the dough should 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.820
 It will turn out like this a little thicker than 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 Pancake I like to add to the dough 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.990
 candied fruit or raisins do not like to add 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.909
 mac mac usually crunches on teeth 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.710
 before adding raisins pour 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.270
 boiling water for our raisins to become 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 juicier and leave for a couple of minutes 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.920
 stand raisins swell we began 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.490
 now you can add it to the dough 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.490
 add 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.869
 our dough is ready to fill it with molds 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.700
 pour the dough into two thirds of the volume 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.810
 molds and leave space for 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.810
 so that the dough was where to grow 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.610
 bake muffins will be in the oven 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.520
 warmed to 190 degrees for 20 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.170
 minutes drove and while our muffins are in 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.420
 the oven will tackle the top today 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.480
 I will show two ways to decorate the tops 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370
 first classic cold squirrels 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.580
 powdered sugar and combine with 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.560
 blender whip if beaten correctly 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.730
 powdered sugar with protein should 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.890
 get the icing like that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.170
 consistency second decoration 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.330
 muffin tops would be unusual i 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.550
 cook it from white chocolate all 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.810
 than just breaking white chocolate 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.490
 slices and melt in the microwave 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.480
 by the way melt the best de porous a 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.150
 plain chocolate 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.070
 put it in the microwave start from 20 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.550
 seconds and and see how fast 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.680
 easy it melts everything is fine 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.570
 Melt 20 seconds was sufficient and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.470
 in the meantime my colts got ready 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.600
 very happy to see them 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.600
 and even more inhale their magical scent 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.569
 it remains to decorate them and everything is ready two 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.640
 decoration options are already ready for me 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.170
 white melted chocolate and frosting 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.709
 powdered sugar and protein 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.269
 usually what we do is take a spoon and 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.150
 spread the icing on top I'm today 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.049
 I will arrive with a non-standard muffin we dip 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.049
 in our frosting 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.870
 inside the castle 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.030
 correctly apply the glaze exactly in so 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.560
 dipping after this use the dressing 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.769
 now do the same with white 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.769
 chocolate 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.870
 Easter muffins turned out just 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.639
 delicious and it took to cook everything 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.019
 only an hour of time they are all day like this 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.639
 would happen if I cooked 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.639
 traditional easter cakes 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.910
 be sure to cook Easter 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.910
 muffins for these positions
