 so for this first video I count 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.169
 introduce you to a little trick kama 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:22.510
 after the famous leeks my agents 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:26.060
 cast iron melee so 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.070
 this trick kama market already before the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.640
 update where but a tip that 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.119
 market 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.890
 after this update so why 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.530
 do this trick cammas is very 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.870
 you're going to have to be 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.960
 chevron at least at level 40 for 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.180
 can go to cut walnut 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.660
 so it's very healthy club to go 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.949
 cut walnut wood and what is 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.100
 you are going to make wood of the beaten groom 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.960
 you will simply sell it 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.900
 here are look at the prices you have at 39 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.409
 kama miles letting it take on 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.869
 just waiting to worry about it's good to 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.880
 see walnut 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.070
 yes, there is one who has had to 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.270
 fool then first bought in hitchhiking 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.470
 here you are, that's thirty-nine thousand 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.009
 carats leaving so with your ax 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.320
 from lumberjack you go to the huge area 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.649
 where you have a big pack of months 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.929
 deny that I'm going to challenge you all 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:38.960
 immediately so go to the plain 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:43.460
 cafes from there you go in 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:48.619
 journey of a dozen bab to the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.390
 youth peninsula and so what is it 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.909
 that there is of particular the ball is this 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.939
 that actually comes is that you are going 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.869
 brands that are quite huge 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.700
 level walnut 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.420
 so much so that you will be able to 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.999
 start to collect a tree and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.649
 click on all the others is pending 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.090
 besides doing the show starts in 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.220
 your father on jacqueline all the mark 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.240
 is true to change hands since 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.220
 only in wood of thirty minutes 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.819
 you have easy way of farm and 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.750
 300 to 400 walnut wood per tree 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.290
 to drown 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.300
 which makes you a total of 221 to little 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.500
 near thirty minutes what is 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:38.990
 rather profitable so we're almost there 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.300
 here you are not at south and frozen or 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.050
 that you have dufresne also a on 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.750
 some maps 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.430
 if it can always make plans I 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:58.390
 show your handyman is 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:58.390
 not a people we we from the maple bones 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.100
 so that's it so here they are cut 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:19.459
 already let you find map that is 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:22.190
 not cut so we welcome him as 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.930
 all the popes precisely what I 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.730
 advise the loop but besides you 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.680
 show the maps where there are the most 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:36.739
 so it's very simple just 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.910
 you go on me more all and so 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.630
 what are you going to do on dofus 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.360
 both maps 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.260
 here you have the map that goes 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.260
 display screen 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.319
 here you select the job so 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.549
 months and already selected and so what 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.650
 what is good is that once 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.569
 then you will select walnut and 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.519
 there they show you all the men where 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.530
 there are trees so you see well 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.599
 the peninsula and I looked 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.000
 this note for example there are twelve woods 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.409
 to give here in 2009 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.760
 there you date is still nine then 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.470
 knowing that I recommend the peÃ±a 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.350
 south and frozen and before there are big 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.389
 tablecloths and you come across that one that 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.729
 is less strong but that the name of 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.639
 group 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.530
 so here you know now where she 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.000
 is closed from the wood of win you can 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.389
 then go and sell it quietly 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.669
 in hd 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.220
 and then the kamas are going to be very easy 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.780
 and will fall very quickly 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.889
 yes little things too if you have the 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.330
 possibility of farming and the night is 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.800
 simpler who will have more trees 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.870
 the year like that to the selected ones to 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.090
 other trees and valleys the lighthouse but 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.680
 all alone is watching but here it goes 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.000
 all you like on the maps there is 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.650
 many trees to make them 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.590
 tons and tons and tons like 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.810
 this and it will facilitate the form 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.030
 Verry much 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.780
 so thank you for watching
