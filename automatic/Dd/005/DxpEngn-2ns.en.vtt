00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.370
 What is it 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.410
 when bands like they are here and move 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.029
 mx reporting yes gentlemen today 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 I bring you a special video because 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.350
 is the first official boxing of the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 new generation of consoles and in this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.210
 case it was the xbox one and here the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.640
 Greater Nelson brings us the unboxing 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.010
 let's say he is the official spokesman and good 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 and it comes out talking in the video very 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.309
 quickly faster than me 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 then I will be explaining more 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.340
 or less what it says that is what 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.339
 bring and we will be analyzing the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 differences with the xbox 360 that is 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.670
 right now and good gentlemen 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.859
 here as we can see brings the kinect 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 then he shows us the headset that is a 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.739
 little different from the 360 ​​then comes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.129
 the control then comes the super cable 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.589
 of hdmi that according to him highlights super pro 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 then come the useless manuals and 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.679
 a super sticker that will be worth 8500 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.449
 weights that is worth the america console good 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.370
 then we have in the cables to 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.010
 that go to the electrical connection and 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.180
 after the console let's say that the most 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.190
 expected 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.290
 here we can see the console well 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.480
 packaged that fart and good 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.340
 Gentlemen is not as big as it is 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.900
 I thought that exaggerated all those who 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.750
 They said it looked like a VCR 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.690
 but good gentlemen there is the xbox one 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 well just as it is going to come already in its 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.190
 launch day and well now you 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 let's see the piece by piece and the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.460
 differences of each one I'm going to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.140
 be commenting mostly for 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 us the gamers that we set ourselves a 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.860
 little more in the specifications and good 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 gentlemen as we can see it does not bring 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.700
 trays no no no it is extracted let's say 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.560
 you just go to the little button so 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 spits us out the album very much like 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.100
 Playstation 3 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.410
 then we bring the usb port and the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.910
 little button where you will detect the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.920
 different devices either as the 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.210
 controls and all that fart after good 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.670
 Lords eyes here in the back 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 we have the electricity connector and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.530
 then we find the entrance 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.630
 hdmi and gentlemen only brings entry 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.340
 hdmi so if you are someone who 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 has a TV visit with the entry of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.310
 surround the cable cited yellow red and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.619
 White 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.060
 you can also see it considering going to 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.730
 have to buy a high screen 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.680
 definition because it only brings in 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.989
 to me for what was already expected because 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.790
 everything will be high in high definition 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.830
 but you have to consider it and good 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.349
 gentlemen from there we passed to the connector 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.840
 optical audio which did not make me 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.569
 thank you very much gentlemen for me that I am 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.849
 gamer and I'm recording because I do not 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.890
 brings the same entry as the xbox 360 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.049
 here we can see in the image how it was 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.140
 entry as obviously not 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.519
 retrocompatible therefore therefore this 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.730
 it will only affect us all 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.290
 those who use headset and then I 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 I used the headset to listen 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.769
 the game and to record then then 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.690
 let's say this breaks me a little 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.670
 bags because we're going to have to 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.870
 get an optical audio cable 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.090
 digital 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.920
 apart obviously this does not come included 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.170
 how is it like they are seeing and 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.799
 also a converter to be able to 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.260
 connect the headset and good I like them 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.349
 he commented he used it mainly 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.750
 to record what it is to talk about 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.210
 while I'm playing 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.490
 and having to use other headsets or 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.160
 to do everything at the same time but 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.980
 Well, gentlemen, that's how we say 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.600
 are the most common entries 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.300
 last thing I showed you it was only for 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.940
 the 360 ​​but if you do not use 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.340
 headset or do not record like me then 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.010
 It will not affect them absolutely 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.380
 in nothing after that comes the entrance 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.260
 of hdmi but for the satellite system 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.240
 of cable those gentlemen neither be excited nor 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.330
 of joke will reach Latin America to 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.860
 no place in Latin America and Europe 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.260
 Spain and this one, I do not think that 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.810
 then do not worry about that it's not going to 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.000
 be usable then comes the usb and the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.550
 contact for the big coming kinect 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.350
 then comes the other one who is also 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.780
 as for the kinect but another form of 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.150
 connect it and then it comes in the entrance 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.310
 or the ethernet port after we 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.840
 shows the security seal if it is 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.340
 we remove loses warranty so that the 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.590
 they're going to open and they're not going to hack it 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.140
 also afterwards he shows us that he has 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.090
 fans on top but 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.269
 you can see it brings vents for 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.380
 all parts will prevent it from getting hot 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.690
 It comes after this 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.080
 the accessories that is the classic box 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.790
 of electricity also now if 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.860
 let's take control, gentlemen, as we can 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.260
 see is not the same entry that brings the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.870
 of 360 which also worries me a 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.540
 little since I would like it to be 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.670
 compatible with these hands-free that 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.760
 they serve for the cell phone and also for 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.370
 play the 360 ​​I hope we say that the 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.620
 wireless connection that has the the xbox 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.620
 one is compatible since so 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.470
 I understand the xbox one does not come with 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.140
 bluetooth so it's only wireless 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.420
 the interconnections that you will have for 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.580
 so I hope that the sos headset 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.580
 so expensive that they have sold so they are 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.160
 compatible with this version of xbox one 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.530
 and well then there he emphasizes that the 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.840
 control will have the day 1 mark and 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.060
 Well here is the special supervision 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.950
 and then we went to the super king jr 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.660
 that is huge apparently do not bring 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.360
 movement like the other kinect like the 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.880
 kinect 1 and good tells us that it will be 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.560
 adaptable for all types of rooms 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.240
 I hope so because here in 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.009
 Latin America the rooms are not 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.919
 as big as usa 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.779
 shows us the diadem that with different 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.860
 connection comes a bit more modern better 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.539
 made it can be 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.399
 I hope they last longer so they are not so 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.169
 badges and good guys this has been all 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.749
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.639
 here shows us how we latches 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.759
 we see in the next see you later 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.759
 bye
