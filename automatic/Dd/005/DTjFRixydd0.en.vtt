00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hi guys are cleaning for the first time 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 I want to offer you a prediction of the team 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.849
 of the week of this standard day 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 to what we're going to analyze in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.599
 however this video will not be a real one 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.210
 and own theme of the week of the whole 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.070
 league of the series to but only of the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.810
 juventus players in fact who he is 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.609
 fan of my facebook page and who not 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.650
 it still is and if so many really 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.850
 you haven't put it like me or you yet 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.670
 invitation to find the link on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 description will have read that at the end of the first 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.650
 time of the juve game I had 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 said and stated that I rent and if e 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.340
 iv lichtsteiner would be soon 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.530
 arrived in our consoles 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 here this may not be true 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.090
 seen and considered the second half 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 of juventus and some of his 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.260
 players who do not fall seriously a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.899
 get a version then this 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.449
 video wants to analyze those a little 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.390
 are the possible candidates to obtain 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.610
 the black card and also the statistics e 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.219
 york network the stars for weak skills 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 that they could inherit from this new one 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.149
 version 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.159
 let's start immediately with the protagonist in the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 first time that is that fernando llorente 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.720
 who never got his own version e 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.119
 I've always liked this year too 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 last as he was a player 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.869
 however very strong in its version 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.030
 miff last year I did not 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.360
 still got to try it had 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 a downgrade of one is in the category and in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.540
 this hypothetical version iv 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.360
 I gave it two points in speed 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.729
 two dribbling points as this 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.070
 is a player who is stationary yes 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.720
 has a very large tonnage but with i 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.770
 foot knows how to do it and showed it in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.680
 more than one occasion then he in 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.470
 dribbling is however just 76 but if it is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.500
 deserves more two in the shot and then arrives 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.750
 81 plus one in defense plus a pass 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.540
 I believe in physique despite the 85's 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.670
 really great the work network from 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.229
 average middle I was taken to medium high in 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.119
 as with this form with which he has 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.310
 played today, Juventus is 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.020
 demonstrated a real striker 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.369
 especially during the first goal 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.659
 who unlocked the game is done 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.880
 find it in the right place at the moment 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.700
 right on the rejected of mirante on 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.649
 strong aft shot one of the two 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.770
 shots that got the goal before 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.990
 llorente then and tevez 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.880
 thanks to cuba and so I would say one 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.230
 high sideboard is used to find the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.800
 right time on the rejected of 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.180
 weaker star goalkeeper 3 to 3 because 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.490
 however he has not shown he knows 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.040
 use the claim and justify a 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.480
 increase in stars stability 23 per lo 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.970
 same speech the dreaming this 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.800
 could be the first iv version of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.000
 lorente and I sincerely hope he will 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.020
 attributed because a player who to me 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.850
 really like it 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.860
 second player who applies to 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.300
 this iv version could be 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.640
 the young Spanish striker died 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.440
 which lately is demonstrating all the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.420
 its value and what those were 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.700
 promises to real madrid could be 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.110
 also kept in juventus eco jersey 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.540
 walled up users difference I have it 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.650
 tried when I started or was 15 and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.450
 I must say that a player who is me 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.550
 liked so much I can't tell you if it's wet 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.710
 or less anyway some warner always has 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.260
 done is really was a sniper and 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.170
 so I want to give him a card iv 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.360
 quite important enough with 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.250
 juicy updates because 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.110
 would be really justified e 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.210
 could make a player die 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.890
 really very palatable during all 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.260
 series with more than 2 speed more than 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.060
 david bing plus 3 shooting plus 2 defense 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.890
 plus 2 the passage that between de physical 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.840
 here are features they remember 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.880
 very those of Ilorente above all 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.010
 iwork reit from medium to medium high 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.170
 because this is a player that when 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.150
 takes the ball doesn't give a damn about it 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.520
 his companions and part with his head down like 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.050
 the kids never played football 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.120
 he wants to derive everyone and therefore he aims 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.100
 always the work race door high in 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.380
 very justified attack weak foot 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.480
 however they remain at three is established by 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.520
 two by three because anyway as dribbling 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
 he is really a very strong player 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.330
 let's move on to two players now 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.310
 would get the iv version would be 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.540
 very interesting because in addition to a 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.040
 enhancing their skills 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.200
 they would also get to the new position 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.940
 is the first to Lichsteiner which is 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.030
 attributed as external right 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.800
 within cifa 15 is definitely in 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.600
 virtue of the two seasons he played 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.550
 as fifth in the midfield even though he 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.970
 born fullback today he played and even 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.040
 got two goals with two assists per 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.110
 llorente 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.420
 and an amazing goal and then the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.489
 We attach a plus 2 more speed 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.169
 thread dribbling a plus 3 shot over 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.049
 three more defense between passing more 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.030
 nudi physical work race remains high high e 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.949
 the weak foot stars and skill stars 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.139
 certainly not different from steiner 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.300
 would get a really upgrade 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.220
 really very important as in 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.810
 series of strong fullbacks it comes to me 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.509
 only maicon since he breaks down 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.430
 become a silver is definitely the 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.990
 plus three defenses are justified by the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.669
 made sure you don't have to play a 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.770
 a little further back plus 3 passing through 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.910
 dedicated only to the fact that today it has 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.430
 made two assists 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.530
 even if in any case like cross there 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.070
 we are still but finally we come to 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.199
 a player who really should 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.120
 come true with this sim card 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.180
 we are talking about tevez would become 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.430
 one of the candidates for my food card 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.919
 favorite within the foot 15 in 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.740
 how much tevez hasn't played from at t but 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.310
 from aps together with to was behind 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.380
 llorente 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.660
 you have to see how he interprets it ea 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.820
 sports because in my opinion and you are 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.099
 done the wing could also be done 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.110
 as a coc version I sincerely hope 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.880
 that can be hijacked on 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.490
 left as you can see the 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.050
 features and the upgrade that the 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.320
 I attribute is very similar to the version 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.169
 iv which is attributed to and sports recently 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.400
 changes only at the physical level and 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.000
 I give him one more point 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.979
 only for the fact that he has in his 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.169
 second goal he made a ride 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.120
 impressive they could not throw 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.340
 down despite they have tried it he is 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.860
 remained standing all the time and then 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.530
 more physical trades 89 look at the 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.960
 statistics are almost all above 80 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.490
 in the defense that has increased because 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.949
 playing as a winger a little more than defense 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.870
 serves and give it an extra star in the 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.150
 Ability would be essential above all 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.159
 because it would play from ats 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.560
 but it doesn't end here because I definitely do 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.380
 I think it will be tevez 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.480
 we will receive the number one suspect 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.390
 summit of all juve players 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.430
 cited to date but I think it is a 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.650
 player who made a match 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.690
 amazing and nobody is talking about it 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.040
 no consideration 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.800
 I'm talking about the left-back 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.670
 invented today by merry because we are 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.070
 more in emergency 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.070
 I'm talking about drum rolls 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.190
 simone padule that today reminded me of a 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.370
 jordi alba and then I attributed it 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.930
 an iv version in silver paper like 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.370
 you can see indeed different from all of them 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.200
 the other papers of the report so far 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.919
 with the statistics of jordi alba 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.080
 Padoin 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.480
 today I loved it so 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.970
 maybe sports give me this gift 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.880
 decades last week I go to today 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.169
 ts juve is missing a strong ps and will have 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.300
 I do not like it at all 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:59.560
 could be padoin the heir well 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.990
 guys the video ends here were 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.490
 just short to even know 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.320
 what do you think about it before the 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.300
 theme of the week before i come out 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.580
 it was because surely a player of the 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.620
 juve will be present tell me who you are 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.090
 you think he can come out with what 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.040
 features such as statistics 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.810
 up-to-date also work would remain there 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.820
 skill and the stars asks for weak like that 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.110
 let's see which of us will get caught if the 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.150
 video you liked I invite you to leave
