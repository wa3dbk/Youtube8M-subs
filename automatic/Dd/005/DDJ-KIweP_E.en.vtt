00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello friends today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.560
 draw a very simple rose let's 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.530
 see how it is done 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.459
 the first thing we will do is a kind of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.459
 that but with the spiral in the part 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.459
 higher 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:26.050
 then we give thickness to the top 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.050
 which will be a petal 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.350
 and we close on this side 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.350
 well now we give form to another petal 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:45.000
 and we close on this side 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.030
 we close this petal to what would be 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.030
 the base of our rose in this way 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.890
 we keep making petals 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.120
 one over here 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.120
 another on the top 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.240
 one on the left 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.520
 we draw 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.400
 a leaf 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.590
 in what would be the basis 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.590
 another sheet on this side 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 a sheet on the top 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.630
 and finally a sheet 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.490
 from this side 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:40.390
 for the base 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.980
 we draw as an oval and what would be 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.060
 our stem 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.740
 and finally 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.259
 a sheet and as you can see we already have 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.450
 our rose finished in a very 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.430
 easy to do it I hope you have them 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.619
 liked do not forget to subscribe comment 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.460
 and give it a like see you until the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.610
 next 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.610
 bye
