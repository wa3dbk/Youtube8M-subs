00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.070

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.550
 at an early morning somehow the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.550

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:54.600

 im watching which smaller zoom level 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.649
 use 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.250
 I'd rather let the colleague 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.930
 proceed the safe somehow I have 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:22.560

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.560
 I never get ready 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.579
 because I played male 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.420
 because of 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.990
 ok turned ever shoots at the 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.630
 general 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 power is I can see nothing okay 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.189
 the obligatory infrared mission 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.570
 we have here and I thought so myself 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.570
 to do with the last balls 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:23.110
 I always like it when we go abroad 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:24.780

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.310
 gear 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.939
 look at the reconstructed airplane oh you 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.939
 shit if something really exists 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.210
 is also unnecessary, the idea shoots 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.210
 or if I already know that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.670

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:42.729

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:52.830

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:52.830

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.289
