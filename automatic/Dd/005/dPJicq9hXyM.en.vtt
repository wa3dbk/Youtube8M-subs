00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.710 
the camera and say stupid things for a
while<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.399> trying<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.090> back<00:00:33.300> into<00:00:33.540> it

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
while so I'm trying to get back into it

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.080 
while so I'm trying to get back into it
now<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.200> hopefully<00:00:34.680> I'll<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.699> sort<00:00:35.879> of<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
now I hopefully I'll get some sort of a

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
now I hopefully I'll get some sort of a
regularity<00:00:36.539> going<00:00:36.989> again<00:00:37.230> fingers<00:00:38.100> crossed

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
regularity going again fingers crossed

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.889 
regularity going again fingers crossed
so<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.789> thought<00:00:38.969> I'd<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.510> something<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so I thought I'd just do something a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
so I thought I'd just do something a
little<00:00:39.989> bit<00:00:40.199> stupid<00:00:40.800> silly<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> kind<00:00:42.239> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.180 
then and I do like a peanut butter
sandwich<00:01:51.420> every<00:01:51.900> now<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.260> so<00:01:52.800> I<00:01:53.100> figured

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
sandwich every now and then so I figured

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.060 
sandwich every now and then so I figured
why<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.750> try<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.230> peanut<00:01:55.830> butter<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
why not try out a peanut butter and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.460 
why not try out a peanut butter and
jelly<00:01:56.280> sandwich<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:56.940> PB&amp;J<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.720> they<00:01:57.900> call<00:01:58.440> it

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
jelly sandwich or a PB&amp;J as they call it

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.010 
jelly sandwich or a PB&amp;J as they call it

is<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> bit<00:03:40.139> sticky<00:03:40.590> as<00:03:40.829> well<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.810> stickier<00:03:42.810> than

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
is a bit sticky as well so stickier than

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.729

normal peanut butter tends to be so this

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.439 
normal peanut butter tends to be so this
is<00:03:46.919> kind<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.280> commitment<00:03:48.319> chunks<00:03:49.319> almost<00:03:50.449> this

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
is kind of commitment chunks almost this

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.890

butter<00:03:55.169> before<00:03:55.319> so<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.709> guess<00:03:56.010> wouldn't<00:03:56.849> have

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
butter before so I guess wouldn't have

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.030 
butter before so I guess wouldn't have
to<00:03:57.629> compare<00:03:58.019> against<00:03:58.349> daughter<00:03:58.590> homemade

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040
