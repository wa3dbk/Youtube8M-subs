thought it turned out really nice it it
does<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> purpose<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.200> wanted<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.619> it's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
does the purpose that I wanted to it's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.719 
does the purpose that I wanted to it's
safe<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> secure<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.720> I'm<00:01:42.840> running<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
safe and secure so when I'm running it

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
safe and secure so when I'm running it
won't<00:01:44.729> kind<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.110> move<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.530> place

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
won't kind of you know move out of place

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.490 
won't kind of you know move out of place
and<00:01:47.250> also<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.970> length<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:49.350> good

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
and also this length is really good

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
and also this length is really good
because<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.920> won't<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.280> hitting<00:01:50.430> my<00:01:50.759> knees<00:01:51.000> too

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
because it won't be hitting my knees too

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.340 
because it won't be hitting my knees too
much<00:01:52.250> when<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> run<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.360> figure<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.290> is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
much when I run so I figure this is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.480 
much when I run so I figure this is
perfect<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.979> took<00:01:59.310> me

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
perfect so this is it and it took me

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.980 
perfect so this is it and it took me
about<00:01:59.790> between<00:02:00.509> two<00:02:00.930> days<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:02.159> took<00:02:02.399> me<00:02:02.579> about

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
about between two days it took me about

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.170 
about between two days it took me about

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.150 
few weeks ago I did get a pretty nasty
blister<00:04:13.829> and<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.700> was<00:04:15.209> not<00:04:15.450> fun<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:16.350> at<00:04:16.500> all<00:04:16.620> so

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
blister and it was not fun not at all so

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.010 
blister and it was not fun not at all so
I<00:04:17.190> figured<00:04:17.489> I'd<00:04:17.640> get<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.539> if<00:04:18.780> anything

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
I figured I'd get this and if anything

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.110 
I figured I'd get this and if anything
just<00:04:19.440> apply<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.910> area<00:04:21.330> that

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
just apply this to the area that

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.090 
just apply this to the area that
that<00:04:22.210> affected<00:04:22.600> before<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:23.949> I<00:04:23.979> can

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
that affected before so that I can

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.530 
that affected before so that I can
prevent<00:04:24.699> that<00:04:24.910> from<00:04:24.970> happening<00:04:25.150> again

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
prevent that from happening again

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.750 
prevent that from happening again
because<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.199> was<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.800> big<00:04:26.949> news<00:04:27.130> II<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.550> I

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
because that was a big news II and I

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.629 
because that was a big news II and I
don't<00:04:27.940> want<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.120> happening<00:04:28.330> again<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.949> got

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
don't want that happening again so got

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.000 
don't want that happening again so got
that<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.240> then<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:32.139> last<00:04:32.350> thing<00:04:32.560> I<00:04:32.740> got<00:04:32.979> from
