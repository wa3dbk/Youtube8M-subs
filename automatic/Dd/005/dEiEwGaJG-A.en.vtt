together<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:59.420> it<00:02:00.420> would<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
together and then it would be like I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.740 
together and then it would be like I
don't<00:02:01.710> even<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> much<00:02:03.270> golden

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
don't even know if that much golden

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.539 
don't even know if that much golden
information<00:02:04.380> could<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.219> spot

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
information could be in one spot

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
information could be in one spot
together<00:02:05.939> without<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.420> universe<00:02:06.869> exploding

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
together without the universe exploding

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.520 
together without the universe exploding
I<00:02:07.590> mean<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.009> almost<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:09.000> freaking<00:02:09.530> having

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
I mean it's almost like freaking having

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.800 
I mean it's almost like freaking having
I<00:02:10.920> got<00:02:11.580> nothing<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.540> ran<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:12.989> there

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
I got nothing it ran out there

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.970 
I got nothing it ran out there
I should<00:02:14.050> have<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.200> cut<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.590> off<00:02:14.709> right

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
I should have just cut it off right

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.030 
I should have just cut it off right
there<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:16.000> know<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.390> had<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.500> keep<00:02:17.620> going

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.370 
there but you know I had to keep going
and<00:02:18.220> now<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.540> coolness<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.140> whole

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
and now the coolness of that whole

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.410 
and now the coolness of that whole
little<00:02:20.980> rant<00:02:21.370> right<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:21.880> has<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.090> been

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
little rant right there has just been

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.130 
little rant right there has just been
totally<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.349> completely<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:24.280> utterly

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
totally and completely and utterly

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.729 
totally and completely and utterly
destroyed<00:02:26.140> as<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.250> add<00:02:27.810> extra<00:02:28.810> adjectives<00:02:29.410> to

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
destroyed as I add extra adjectives to

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.380 
destroyed as I add extra adjectives to
hide<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.370> fact<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.819> couldn't<00:02:31.090> think<00:02:31.120> of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
hide the fact that I couldn't think of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.880 
hide the fact that I couldn't think of
the<00:02:31.420> next<00:02:31.630> word<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.170> wanted<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.620> say<00:02:32.830> but

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the next word that I wanted to say but

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.790 
the next word that I wanted to say but
anyway<00:02:33.870> got<00:02:34.870> all<00:02:34.959> sorts<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.319> weapons<00:02:35.470> here

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
anyway got all sorts of weapons here

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.330 
anyway got all sorts of weapons here
there's<00:02:36.069> not<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:37.530> well<00:02:38.530> obviously

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
there's not really like a well obviously

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.479 
there's not really like a well obviously
there's<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.790> set<00:02:40.000> spot<00:02:40.330> for<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.630> weapons<00:02:40.959> but

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
there's a set spot for the weapons but

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.030 
there's a set spot for the weapons but
because<00:02:42.489> that's<00:02:42.670> where<00:02:42.849> they<00:02:42.970> are<00:02:43.120> but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
because that's where they are but

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.130 
because that's where they are but
basically<00:02:45.040> there's<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:46.299> some<00:02:46.750> will<00:02:46.900> be<00:02:47.019> on

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
basically there's like some will be on

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.870 
basically there's like some will be on
the<00:02:47.170> ground<00:02:47.410> over<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.519> some<00:02:48.670> will<00:02:48.790> be

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
the ground over here and some will be

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.370 
the ground over here and some will be
here<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.269> not<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.569> built<00:02:49.870> an<00:02:50.019> altar<00:02:50.140> for

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
here so not like you built an altar for

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.600 
here so not like you built an altar for
the<00:02:50.680> sniper<00:02:50.950> or<00:02:51.220> anything<00:02:51.549> like<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:53.610> it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
the sniper or anything like that so it

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.559 
the sniper or anything like that so it
got<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.900> thing<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.470> thing<00:02:57.569> warthog

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
got that thing and that thing warthog

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.910 
got that thing and that thing warthog
and<00:02:58.599> Mongoose<00:02:59.110> couldn't<00:02:59.470> think<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.769> word

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
and Mongoose couldn't think of the word

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.600 
and Mongoose couldn't think of the word
for<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.849> moment<00:03:01.360> there<00:03:01.660> but<00:03:02.040> don't<00:03:03.040> worry<00:03:03.310> I

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
for a moment there but don't worry I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.050 
for a moment there but don't worry I
have<00:03:03.940> corrected<00:03:04.450> myself<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.400> gotcha<00:03:06.400> DMR's

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
have corrected myself so I gotcha DMR's

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.570 
have corrected myself so I gotcha DMR's
and<00:03:07.510> all<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.780> good<00:03:07.930> stuff<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.680> then<00:03:08.769> that

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
and all that good stuff and then that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.039 
and all that good stuff and then that
revenant<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:11.670> not<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.910> hidden<00:03:13.390> but<00:03:13.660> this

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
revenant is not as hidden but this

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.559 
revenant is not as hidden but this
concussive<00:03:14.590> rifle<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.160> hidden<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.640> he<00:03:16.330> put<00:03:16.540> a

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
concussive rifle is hidden and he put a

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.030 
concussive rifle is hidden and he put a
don't<00:03:17.470> stand<00:03:18.070> here<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.519> camp<00:03:18.850> marker<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.890> that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
don't stand here in camp marker so that

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.590 
don't stand here in camp marker so that
people<00:03:21.280> didn't<00:03:21.549> just<00:03:21.730> stand<00:03:21.940> there<00:03:22.090> in<00:03:22.299> camp

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
people didn't just stand there in camp

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.500 
people didn't just stand there in camp
so<00:03:23.260> then<00:03:23.920> he's<00:03:24.070> got<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:24.489> little<00:03:24.760> turret

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
so then he's got this little turret

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.050 
so then he's got this little turret
right<00:03:25.630> here<00:03:25.900> which<00:03:26.079> is<00:03:26.260> good<00:03:26.500> because<00:03:26.769> it

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
right here which is good because it

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.280 
right here which is good because it
helps<00:03:28.060> hold<00:03:28.209> people<00:03:28.540> down<00:03:28.720> while<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.109> rape

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
helps hold people down while you rape

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.559 
helps hold people down while you rape
them<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:30.730> know<00:03:30.819> that's<00:03:30.970> always<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.359> good

thing<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.140> can't<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.620> them<00:03:32.739> squirming

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130

good thing is you can watch the other

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.009 
good thing is you can watch the other
people<00:03:39.549> doing<00:03:39.819> it<00:03:39.910> because<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.390> other<00:03:40.569> turret

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
people doing it because the other turret

is in sight from right there so in all

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.500 
is in sight from right there so in all
seriousness<00:03:44.380> that's<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.130> good<00:03:45.310> thing<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.060> do<00:03:46.329> is

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
seriousness that's a good thing to do is

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.110 
seriousness that's a good thing to do is
have<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.079> turrets<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:48.220> where<00:03:48.370> they<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.850> be

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
have the turrets to where they can be

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.300 
have the turrets to where they can be
shot<00:03:49.510> by<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.780> other<00:03:50.049> turrets<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.859> you

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
shot by the other turrets so that you

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.220 
shot by the other turrets so that you
know<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:52.120> not<00:03:52.329> like<00:03:52.540> they're<00:03:52.780> hidden<00:03:52.989> in<00:03:53.200> one

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.890 
know it's not like they're hidden in one
corner<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:53.829> only<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.730> sniper<00:03:55.150> with<00:03:55.600> like
