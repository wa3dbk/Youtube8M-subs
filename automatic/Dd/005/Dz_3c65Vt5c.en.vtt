 hello guys I'm a football solo tricks 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.350
 online and today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.350
 next trick 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.200
 Look 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.160
 to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.160
 yes 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.930
 do not 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.910
 how 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.030
 good guys as you have been able to see is a 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.710
 trick the truth that pretty flashy and 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.720
 it is very common in the world of 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.970
 freestyle and the truth is not difficult 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.250
 it simply requires practical proof 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.809
 and dedication the technique to spin 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.570
 the ball is the next we put the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.129
 ball in front of the face and just 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.570
 we point the outside towards 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.239
 our face once we have the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.650
 outside we just shoot it 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.300
 when we first started doing this 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.040
 trick we will notice that it is a little 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.479
 difficult to keep the ball rolling in the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.830
 finger is then valid for 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.380
 beginners we will do the following 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.149
 when we throw the ball up not 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.920
 we make it jump worth that is more 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.160
 advanced we have to make the ball 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.420
 just roll on the fingertip it 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.310
 you dance is going to be a little bit 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.649
 unstable and you're going to go for any 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.899
 side because to me although it is done 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.149
 it's a bit difficult for me but the 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.670
 question is to stay at the center of 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.229
 ball down and you try not to be 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.850
 fall once we already know how 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.410
 make it spin well and how do we make 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.210
 say in the fingertip we're going to 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.090
 try to do this when it's spinning 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.860
 the ball we do like that and we put the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.580
 Finger when in motion is worth 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.580
 it would be something like that 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.700
 As you can see we went from the yolk to the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.230
 finger tip once we know how to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 do it with the tip of your finger the ball 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.430
 is going to stabilize the double 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.890
 yes 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.630
 a few guys in short is that is the 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.980
 game of dolls is that you turn the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.590
 buds and that I'm here on the tip of the 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.330
 finger is worth so it does not have no great 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.190
 mystery is simply practice and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.110
 constancy dedicate time and 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.260
 practice it a lot so I hope that you 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.260
 I liked it
