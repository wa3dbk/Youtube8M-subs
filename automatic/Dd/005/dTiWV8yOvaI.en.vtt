 Although there are some players who put out the best in qualifying other than Aso mountain 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.870

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.300
 Isn't it

 I Nde I think with 3 minutes 58 seconds Tevez at the time was mer 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.670
 Although I think that there is dissatisfaction in the case of morbidity, 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.600
 ar was a little ridiculed , so the value of the cat is very happy with the person 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.600

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.410
