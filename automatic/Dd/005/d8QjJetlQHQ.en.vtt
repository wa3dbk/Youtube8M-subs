00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.809 
you can use England's duraline then I
will<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.110> mix<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.739> apply<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.580> lips

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
will just mix it and apply to the lips

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.660 
will just mix it and apply to the lips
with<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.390> small<00:02:45.660> brush<00:02:46.430> slightly<00:02:47.430> going

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
with a small brush slightly going

00:02:47.670 --> 00:03:21.610 
with a small brush slightly going
outside<00:02:48.510> my<00:02:48.840> natural<00:02:49.349> lip<00:02:49.590> line

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.550 

now<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.220> can<00:03:22.519> see<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.480> both<00:03:23.720> sides<00:03:24.140> are

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
now you can see that the both sides are

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.270 
now you can see that the both sides are
not<00:03:24.890> very<00:03:25.220> symmetrical<00:03:26.080> so<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.349> is<00:03:27.560> why<00:03:28.250> I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
not very symmetrical so that is why I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.970 
not very symmetrical so that is why I
will<00:03:28.700> use<00:03:28.879> a<00:03:28.940> concealer<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.530> synthetic

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
will use a concealer and a synthetic

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.780 
will use a concealer and a synthetic
brush<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:32.319> make<00:03:33.319> sure<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.280> edges<00:03:34.610> are

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
brush to make sure that the edges are

00:03:34.790 --> 00:04:00.260 
brush to make sure that the edges are
even<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.690> lines<00:03:35.900> are<00:03:36.410> more<00:03:37.190> sharp

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.200 

and<00:04:00.360> one<00:04:01.200> final<00:04:01.650> touch<00:04:01.860> is<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.250> powder<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.790> set

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
and one final touch is a powder to set

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.230 
and one final touch is a powder to set
the<00:04:03.360> concealer<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.980> am<00:04:05.340> done<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.790> honestly
