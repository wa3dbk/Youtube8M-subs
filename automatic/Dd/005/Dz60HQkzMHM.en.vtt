00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 the july or anime coffee machine with 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.919
 Girl tells the story of the boy 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.230
 So it's pretty sensitive and his 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.630
 girlfriend yes so ne totally expired 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.599
 that gives you a basket and that's why 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 goes on a mountain hike and seeks 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.100
 by flowers so what and how it randomly 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.619
 so wants exactly on him 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.359
 spaceship of extraterrestrials an un 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.949
 center as his body I ask 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.410
 his body naturally restore to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.939
 say yes we are sorry but with one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.439
 difference he is now a girl that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.260
 likes quite a lot for one or the other 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.809
 crazy and strange sounds and believes 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 me it is still amanda 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.649
 many aspects nice take out for you 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.239
 Personally, I alone alone 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.070
 history and has so what should I do every 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.200
 I do my other day and that's exactly why 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.100
 For example, I think he is absolute 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.050
 innovative and unique the characters 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.760
 and omari and yes solar are mine 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.520
 opinion after all really well developed 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 so only as the reserved one 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.820
 shy students yes as close as 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.980
 those who are quite friendly 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.550
 But somehow it is not like that anyway 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.799
 all 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.350
 the medial corresponds and tomato the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.750
 children friends also the aliens then 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.090
 when living or being your best friend 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.369
 really nicely designed with 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.409
 This crazy plot may of course 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.210
 also a concentrated charge comedy not 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.729
 are missing in my eyes here really 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 Well put in chur sda slapstick 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 One becomes one with gags all the time 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.700
 entertained, however, comes between too 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.619
 one or two drama elements 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.049
 with in and I think they are all 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.840
 I also did a really good job personally 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.100
 as juri must already have to say how 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.920
 I have seen the was just 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.180
 absolutely thrilled purely musical needs 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.220
 I personally say 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.110
 update now not so impressed the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.910
 opening to myself I found had relative 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.190
 cool the animations are my eyes 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.200
 not the best but hey people 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.760
 of place from the year 2006 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 actual little love story 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.520
 girl with a between two 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.900
 running workout 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.479
 that's exciting to the last second 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.460
 stays and absolute resolution gets you 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.140
 then only in the over a respect and not 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.580
 at the end then the end of the series is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 pretty well kept that open 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.630
 still single europe publishes that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.690
 to round out the whole thing 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.520
 conclusion who cheers laser show series maker 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
 and coffee maker not seen yet 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.840
 this should definitely be done by itself 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.730
 because of the absolutely incredible 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.940
 exorbitantly wacky plot with 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.220
 pull up slapstick and drama elements 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.959
 is simply the reason par excellence 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.270
 have a look at me in my eyes 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.670
 I have been a long long long long time 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.680
 not such a crazy one anymore 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.989
 seen me and basically so much 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.880
 I would like to say innovation with one 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.860
 play and in the principle of statements that 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.600
 a lot of innovation in everything 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 So play a plot you still have 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.920
 not seen that guaranteed I have times 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.959
 Looked at the beginning, for example, probably 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.519
 the relatively negatively rated that can 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.739
 Personally, I do not understand 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.900
 i bÃ¼nder exactly on the other bar 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.480
 I have to say he was really good comedy 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.310
 and drama have been perfect at all places 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.799
 fit and easy 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.959
 feverish as grad still something like said 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.600
 that was for me as a georgia mature 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.830
 just an incredible good series 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.989
 The animations are not only on 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.420
 the newest stand but gets through it 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.459
 the music clearly turns out to be 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.709
 not really on the openings though 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.510
 really nice especially the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.790
 the first scene from the opening caution because 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.250
 then this occurs after this music 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.780
 was played was pretty nice, I 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.400
 personally found him very well, I had 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.280
 me if I'm one more tick 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.480
 desired drama but in itself it is in 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.340
 my eyes one of the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.200
 most varied series this 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.540
 there is such a thing and not only that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.980
 all steel and july fans he still 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.930
 did not see him at all 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.180
 falls to the is a in my eyes 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.900
 massive you like this genre and he has 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.000
 It deserves 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.560
 in my eyes even if we have a reason 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.599
 bit ceded 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.030
 Volt and maybe even says good times 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.620
 i am no yuriko kaba otherwise 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.610
 theoretically no problem some can 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.380
 give it to you 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.239
 Only because of the humor I can do that 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.280
 absolutely recommend and as always 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.020
 of course, all said that my 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.980
 opinion because they do not like then 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.500
 just make your own 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.500
