remember<00:03:50.950> I<00:03:51.190> think<00:03:51.250> these<00:03:51.610> were<00:03:52.180> more<00:03:52.390> on<00:03:52.540> the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
remember I think these were more on the

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.449 
remember I think these were more on the
pricey<00:03:52.870> side<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.230> believe<00:03:53.350> these<00:03:54.010> were<00:03:54.190> like

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
pricey side I believe these were like

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.170 
pricey side I believe these were like
maybe<00:03:54.820> around<00:03:55.920> $70<00:03:56.920> which<00:03:57.430> was<00:03:57.670> kind<00:03:58.060> of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
maybe around $70 which was kind of

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.930 
maybe around $70 which was kind of
ridiculous<00:03:58.620> but<00:03:59.620> they<00:03:59.799> are<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.310> cute<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:00.850> they

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
ridiculous but they are so cute and they

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.090 
ridiculous but they are so cute and they
look<00:04:01.180> amazingly<00:04:01.810> cute<00:04:02.110> on<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.739> thought<00:04:02.950> it

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
look amazingly cute on so I thought it

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.920 
look amazingly cute on so I thought it
was<00:04:03.220> worth<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.610> with<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.239> white<00:04:04.420> top<00:04:04.660> these

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
was worth it with the white top these

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.150 
was worth it with the white top these
would<00:04:05.080> just<00:04:05.110> look<00:04:05.410> adorable

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160

um I'm then also from ASOS I got two of
the<00:04:10.750> same<00:04:10.780> tops<00:04:11.590> they're<00:04:12.310> just<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:12.820> triangle

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
the same tops they're just like triangle

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.840 
the same tops they're just like triangle
tops<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:14.620> they<00:04:15.010> look<00:04:15.160> like<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:15.730> they

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
tops and they look like this so they

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.530 
tops and they look like this so they
have<00:04:16.030> structured<00:04:16.450> cups<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:18.090> there's<00:04:19.090> no<00:04:19.329> like

have structured cups and there's no like
extra<00:04:20.049> padding<00:04:20.440> it's<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.919> like<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.280> padded

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
extra padding it's just like a padded

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.370 
extra padding it's just like a padded
cup<00:04:22.060> um<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:23.289> you<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.099> slide

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
cup um and you can slide

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.530 
cup um and you can slide
sieze<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.520> if<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.790> want<00:04:26.970> them<00:04:27.120> further<00:04:27.330> apart

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
sieze so if you want them further apart

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.990 
sieze so if you want them further apart
or<00:04:27.900> closer<00:04:28.050> together<00:04:28.320> when<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.310> get<00:04:29.400> tops<00:04:29.790> like

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
or closer together when I get tops like

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.310 
or closer together when I get tops like
this<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.390> don't<00:04:30.450> really<00:04:30.750> like<00:04:30.930> when<00:04:31.080> they<00:04:31.170> go

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320
