Chapter 19
Father Beto To The Rescue

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.700
What a lovely pastry. Where is it from?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.440
Julian, my godson who is a priest, sent it to me. 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.780
He makes them himself.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.520
I didn’t know that you had a godson, Father Beto, 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.174
or that he was a priest.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.460
And not just any priest. Julián is a Soldier of Christ.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.260
A Soldier of Christ?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200
I’ve heard that a Soldier of Christ 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.900
was not allowed to visit his dying mother.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.800
I’ve heard that those with different opinions are locked up.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.210
That is just gossip.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.840
 If Julian were being mistreated he would not be baking pastries. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.251
Why don’t you try this?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.360
What is it?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.180
It looks like a message.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.293
Open it, Father Beto.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.100
“Please help me Father Beto!"

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.160
They want to send me to a mental institution. 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.260
My superiors say that I am crazy 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.880
because I protected my community from businessmen in the congregation who wanted to take away their land. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.040
Please get me out of here.

00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:06.448
Julian has gone mad!

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.840
Father Beto, what do you mean? 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.460
Julian is another victim of a congregation that has mistaken torment for spirituality.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.560
The only crazy people are the ones who want to lock him up, Father Beto.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.240
That is enough madness! 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.760
I will make a phone call to clarify this. 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.120
Soldiers of Christ, good afternoon.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.980
Good afternoon, this is Father Alberto Martinez.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.460
I would like to speak to my godson, the priest Julian Lopez, please.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.060
He is on a retreat.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.760
Listen, you have been telling me for three months that he is on a retreat. 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.740
A 29-year-old priest cannot spend his entire life on retreats. 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.060
Please call back in a month.  

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.200
Or rather, please do not call back. Assumpti apostolatus.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.100
He hung up on me. He didn’t want to tell me anything.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.460
Father Beto, you know that Julian isn’t mad. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.860
Something very serious is going on here…

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.840
Some institutional practices within the Catholic Church foster the violation of human rights

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.700
by protecting people who abuse their symbolic power 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.360
to force others into obedience, sacrifice, silence and submission. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.280
These practices are against the Christian project of respecting human freedom and dignity. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.260
We must go to the Attorney General’s Office 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.240
and report this deprivation of liberty.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.020
Absolutely not! 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.980
Dirty clothes must be washed at home.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.460
So what can we do? 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.580
The Catholic hierarchy protects these kind of congregations. 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.275
We must get Julian out of there.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.680
We could pretend to be doctors from the mental institution.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.740
I think it would be better to go the Attorney General’s office.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.020
Silence!

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.740
 You can wait outside with the engine running.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.547
Oh, my Lord!

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.600
What business do you have here?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.520
We are the nurses from the psychiatric center. 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.120
We have come for the patient Julian Lopez. 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.334
Oh, my God!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.940
Please come in.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.420
Let’s go, Sister Juana!

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:06.636
Drive faster!

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.900
Did they treat you very badly in there, Julian?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.380
Dreadfully, but I am not Julian. My name is Juan.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.134
What?

00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:16.454
What about Julian? 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.040
Richi, for goodness sake. Who did you bring out?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.300
The person that you told me to bring out, but it was very dark.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.400
I suggest that we go to the Attorney General. 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.140
That is the only way to get Julian out of that torment.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.900
I would like to accompany you, as I have many things to denounce. 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.320
They lock us up, monitor our letters, and call all dissidents mad.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.220
That is terrible!

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.440
When I tried to denounce it, nobody in the Church paid attention to me.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.160
Now we will make sure they pay attention to you, Juan.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.780
Oh, my God... what a relief this season has come to an end!

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.320
End of season 5

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.700
We'll be back in September
