00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello guys like you read from 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 title sold once more to snow and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.900
 in fact here is the small package and I have 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 bought the bio primer and here it is 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.850
 then I didn't want to log in this time 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460
 by hand it was my justification 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.740
 so in the sense that it is laura will have 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.800
 martone I leave you below her the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.390
 link to his channel in by now 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.680
 you know xkÃ¨ in every occasion I talk to you about 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 in short, she instigated me 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.090
 in fact linda also wanted me to do it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.550
 the order also for you and I know you have it 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.539
 also bought laura so in short there 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 we are instigated win immense but 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.809
 then we took the primer precisely 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.079
 as you know it has just come out is indeed is 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.379
 in discount on the site should cost 9 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.480
 euros and 90 instead of 12 and something and also 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.840
 shipments seem to me to be 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.540
 inferior in fact I paid them 2 euros 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 and 45 and if I am not mistaken they usually cost 45 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.400
 euro now I would not say one 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 stupid because I don't remember but I know 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.890
 which however costs a bit less too 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.340
 those and also the primer in fact 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.670
 Discount 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 I took this version that one 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 let's say green that is but you do it is indeed 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.180
 it is a matting face for skin 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.060
 oily is mixed and what they write here 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 and sorry if you can't read so much 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.420
 but I'm recording it's almost seven o'clock 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.479
 in the evening then the light had a little bit 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.720
 abandoned but I wanted to do it for you 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.100
 see why it is still obvious 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.560
 and so maybe 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.189
 guys would like to take it and have it 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.570
 in short, an opinion never hurts 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.280
 then back then 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.580
 I tell you a little what they wrote 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.100
 who have there is a natural face driver 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.190
 to be applied before makeup for a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.930
 velvety and long-lasting matte finish 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.940
 there are written ingredients and how 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.250
 however we know they obviously have a 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.280
 in fact green in a fragrance from 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.380
 perfume is unmatched and does not compare with 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.090
 the vegetarian vegan 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.120
 and then it is 40 ml and lasts 12 months 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.130
 from the opening, in short, it arrives in 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.989
 this tube 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.650
 the last thing I want to say about it 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.819
 shipments and that were really 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.950
 fast to order on Wednesday 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.610
 morning and Thursday morning was already in the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.390
 my hands and where I had it this time 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.010
 asked if they would send me maybe because 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
 we did the order in two 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.270
 so he had taken two primers and if 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.850
 maybe they sent me a 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.310
 a nominees eyeshadows to the excuses is instead 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.760
 no apple did n't send it they have 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.130
 sent only four samples between 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.860
 the other 22 so they definitely have 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.230
 read that we were two though is that there 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.690
 they only sent these but I think 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.370
 which is often depends on how much you spend 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.980
 for that last time i took the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.510
 palette and I had spent a little more and me 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.370
 they sent the lip pencil and not 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.980
 May instead spent this time 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.130
 around 22 euros and they don't have me 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.770
 therefore, no mandate sent 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.110
 this is a small note concerning the 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.210
 shipments regarding the trend 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.100
 obviously I did n't have a chance to try it 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.200
 very much indeed because it arrived 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.960
 Thursday I tried it right away 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.330
 afternoon is however I must say that already me 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.690
 like the first impressions we say 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.280
 because I put it around three o'clock 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.050
 afternoon I went around and at 7 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.620
 broken in short when I returned to 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.030
 home I still had the blush completely 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.130
 intact and what I usually do anyway 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.350
 it vanishes apart with some that measure 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.320
 there is no blush last longer than that 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.840
 to others, however, 4 hours still seems to me 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.990
 a good duration instead maybe usually 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.840
 it is hard 2 hours and then vanishes 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.170
 however true that the trick lasts a while 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.380
 more obviously I have to test it better 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.790
 as for the lucidity then 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.340
 the fact of dulling 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.010
 I don't know why I don't have the skin 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.200
 mixed yes but not that I kill myself 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.350
 so very much that is not it 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.110
 I know so much we will ask Linda why 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.590
 she knows instead that she polishes more often 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.300
 so surely you will be able to tell me 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.090
 however as a duration from the second makeup 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.030
 me is enough that is valid in fact I have it 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.540
 also tried this morning before going 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.460
 at work and this morning as 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.590
 when I go to work, I do 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.730
 just in a hurry and I only put it 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:03.340
 this is the blush and after that anyway 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.180
 working I sweated a little bit myself 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.920
 I am looked after two orette 3 elba e 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.620
 the blush was still there 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.390
 so it seemed to me this is one 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.340
 positive thing also because I didn't use it 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.660
 the same blush of yesterday just for 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.430
 see if he could only be 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.800
 blush on the other hand also however 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.470
 this morning lasted longer than usual in the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.260
 sense that I usually sudo also then 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.300
 after an hour I don't have anything anymore 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.600
 this morning after two hours the 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.580
 blush could still be seen and therefore in short 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.580
 these are my first impressions 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.370
 I can then show you how I didn't 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.590
 I knew well but it is colored therefore a 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.680
 colorful face primer I'll show you 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.050
 oh god less out of a quintal 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.810
 so this is the primer now 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.920
 put on the hand however easy from 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.690
 roll out just like a cream is there 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.670
 now I really didn't put so many 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.970
 however just like a first look 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.340
 it absorbs just a frettissima 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.330
 spread that point well to be also 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:15.690
 however it is not on the face anyway 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.490
 heavy as you see there after it becomes 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.960
 obviously for the color of the skin 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:25.350
 so it spreads quickly is veil 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.690
 light here I do not feel heavy and that is 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.390
 I also looked at how after putting it 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:37.110
 obviously the face is a little bit 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:39.870
 the more you say sorry for this 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.170
 that I am distracted look at this the cat 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.710
 hanging so I present it also in the 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.710
 my battery 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:07:06.060
 hello to whom vidiri atp say and excuse i 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.540
 mine I was also everywhere 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:12.420
 he looks more like a monkey than a cat 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.250
 however obviously it goes to standardize a 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.760
 even the complexion is little 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:20.250
 colorful and just this is what you 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.250
 I can say for now of this primer 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.220
 as a first impression it is absolutely 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.650
 true advice why 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.140
 I am finding myself well then obviously 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.840
 I have to try for more time and I'll do it 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.600
 surely know in the next videos is 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.760
 low so take a ride on the site of 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.850
 Snow check out are on offer me 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.650
 it also looks like compact foundation 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.540
 so if maybe you are interested in dates 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.000

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.950
 to have been useful and to have given you 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.360
 some more information and see you 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.360
