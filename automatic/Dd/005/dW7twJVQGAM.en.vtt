00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:10.090
 very good people today we are going to talk in 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.760
 row of mobile cameras you know 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.459
 that is very fashionable to make the pics 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.060
 frank the mobile and every time they do 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.800
 better pictures with him but like that 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.750
 we stop the quality of a camera and another 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 Well that's what you're going to try 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 clarify a little 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.640
 As you know, we have all generally 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.940
 evaluated the quality of a camera 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.260
 photos in general and of mobile by the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.090
 megapixels usually people 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.680
 how many megapixels does he have and 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.980
 he thinks he will have more quality 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.110
 for having more megapixels in the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.280
 megapixels by increasing the resolution of 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.809
 digital photo resolution which 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.380
 will occupy within the memory what 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.170
 will occupy 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.510
 the pixels that will occupy in the photo 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.800
 of the dots that will occupy the photo 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.140
 but that has a lot of resolution does not 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.050
 means that the best quality is 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.300
 photo because it has a bottleneck 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.420
 very important there that is the lens the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.870
 optics of the camera as you know speaking 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 of mobile optics every time 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.930
 better and such but usually not 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.479
 can be compared to an SLR camera 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.500
 even a modern compact and well 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.140
 powerful that's precisely the optics 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.690
 obviously, it is not observed which camera does not 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.750
 a small camera of this size can not 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.360
 take pictures like a camera like this with the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.860
 goal so it's worth that 's because it comes in 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.980
 much more lights to the cameras 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.900
 the lens and you can take some pictures of 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.200
 higher quality every day are better 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.040
 of mobile because 2003 authorizes and everything 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.250
 but still it lacks enough not 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.150
 precisely the latest tests and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.670
 comparative comparisons 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.350
 They said that the Nokia Lumia with the per 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.920
 view 'this this technology that is 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.920
 technology 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 but he did best photos and 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.590
 even comparing it with the iphone 5 with 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.600
 the galaxy s3 will exceed the use of many 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.880
 mobile phones that have a 12 camera 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.540
 megapixels even him 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.890
 as far as skin that was 41 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.510
 megapixels the asshole that good gave 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.440
 pretty fame to the camera I started to 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.610
 carry the symbian mobile 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.020
 but that this did not support that although 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.810
 I moved to make more milk photos 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.010
 they did not want to sell the bike a bit with 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.560
 which I have megapixels when 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.080
 really what what today is the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 camera technology that was a 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.200
 very good lens 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.730
 simply normally Nokia has always 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.080
 mounted optical carl zeiss the iphone by 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.340
 example the sony ericsson mounts that 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.850
 he has also made very good pictures of 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.850
 the mobiles 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.610
 a little this comparative because it is clear 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.030
 who does not want is doing enough 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.520
 well in this aspect but there are details 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.080
 very curious for example how is 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.410
 growing both photography from the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.600
 mobile 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.580
 when for some time there has been 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.870
 flickr social network it seems to me that the 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.720
 yahoo 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.280
 what he was doing was becoming fashionable 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.680
 to upload the photos with the iphone or 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.879
 any terminal more and more 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.489
 they went up from the mobile 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.409
 then instagram was born and now it's done 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.299
 upside down now people take a picture 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.620
 with the SLR he has a great time 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.739
 women install as I have done with 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.209
 the mobile is quite curious this the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.849
 truth is something to keep in mind 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.340
 Well I hope I have clarified a bit 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.319
 this from the photo cameras look at the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.819
 resolution but also look at optics 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.600
 see that they have a good quality 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.250
 good sensor 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.590
 and do not get carried away by a shtick 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.830
 because you already know that the numbers never 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.000
 they fit for nothing this is all for now 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.000
 and greetings to all
