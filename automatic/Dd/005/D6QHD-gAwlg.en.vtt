barrel some people like it I'm not a
huge<00:00:25.520> fan<00:00:25.550> I<00:00:26.060> think<00:00:26.119> it's<00:00:26.449> just<00:00:26.930> way<00:00:27.140> too<00:00:27.170> short

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
huge fan I think it's just way too short

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.070 
huge fan I think it's just way too short
profile<00:00:28.820> with<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:29.119> gun<00:00:29.300> looks<00:00:29.539> like<00:00:29.690> it<00:00:29.840> needs

profile with the gun looks like it needs

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.020 
profile with the gun looks like it needs
a<00:00:30.440> longer<00:00:31.400> barrel<00:00:31.730> or<00:00:33.460> something<00:00:34.460> altogether

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
a longer barrel or something altogether

different so what I've done is I've
built<00:00:40.039> a<00:00:40.159> couple<00:00:41.589> attachments

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
built a couple attachments

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.459 
built a couple attachments
girls<00:00:43.399> this<00:00:43.729> is<00:00:43.789> parts<00:00:44.780> from<00:00:44.899> a<00:00:45.019> stampede

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
girls this is parts from a stampede

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.139 
girls this is parts from a stampede
stampede<00:00:46.809> designed<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.769> barrel<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.789> then

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
stampede designed the barrel and then

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.200 
stampede designed the barrel and then
this<00:00:50.329> is<00:00:50.569> the<00:00:51.159> interlocking<00:00:52.989> barrel<00:00:53.989> for

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
this is the interlocking barrel for

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.539 
this is the interlocking barrel for
barrel<00:00:56.210> extensions<00:00:56.780> like<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:58.280> Recon<00:00:59.139> or<00:01:00.549> long

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
barrel extensions like the Recon or long

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.930 
barrel extensions like the Recon or long
strike<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.280> from<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.820> think<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.380> recon<00:01:06.940> it's

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
strike this is from I think a recon it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.820 
strike this is from I think a recon it's
used<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.299> couple<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.720> recon<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.290> specter

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
used in a couple to recon in the specter

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.090 
used in a couple to recon in the specter
and<00:01:09.979> something<00:01:10.310> else<00:01:10.900> so<00:01:11.900> anyway<00:01:12.290> what<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.770> did

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
and something else so anyway what I did

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.250 
and something else so anyway what I did
was<00:01:13.430> I<00:01:14.740> made<00:01:15.740> these<00:01:16.160> so<00:01:16.550> that<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:19.210> easily

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
was I made these so that you can easily

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.040 
was I made these so that you can easily
replace<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.620> old<00:01:21.770> one<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:23.720> got<00:01:23.900> these

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
replace the old one and it's got these

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.020 
replace the old one and it's got these
two<00:01:24.470> blocks<00:01:25.630> what<00:01:26.630> I<00:01:26.660> did<00:01:26.900> was<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:28.000> made<00:01:29.000> a

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
two blocks what I did was I made a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
two blocks what I did was I made a
couple<00:01:29.450> extra<00:01:30.170> pieces<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.030> then<00:01:32.030> these<00:01:32.210> fit

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
couple extra pieces and then these fit

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.960 
couple extra pieces and then these fit
around<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.680> barrel<00:01:34.370> these<00:01:34.520> are<00:01:34.670> glued<00:01:34.850> in

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
around the barrel these are glued in

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.470 
around the barrel these are glued in
place<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.770> when<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.700> put<00:01:38.060> something<00:01:38.450> like

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
place so that when I put something like

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.600 
place so that when I put something like
this<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:39.110> it'll<00:01:39.620> actually<00:01:39.800> stay<00:01:40.250> where<00:01:40.460> it's

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
this in it'll actually stay where it's

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.430 
this in it'll actually stay where it's
supposed<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.000> be<00:01:41.180> instead<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.630> flopping

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
supposed to be instead of flopping

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.219 
supposed to be instead of flopping
around<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.190> big<00:01:43.400> empty<00:01:43.580> space

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
around in that big empty space

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.719 
around in that big empty space
so<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.520> fits<00:01:46.789> right<00:01:46.969> into<00:01:47.180> there<00:01:51.729> that's

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
so that fits right into there that's

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.919 
so that fits right into there that's
right<00:01:53.030> over<00:01:53.299> top<00:01:53.509> of<00:01:53.689> it<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:55.009> that<00:01:55.070> holds<00:01:55.490> it

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
right over top of it and that holds it

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.169 
right over top of it and that holds it
really<00:01:56.929> snug<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.619> mean<00:01:57.890> that's<00:01:58.130> not<00:01:58.280> seriously

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
really snug I mean that's not seriously

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.289 
really snug I mean that's not seriously
not<00:01:59.390> going<00:01:59.689> anywhere<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.909> then<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.179> other

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
not going anywhere and then the other

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.999 
not going anywhere and then the other
nice<00:02:02.509> thing<00:02:02.539> about<00:02:02.780> that<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.860> got<00:02:03.979> a

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
nice thing about that is it's got a

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.190 
nice thing about that is it's got a
one-inch<00:02:04.429> acrylic<00:02:04.880> tube<00:02:05.240> through<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.140> you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
one-inch acrylic tube through it so you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.370 
one-inch acrylic tube through it so you
can<00:02:06.679> still<00:02:07.009> fire<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.179> still<00:02:08.569> works<00:02:09.170> as

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
can still fire it and it still works as

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.940 
can still fire it and it still works as
a<00:02:09.410> maverick

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.270 

so<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.370> can<00:02:16.700> still<00:02:16.940> use<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.950> kind<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
so I can still use it it's it's kind of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.070 
so I can still use it it's it's kind of
a<00:02:19.370> cosmetic<00:02:19.760> mod<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.360> it's<00:02:20.510> also<00:02:20.629> kind<00:02:20.989> of

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
a cosmetic mod but it's also kind of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.509 
a cosmetic mod but it's also kind of
functional<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.030> look<00:02:23.299> at<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:25.340> two

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
functional if you look at the two

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.630 
functional if you look at the two
different<00:02:25.549> extensions<00:02:26.360> here<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:28.220> can<00:02:28.400> see

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
different extensions here you can see

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.420 
different extensions here you can see
that<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.870> Recon<00:02:30.349> one<00:02:30.680> has<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> smaller

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
that the Recon one has a smaller

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.770 
that the Recon one has a smaller
diameter<00:02:32.049> barrel<00:02:33.049> extension<00:02:33.760> then<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.360> long

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
diameter barrel extension then the long

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.750 
diameter barrel extension then the long
strike<00:02:36.170> long<00:02:36.470> strike<00:02:36.709> has<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.129> wider<00:02:37.430> one

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
strike long strike has this wider one

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.080 
strike long strike has this wider one
here<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.989> this<00:02:39.079> one's<00:02:39.319> for<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.590> Recon<00:02:40.090> so

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
here and this one's for the Recon so

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.690 
here and this one's for the Recon so
this<00:02:41.870> piece<00:02:42.260> will<00:02:42.560> actually<00:02:42.980> fit<00:02:43.190> onto<00:02:43.370> here

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
this piece will actually fit onto here

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.960 
this piece will actually fit onto here
and<00:02:43.909> lock<00:02:44.239> into<00:02:44.480> place<00:02:44.659> just<00:02:47.290> like<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.970> it's

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
and lock into place just like that it's

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.400 
and lock into place just like that it's
got<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> little<00:02:50.299> work<00:02:50.540> still<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.930> got<00:02:51.079> to<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.260> it

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
got a little work still I got to do it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.470 
got a little work still I got to do it
so<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.739> uh<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:52.400> locks<00:02:52.700> right<00:02:52.879> now<00:02:53.209> it's<00:02:53.420> a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
so it uh it locks right now it's a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.849 
so it uh it locks right now it's a
little<00:02:53.840> bit<00:02:53.959> loose<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:59.859> that's

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
little bit loose but that's that's

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.229 
little bit loose but that's that's
doable<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.420> pretty<00:03:03.170> much<00:03:03.379> lines<00:03:03.739> up

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
doable and it it's pretty much lines up

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.990 
doable and it it's pretty much lines up
but<00:03:05.239> I'm<00:03:05.359> not<00:03:05.510> sure<00:03:05.870> functionality-wise

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
but I'm not sure functionality-wise

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.130 
but I'm not sure functionality-wise
still<00:03:08.000> have<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.239> test<00:03:08.420> out<00:03:08.629> these<00:03:08.810> see<00:03:09.109> how

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
still have to test out these see how

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.990 
still have to test out these see how
many<00:03:09.349> shots<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.769> can<00:03:09.890> actually<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> you

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
many shots you can actually get to you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.309 
many shots you can actually get to you
know<00:03:11.090> fly<00:03:11.420> through<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:11.720> barrel<00:03:12.200> without

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
know fly through that barrel without

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.589 
know fly through that barrel without
jamming<00:03:13.040> them<00:03:13.180> because<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.420> pretty

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
jamming them because it's a pretty

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.979 
jamming them because it's a pretty
pretty<00:03:15.170> tight<00:03:15.409> opening<00:03:16.180> but<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.450> cosmetic

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
pretty tight opening but for a cosmetic

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.710 
pretty tight opening but for a cosmetic
mod<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.500> think<00:03:18.829> that's<00:03:18.950> pretty<00:03:19.099> fun<00:03:19.419> be<00:03:20.419> able<00:03:20.630> to

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
mod I think that's pretty fun be able to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.759 
mod I think that's pretty fun be able to
do<00:03:20.840> stuff<00:03:21.079> like<00:03:21.109> this<00:03:22.180> however<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:24.530> long

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
do stuff like this however the long

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.559 
do stuff like this however the long
strike<00:03:25.160> barrel<00:03:25.489> since<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.849> has<00:03:26.000> this<00:03:26.180> wider

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
strike barrel since it has this wider

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.750 
strike barrel since it has this wider
diameter<00:03:26.930> it's<00:03:27.349> actually<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.769> same<00:03:27.950> size<00:03:27.980> as

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
diameter it's actually the same size as

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.909 
diameter it's actually the same size as
the<00:03:29.030> inner<00:03:29.180> diameter<00:03:29.419> this<00:03:29.900> these<00:03:30.260> don't<00:03:30.620> fit

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
the inner diameter this these don't fit

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.080 
the inner diameter this these don't fit
on<00:03:31.359> but<00:03:32.359> what<00:03:32.569> you<00:03:32.599> could<00:03:33.019> do<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.940> take<00:03:34.940> this

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
on but what you could do is take this

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.599 
on but what you could do is take this
apart<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.840> cut<00:03:36.530> maybe<00:03:36.799> you<00:03:37.160> know<00:03:37.250> like<00:03:37.459> an

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
apart and cut maybe you know like an

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.839 
apart and cut maybe you know like an
inch

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
inch

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.250 
inch
cut<00:03:39.659> an<00:03:39.750> inch<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.049> this<00:03:40.170> inner<00:03:40.890> barrel<00:03:41.489> out<00:03:42.260> so

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
cut an inch of this inner barrel out so

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.830 
cut an inch of this inner barrel out so
that<00:03:43.439> it<00:03:43.620> fits<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.640> would<00:03:45.000> slide<00:03:45.329> right<00:03:45.359> into

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
that it fits and would slide right into

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.069 
that it fits and would slide right into
place

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
place

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.979 
place
and<00:03:46.920> you'd<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.700> know<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:48.060> ridiculously

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
and you'd have you know a ridiculously

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.559 
and you'd have you know a ridiculously
long<00:03:49.230> barrel<00:03:49.709> on<00:03:51.530> automatic<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:54.090> that's<00:03:54.299> this

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
long barrel on automatic so that's this

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.839 
long barrel on automatic so that's this
barrel<00:03:55.049> extension<00:03:55.519> personally<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.609> think<00:03:56.670> it

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
barrel extension personally I think it

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.309 
barrel extension personally I think it
also<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.480> know<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:57.780> looks<00:03:57.959> good<00:03:58.170> just

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
also just you know it looks good just

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.190 
also just you know it looks good just
like<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:58.739> it's<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.400> nice<00:03:59.549> little<00:04:00.200> little

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
like this it's a nice little little

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.500 
like this it's a nice little little
addition

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
addition

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.470 
addition

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
so for cosmetic mods or for things where

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.920 
so for cosmetic mods or for things where
you<00:04:06.900> know<00:04:07.019> if<00:04:07.079> you're<00:04:07.230> doing<00:04:07.319> office<00:04:07.829> games

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
you know if you're doing office games

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.199 
you know if you're doing office games
just<00:04:09.930> nerf<00:04:10.560> games<00:04:10.829> in<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.519> office<00:04:11.879> or

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
just nerf games in the in the office or

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.440 
just nerf games in the in the office or
you<00:04:12.689> know<00:04:12.810> around<00:04:13.079> here<00:04:13.230> office<00:04:13.620> building<00:04:14.450> you

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
you know around here office building you

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.610 
you know around here office building you
don't<00:04:15.629> really<00:04:15.750> need<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:17.060> giant<00:04:18.060> barrel

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
don't really need a giant barrel

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.569 
don't really need a giant barrel
something<00:04:19.620> like<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:19.889> is<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.099> little<00:04:20.370> fun

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
something like this is a little fun

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.779 
something like this is a little fun
addition<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:23.039> then<00:04:23.160> same<00:04:23.430> with<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.729> one

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
addition and then same with this one

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.330 
addition and then same with this one
this<00:04:24.599> one<00:04:24.870> has<00:04:25.259> the<00:04:25.650> one-inch<00:04:25.979> diameter

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
this one has the one-inch diameter

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.170 
this one has the one-inch diameter
barrel<00:04:26.910> on<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.930> inside<00:04:28.349> and<00:04:28.820> then<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:29.970> just

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
barrel on the inside and then it just

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.550 
barrel on the inside and then it just
locks<00:04:30.419> into<00:04:30.660> place<00:04:30.840> here<00:04:35.930> that<00:04:36.930> just<00:04:37.080> locks<00:04:37.349> in

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
locks into place here that just locks in

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.040 
locks into place here that just locks in
like<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:41.580> then<00:04:41.880> this<00:04:42.000> piece<00:04:42.240> goes<00:04:42.570> right

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
like that and then this piece goes right

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.350 
like that and then this piece goes right
over<00:04:43.289> top<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.560> it

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
over top of it

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.180 
over top of it
check<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.570> out<00:04:45.630> no<00:04:46.229> extra<00:04:46.650> gluing<00:04:48.770> no<00:04:49.770> extra

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
check that out no extra gluing no extra

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:59.480 
check that out no extra gluing no extra
holes<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.669> drill<00:04:51.889> pretty<00:04:52.889> solid<00:04:57.860> so<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.280> also

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
holes to drill pretty solid so this also

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.350 
holes to drill pretty solid so this also
gives<00:04:59.820> you<00:04:59.909> a<00:04:59.940> bigger<00:05:00.180> beefier<00:05:01.139> gone<00:05:02.130> but<00:05:03.090> then

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
gives you a bigger beefier gone but then

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.510 
gives you a bigger beefier gone but then
since<00:05:04.110> this<00:05:04.199> one<00:05:04.380> also<00:05:04.500> has<00:05:04.710> another<00:05:04.919> tactical

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
since this one also has another tactical

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.399 
since this one also has another tactical
rail<00:05:05.699> you<00:05:06.000> could<00:05:06.330> put<00:05:06.659> a<00:05:06.900> scope<00:05:07.169> or<00:05:07.500> lights<00:05:07.979> or

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.750 

have<00:05:13.409> these<00:05:13.590> adapters<00:05:14.159> these<00:05:14.430> little

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
have these adapters these little

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.000 
have these adapters these little
Picatinny<00:05:15.479> rail<00:05:15.570> adapter<00:05:15.930> so<00:05:16.530> this<00:05:16.830> will

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
Picatinny rail adapter so this will

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.430 
Picatinny rail adapter so this will
actually<00:05:17.370> fit<00:05:17.550> on<00:05:17.669> here<00:05:17.849> too<00:05:18.199> might<00:05:19.199> have<00:05:19.349> to

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
actually fit on here too might have to

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.440 
actually fit on here too might have to
trim<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.710> down

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
trim it down

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.850 
trim it down
yeah<00:05:22.510> probably<00:05:22.900> have<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.050> trim<00:05:23.260> it<00:05:23.380> down<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:23.560> bit

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
yeah probably have to trim it down a bit

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.820 
yeah probably have to trim it down a bit
but<00:05:24.340> anyway<00:05:24.670> so<00:05:24.730> this<00:05:25.000> would<00:05:25.210> slide<00:05:25.540> on<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:26.770> if

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
but anyway so this would slide on so if

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.440 
but anyway so this would slide on so if
I<00:05:26.920> cut<00:05:27.160> it<00:05:27.280> you<00:05:27.370> could<00:05:27.520> you<00:05:27.880> know<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.030> get<00:05:28.330> it

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
I cut it you could you know you get it

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.550 
I cut it you could you know you get it
to<00:05:28.540> slide<00:05:28.750> on<00:05:28.900> because<00:05:29.140> then<00:05:29.260> you'd<00:05:29.410> have<00:05:29.500> a

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
to slide on because then you'd have a

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.630 
to slide on because then you'd have a
Picatinny<00:05:30.520> rail<00:05:30.580> on<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.570> underside<00:05:31.960> here<00:05:32.640> but

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
Picatinny rail on the underside here but

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.000 
Picatinny rail on the underside here but
then<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:33.940> could<00:05:34.090> also<00:05:34.240> do<00:05:34.660> you<00:05:35.230> know<00:05:35.320> for<00:05:35.980> a

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
then you could also do you know for a

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.470 
then you could also do you know for a
grip<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.400> have<00:05:36.520> some<00:05:36.670> pictures<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.180> one<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.450> I
