00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.840
 on good days certainly 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.590
 I still have some for you 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.110
 For us the personalization of the home screen owner Sheikh was many 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.139
 interest 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.820
 Since one smells, he also has Chris Brown that one is the point 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.829
 Paloma itself can never be 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.390
 So I can already 3 0 TuS Raubling own links 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.539
 it is necessary 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.289
 has his own personalized of the Shah's for him 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.720
 now know exactly what does not secure and that Porsche is not on 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.960
 I have already made some short since her husband 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.250
 the first half was percent unchanged let us now I have to 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.450
 I really had a good mind if he did 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.519
 on the second page I have not been energized 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.709
 the unusual thing about it is that you can turn it off like that 

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.030
 to save energy 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.510
 the task manager 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 Michelstadt he inspired my active applications 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.480
 accordingly 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.270
 and the four has 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.020
 It probably does not mean that he will ever introduce me 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.159
 everything with you have to make each other a reporter 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.210
 depending on how naturally ends again 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.590
 Japan is the otherwise personalize so would have several options first 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.590
 first that they could generally be the opposite of the stones 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.100
 Therefore, the affected could not the other 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.160
 for announcing reports edit mode 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.380
 This has something with some you want 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.920
 to make a sworn one 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.080
 the last meters 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.240
 or press again 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.030
 primarily to work new varieties 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.180
 Tasci and now 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.100
 when go through 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.210
 and so on and so on and Westerholt Eclipse on the calendar 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.450
 Is July 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.990
 youngest is religious 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.510
 to find the Magic Numbers girl 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.870
 Unique user order 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.870
 and so further squares convicted 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.950
 the cows on it 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.220
 Rheumatism allows you to do several things at the same time a man 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.100
 Especially EPS is for people who at least want to have NLA 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.729
 in a 800 points 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.420
 in between players insert no 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.230
 because then too 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.510
 Shepherds located to applications limits direct dialing or initially 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.740
 Hurricane several times 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 or you just shoot the crisis again and again 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.739
 otherwise there's also the one in the Bamberger 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.129
 Tickets are tired smile show gallery 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.129
 I pretend and ear the corpses of the gondola 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.949
 the latter plays only Galaxies Group Samsung the next 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.699
 the person is not unanimous that's way because 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.939
 Live with and Miller consume more Ankum and you always want that 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.439
 save as much as possible 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.700
 not everyone who is in large units but as I said 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:37.539
 would like to 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.669
 there are also 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:44.209
 a better compute Kleist home-screen doing this will certainly be very solid sense of 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.519
 Demo if it somehow faster 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.629
 there is also a very cool fisherman but never said who 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.629
 discontinued so lock he avoid 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.659
 you are welcome too 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.659
 but of course continue to work the option 5 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.360
 then the 9 we could push as much as you can 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.360
 these are rarely to be found 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.769
 You can also keep it under change 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.029
 Here you can give the search in the soup 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.819
 and their descendants push 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.500
 can add a bit more 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.289
 In total, seven people are impossible 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.459
 she has added or sold back and legs 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.149
 the image section media breaks Skalski the show 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.279
 Joe Biden 13 and sparkling wine 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.619
 but I want to Brian so that's why I logically leave it 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:39.039
 yes that's not the possibilities of Hospice Minden will be the termination 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.129
 if you want that too this first page could be on some points too 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.399
 change 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.509
 you can all work are put you can never me until 09 Andechs 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.509
 new technique the males in the fall 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.939
 if, for example, I pay attention to the previous speaker 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.719
 the remaining 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:56.909
 Kerner me on it 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.509
 and not offered in all cases 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.389
 find the winter training year 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.659
 It shows honestly that smoking will hit can exactly classify it 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.459
 Exactly not fit free had to have interest photograph Zottmann free 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.449
 Do you still have one on it? 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.620
 yes Ali Sethi could really do a lot of the game 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.430
 It looks exactly the same as it conveys and also in terms of it 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.430
 Confession in which we will be a little bit more 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.700
 yes I think the micro sings possibilities of a big screen 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.949
 I hope I could answer a few questions maybe then 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.020
 took over others know how he can play seven 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.629
 yet found it straight while pulling up 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.719
 shopwiki Comments and I like to look through and 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:42.259
 they have been spared 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.699
 after I become a reporter 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:45.550
 that tore a big hole
