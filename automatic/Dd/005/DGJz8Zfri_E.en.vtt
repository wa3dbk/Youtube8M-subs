00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.059
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.700
 I bring you a top of three games 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.279
 which are one of the best they could 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.130
 find the app ready one are already 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.930
 known from companies known as 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.330
 I entered the end already just between 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.690
 at 34 for those who have 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.100
 followed from deliver end 1 2 and 3 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.840
 door against one that is called jean 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.550
 jacques that was also great and 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.280
 one that is called hero that is a little more 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.199
 visual but they are three of the best 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.520
 games that could find play store 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:45.280
 let's start with the turn 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.540
 with show that you upload new 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.090
 with the area 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.070
 now I'm going to stop by the regular this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 game is played with the screen stopped 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.110
 but I like to play with the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.610
 screen cut because like I was 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.100
 makes things a little easier 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.660
 that move this part as news 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.560
 welcome to turn and the whole thing 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.850
 probable we're going to have to turn the this 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.800
 video you can also use the bar is the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.700
 that the Yoris had in relation to the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.619
 colors 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.479
 let's relate the colors with the 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.240
 little balls that come out of the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.460
 corners for example 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.550
 a red one has to be that along with 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:31.360
 the red or blue with blue blue red 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.150
 red red there is some little ball that they give us 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.850
 powers like they give us a shield or 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.920
 something so that if we get to pass one 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.159
 of another color or something like that does not happen to us 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.289
 nothing 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.450
 as you can see as you increase 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.450
 the level goes but more difficult or easier 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.670
 my record was 20,000 out 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.320
 I have not played much on my phone 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.450
 I like it more there because I occupy it more but 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 hence you wanted to install it from 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.930
 tablet because it feels like a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.200
 little better the gameplay of the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200
 games 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.660
 we have 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.660
 I do not 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.650
 good friends let's start with the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 next game so you do not get too 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.550
 long the game in the video we're going to 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.550
 think with jr jac 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.120
 This is one of the games that has most 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.940
 liked because that hayek is not typical 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.370
 game that you're running with and 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.590
 jumping like guy galÃ¡n acosta no 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.540
 This is a little bit different because 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.540
 different worlds come out we can choose 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.250
 characters here in the store we can 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.920
 choose several that are there buying 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.430
 with the coins that we are winning 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.430
 the poses 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.799
 the voices are going to give a little bit of a 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.799
 type gameplay so they can see how it is 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.850
 in this part we have several buttons 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.040
 some to make some balls for 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.860
 jump and ones to cut time or 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.990
 I walked slowly 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.770
 As you can see, there are several other 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.960
 Lets put 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.750
 we get several obstacles as they can 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.620
 see now we change 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.620
 of the world 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.430
 but bring all 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.390
 the hardest thing about this 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.560
 and we'll get 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.620
 me 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.110
 already tell me a message and how can you see 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.360
 we already change the world is a bit 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.970
 different from normal but it is very addictive 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.870
 I recommend it 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.030
 go 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.349
 hello let's start with the next 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.349
 trial is 34 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.830
 equal without connection another power of the two 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.380
 modes can play with internet connection 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.060
 with wifi or 3g but recommended the 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.060
 wifi so you spend all the data 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.260
 in fact the quality of this game already 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.940
 It improved much more to how the 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.940
 first and someone else came to play 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.830
 today 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.129
 I did not want him to fall 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.230
 well, we jump 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.620
 we have reached a goal 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.630
 good friends how did I tell you this has been 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.370
 all for today's video 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.050

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.600
