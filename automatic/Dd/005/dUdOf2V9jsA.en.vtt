00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.450 

give<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.330> more<00:01:08.509> space<00:01:08.930> if<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.680> can<00:01:09.890> find<00:01:10.130> some

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
more space but if we can't handle this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.010 
more space but if we can't handle this
small<00:01:15.290> container<00:01:15.790> I'm<00:01:16.790> hoping<00:01:17.330> that'll<00:01:17.659> push

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
small container I'm hoping that'll push

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.100

out<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.530> I'll<00:01:18.860> get<00:01:19.100> more<00:01:19.280> leaves<00:01:19.580> which<00:01:20.110> I'm

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110
