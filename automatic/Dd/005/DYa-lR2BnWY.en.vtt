00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 how about you guys, I'm your youtuber 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
 favorite on the drive and this time 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.960
 took over from the news of the world 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.509
 geek let's start the restart of the saga 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.880
 arachnida by sony hands is having 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.250
 serious complications and thanks to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.619
 mass filtering the emails sony 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 has sent to other companies and in a way 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.000
 internal to talk about the future 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.150
 cinematographic of the trepamuros we have 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.519
 come data that can be very 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.489
 controversial do not forget this not 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.860
 is confirmed to begin with we will talk 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 of the possibility that speedy appears 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.170
 in the third part of captain america 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.299
 civil war or civil war 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.640
 amy pascal jefa de sony pictures 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.820
 entertainment talked with more take 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.170
 producer of spiderman movies 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.510
 saying that he loves the idea of 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 introduce peter parker to captain 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 america but they will not give you what 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.240
 they want you to offer 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.400
 another issue that Pascal mentions is if 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.979
 spider-man could work in the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.960
 marvel studios plans saying that 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.390
 they would have to solve the problems 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 with marvel to accept restart the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.610
 character in the third part of the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.310
 captain america what power they would have 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.009
 in the franchise of the character if 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.470
 they plan to use other characters or if they 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.050
 can use characters that marvel do not use 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.630
 if they can give continuity to the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.850
 history after this deal if in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 reality will be given the rights or just 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.520
 they are renting it and so on 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.890
 of marvel if I could produce the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.440
 new speed films and their intentions 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.200
 would happen to focus on him spider-man 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.910
 superhero and put aside the romances 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 to contrast with what has already been 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.259
 made in the cinema since in the five 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.409
 movies the romance has been the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.570
 absolute protagonist and obviously not 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.940
 would recount the origins by 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.220
 consider that it has already been done so 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.459
 would leave from a point where Peter 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.930
 parker is already spider-man another of the 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.909
 revelations 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.489
 that is a very very very news 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.530
 worrying for many is that in those 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.530
 mail is talking about that andrew garfield 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.870
 I would have been fired and that a new 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.650
 movie of the trepamuros could come in 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.109
 the 2017 and that Aunt May's spin-off is 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 really proposed as well as the spin-off 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.730
 with female characters 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.469
 the latter sounds more logical but the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.109
 Spin-off from Aunt Mail 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.840
 besides the possible dismissal of andrew it 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.569
 now add two possibilities a 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.280
 new reboot and ryan gosling for the 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.950
 adaptation they are preparing from the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.049
 six incidents in terms of gosling has 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.900
 said that he is not very aware of these 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.500
 movies may just be indications of 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.599
 an approach a reboot more and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.030
 many times something had been mentioned 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.730
 about this and it is on this occasion 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.489
 Jeff Robinov head of the studio 8 who 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.319
 sent the mail to amy pascal where this one 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.450
 tells him that I can no longer find the 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.000
 origin of the hero that they should look for 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.909
 new approaches speaks a little bit of the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.260
 last hunt of craig mythical history 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.120
 from spider-man 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.280
 the story is not so much talked about 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.159
 peter parker powers but what 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.099
 it really makes you a hero is 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.579
 tell your feelings your relationships and 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.379
 how his disappearance affects his environment 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.780
 he also states that it would be good to treat 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.329
 with an adult peter as it happens in 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.640
 the comics that has evolved from 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.019
 a teenager with problems 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.720
 teenagers to an adult with problems 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.470
 adults something not seen at the moment 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.690
 but that's not all there is another news that 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.299
 tells us about the transfer of speedy to 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.840
 marvel or at least creatively the year 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.359
 that is starting in 2015 there would be a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.819
 meeting between kevin page and amy pascal 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.849
 to discuss the future of the arachnid 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.819
 hoping that there is good news fruit 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.459
 of this in the month of February it is said that 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.220
 Speedy's debut would be in a scene 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.859
 the credits although it is not specified in 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.810
 what movie would then come a new 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.389
 trilogy of the trepamuros at the hands of 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.360
 marvel and directed by the brothers russo 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.889
 after avengers infinity ward being 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.560
 that they too 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.870
 in the function of screenwriters a 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.240
 condition that there is for this to take 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.210
 out is that kevin face does not want to 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.759
 producer avi arad involved of no 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.509
 mode and apparently has the support of 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:48.270
 marvel regarding this decision and if 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.039
 this will not happen are and would continue 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.529
 with his plans of the movie of the 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.409
 six sinister and subsequently the 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.349
 amazing spider-man 3 but without marc webb 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.180
 since this one would also be fired and 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.610
 it would be the work of phil lord and chris 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.849
 Miller film directors lego 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.939
 who would direct this delivery and not 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.819
 an animated version as it was rumored is 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:14.129
 a lot of information to process but 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.680
 we must be prepared for anything 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.469
 because this may not be far away 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.319
 of the reality in order what they think of everything 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.719
 this guys are already clearer what 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.639
 what's going on with spider-man want 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.460
 that the avengers join or that they 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.199
 remain in your series as lonely if not 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.930
 it's Andrew Garfield who stays like 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.800
 spyv and who would be the appropriate actor 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.190
 for the role 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.550
 let me know in the comments up 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.550
 the next
