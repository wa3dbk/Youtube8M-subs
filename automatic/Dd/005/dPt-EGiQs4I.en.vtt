00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.540
 For the tenth time will take place this year 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.850
 the top event the auction in mules 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.620
 instead of and for a few years it is like that 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.870
 something like a tradition for us 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.820
 that we have a few days before 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.710
 the auction with iris schloss and elmar 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.770
 lesch the two organizers of the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.510
 auction to meet us about the picture 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.539
 to make a new collection 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.769
 wanted this year in the anniversary year 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.269
 we from elmar know if he is 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.800
 is satisfied with the development of 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.629
 auction and above all things with the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.670
 development of the horses over the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.010
 auction to the appropriate matching 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.019
 riders have gone 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.089
 we have a whole wide range 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.309
 become more successful for this little one 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.129
 lord what we sold over the years 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.879
 are yes as I said you are 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.430
 really to the Stammplatz level the horses 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.260
 penetrated and what you just emphasize 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:01.010
 everything had to be more or less 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.390
 selfmade couple out there 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.060
 so those who have crystallized as 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.800
 over the 1 star range over the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.440
 junior young rider camp in there 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.670
 have come and then practically now 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.240
 go the three stars and even in the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.650
 four stones level gets so far and 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.820
 that's really just a small one 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:26.040
 excerpt so if you take 14 times 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.650
 Stands was was up- to- date again 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.880
 ddp that was currently placed there 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.440
 that's really just the best 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 and wilma comes here and says happy 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.030
 became junior championat 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.950
 top countries has won or horses the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.450
 get sexy for the world championship more 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 have qualified by 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.090
 So far as there is no assumption 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.460
 reason to be dissatisfied I think we 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.870
 we can be modestly satisfied 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.310
 his 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.500
 As every year you can already 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.420
 a few weeks before the auction one 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.430
 nice overview of the current 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.430
 procure collection on the homepage 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.400
 www.evotec.com are pictures 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.590
 description and also videos to 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.330
 but we still wanted from 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.750
 know your castle what is that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.930
 special about the auction collection 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.010
 2014 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.690
 I have to develop every collection 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.620
 and so again this year 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.270
 Beginning 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.850
 it all fits together that was the case 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.150
 everything just can cover but me 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.040
 think also we just succeeded 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.980
 again for young riders also for 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.610
 professionals just good young horses too 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.380
 Find 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.350
 Of course, our big advantage is that 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.890
 We now have many breeders 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.930
 us their horses also flatness 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.610
 entrust more than half of the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.830
 collection also comes directly from 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.080
 Breeder and I think we have whole 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.959
 really not only networks but also 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.850
 a good quality collection where we are 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.549
 not the outstanding tip now 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.200
 have forcibly ever had vice 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.180
 Bundeschampion or whatever 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.810
 but really so a wide peak 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.310
 I think I was going to have it, too 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.420
 already interesting customers 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.120
 from america canada belgium italy 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.950
 France 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.950
 we can not really understand each other
