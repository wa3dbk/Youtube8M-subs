00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 Besides, the person will recognize me 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.400
 thank you so much for that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.790
 I do not know how much it was 50 cents 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.560
 I believe and this to three euros or 2 euros 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.770
 done but well I'll see that by 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.930
 building into account the parts are 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.979

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 show beating who listens and the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.799

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.570

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.770
 mail shaped before but yes it was 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.869

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.750
 on the fifth generation 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.310
