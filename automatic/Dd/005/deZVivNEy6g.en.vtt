00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
because my bullets never register her

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
because my bullets never register her
when<00:00:20.310> i<00:00:20.340> use<00:00:20.580> his<00:00:20.760> gun<00:00:20.910> I'm<00:00:21.270> being<00:00:21.570> for<00:00:21.779> real<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
when i use his gun I'm being for real a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.410 
when i use his gun I'm being for real a
lot<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.830> times<00:00:23.070> majority<00:00:23.850> time<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.240> use

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
lot of times majority time when I use

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.779 
lot of times majority time when I use
this<00:00:24.539> weapon<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.109> always<00:00:25.619> happens<00:00:26.250> my<00:00:26.400> bullets

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this weapon it always happens my bullets

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
this weapon it always happens my bullets
don't<00:00:26.970> register<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.630> guess<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> do<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
don't register so guess what I do I

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.310 
don't register so guess what I do I
don't<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.090> that's<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.109> much<00:00:31.199> how

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
don't use it so that's pretty much how

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.659 
don't use it so that's pretty much how
you<00:00:31.500> solve<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.920> problem<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.520> stay

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you solve that problem you just stay

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.729 
you solve that problem you just stay
away<00:00:32.880> from<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> weapon<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.870> decided<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
away from the weapon but I decided to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.069 
away from the weapon but I decided to
try<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.579> again<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.630> cook<00:00:36.870> up

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
try it out again see what I can cook up

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.520 
try it out again see what I can cook up
and<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.760> gameplay<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.960> another

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and so I got this gameplay but another

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.869 
and so I got this gameplay but another
thing<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:40.829> playing<00:00:41.040> solo<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.640> match

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.130 
thing I'm playing solo in this match
which<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> something<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.600> don't<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.809> too

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
often in my videos anymore reason behind

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.740 
often in my videos anymore reason behind
that<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:46.430> when<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> play<00:00:47.670> solo<00:00:48.120> yes<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.629> can
