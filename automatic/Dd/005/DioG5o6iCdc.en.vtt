I'm not too concerned where this goes

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.330 
I'm not too concerned where this goes
because<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:47.260> going<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.530> put<00:00:47.680> a<00:00:47.710> state<00:00:47.980> up<00:00:48.160> the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
because I'm going to put a state up the

bananas<00:01:00.370> in<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:00.730> one<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:05.980> I<00:01:06.100> think<00:01:06.340> that's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
bananas in that one and I think that's

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.060 
bananas in that one and I think that's
because<00:01:08.160> because<00:01:09.160> of<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> heat<00:01:09.580> produced<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
because because of the heat produced and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.990 
because because of the heat produced and
I<00:01:12.700> thought<00:01:13.180> think<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.900> was<00:01:14.020> hot<00:01:14.229> enough<00:01:14.470> or

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I thought think it was hot enough or

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840 
I thought think it was hot enough or

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
of small order to start there's a little

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.670 
of small order to start there's a little
too<00:01:29.200> small<00:01:29.410> little<00:01:29.770> ones<00:01:31.260> let's<00:01:32.260> put<00:01:32.410> them<00:01:32.530> on

potatoes are quite small the salad size

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.460 
potatoes are quite small the salad size
I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:43.000> that's<00:01:43.210> because<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.630> put<00:01:43.750> two

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
potatoes in each wheel maybe that's that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.960

that<00:01:51.520> wasn't<00:01:51.760> them<00:01:53.580> they<00:01:54.580> should<00:01:54.760> have<00:01:54.850> been

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
that wasn't them they should have been

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:03.990 
that wasn't them they should have been
falling<00:01:55.510> apart<00:02:00.120> or<00:02:01.120> less<00:02:01.720> potatoes<00:02:02.700> before<00:02:03.700> to
