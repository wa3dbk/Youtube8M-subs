00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
photography today I want to talk a

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.329 
photography today I want to talk a
little<00:00:03.060> bit<00:00:03.300> about<00:00:03.419> signing<00:00:04.049> photos<00:00:04.589> so<00:00:05.250> I'm

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
little bit about signing photos so I'm

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.769 
little bit about signing photos so I'm
gonna<00:00:05.430> be<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.670> an<00:00:05.790> art<00:00:06.029> show<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.450> few<00:00:06.660> weeks

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
gonna be in an art show in a few weeks

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.110 
gonna be in an art show in a few weeks
and<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.859> was<00:00:08.130> contemplating<00:00:08.490> whether<00:00:08.910> or<00:00:09.030> not

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
and I was contemplating whether or not

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.780 
and I was contemplating whether or not
to<00:00:09.330> sign<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.780> front<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.500> photo<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.490> has

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
to sign the front of a photo that has

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.580 
to sign the front of a photo that has
been<00:00:11.940> printed<00:00:12.150> out<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.630> potentially<00:00:13.410> for

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
been printed out and potentially for

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.849 
been printed out and potentially for
sale<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.940> concept<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.350> signing<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
sale I like the concept of signing a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.769 
sale I like the concept of signing a
photo<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.570> would

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
photo but I don't like that it would

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.250 
photo but I don't like that it would
kind<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.090> interfere<00:00:21.090> would<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.390> aesthetic<00:00:21.990> of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
kind of interfere would be aesthetic of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.590 
kind of interfere would be aesthetic of
the<00:00:22.650> photo<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:23.970> black<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.480> if

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the photo because if it's black or if

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.089 
the photo because if it's black or if
you<00:00:24.689> sign<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.050> silver<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.680> could<00:00:25.980> be

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you sign it with silver that could be

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.060 
you sign it with silver that could be
distracting<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.510> then<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.750> had<00:00:27.900> an<00:00:28.019> idea<00:00:28.140> what

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
distracting so then I had an idea what

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.400 
distracting so then I had an idea what
if<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.400> sign<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:29.990> phosphorescent<00:00:30.990> and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
if you sign it with phosphorescent and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.939 
if you sign it with phosphorescent and
visible<00:00:31.740> ink

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
visible ink

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.819 
visible ink
hmm<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> went<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.690> Amazon<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.590> able<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
hmm so I went on Amazon and was able to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.150 
hmm so I went on Amazon and was able to
find<00:00:35.160> an<00:00:35.340> ultraviolet<00:00:35.989> pen<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.559> basically<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
find an ultraviolet pen it's basically a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
find an ultraviolet pen it's basically a
permanent<00:00:38.700> marker<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.450> when<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> write<00:00:40.140> on

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
permanent marker but when you write on

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
permanent marker but when you write on
it<00:00:40.579> there<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.610> can't<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.600> you're

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it there you can't see what you're

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.850 
it there you can't see what you're
writing<00:00:42.870> until<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.379> hit<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.710> an

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
writing until you hit it with an

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
writing until you hit it with an
ultraviolet<00:00:44.219> light<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.120> shines<00:00:45.390> in

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
ultraviolet light and then it shines in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
ultraviolet light and then it shines in
blue<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.520> cool<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.030> when<00:00:48.149> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
blue which is really cool so when you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
blue which is really cool so when you
write<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:49.039> aluminized<00:00:50.039> metal

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
write on one of these aluminized metal

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.970 
write on one of these aluminized metal
prints<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.770> there's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
prints you can actually see that there's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
prints you can actually see that there's
a<00:00:53.039> signature<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.879> has<00:00:54.030> no<00:00:54.300> color<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
a signature there but it has no color to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
a signature there but it has no color to
it<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.289> hit<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it if you hit it with if you look at it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.970 
it if you hit it with if you look at it
at<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.510> certain<00:00:57.989> angle<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:58.710> these<00:00:58.800> are

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
at a certain angle because these are

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
at a certain angle because these are
highly<00:00:59.399> reflective<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> kind<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> see

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
highly reflective you can kind of see

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
highly reflective you can kind of see
the<00:01:00.899> signature<00:01:01.379> written<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the signature written there but it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.280 
the signature written there but it
doesn't<00:01:03.090> detract<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> image

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
doesn't detract it all from the image

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
doesn't detract it all from the image
when<00:01:04.409> you're<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.680> looking<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.369> then

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
when you're just looking at it and then

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.700 
when you're just looking at it and then
you<00:01:05.970> hit<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> light<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> poof

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you hit it with the light and poof

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
you hit it with the light and poof
there's<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.220> signature<00:01:08.580> there<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> thought

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
there's a signature there so I thought

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530 
there's a signature there so I thought
that<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.200> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> neat<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.240> will<00:01:12.240> show<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that was kind of neat I will show you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
that was kind of neat I will show you
right<00:01:12.900> now<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.680> looks<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.640> when<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
right now what that looks like when you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.980 
right now what that looks like when you
hit<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> light<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:18.119> kind<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> neat

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
hit it with a light it's kind of a neat

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
hit it with a light it's kind of a neat
effect<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.830> I've<00:01:19.920> never<00:01:20.130> seen<00:01:20.430> anyone<00:01:20.759> do

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
effect that I've never seen anyone do

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.080 
effect that I've never seen anyone do
before<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> thought<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.070> would<00:01:23.490> share<00:01:23.880> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
before so I thought I would share this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270 
before so I thought I would share this
with<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.680> thoughts<00:01:25.710> are<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
with you see what your thoughts are on

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.730 
with you see what your thoughts are on
this<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.630> think

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
this do you like this what do you think

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.020 
this do you like this what do you think
so<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> back<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.549> each<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.939> these

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so on the back of each one of these

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.050 
so on the back of each one of these
prints<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:31.170> gonna<00:01:31.369> also<00:01:32.369> sign<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
prints I'm just gonna also sign it and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
prints I'm just gonna also sign it and
I'll<00:01:33.479> write<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> name<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.740> actual<00:01:34.890> image

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I'll write the name of the actual image

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.520 
I'll write the name of the actual image
but<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> front<00:01:36.780> I'll<00:01:37.079> use<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
but on the front I'll use the
