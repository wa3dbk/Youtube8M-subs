over<00:00:13.950> England<00:00:14.690> if<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:16.109> look<00:00:16.800> back<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.010> that

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
over England if you look back on that

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.920 
over England if you look back on that
team<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> pick<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> world's<00:00:18.449> best<00:00:18.660> team

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
team and you pick the world's best team

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.210 
team and you pick the world's best team
at<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.080> moment<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.650> probably<00:00:19.859> had<00:00:20.039> nine

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
at that moment we probably had nine

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.060 
at that moment we probably had nine
players<00:00:20.510> so<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.080> can't<00:00:22.320> win<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> World<00:00:22.740> Cup<00:00:22.949> if

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
players so you can't win a World Cup if

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.769 
players so you can't win a World Cup if
you<00:00:23.189> haven't<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.580> nine<00:00:24.180> players<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you haven't got nine players in the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900 
you haven't got nine players in the
world's<00:00:25.019> bests<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:26.070> can't<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.670> player

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
world's bests you can't have one player

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.589 
world's bests you can't have one player
you<00:00:27.150> need<00:00:27.330> more<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.820> think<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.240> showed

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you need more and and I think as showed

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
you need more and and I think as showed
in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.170> history<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.529> rugby<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.009> best<00:00:32.219> team<00:00:32.369> as

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
in the history of rugby the best team as

in the history of rugby the best team as
one<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> most<00:00:33.149> stars<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.630> but

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
one is what the most stars in it but

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
one is what the most stars in it but
it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> team<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.760> individual<00:00:36.300> but

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it's a team you can be individual but

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's a team you can be individual but
work<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> team<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.610> more<00:00:39.570> fortunate

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
work as a team and that's more fortunate

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
work as a team and that's more fortunate
we<00:00:40.110> had<00:00:40.230> guys<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.860> 26<00:00:41.399> 27<00:00:41.850> year<00:00:42.059> olds

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
been around a long time and they were

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
been around a long time and they were
there<00:00:44.430> from<00:00:44.520> 84<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> experience

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

and<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:48.390> counts<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and and that really counts when the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
and and that really counts when the
pressures<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:51.649> having<00:00:52.649> beaten<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> defending

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
game plan up to that point had been

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.060

built<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.359> their<00:01:00.510> pack<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.039> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
built on their pack but there was a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.880 
built on their pack but there was a
sudden<00:01:02.399> change<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.059> direction<00:01:03.619> you<00:01:04.619> can't

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
sudden change of direction you can't

change your style of technique over
nights<00:01:06.479> you've<00:01:07.290> either<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
nights you've either got it or you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.760 
nights you've either got it or you
haven't<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.320> their<00:01:10.470> problem

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
haven't and that that was their problem

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.960 
haven't and that that was their problem
I<00:01:10.830> mean<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.220> tried<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:11.850> but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
I mean that they tried very well but

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.330 
I mean that they tried very well but
unfortunately<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.860> didn't<00:01:14.159> have

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
unfortunately it was just it didn't have

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.359 
unfortunately it was just it didn't have
that<00:01:15.110> x-factor<00:01:16.110> players<00:01:16.710> Gus<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.250> was

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that x-factor players Gus got was

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
that x-factor players Gus got was
probably<00:01:17.580> only<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.060> who<00:01:18.240> could<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.630> something

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
probably only one who could do something

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
probably only one who could do something
that<00:01:19.080> no<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.320> else<00:01:19.470> could<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:20.490> never

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that no one else could do but he never

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:31.680 
that no one else could do but he never
got<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> ball

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.950 

I'm<00:01:31.780> taking<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.620> trophy<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:33.750> think<00:01:34.750> when<00:01:34.870> you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
I'm taking the trophy I think when you

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.900

win you actually realize bloody hard

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.970 
win you actually realize bloody hard
work<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:38.020> know<00:01:38.170> there's<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.440> lot<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.680> glory<00:01:38.890> but

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
work you know there's a lot of glory but

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.800 
work you know there's a lot of glory but
cheese<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.430> know<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.120> put<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.390> lot<00:01:40.510> of<00:01:40.600> life

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
cheese you know you put a lot of life

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.290 
cheese you know you put a lot of life
and<00:01:41.020> sweat<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.860> tears<00:01:42.040> and<00:01:42.430> training-wise<00:01:42.970> to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
and sweat and tears and training-wise to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.300 
and sweat and tears and training-wise to
be<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.540> best<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:44.920> think<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> hardest

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
be the best but I think the hardest

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.950 
be the best but I think the hardest
thing<00:01:45.550> after<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.120> you've<00:01:46.420> got<00:01:46.540> to<00:01:46.630> take<00:01:46.810> two

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
thing after you you've got to take two

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.720 
thing after you you've got to take two
four<00:01:47.110> years<00:01:47.380> that's<00:01:47.680> even<00:01:47.890> harder<00:01:48.190> because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
four years that's even harder because

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.980 
four years that's even harder because
everyone<00:01:49.120> wants<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.300> smash<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.630> after<00:01:49.870> that

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
everyone wants to smash you after that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.770 
everyone wants to smash you after that
but<00:01:50.800> look<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.520> was<00:01:51.910> very<00:01:52.060> fortunate<00:01:52.300> you<00:01:52.690> know

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
but look I was very fortunate you know

players<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.620> and<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.430> think<00:02:00.520> that's<00:02:00.790> what<00:02:00.910> rugby

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
players so and I think that's what rugby

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.540 
players so and I think that's what rugby
does<00:02:01.330> to<00:02:02.970> camp<00:02:03.970> AZ<00:02:04.210> went<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.900> win<00:02:05.220> 101<00:02:06.220> caps

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
does to camp AZ went on to win 101 caps

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.520 
does to camp AZ went on to win 101 caps
for<00:02:06.790> his<00:02:06.850> country<00:02:06.970> but<00:02:07.720> what<00:02:07.900> does<00:02:08.050> he<00:02:08.140> make<00:02:08.350> of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
for his country but what does he make of

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.130 
for his country but what does he make of
the<00:02:08.649> current<00:02:09.040> side<00:02:09.810> there's<00:02:10.810> been<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:10.960> lot<00:02:11.110> of

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the current side there's been a lot of

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.230 
the current side there's been a lot of
problems<00:02:11.590> over<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.070> years<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:14.020> know<00:02:14.080> and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
problems over the years you know and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.400 
problems over the years you know and
sometimes<00:02:16.240> if<00:02:16.420> you're<00:02:16.540> too<00:02:16.720> successful<00:02:16.960> you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
sometimes if you're too successful you

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.480 
sometimes if you're too successful you
actually<00:02:17.650> forget<00:02:17.830> about<00:02:17.950> where<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.310> come

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
actually forget about where you come

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.490 
actually forget about where you come
from<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.570> think<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:19.900> Australian<00:02:20.290> rugby

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
from and I think in Australian rugby

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.930 
from and I think in Australian rugby
we've<00:02:20.650> actually<00:02:20.800> forgot<00:02:21.190> about<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.760> grass

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
we've actually forgot about the grass

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.810 
we've actually forgot about the grass
roots<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.620> think<00:02:23.830> if<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.040> see<00:02:24.250> now<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.490> we

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
roots and I think if you see now that we

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.370 
roots and I think if you see now that we
are<00:02:25.180> struggling<00:02:25.480> because<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:25.990> haven't<00:02:26.170> got

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
are struggling because we haven't got

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.560 
are struggling because we haven't got
the<00:02:26.470> players<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.850> we<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.180> need<00:02:28.420> to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570
