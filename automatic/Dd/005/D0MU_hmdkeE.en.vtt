00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 The people are good people, let's do it today. 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.480
 I love to kiss her pretty much in the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.220
 You really taught me how to eggplant. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.310
 because I did not like it before but it did 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 a very hot summer and I learned to 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.740
 Experiencing is not everything I like but 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.930
 it was delicious 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.689
 then and today I see an eggplant with 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.439
 Exactly what is an Arab seasoning is super 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.200
 tasty 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.899
 It's not hard to find there you find 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.510
 case of easy spice and so let's 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.690
 there we picked and froze 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.379
 I think all two seed all 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.539
 The goal only spits the little one and lets go. 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.550
 refuse her but first we'll go 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.550
 come with onion and garlic ne 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.930
 of quentin yes onion is already putting 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.930
 purple onion, right? 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 look as much as you want I usually 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.750
 really likes the area and we want to 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 pull here only has an onion point but 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.280
 and air and you take some of the crude oil 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.619
 in the week that Jesus never loves 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:24.299
 I find this too wonderful. 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.920
 I think oh eggplant applied because 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.920
 no bark all 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.450
 now he's hanging around until she arrives 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.369
 at that point she will too, but she was going to 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.939
 people being able to make ours full dark 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.580
 fifa it will no longer accurate gray 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:53.789
 is an Arabic seasoning if judges and tasty 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.460
 did not have our respect ours is already 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.289
 ready and cold to put inside the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.509
 Our father alone here we are 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.229
 using a guidewire mass which is a 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.679
 dough which is flour water and sun and salt 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.920
 So it 's vegan you that does not cover anything. 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.680
 of animal origin or are allergic to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.209
 lactose can also eat is this for 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.280
 Josh completely picking on the truth 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.670
 Yes, sure, but I'll put a little 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.040
 here or in the center of it and there we do 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.530
 a glue with water and flour 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.799
 on the dollar to close the space she who 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.180
 only light in the rules only passes 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:41.280
 much not only with me, sticky alone and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.390
 There you pick up, she's doing some 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.380
 to do well with a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.269
 And there is only one truth in the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.350
 finally say it's very close and now 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.459
 which is in a bazaar all over the complex 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:11.069
 me is easy 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:13.499
 do not take over fold and then 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.849
 It was only a rainy December morning 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:18.930
 this here 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.659
 That's when we taught him that's what we 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.249
 place the oil as it is hot because 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.170
 Stuffing is cooked even just for 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:28.799
 fry dough and it looked good 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.689
 We had a very good time. 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.079
