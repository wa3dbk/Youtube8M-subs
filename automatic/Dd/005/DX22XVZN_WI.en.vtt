00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.490
 on another occasion we saw how to create a DVD 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.979
 with a simple welcome 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.899
 using encore cs4 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.049
 let's red on translation 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.550
 but with a more complex menu 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.230
 using in this case 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.849
 and now I am a witch of course 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.579
 premier 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.279
 here uses answered 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.710
 ah. after starting premiere pro cs4 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.620
 oporto disposed 8 clips which are these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 a. 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.940
 with as many titles 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.710
 and as many markers so 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.100
 that I will go 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.770
 to create share precisely 8 titles eight then 8 clip art 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.790
 and therefore will make use of a main menu 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.010
 and from the submenus that will contain the different scenes 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.380
 here in this case 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.480
 these fixes - they are almost all types in high definition but this is not 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.610
 considerable 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.110
 with audio content that does not matter that much 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.160
 then 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.619
 what will i do i go to activate the mixer window 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.950
 sound 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.120
 hey I'll reduce claudio come here this is hate 1 in these the audio 1 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.930
 so i'm going to reduce the audioooooo 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.940
 practically 0 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.510
 the way that not via postiglione 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.240
 el put it runs in addition 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.990
 a background music 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.400
 what matters hoarse sycamore I set exam several video clips 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.920
 that matter 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.100
 and in this case I had decided to import 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.939
 of lemon music confit here 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.360
 so let's see for a moment 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.390
 for example, we could swallow if you put one 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.670
 one evening at dinner cont 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.980
 and I will take this piece of music 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.980
 let's see if I turned 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.190
 you probably don't feel it but this is not important 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.769
 if not now when to add 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.079
 to my 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.299
 here on my time line 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.869
 but as the 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.339
 here in this case 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.359
 the piece of music is not enough to cover all 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.989
 to my 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:26.859
 time line 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.519
 I'll get another one 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.149
 atjazz godless I know myself 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.819
 the time of maddalena 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.069
 and in this case precisely 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.069
 I will add it also in this case 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:43.219
 but what is too long, however, is then the curcio rome this 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.539
 one of many this simply 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.250
 in many small examples to see how 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.689
 you act using 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.419
 cs4 premiere but we've already seen on other occasions 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.639
 ooh of course I'm going to check it out here 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.219
 anaconda mine 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.879
 mix 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.390
 so I'll tell you tweets close this window closed 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.369
 com 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.539
 excel 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.529
 I go to art always remix 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.529
 ebay to check if my oil 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.249
 ok my wife turns you see 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.680
 that there is its importance the video content 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.929
 besides having inserted the audio, I have already prepared and inserted at the beginning 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.269
 of every single one 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.919
 of every single one 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.359
 script 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.439
 let's start this example no if it wasn't this 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.689
 we make peace request on the fifth 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.809
 on the contrary, we space for little modestly at the beginning here is this one here 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:49.089
 fairy shooting with moon high-definition cameras of this daisy 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:54.219
 and for otraweb rugby but having put a push 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.119
 you see here also 8 inserted one 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:59.449
 a marker 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.689
 which will be what will then define the possibility of making the connection in 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:04.479
 my menu 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.479
 not baptized in this case daisy 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:09.980
 I will tell you that 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.609
 from the window cap 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.539
 will appear in my menu must be animated 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.689
 with a duration of 5 seconds for example 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:23.360
 the same thing I could do also for this second - which is a pipe of 

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:24.779
 nothing pinnacle 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:28.879
 here I had not yet established that what I do should be animated 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.249
 now simply dragging this little cloths a minute 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.539
 I don't get a window 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:35.729
 of the scene 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.300
 tim atack the toughs 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.300
 3 4 second and the same thing I was for all the others 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.580
 the scene of the Sforza castle 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.729
 of Milan at 15 of August 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.729
 when there are artificial forts and so on 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:58.949
 in doing so I can continue for everyone but now I am not going to bore you 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.020
 because it would be repetitive what to recover 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.770
 activate and again 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.069
 as we have already seen also opportunity 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.520
 you don't need to go to really directly but just go here east 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.719
 in the file menu 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.199
 and click on 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.229
 adobe dainami klink 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.270
 sent by nightmare 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.430

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.930
 directly imports the 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.470
 this tweet opened too big 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.199
 let's see' 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.129
 wait for you 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.199
 terms open 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.610
 after which lory is mentioned in the window 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.610
 in the right way 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.919
 ok okay for the moments we leave untitled 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.699
 web 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:48.849
 ok 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.599
 that is importing 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.229
 if importing the innate creator project 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.669
 impregnated 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.669
 weight interrupts and otherwise I become too long and boring 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.080
 you know that it is leaking and how it was opened 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.139
 and now we proceed to the creation of the menu 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.789
 for all the info for consequent actions
