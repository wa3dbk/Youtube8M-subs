we love it we want to celebrate it but I

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.219 
we love it we want to celebrate it but I
think<00:05:09.550> in<00:05:09.699> the<00:05:09.819> concept<00:05:10.240> study<00:05:10.509> you<00:05:10.659> also<00:05:10.840> see

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
think in the concept study you also see

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.830 
think in the concept study you also see
many<00:05:11.860> elements<00:05:12.310> that<00:05:12.520> are<00:05:12.789> modern<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.659> that

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
many elements that are modern and that

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.610 
many elements that are modern and that
can<00:05:14.020> take<00:05:14.229> us<00:05:14.409> into<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:15.310> design<00:05:15.639> future<00:05:16.120> and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
can take us into the design future and

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.740 
can take us into the design future and
so<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.830> concept<00:05:18.699> serves<00:05:19.060> also<00:05:19.360> as<00:05:19.629> an

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
so this concept serves also as an

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.080 
so this concept serves also as an
inspiration<00:05:20.440> for<00:05:20.470> every<00:05:21.250> other<00:05:21.370> project<00:05:21.699> that

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
inspiration for every other project that

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.320 
inspiration for every other project that
we<00:05:22.240> did

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
we did

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.480 
we did
that's<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:25.080> great<00:05:25.289> outlook<00:05:25.710> at<00:05:25.889> least<00:05:26.129> for<00:05:26.400> the
