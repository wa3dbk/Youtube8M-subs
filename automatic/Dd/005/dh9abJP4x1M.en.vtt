stone<00:00:58.170> cold<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:59.010> i<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> good<00:00:59.699> idea

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
stone cold which i think is a good idea

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.229 
stone cold which i think is a good idea
but<00:01:00.390> beyond<00:01:00.899> an<00:01:01.050> initial<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.739> pop<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.760> not

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but beyond an initial first pop I'm not

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.759 
but beyond an initial first pop I'm not
sure<00:01:03.480> how<00:01:03.660> much<00:01:03.780> long<00:01:04.019> seven<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.500> something

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
sure how much long seven is something

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.140 
sure how much long seven is something
like<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.129> would<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.729> time<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> try

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
like that would have it's time to try

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
like that would have it's time to try
something<00:01:06.180> new<00:01:06.659> something<00:01:07.020> fresh<00:01:07.340> I'd<00:01:08.340> hate

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
something new something fresh I'd hate

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.410 
something new something fresh I'd hate
to<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.790> WWE<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.630> into<00:01:10.670> WCWS<00:01:11.670> old<00:01:11.820> ways<00:01:12.060> or

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to see the WWE go into WCWS old ways or

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
to see the WWE go into WCWS old ways or
TN<00:01:12.689> Hayes<00:01:12.930> current<00:01:13.320> ways<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.740> trying<00:01:14.520> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
TN Hayes current ways of trying to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670

rehash<00:01:15.090> old<00:01:15.360> stuff<00:01:15.720> over<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.320> again<00:01:16.560> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
rehash old stuff over and over again I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
rehash old stuff over and over again I
think<00:01:16.860> bringing<00:01:17.220> Kevin<00:01:17.580> Nash<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.030> while<00:01:18.240> he<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
think bringing Kevin Nash in while he is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.219 
think bringing Kevin Nash in while he is
an<00:01:18.659> old<00:01:18.810> name<00:01:19.140> would<00:01:19.979> bring<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.250> new<00:01:20.430> twist<00:01:20.790> on

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
an old name would bring a new twist on

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.520 
an old name would bring a new twist on
on<00:01:22.229> leadership<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> raw<00:01:24.240> GM<00:01:24.600> i<00:01:25.110> know

on leadership for for the raw GM i know
they<00:01:25.770> teased<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:27.060> rock<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> stone<00:01:27.869> cold<00:01:28.170> with

they teased the rock and stone cold with

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560 
they teased the rock and stone cold with
some<00:01:28.619> catchphrases<00:01:29.100> early<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
some catchphrases early on in the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600 
some catchphrases early on in the
general<00:01:30.869> managers<00:01:31.290> comments<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.070> i<00:01:32.310> think

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
general managers comments but i think

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.980 
general managers comments but i think
that<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.150> red<00:01:33.299> herring<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:33.869> us

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that was just a red herring to get us

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.380 
that was just a red herring to get us
thinking<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.680> us<00:01:34.799> hoping<00:01:35.270> let's<00:01:36.270> see

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
thinking and to get us hoping let's see

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
thinking and to get us hoping let's see
an<00:01:36.509> outsider<00:01:36.930> no<00:01:37.200> pun<00:01:37.409> intended<00:01:37.530> come<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
an outsider no pun intended come in and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
an outsider no pun intended come in and
and<00:01:38.880> take<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.479> role<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.900> also<00:01:40.590> some<00:01:40.740> comments

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
and take that role on also some comments

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
and take that role on also some comments
on<00:01:41.189> Matt<00:01:41.430> Hardy<00:01:41.729> who<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:42.990> would

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
on Matt Hardy who do I think he would

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980 
on Matt Hardy who do I think he would
team<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.820> from<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> face<00:01:45.149> perspective<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
team with from a face perspective I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.929 
team with from a face perspective I
think<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.829> could<00:01:46.950> bring<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.310> Shannon

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
think we if we could bring in Shannon

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.580 
think we if we could bring in Shannon
Moore<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> face<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:49.079> those<00:01:49.229> two<00:01:49.409> have

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
Moore as a face you know those two have

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
Moore as a face you know those two have
a<00:01:49.619> history<00:01:49.740> personally<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.729> think<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.540> could<00:01:51.630> be

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
a history personally I think it could be

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.539 
a history personally I think it could be
another<00:01:51.840> high-flying<00:01:52.500> type<00:01:52.770> team<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.340> could

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
another high-flying type team that could

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
another high-flying type team that could
that<00:01:54.060> could<00:01:54.119> bring<00:01:54.420> Matt<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.780> credibility

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
that could bring Matt some credibility

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.289 
that could bring Matt some credibility

looking to make that big break and and

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.270 
looking to make that big break and and
get<00:06:30.120> their<00:06:30.300> chance<00:06:30.540> at<00:06:30.810> achieving<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.950> next
