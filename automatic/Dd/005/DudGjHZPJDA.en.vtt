00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.160
 we already see help this month 5 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:10.549
 here on the back 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.089
 Fini had a 3com as 1 megapixel camera 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.119
 inclusive in Haiti 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.470
 and this camera long time we had to reach fastest by putting one here 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.429
 on the 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.720
 Trigger pusher 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.939
 then I can come directly into the ranks 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.390
 and now let's take a look at the options 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.540
 Family shots 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.200
 then in the bigger one 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.590
 here are not always easy with accounts for 3 megapixels 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.580
 but it is also below that per year 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.900
 yes there is a night mode there is a light for not my son now 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.170
 its like holding so it is also suitable as a small draw 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.290
 flashlight 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.290
 in order to be poorer yes Osmani do not need to go 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.500
 then there is one yourself as a filter 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.910
 White balance 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.910
 go through 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.700
 very handy for me too 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.040
 to see that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.780
 I'm not going to go back to the menu directly 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.820
 you can still make other settings or if you do not notice 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.250
 that right Kaman 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.220
 directly the setting of the change 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.760
 Sulander Meyer is still defective and Mr. more on setting though Study 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.790
 Photo quality checking position on the train saves you car turn lock 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.479
 Control 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.880
 Finally hire customers and reset many 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.490
 now I will have expected 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.490
 to take a picture 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.250
 I can get it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.039
 the colors are good 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.890
 how nice 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.930
 clear and bright so 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.400
 perfectly fine 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.980
 Now, for example, I would like to delete it because I can hear a video turn 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.960
 I just change here 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.240
 So Herrmann photos and videos then photos and take 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.919
 Record videos 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.919
 so here too there is a string of possibilities 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.549
 Video length can be easier if I'm normal or just for one 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.879
 Pass limited also here I can happily use the light it 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.339
 gives a night mode 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:27.579
 Self-timer microphone Weishaupt easily effects 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.269
 and also some more settings 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.740
 they are searching videos are taken with 320 times Steinert 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.309
 40 look are so 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 QVGA resolution 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.259
 it's just time 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.259
 at opportunities comes out 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.299
 So I am allowed to have a decent quality watch 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.610
 Of course still not expect much from such cell phones 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.919
 it is actually well cleared for that 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.409
 altogether he can help a little bit the marriages come to a strict conclusion 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.689
 the darker it became 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.349
 I had some problems with that but otherwise it is the video 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.829
 by exercising order and much better than what some others do 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.119
 to activate the camera 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:25.719
 interesting even with the mobile phone camera is the winning geo-tagging 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.049
 that means 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.149
 she can 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.269
 the recordings you make for example month 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.790
 Link coordinates with the Mac so that you can follow afterwards 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.949
 really knows exactly where the picture was taken
