00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.940
 let's prepare spring rolls 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.730
 of prawns and vegetables ingredients 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.980
 what we need is a cabbage room 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.900
 or medium cab a obvious big area and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.300
 a small onion all cut in 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.150
 juliana fine 30 grams of sprouts 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.820
 Soybeans 300 prawns 2 tablespoons sauce 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.430
 Free soybeans powder a teaspoon 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.789
 of oyster sauce optional a little 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.340
 of water oil and salt we also need 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.489
 sheets of pasta brick or edge or paste 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 Special china for rolls and an egg 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.350
 or better just the yolk to close 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.350
 our rolls we started putting a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 wok the fire with a splash of oil and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.329
 when it's hot, we'll add the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.620
 cabbage carrot and onion 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.240
 we put a little salt so that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.080
 porsche better 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.080
 we move 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.989
 and as everything is a vegetable that is 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 pretty hard let's add the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 bean sprouts 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.140
 and we move it a little bit and add a 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.840
 trickle of water so the vegetables will 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.610
 soften a pinch without needing 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.460
 have scalding it in boiling water 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.930
 First 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.140
 what is done in the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.640
 Chinese restaurants you see the water as the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.180
 let's let it boil until it 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.850
 evaporate completely 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.479
 so the vegetable will be al dente 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.040
 neither too hard nor too soft 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.170
 we add the soy sauce which 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.310
 we also have to let it absorb 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.990
 well but it will evaporate 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.990
 we add the ginger 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.420
 and the trick is that we have to leave 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.040
 this vegetable is quite dry because 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.840
 filling of the rolls always has 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.030
 to be retinue so that we are not 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.510
 moisten the mass in which 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.220
 roll up and then break when frying 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.979
 we remove the vegetables from the wok to a 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.860
 side and we throw the gambetas we throw 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.310
 a little salt and we're going to sautÃ© them 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.870
 on a high heat and quickly so that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.120
 we do too much 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.730
 and still I have done in all the water then 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.030
 the truth is that they are frozen 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.739
 a little bit of oyster sauce only if the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.739
 we have but it is also not essential 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.900
 and once we have it ready we remove 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.489
 a little dish 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.069
 Now let's start with our 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.659
 rollitos we beat the egg that you 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.750
 I remember it's better if it's a yolk 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.239
 then the dough will stick better and like this 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.129
 filling has been quite smooth what 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.189
 let's strain first to remove the 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.230
 excess water or moisture that may have 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.689
 this time we are going to make the rolls with 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.819
 sheets of brick dough so you can see that 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.250
 they are just as beautiful and equal 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.319
 good we take off the paper wafer 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.560
 protector and we put a little bit of 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.299
 filling near a very little edge 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 remember that this part is important 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.709
 Well, if we got wet, it was 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.110
 too much dough and we can not fry them 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.870
 all right 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.180
 we stop half roll the roll and 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.939
 we put a little egg on the tips 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.959
 we fold it to the center of the roll 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.959
 and we paste 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.860
 it is important that there is enough mass 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.959
 always surrounding the filling as you can see 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.000
 you think it's too much dough and little 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.970
 filling and I tell you that if not then 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.880
 You will have problems frying them when 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.000
 we miss the last fold we throw 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.450
 another little egg on the tip 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.580
 and we wind up if we see that 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.130
 it sticks very well you know it's the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.410
 bud to the best hit we help each other 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.960
 with a little more and you see here the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.420
 difference from one mass to another both 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.550
 they fit very well with these amounts that 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.620
 We have given you will come around 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.080
 about ten rolls now with a 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.090
 fryer or a frying pan full of 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.640
 oil let's go frying the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.769
 quickly because being cool alone 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.200
 they will need a minute on each side 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.480
 to brown remember that if we have 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.639
 frozen first thing we can do 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.130
 we will have to fry them on low heat 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.889
 so that they are well browned on the outside but 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.250
 do well inside we drain them in 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.320
 Well absorbent kitchen paper and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.199
 that we overze freeze in a 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.510
 tupper and ready we have our 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.580
 spring rolls of rumbas and 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.590
 vegetables that as you see are very 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.350
 similar to the order of the restaurants 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.150
 Chinese and I can even tell you that if 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.610
 you follow the recipe well at face value 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.490
 they will appear to you that are richer 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.490
 still because they are delicious
