00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.519
 We are in an era of vegetable production for the production of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.140
 strawberries of the next campaign this is an important step to ensure the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.830
 quality of people two templates consequently productive potential 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.650
 In the national agronomic institute the agronomist and July thin spring some 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.230
 technical recommendations to carry out this work 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.850
 quality is a fundamental factor for the success of strawberry production 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.460
 of the fashions used for cultivation 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.880
 who must possess special qualities such as sanity from the high orgy 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.970
 performance potential 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.590
 the time of production of strawberry seedlings our country 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.830
 goes from the month of October to March and during this stage you have everything to have 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.520
 the maximum yield of the genetic potential of mother plants 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.160
 For this it is important to use good varieties and good techniques of 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.130
 production 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.510
 there are different 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.500
 forms of fashion production 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.430
 some cases the farmers only put began in 2000 multiply in that 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.510
 it's the fashionable idea we 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.320
 we recommend the use of more is in this case has structures 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
 in overbooked 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.860
 and with percent 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.840
 placid coverage 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.910
 about the idea I poked myself included to protect it against the merideños al 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.900
 fashions love the countryside 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.270
 but the work of fashion production 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.869
 It is recommended to provide seedlings with the necessary conditions so that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.490
 can be protected from weather phenomena and the attack of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.470
 plagues and diseases 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.670
 there are problems of diseases and beaches 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.369
 i percent the problem is a lot and they also follow suddenly the high 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.279
 temperatures also has its influence then that's why 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.270
 we recommend a good health a good diego 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.459
 more than this 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.459
 a protection against the equals 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:19.959
 climate 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.269
 the high temperature and heavy rains hurt the plants what 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.089
 primordial in this work 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:27.919
 from the mother plants 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:33.429
 are free of viruses so that they can generate seedlings of good quality 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:38.059
 the mother plant basically believe many cases have been based on the work 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:43.679
 tdf less and already st if some launches the free of ideas 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.909
 a the best production perspective 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.349
 of course the conditions in which they live in gaza then 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.909
 when a mother plant comes 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.929
 in the pot we put it in nothing 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.629
 biggest president can be 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.229
 ceramic plastic pots 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:05.410
 i percent 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.260
 so that the plant can express its potential according to aena 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.329
 Largest resident 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.269
 you read from there when they start to notice on the boards 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.349
 they rise by putting small pot around so that they can 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.549
 in settle there 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.879
 i percent 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.030
 by the Senate the most recommended technique for the production of weddings 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.849
 is the multiplication of plastic pots 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.599
 because if the transplant was made because of that city the producer did not 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.609
 has control over the health of the root system 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.949
 neither of the quality of the fashions 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.389
 one of the techniques of production of motorcycles that is made in the institute 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:56.059
 agronomic that production system in my wings that is a way to destroy 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.169
 cities 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.489
 table 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.879
 this is an extra woman 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.099
 simply that you can p 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.409
 resorting to technology 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.609
 opt for better production conditions to make species waiting 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.319
 a better result 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.519
 certainly without doubt only in states with protection 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.999
 low jorge against the yoke days 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.220
 and against him 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.110
 in the strong solar rays 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.160
 3 percent 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.160
 generates an expectation of a better province 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.560
 the facets used for the job must contain the essential nutrients 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.180
 so that seedlings can have the necessary conditions 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.660
 for the best possible development we leave behind basically copy 50% of 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.660
 it will be of forest and 50% of 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.289
 barcelona - time of cows in this case since then nothing 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.270
 the amount of it is recommended that we had experienced that is the one that goes 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.379
 to good result then 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:04.960
 Etienne a pot 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.449
 prepare 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.680
 that substrate 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.439
 they came omar romano naranjito a train 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.699
 the wire ceo why I pay 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.699
 as they go out in the area so you can 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.550
 have a hand 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.550
 this in 15 22 days when it starts 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.939
 to have her she can cut 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.050
 but 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.199
 as I told you at the stage 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.680
 the reproductive 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.400
 the next or those who fear some origin or port mode and another and so on 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.659
 successively 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.600
 attack 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.830
 the time comes when it has to be carried out 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.460
 you can also produce seedlings 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.379
 without the need to build the countertops 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.719
 placing the pots on planks built on the same floor 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:01.289
 that vote the drip production system that you can opt for him 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.740
 the question is who else then while both at the table little 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.229
 and that costs at least 107 this scheme 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.909
 by more than in the beds 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.699
 it can be done only by raising the earth ago efe 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.520
 that sings of brick that is permanent or otherwise becomes 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.469
 so he sees 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:25.129
 in the side because the moderate shoemaker wants 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.289
 i efe 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.129
 It can 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.949
 resort to this system to be created in modern 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:35.400
 the bears of it 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.740
 the divorce process 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.419
 in the difference is that the ac on the ground 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.759
 the but of the idea of ​​this one we will continue 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:48.229
 By the method of production of seedlings of pots a good 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.649
 development of the root system 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:55.089
 that is not accepted at the time of transplant to the final place 

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.319
 and stress is not surprising 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.599
 and you can advance the harvest in relation to other methods used
