00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 and if you kill me , I survive that 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.890
 Not 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 the following show is not for 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 suitable for spectators and are you happy 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 I've known you for a long time 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.500
 why I am a very peaceful 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599
 human and there are no witnesses to that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 contrary claim 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.480
 how many people have you killed already? 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.020
 Master, what are you going to bring me? 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020
 under water 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.680
 what is it I'll kill you episode 3 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680
 really around 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.380
 how are you both that was 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.190
 but let me grow it today 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.300
 I think I have to puke 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.460
 No , I still have my hand 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.840
 Wrapped and had a hello 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.400
 I had to tell something or have to 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.770
 stay with us two okay, I know 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.629
 what you say what my game did not think 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.370
 easily a leader for your enemy 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.369
 not beautiful but nothing for tomorrow 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.259
 yes that I'm still great 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.550
 year old bastard optimally that's me 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.869
 embarrassingly fast change the topic yes 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.159
 my last performance of my birth came as 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.900
 I really big out, well that was now 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.460
 really pretty inappropriate yes it is 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.320
 pretty stinky here but actually 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.550
 So I think so well personally 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.869
 Now I would like to stop the topic 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.009
 I just wanted to change 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.600
 Help a knee-op and you're the same 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.070
 180 again and that's what's supposed to do 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.060
 By the way, a left eye sees 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.880
 shit off that's one too 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.380
 Artificial eye which material 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 glass yes, I thought he must go through times 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.679
 I have heard that one 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.970
 Side job accepted as what are you working on 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.200
 I bring zombies and there are no zombies 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.030
 and you've got each with a 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.340
 puny life seen a combo no 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.479
 like to happen godlike you could 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.920
 Never kill zombies you are one 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.990
 clumsy I'm still a dumb 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 Oh yes, and then what the last week 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 [Music] 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.369
 that was an exception too and what is 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.369
 with yesterday as a bicycle were 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.610
 [Music] 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.710
 Yes, I'll go in again 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.790
 beautiful meeting if you help them 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.210
 the politics are all and these are 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.400
 we 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.140
 I have a strong headache in one 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.220
 vacuum can not I feel finds 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.020
 really shit that the princess 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.860
 now it just disappeared 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.630
 I can not bring it 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.910
 I think I feel that right in the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.500
 next room is in the driving school or 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.069
 No, but I'm a medium feel that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.330
 undergone 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.130
 but we were still there now 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.360
 megalomaniac you should rather 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.410
 go to a therapist 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.090
 I would not have to do that too 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.700
 like shit but I want you 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.080
 do not live to develop into life she was 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.790
 In any case, no desire felt 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.930
 that something does not know why too 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.430
 We do not rather help than over it 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.430
 not a bad idea to talk about 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.819
 [Music] 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.100
 But I did it and I did 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:53.330
 boring jump out the window 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:55.520
 [Music] 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.390

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.390
