several years you know that the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.490 
several years you know that the
beginning<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.210> kind<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.289> poo

beginning I was kind of a kind of poo
pood<00:00:28.740> abstract<00:00:29.220> games<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.880> even<00:00:30.720> today<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
pood abstract games and and even today I

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.130 
pood abstract games and and even today I
have<00:00:31.380> kind<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.890> thin<00:00:32.790> level<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.600> contempt

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
have kind of a thin level of contempt

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.479 
have kind of a thin level of contempt
for<00:00:34.260> games<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.739> pretend<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.280> thematic

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
for games that pretend to be thematic

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
for games that pretend to be thematic
but<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.510> really<00:00:36.750> abstract<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.440> pure

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
but are really abstract but pure

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.319 
but are really abstract but pure
abstracts<00:00:38.370> well<00:00:38.910> they're<00:00:39.059> becoming

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
abstracts well they're becoming

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.670 
abstracts well they're becoming
something<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:39.809> growing<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.410> more

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
word that i'm assuming is the same thing

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
word that i'm assuming is the same thing
to<00:00:55.079> force<00:00:55.620> somebody<00:00:56.100> else<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.420> what

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to force somebody else and that's what

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
to force somebody else and that's what
this<00:00:57.719> game<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.050> about<00:00:58.670> surrounding<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
this game is about surrounding and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.760 
this game is about surrounding and
capturing<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> being<00:01:00.750> forced<00:01:00.989> into<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.379> small

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
capturing and being forced into a small

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.310 
capturing and being forced into a small
position<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.879> comes<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.840> excellent

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
position it comes with really excellent

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.450 
position it comes with really excellent
little<00:01:04.799> small<00:01:05.700> pieces<00:01:06.799> little<00:01:07.799> triangles

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
little small pieces little triangles

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
little small pieces little triangles
let's<00:01:08.909> take<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> look<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.780> we'll<00:01:10.530> be

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
let's take a look at them and we'll be

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:26.730 
let's take a look at them and we'll be
right<00:01:10.830> back

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.170 

this<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.070> board<00:01:28.310> made<00:01:28.520> up<00:01:28.549> of<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.850> bunch<00:01:28.880> of

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
this is the board made up of a bunch of

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.749 
this is the board made up of a bunch of
individual<00:01:29.840> hexagons<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.399> can<00:01:31.549> see

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
individual hexagons that you can see

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.999 
individual hexagons that you can see
attached<00:01:32.689> very<00:01:32.990> simply<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.590> attach<00:01:33.829> them

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
attached very simply and you attach them

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.649 
attached very simply and you attach them
together<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.579> have<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.789> crisscross

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
together so you have a crisscross

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.429 
together so you have a crisscross
pattern<00:01:36.110> of<00:01:36.860> black<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.880> white<00:01:38.360> triangles<00:01:39.289> and

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
pattern of black and white triangles and

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.320 
pattern of black and white triangles and
the<00:01:39.979> starting<00:01:40.340> configuration<00:01:40.520> where<00:01:41.240> you

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
the starting configuration where you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.850 
the starting configuration where you
basically<00:01:41.509> have<00:01:42.100> three<00:01:43.750> hexes<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.990> your<00:01:45.530> color

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
basically have three hexes of your color

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.410 
basically have three hexes of your color
so<00:01:46.340> we're<00:01:46.460> playing<00:01:46.729> white<00:01:47.360> vers<00:01:47.720> dark<00:01:48.200> and

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
so we're playing white vers dark and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.300 
so we're playing white vers dark and
basically<00:01:50.420> one<00:01:50.689> person<00:01:51.110> takes<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.530> turn<00:01:52.039> and

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
basically one person takes a turn and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.279 
basically one person takes a turn and
then<00:01:52.729> then<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.329> next<00:01:53.450> person<00:01:53.659> takes<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.110> turn

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
then then the next person takes a turn

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.590 
then then the next person takes a turn
so<00:01:55.280> for<00:01:55.460> example<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:55.970> can<00:01:56.149> move<00:01:56.210> this<00:01:56.360> black

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
so for example I can move this black

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.300 
so for example I can move this black
piece<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.990> an<00:01:57.079> adjacent<00:01:57.200> spot<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:57.860> can<00:01:58.130> move<00:01:58.190> the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
piece to an adjacent spot I can move the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.130 
piece to an adjacent spot I can move the
white<00:01:58.459> piece<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.819> an<00:01:58.880> adjacent<00:01:59.090> spot<00:01:59.479> white

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
white piece to an adjacent spot white

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.539 
white piece to an adjacent spot white
pieces<00:02:00.409> can<00:02:00.679> only<00:02:00.799> move<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.069> white<00:02:01.220> spaces

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
pieces can only move the white spaces

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.190 
pieces can only move the white spaces
black<00:02:01.940> pieces<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.539> only<00:02:02.659> move<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.990> black

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
black pieces can only move to black

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.919 
black pieces can only move to black
spaces<00:02:03.560> what<00:02:04.490> you're<00:02:04.670> trying<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.060> do<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.450> you

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
spaces what you're trying to do is you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.990 
spaces what you're trying to do is you
are<00:02:05.959> trying<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.619> surround<00:02:07.130> your<00:02:07.610> other<00:02:07.759> piece

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
are trying to surround your other piece

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.359 
are trying to surround your other piece
completely<00:02:08.479> for<00:02:08.660> example<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.739> white<00:02:10.099> piece

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
completely for example this white piece

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.160 
completely for example this white piece
here<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.849> this<00:02:11.330> might<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.690> hard<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.930> see<00:02:12.110> in

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
here and this might be hard to see in

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.559 
here and this might be hard to see in
the<00:02:12.260> camera<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.620> let's<00:02:12.769> focus<00:02:13.099> up<00:02:13.299> this<00:02:14.299> white

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
the camera so let's focus up this white

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.240 
the camera so let's focus up this white
piece<00:02:14.810> here<00:02:15.170> has<00:02:15.560> been<00:02:15.590> completely

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
piece here has been completely

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.460 
piece here has been completely
surrounded<00:02:16.730> by<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:16.880> black<00:02:17.150> piece<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.780> if<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.140> move

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
surrounded by a black piece so if I move

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.250 
surrounded by a black piece so if I move
here<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.519> white<00:02:19.760> piece<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.299> removed<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.170> have

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
here the white piece is removed I have

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
here the white piece is removed I have
captured<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.860> however<00:02:22.700> if<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:22.970> white<00:02:23.209> piece

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
captured it however if the white piece

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.930 
captured it however if the white piece
moves<00:02:23.780> there<00:02:24.080> they<00:02:24.440> are<00:02:24.500> not<00:02:24.769> removed<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.700> has

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
moves there they are not removed it has

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.229 
moves there they are not removed it has
to<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.620> surrounding<00:02:28.400> pieces<00:02:28.849> have<00:02:29.090> to

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
to be the the surrounding pieces have to

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.580 
to be the the surrounding pieces have to
be<00:02:29.359> the<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.750> move<00:02:29.900> there<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:30.170> capture<00:02:30.350> it

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
be the one to move there to capture it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.229 
be the one to move there to capture it
so<00:02:30.859> sometimes<00:02:31.190> you'll<00:02:31.310> move<00:02:31.430> into<00:02:31.549> a<00:02:31.700> position

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
so sometimes you'll move into a position

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.910 
so sometimes you'll move into a position
that<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:34.250> know<00:02:34.370> completely<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:36.799> know

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
that is you know completely you know

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.860 
that is you know completely you know
surround<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.239> be<00:02:38.359> safe<00:02:38.540> for<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> while

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
surround it just to be safe for a while

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.870 
surround it just to be safe for a while
now<00:02:39.109> this<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.130> happen<00:02:40.310> down<00:02:40.579> here<00:02:40.609> at<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
now this can happen down here at the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.630 
now this can happen down here at the
edge<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.239> board<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.690> if<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:42.829> if<00:02:43.160> you're

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
edge of the board to if we if you're

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.520 
edge of the board to if we if you're
down<00:02:44.000> here<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:45.620> piece<00:02:45.920> moves<00:02:46.819> here<00:02:47.750> then

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
down here and a piece moves here then

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.349 
down here and a piece moves here then
you're<00:02:48.709> surrounded<00:02:49.250> because<00:02:49.579> you<00:02:50.030> only<00:02:50.180> need

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
you're surrounded because you only need

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.759 
you're surrounded because you only need
to<00:02:50.390> be<00:02:50.569> surrounding<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.049> spot<00:02:51.290> since<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> edge

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
to be surrounding to spot since the edge

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.620 
to be surrounding to spot since the edge
of<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.980> board<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.880> would<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.150> captured

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
of the board and you would be captured

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.009 
of the board and you would be captured
now<00:02:54.620> if<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.639> are<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.910> last<00:02:56.060> person<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.720> move

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
now if you are the last person to move

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.590 
now if you are the last person to move
off<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.380> section<00:02:57.829> of<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.100> board<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.549> that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
off a section of the board and that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.930 
off a section of the board and that
section<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.810> board<00:03:00.190> has<00:03:01.190> three<00:03:01.730> edges

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
section of the board has three edges

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.449 
section of the board has three edges
free<00:03:02.690> like<00:03:03.139> this<00:03:03.319> one<00:03:03.470> here<00:03:03.650> one<00:03:03.920> two<00:03:04.160> three

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
free like this one here one two three

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.580 
free like this one here one two three
that<00:03:05.120> are<00:03:05.150> all<00:03:05.359> adjacent<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.870> each<00:03:05.900> other<00:03:06.139> then

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
that are all adjacent to each other then

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.740 
that are all adjacent to each other then
that<00:03:06.620> section<00:03:07.250> comes<00:03:07.459> off<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.450> will<00:03:08.569> take

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
that section comes off and you will take

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.150 
that section comes off and you will take
that<00:03:08.930> section<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.380> place<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.829> in<00:03:09.889> front<00:03:09.920> of

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
that section and place it in front of

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.199 
that section and place it in front of
yourself<00:03:10.609> when<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:11.840> two<00:03:12.200> sections<00:03:12.829> in

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
yourself when you have two sections in

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.789 
yourself when you have two sections in
front<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.389> instead<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:15.049> moving<00:03:15.290> in<00:03:15.530> return

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
front of you instead of moving in return

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.039 
front of you instead of moving in return
you<00:03:15.950> can<00:03:16.069> simply<00:03:16.600> discard<00:03:17.600> both<00:03:17.810> those

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
you can simply discard both those

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.259 
you can simply discard both those
sections<00:03:18.380> take<00:03:19.040> any<00:03:19.280> piece<00:03:19.519> in<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.819> board<00:03:20.090> and

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
sections take any piece in the board and

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.170 
sections take any piece in the board and
sit<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.079> just<00:03:21.200> kill<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.859> this<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> very

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
sit and just kill it and this is a very

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.490 
sit and just kill it and this is a very
handy<00:03:23.389> thing<00:03:23.690> because<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:24.049> does<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.260> couple

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
handy thing because it does a couple

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.039 
handy thing because it does a couple
things<00:03:24.650> one<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.400> shrinks<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> board<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.930> as

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
things one it shrinks the board so as

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.170 
things one it shrinks the board so as
the<00:03:27.230> board<00:03:27.470> as<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.799> game<00:03:27.950> progresses<00:03:28.430> you

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the board as the game progresses you

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.640 
the board as the game progresses you
know<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.660> pieces<00:03:29.989> are<00:03:30.109> moving<00:03:30.380> in<00:03:30.500> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
know the pieces are moving in the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.650 
know the pieces are moving in the
board's<00:03:30.920> getting<00:03:31.190> smaller<00:03:31.579> but<00:03:32.150> also<00:03:32.299> if<00:03:32.540> you

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
board's getting smaller but also if you

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.050 
board's getting smaller but also if you
have<00:03:32.959> in<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.290> position<00:03:33.590> where<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:34.489> difficult

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
have in a position where it's difficult

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.850 
have in a position where it's difficult
to<00:03:35.269> kill<00:03:35.450> somebody<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:36.379> can<00:03:36.560> always<00:03:36.680> turn

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
to kill somebody you can always turn

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.250 
to kill somebody you can always turn
into<00:03:37.159> of<00:03:37.280> these<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.670> get<00:03:37.939> rid<00:03:38.090> of

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
into of these and get rid of

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.490 
into of these and get rid of
somebody<00:03:38.500> changing<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.430> odds<00:03:39.610> hopefully

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
somebody changing the odds hopefully

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.619 
somebody changing the odds hopefully
into<00:03:41.500> your<00:03:41.739> favor<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.879> first<00:03:43.120> person<00:03:43.510> who

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
into your favor the first person who

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.360 
into your favor the first person who
eliminates<00:03:44.260> all<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:45.159> the<00:03:45.310> other<00:03:45.459> person's

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
eliminates all of the other person's

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.000 
eliminates all of the other person's
pieces<00:03:48.370> is<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.970> winner<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:50.110> once<00:03:50.470> again<00:03:50.620> on

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
pieces is the winner so once again on

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.640 
pieces is the winner so once again on
your<00:03:51.519> turn<00:03:51.849> you<00:03:52.329> can<00:03:52.360> move<00:03:52.599> a<00:03:52.750> piece<00:03:52.959> take

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
your turn you can move a piece take

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.770 
your turn you can move a piece take
empty<00:03:53.950> tiles<00:03:54.310> maybe<00:03:54.549> capture<00:03:54.970> pieces<00:03:55.299> or

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
empty tiles maybe capture pieces or

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.880 
empty tiles maybe capture pieces or
exchange<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.440> pieces<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:56.860> take<00:03:57.159> them<00:03:57.310> off<00:03:57.870> and

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
exchange to pieces and take them off and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.530 
exchange to pieces and take them off and
like<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.010> said<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.430> person<00:04:00.579> with<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.849> fewest

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
like I said the person with the fewest

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.300 
like I said the person with the fewest
pieces<00:04:01.989> or<00:04:02.140> no<00:04:02.379> pieces<00:04:02.709> at<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:02.920> end<00:04:03.069> is<00:04:03.190> the

there<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:07.569> have<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.780> game<00:04:08.109> a<00:04:08.799> couple<00:04:09.159> things

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
there you have the game a couple things

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.339 
there you have the game a couple things
about<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.760> game<00:04:09.909> while<00:04:10.810> I've<00:04:11.049> set<00:04:11.260> the

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
about the game while I've set the

about the game while I've set the
beginning<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.859> pieces<00:04:12.040> are<00:04:12.220> great<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
beginning the pieces are great the the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.119 
beginning the pieces are great the the
hexagons<00:04:13.629> are<00:04:13.780> nice<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.230> thick<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.709> the

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
hexagons are nice and thick and the

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
triangles the only problem with those

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.120 
triangles the only problem with those
little<00:04:16.510> pyramid<00:04:17.109> triangle<00:04:17.620> pieces<00:04:17.829> is

little pyramid triangle pieces is

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.650 
little pyramid triangle pieces is
they're<00:04:18.669> not<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:18.940> always<00:04:19.180> easiest<00:04:19.510> thing

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
they're not the always easiest thing

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.029 
they're not the always easiest thing
that<00:04:19.750> pick<00:04:19.930> up<00:04:19.959> you're<00:04:20.260> grabbing<00:04:20.620> them<00:04:20.859> by<00:04:20.979> the

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
that pick up you're grabbing them by the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.400 
that pick up you're grabbing them by the
top<00:04:21.990> it's<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.260> not<00:04:23.410> as<00:04:23.560> easy<00:04:23.710> as<00:04:23.979> cubes<00:04:24.520> or

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
top it's just not as easy as cubes or

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.110 
top it's just not as easy as cubes or
spheres<00:04:26.410> will<00:04:26.620> be<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.860> grab<00:04:27.039> it's<00:04:27.729> not<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.880> big

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
spheres will be the grab it's not a big

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.390 
spheres will be the grab it's not a big
deal<00:04:28.150> but<00:04:28.979> just<00:04:29.979> something<00:04:30.100> I<00:04:30.220> thought<00:04:30.370> I

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
deal but just something I thought I

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.129 
deal but just something I thought I
throw<00:04:30.639> in<00:04:30.760> there<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.060> other<00:04:31.240> than<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.479> high

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
throw in there but other than that high

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.189 
throw in there but other than that high
quality<00:04:32.620> across<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.010> board<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:34.120> game<00:04:34.360> works

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
quality across the board the game works

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.490 
quality across the board the game works
well<00:04:35.770> ah<00:04:36.160> at<00:04:37.090> first<00:04:37.449> you're<00:04:37.960> kind<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.199> flailing

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
well ah at first you're kind of flailing

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.379 
well ah at first you're kind of flailing
around<00:04:38.710> like<00:04:39.039> what<00:04:39.220> pieces<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.669> move<00:04:39.910> here<00:04:40.210> and

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
around like what pieces I move here and

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.029 
around like what pieces I move here and
all<00:04:40.479> some<00:04:40.690> sections<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.590> board<00:04:41.830> start

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
all some sections of the board start

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.409 
all some sections of the board start
missing<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:42.520> start<00:04:42.729> capturing<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.300> then

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
missing and you start capturing and then

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.689 
missing and you start capturing and then
in<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:44.110> middle<00:04:44.349> it<00:04:44.530> gets<00:04:44.680> and<00:04:45.010> near<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.460> end

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
in the middle it gets and near the end

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.129 
in the middle it gets and near the end
it<00:04:45.789> gets<00:04:45.910> really<00:04:46.150> interesting<00:04:46.300> now<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.050> is

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
it gets really interesting now it is

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.600 
it gets really interesting now it is
possible<00:04:47.229> for<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.860> game<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.130> end<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.520> a

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
possible for the game to end in a

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.400 
possible for the game to end in a
stalemate<00:04:48.840> which<00:04:49.840> is<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:49.990> little<00:04:50.199> boring

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
stalemate which is a little boring

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.860 
stalemate which is a little boring
because<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.220> both<00:04:51.370> have<00:04:51.400> pieces<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:52.150> don't

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
because you both have pieces I don't

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.189 
because you both have pieces I don't
know<00:04:52.960> how<00:04:53.229> common<00:04:53.949> that<00:04:53.979> is<00:04:54.449> but<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.630> but<00:04:56.050> it

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
know how common that is but it but it

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.930 
know how common that is but it but it
really<00:04:56.470> comes<00:04:56.740> down<00:04:56.800> interesting<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.639> can<00:04:57.669> be

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
really comes down interesting you can be

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.580 
really comes down interesting you can be
ahead<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.599> have<00:04:58.990> more<00:04:59.169> pieces<00:04:59.500> in<00:04:59.560> your

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
ahead and have more pieces in your

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.570 
ahead and have more pieces in your
opponent<00:04:59.889> and<00:04:59.949> look<00:05:00.099> like<00:05:00.250> you're<00:05:00.370> going<00:05:00.490> to

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
opponent and look like you're going to

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.120 
opponent and look like you're going to
win<00:05:00.729> but<00:05:01.330> through<00:05:01.510> clever<00:05:01.720> maneuvering<00:05:02.380> you

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
win but through clever maneuvering you

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.860 
win but through clever maneuvering you
can<00:05:03.310> move<00:05:03.460> into<00:05:03.729> positions<00:05:04.180> get<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.539> tiles

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
can move into positions get the tiles

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.210 
can move into positions get the tiles
suddenly<00:05:05.380> kill<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.620> few<00:05:05.770> of<00:05:05.830> their<00:05:05.979> pieces

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
suddenly kill a few of their pieces

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.700 
suddenly kill a few of their pieces
surround<00:05:07.060> a<00:05:07.150> few<00:05:07.330> more<00:05:07.539> and<00:05:07.720> come<00:05:07.900> back<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.380> has

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
surround a few more and come back it has

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.890 
surround a few more and come back it has
some<00:05:08.889> very<00:05:09.130> interesting<00:05:09.520> mechanics<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.270> going

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
some very interesting mechanics of going

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.680 
some very interesting mechanics of going
back<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.289> forth<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.490> idea<00:05:13.449> that<00:05:13.510> the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
back and forth the the idea that the

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.240 
back and forth the the idea that the
board<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:13.990> shrinking<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.560> kind<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.800> force<00:05:15.070> on

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
board is shrinking is kind of force on

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.560 
board is shrinking is kind of force on
this<00:05:15.340> but<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.550> like<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:15.910> way<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:16.090> works<00:05:16.270> here

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
this but I like the way it works here

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.879 
this but I like the way it works here
there's<00:05:16.720> another<00:05:17.470> game<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:17.680> there's

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
there's another game that there's

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.370 
there's another game that there's
something<00:05:18.010> similar<00:05:18.400> call<00:05:18.610> desserts<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.900> I

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
something similar call desserts and I

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.980 
something similar call desserts and I
feel<00:05:21.099> like<00:05:21.220> this<00:05:21.460> does<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:21.820> much<00:05:22.180> better<00:05:22.630> and

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
feel like this does it much better and

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.779 
feel like this does it much better and
is<00:05:23.260> a<00:05:23.289> little<00:05:23.500> bit<00:05:23.710> easier<00:05:24.099> to<00:05:24.159> comprehend

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
is a little bit easier to comprehend

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.550 
is a little bit easier to comprehend
this<00:05:24.909> is<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.120> game<00:05:25.270> that's<00:05:25.419> not<00:05:25.720> difficult<00:05:26.139> to

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
this is a game that's not difficult to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.469 
this is a game that's not difficult to
understand<00:05:27.130> there<00:05:27.789> was<00:05:27.880> just<00:05:27.909> a<00:05:28.090> few<00:05:28.300> simple

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
understand there was just a few simple

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.149 
understand there was just a few simple
rules<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.080> rule<00:05:29.229> book<00:05:29.380> lays<00:05:29.590> out<00:05:29.740> exactly

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
rules the rule book lays out exactly

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.250 
rules the rule book lays out exactly
what<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:30.430> can<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.760> cannot<00:05:31.030> do<00:05:31.270> with<00:05:31.930> all<00:05:32.110> your

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
what you can and cannot do with all your

what you can and cannot do with all your

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
different movements and there's a few

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.270 
different movements and there's a few
minor<00:05:34.510> exceptions<00:05:34.780> about<00:05:35.620> removing<00:05:36.190> the

minor exceptions about removing the

minor exceptions about removing the
