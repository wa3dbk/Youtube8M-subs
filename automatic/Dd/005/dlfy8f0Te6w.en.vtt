from the veterinarian that the semen

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.139 
from the veterinarian that the semen
quality<00:02:07.259> might<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> little<00:02:08.369> bit<00:02:08.580> below<00:02:08.849> what

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
quality might be a little bit below what

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
quality might be a little bit below what
we'd<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.739> probably<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
we'd like to have that's probably not a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.550 
we'd like to have that's probably not a
reason<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.760> call<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.209> bull<00:02:12.420> way<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
reason to call the bull way to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.550 
reason to call the bull way to
few<00:02:13.770> weeks<00:02:14.069> test<00:02:14.819> him<00:02:15.030> again<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.230> really

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
few weeks test him again and you really

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.750 
few weeks test him again and you really
probably<00:02:16.739> want<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.099> test<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.640> these

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
probably want to test some of these

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640 
probably want to test some of these

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
bulls if you're going to use them again
