00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
talk about specifically you know what

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.580 
talk about specifically you know what
does<00:00:19.199> Andy<00:00:19.770> need<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:21.240> win<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.990> match

now<00:00:23.449> you<00:00:24.449> know<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.109> margin<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.470> gonna

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
now you know I think the margin is gonna

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.920 
now you know I think the margin is gonna
be<00:00:25.769> razor<00:00:26.070> thin<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:27.029> when<00:00:27.180> these<00:00:27.269> guys<00:00:27.480> play

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
be razor thin here when these guys play

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.050 
be razor thin here when these guys play
it's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.800> couple<00:00:29.130> points<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it's a couple points here and there that

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.080 
it's a couple points here and there that
really<00:00:30.240> decide<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> thing<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.940> there's<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
really decide the thing so there's the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
really decide the thing so there's the
obvious<00:00:33.239> stuff<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.170> out<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
obvious stuff let's get that out of the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
obvious stuff let's get that out of the
way<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.800> first<00:00:35.040> serve<00:00:35.280> percentage<00:00:35.910> for

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
way like first serve percentage for

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.049 
way like first serve percentage for
example<00:00:36.680> if<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:38.010> guy<00:00:38.190> serves<00:00:38.520> significantly

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
example if one guy serves significantly

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.610 
example if one guy serves significantly
better<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> other<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:40.260> gonna<00:00:40.440> be

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
better than the other that's gonna be

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.810 
better than the other that's gonna be
the<00:00:40.739> difference<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> match<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.640> let's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the difference in the match but let's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.900 
the difference in the match but let's
just<00:00:41.969> assume<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:43.250> both<00:00:44.250> these<00:00:44.430> guys<00:00:44.610> bring

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
just assume that both these guys bring

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.510 
just assume that both these guys bring
their<00:00:45.090> a-game<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.930> they're<00:00:46.890> both<00:00:47.010> serving

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
their a-game and they're both serving

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.650 
their a-game and they're both serving
well<00:00:48.020> what<00:00:49.020> exchange<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> think<00:00:50.940> will

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
well what exchange do I think will

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.000 
well what exchange do I think will
really<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> big<00:00:52.379> difference<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
really make a big difference and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.819 
really make a big difference and
specifically<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.270> Andy<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.739> in

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
specifically for Andy now if we get in

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.389 
specifically for Andy now if we get in
the<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.100> machine<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:58.260> back<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.859> year<00:00:58.890> from

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the time machine and go back a year from

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.290 
the time machine and go back a year from
a<00:00:59.760> year<00:01:00.539> ago<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.920> Roger<00:01:02.489> Federer<00:01:03.030> up

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a year ago and we put Roger Federer up

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.050 
a year ago and we put Roger Federer up
here<00:01:03.769> what<00:01:04.769> Roger<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.430> did<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
here what Roger really did you know that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
here what Roger really did you know that
was<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.240> interesting<00:01:06.479> match<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
was an interesting match because the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.620 
was an interesting match because the
roof<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.820> open<00:01:09.270> Andy<00:01:10.229> won<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> first<00:01:10.950> set<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
roof was open Andy won the first set and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.000 
roof was open Andy won the first set and
then<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.229> rain<00:01:13.439> delay<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> roof

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
then there was that rain delay the roof

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
then there was that rain delay the roof
got<00:01:14.189> closed<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.939> then<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.180> kind<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.420> became<00:01:15.659> an

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
got closed and then it kind of became an

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.990 
got closed and then it kind of became an
indoor<00:01:16.110> court<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.619> Roger<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> flipped

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

good old backhand to backhand exchange
like<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:39.360> Roger<00:01:40.290> would<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.100> he

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
like this and what Roger would do is he

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.539 
like this and what Roger would do is he

would slice the ball down the line he
would<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:44.909> Andy<00:01:45.570> hitting<00:01:45.899> somewhere<00:01:46.439> over

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the forehand for for the sake of

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.740 
the forehand for for the sake of
argument<00:02:01.979> cuz<00:02:02.250> Andy<00:02:02.790> did<00:02:02.939> hit<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> lot<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> them

cross-court<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.939> well<00:02:05.939> Roger<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.509> then

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
cross-court here well Roger would then

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.160 
cross-court here well Roger would then
do<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.610> he's<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.819> Andy<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.599> position<00:02:09.989> so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
do is he's got Andy out of position so

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.500 
do is he's got Andy out of position so
he<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.679> do<00:02:11.129> something<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.760> push

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
he can really do something like push

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.809 
he can really do something like push
and<00:02:13.629> II<00:02:14.200> deep<00:02:14.530> into<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.099> corner<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.519> what

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
and II deep into the corner and what

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.289 
and II deep into the corner and what
that<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.150> achieving<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.959> it's<00:02:17.500> getting<00:02:17.799> Andy

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
that is achieving is it's getting Andy

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.750 
that is achieving is it's getting Andy
retreating<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:20.170> hit<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.650> backhand<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.549> we<00:02:21.610> all

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
retreating to hit a backhand and we all

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.910 
retreating to hit a backhand and we all
we<00:02:21.970> all<00:02:22.000> know<00:02:22.120> how<00:02:22.480> hard<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.019> if<00:02:23.440> you're

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
we all know how hard that is if you're

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.440 
we all know how hard that is if you're
moving<00:02:24.280> back<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.849> try<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.299> hit<00:02:25.420> a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
moving back and you try and hit a

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.229 
moving back and you try and hit a
backhand<00:02:26.190> you're<00:02:27.190> not<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.730> stick<00:02:28.000> it

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
backhand you're not going to stick it

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.350 
backhand you're not going to stick it
you're<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.569> set<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.879> that<00:02:30.879> was<00:02:31.090> really

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
you're not set and that was really

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.780 
you're not set and that was really
effective<00:02:32.019> for<00:02:32.049> for<00:02:32.920> Roger<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.519> allowed

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
effective for for Roger and that allowed

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.699 
effective for for Roger and that allowed
him<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.060> get<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.690> driver's<00:02:34.930> seat<00:02:35.230> Andy's

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
him to get in the driver's seat Andy's

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.610 
him to get in the driver's seat Andy's
retreating<00:02:36.670> here<00:02:37.000> he<00:02:37.540> hits<00:02:37.810> he<00:02:38.349> hits<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
retreating here he hits he hits a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.800 
retreating here he hits he hits a
backhand<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.940> little<00:02:40.299> short<00:02:40.599> doesn't

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
backhand it's a little short doesn't

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.750 
backhand it's a little short doesn't
have<00:02:41.049> quite<00:02:41.230> as<00:02:41.319> much<00:02:41.590> stick<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.129> Roger<00:02:42.489> can

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
have quite as much stick and Roger can

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.110 
have quite as much stick and Roger can
step<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.329> and<00:02:43.510> really<00:02:44.140> be<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.379> control<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
step in and really be in control of of

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.970 
step in and really be in control of of
the<00:02:46.690> point<00:02:46.930> there<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.379> then<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.560> course<00:02:47.799> going

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the point there and then of course going

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.979 
the point there and then of course going
back<00:02:48.099> cross-court<00:02:48.879> you<00:02:48.940> know<00:02:49.060> if<00:02:49.180> if<00:02:49.540> Andy's

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
back cross-court you know if if Andy's

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.539 
back cross-court you know if if Andy's
over<00:02:50.230> here<00:02:50.379> hitting<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.769> forehand<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.489> now

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
over here hitting a forehand and now

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.330 
over here hitting a forehand and now
he's<00:02:51.700> retreating<00:02:52.030> back<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:52.720> then<00:02:53.230> Roger<00:02:54.010> goes

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
he's retreating back and then Roger goes

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.069 
he's retreating back and then Roger goes
over<00:02:54.579> here<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:54.849> then<00:02:55.030> he<00:02:55.120> has<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.299> stop<00:02:55.780> and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
over here and then he has to stop and

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.830 
over here and then he has to stop and
change<00:02:56.290> direction<00:02:57.030> moving<00:02:58.030> backwards<00:02:58.569> and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
change direction moving backwards and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.990 
change direction moving backwards and
then<00:02:59.019> setting<00:02:59.920> yourself<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.549> changing

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
then setting yourself and changing

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.930 
then setting yourself and changing
directions<00:03:01.209> that's<00:03:01.720> difficult<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:03.849> know

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
directions that's difficult so you know

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.520 
directions that's difficult so you know
I<00:03:04.090> think<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.019> be<00:03:05.140> really

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
I think this is going to be really

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.309 
I think this is going to be really
effective<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.489> really<00:03:06.970> effective<00:03:07.239> play<00:03:07.720> for

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
effective a really effective play for

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.140 
effective a really effective play for
Andy<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.950> use<00:03:09.480> against<00:03:10.739> Novak<00:03:11.819> alright<00:03:12.819> so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
Andy to use against Novak alright so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.289 
Andy to use against Novak alright so
we'd<00:03:13.299> have<00:03:13.379> from<00:03:14.379> this<00:03:14.560> perspective<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
we'd have from this perspective the

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.890 
we'd have from this perspective the
backhand<00:03:16.810> back<00:03:17.079> in<00:03:17.349> exchange<00:03:18.690> Andy's<00:03:19.690> gonna

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
backhand back in exchange Andy's gonna

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.159 
backhand back in exchange Andy's gonna
leave<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.470> little<00:03:20.889> bit<00:03:21.400> short<00:03:21.910> slice<00:03:22.840> keep

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
leave it a little bit short slice keep

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.460 
leave it a little bit short slice keep
it<00:03:23.319> low<00:03:23.500> pull<00:03:24.400> Novak<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.180> get<00:03:25.540> them<00:03:25.630> inside<00:03:26.260> the

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
it low pull Novak in get them inside the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.069 
it low pull Novak in get them inside the
baseline<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.340> then<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.120> next<00:03:28.480> shot<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.750> gonna

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
baseline and then the next shot is gonna

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.979 
baseline and then the next shot is gonna
be<00:03:29.380> deep<00:03:30.030> probably<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> backhand<00:03:31.660> you

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
be deep probably to the backhand you

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.509 
be deep probably to the backhand you
know<00:03:32.349> that's<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:33.040> what<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.340> would

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
know that's that's what I would

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.210 
know that's that's what I would
recommend<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.299> go<00:03:34.930> deep<00:03:35.260> deep<00:03:35.889> to<00:03:36.099> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
recommend is is go deep deep to the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.949 
recommend is is go deep deep to the
backhand<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.880> really<00:03:37.120> try<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.389> get<00:03:37.540> Novak

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
backhand and really try and get Novak

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.710 
backhand and really try and get Novak
retreating<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.790> hitting<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.209> back<00:03:40.329> in<00:03:40.569> and

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
retreating and hitting it back in and

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.270 
retreating and hitting it back in and
the<00:03:40.780> reason<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.139> think<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.590> an<00:03:41.889> effective

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
the reason I think this is an effective

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.990 
the reason I think this is an effective
play<00:03:42.459> against<00:03:42.849> Djokovic<00:03:43.329> is<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:45.609> know<00:03:45.730> both

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
play against Djokovic is you know both

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.089 
play against Djokovic is you know both
these<00:03:46.269> guys<00:03:46.480> are<00:03:46.840> unbelievable

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
these guys are unbelievable

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.400 
these guys are unbelievable
defenders<00:03:48.849> right<00:03:49.150> you've<00:03:49.599> seen<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:50.079> many<00:03:50.169> I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
defenders right you've seen so many I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.900 
defenders right you've seen so many I
mean<00:03:50.560> it's<00:03:51.010> interesting<00:03:51.250> with<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.609> semies

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
mean it's interesting with the semies

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.479 
mean it's interesting with the semies
for<00:03:52.120> example<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.599> had<00:03:52.810> del<00:03:53.290> Potro<00:03:53.769> that<00:03:54.370> was

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
for example you had del Potro that was

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.740 
for example you had del Potro that was
five<00:03:54.700> sets<00:03:54.970> with<00:03:55.500> with<00:03:56.500> Novak<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.099> you<00:03:57.280> had

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
five sets with with Novak and you had

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.990 
five sets with with Novak and you had
Jerzy<00:03:58.750> Janowicz<00:03:59.560> Janowicz<00:04:00.190> something<00:04:00.849> like

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
Jerzy Janowicz Janowicz something like

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.690 
Jerzy Janowicz Janowicz something like
that<00:04:01.230> against<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.620> should<00:04:03.010> know<00:04:03.160> my<00:04:03.370> friend

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
that against I should know my friend

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.580 
that against I should know my friend
actually<00:04:03.879> represents<00:04:04.510> him<00:04:04.660> but<00:04:04.900> still

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
actually represents him but still

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.059 
actually represents him but still
working<00:04:05.769> on<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.010> but<00:04:07.019> Jersey<00:04:08.019> versus<00:04:08.470> Andy<00:04:08.859> now

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
working on it but Jersey versus Andy now

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.580 
working on it but Jersey versus Andy now
both<00:04:09.370> those<00:04:09.639> guys<00:04:09.849> big<00:04:10.480> guys<00:04:10.720> hard<00:04:11.290> hitters

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
both those guys big guys hard hitters

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.539 
both those guys big guys hard hitters
very<00:04:11.829> similar<00:04:12.310> players<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:15.160> know<00:04:15.280> one<00:04:15.459> of

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
very similar players and you know one of

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.129 
very similar players and you know one of
the<00:04:15.609> reasons<00:04:15.940> both<00:04:16.060> Andy<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.660> Novak<00:04:16.959> were

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
the reasons both Andy and Novak were

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.680 
the reasons both Andy and Novak were
able<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.349> win<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.680> match<00:04:17.919> is<00:04:18.190> B<00:04:18.370> is<00:04:18.690> because

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
able to win that match is B is because

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.350 
able to win that match is B is because
they<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.199> take<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.650> shot<00:04:21.039> after<00:04:21.340> shot<00:04:21.609> blow

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
they can take a shot after shot blow

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.170 
they can take a shot after shot blow
after<00:04:22.630> blow<00:04:22.840> huge<00:04:23.650> ground<00:04:24.039> stroke<00:04:24.400> after<00:04:24.849> huge

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
after blow huge ground stroke after huge

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.700 
after blow huge ground stroke after huge
ground<00:04:25.570> stroke<00:04:26.020> you

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
ground stroke you

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.800 
ground stroke you
because<00:04:26.889> they<00:04:27.280> are<00:04:27.460> excellent<00:04:27.910> lateral

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
because they are excellent lateral

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.740 
because they are excellent lateral
defenders<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:30.669> in<00:04:30.759> other<00:04:30.910> words<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.389> know<00:04:31.690> you

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
defenders so in other words you know you

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.170 
defenders so in other words you know you
see<00:04:31.990> Novak<00:04:32.530> for<00:04:33.130> example<00:04:33.460> all<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.669> time<00:04:33.850> going

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
see Novak for example all the time going

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.230 
see Novak for example all the time going
side<00:04:34.449> to<00:04:34.479> side<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.740> he<00:04:36.340> gets<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.759> ball<00:04:37.000> and

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
side to side and he gets to the ball and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.809 
side to side and he gets to the ball and
he<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.539> hits<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.840> great<00:04:38.139> shot<00:04:38.800> back<00:04:39.430> deep

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
he just hits a great shot back deep

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.570 
he just hits a great shot back deep
right<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:41.199> doesn't<00:04:41.710> matter<00:04:41.800> how<00:04:41.889> big<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.370> is

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
right so it doesn't matter how big it is

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.969 
right so it doesn't matter how big it is
the<00:04:43.240> other<00:04:43.449> guy<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:44.080> never<00:04:44.319> able<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.710> really

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
the other guy is never able to really

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.820 
the other guy is never able to really
move<00:04:45.220> forward<00:04:45.280> step<00:04:46.060> up<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.590> get<00:04:47.590> some

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
move forward step up and get some

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.400 
move forward step up and get some
lateral<00:04:48.220> court<00:04:48.610> positioning<00:04:49.150> too<00:04:49.990> good<00:04:50.229> of<00:04:50.349> a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
lateral court positioning too good of a

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.270 
lateral court positioning too good of a
defender<00:04:50.740> both<00:04:50.889> guys<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:52.410> what<00:04:53.410> Andy<00:04:53.830> needs<00:04:54.069> to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
defender both guys so what Andy needs to

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.520 
defender both guys so what Andy needs to
do<00:04:54.520> if<00:04:54.789> you<00:04:54.940> can<00:04:55.090> actually<00:04:55.240> get<00:04:55.569> Novak<00:04:56.110> moving

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
do if you can actually get Novak moving

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.430 
do if you can actually get Novak moving
in<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.979> then<00:04:57.099> force<00:04:57.669> force<00:04:58.419> Novak<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.080> defend

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
in and then force force Novak to defend

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.770 
in and then force force Novak to defend
by<00:04:59.590> backing<00:05:00.130> up<00:05:00.310> then<00:05:01.240> it's<00:05:01.509> way<00:05:01.750> more

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
by backing up then it's way more

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.689 
by backing up then it's way more
difficult<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.560> get<00:05:02.710> stick<00:05:03.009> on<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.310> ball<00:05:03.490> when

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
difficult to get stick on the ball when

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.820 
difficult to get stick on the ball when
you're<00:05:03.820> backing<00:05:04.120> up<00:05:04.479> right<00:05:04.840> your<00:05:05.380> momentum<00:05:05.770> is

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
you're backing up right your momentum is

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.379 
you're backing up right your momentum is
carrying<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.250> backwards<00:05:06.759> versus<00:05:07.090> being<00:05:07.270> able

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
carrying you backwards versus being able

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.710 
carrying you backwards versus being able
to<00:05:07.539> plant<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.110> move<00:05:08.440> sideways<00:05:09.240> then<00:05:10.240> there's

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
to plant and move sideways then there's

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.930 
to plant and move sideways then there's
a<00:05:10.780> better<00:05:10.960> chance<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.590> think<00:05:11.620> of<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.759> ball

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
a better chance I think of the ball

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.760 
a better chance I think of the ball
being<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.270> little<00:05:13.660> bit<00:05:13.810> shorter<00:05:14.289> maybe<00:05:14.530> not

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
being a little bit shorter maybe not

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.520 
being a little bit shorter maybe not
having<00:05:15.009> quite<00:05:15.250> as<00:05:15.520> much<00:05:15.729> on<00:05:15.970> it<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.360> then<00:05:17.050> Andy

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
having quite as much on it and then Andy

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.969 
having quite as much on it and then Andy
can<00:05:17.979> step<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:19.470> he<00:05:20.470> can<00:05:20.650> be<00:05:20.800> more

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
can step in and he can be more

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.409 
can step in and he can be more
aggressive<00:05:21.099> right<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:21.699> instead<00:05:21.820> of<00:05:22.000> trying<00:05:22.330> to

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
aggressive right so instead of trying to

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.270 
aggressive right so instead of trying to
rip<00:05:22.720> big<00:05:23.020> Brown<00:05:23.289> short<00:05:23.560> from<00:05:23.740> behind<00:05:24.009> the<00:05:24.130> base

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
rip big Brown short from behind the base

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.240 
rip big Brown short from behind the base
line<00:05:24.550> just<00:05:25.389> those<00:05:25.569> couple<00:05:25.810> extra<00:05:26.259> feet<00:05:26.530> make

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
line just those couple extra feet make

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.219 
line just those couple extra feet make
all<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.580> difference<00:05:28.000> right<00:05:28.240> ball<00:05:28.840> gets<00:05:29.110> on

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
all the difference right ball gets on

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.719 
all the difference right ball gets on
top<00:05:29.380> of<00:05:29.560> Novak<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:29.949> little<00:05:30.220> bit<00:05:30.340> quicker<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
top of Novak a little bit quicker the

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.999 
top of Novak a little bit quicker the
angles<00:05:31.180> are<00:05:31.330> opened<00:05:31.630> up<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.139> I<00:05:32.409> think<00:05:32.680> that's

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
angles are opened up and I think that's

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.899 
angles are opened up and I think that's
the<00:05:33.280> way<00:05:33.509> that<00:05:34.509> that<00:05:35.259> Andy<00:05:35.650> can<00:05:36.009> can<00:05:36.639> beat

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
the way that that Andy can can beat

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.749 
the way that that Andy can can beat
Novak<00:05:37.360> here<00:05:37.659> so<00:05:38.099> you<00:05:39.099> know<00:05:39.220> obviously<00:05:39.340> that

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
Novak here so you know obviously that

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.279 
Novak here so you know obviously that
would<00:05:39.909> work<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.419> strategy<00:05:40.690> would<00:05:40.960> work<00:05:41.110> for

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
would work that strategy would work for

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.680 
would work that strategy would work for
Novak<00:05:41.590> as<00:05:41.830> well<00:05:42.009> because<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.580> Roger<00:05:43.150> used<00:05:43.509> it

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
Novak as well because it Roger used it

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.689 
Novak as well because it Roger used it
effectively<00:05:43.900> against<00:05:44.620> Andy<00:05:44.860> last<00:05:45.070> year<00:05:45.340> but<00:05:45.490> I

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
effectively against Andy last year but I

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.180 
effectively against Andy last year but I
think<00:05:46.150> that's<00:05:46.389> um<00:05:46.750> that's<00:05:47.620> what<00:05:47.889> I<00:05:47.919> would<00:05:48.099> be

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
think that's um that's what I would be

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.860 
think that's um that's what I would be
looking<00:05:48.490> for<00:05:48.729> in<00:05:48.909> this<00:05:49.060> in<00:05:49.270> this<00:05:49.419> match<00:05:49.630> is<00:05:49.840> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
looking for in this in this match is the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.189 
looking for in this in this match is the
slice<00:05:50.380> pull<00:05:51.280> a<00:05:51.310> guy<00:05:51.550> in<00:05:51.789> then<00:05:52.360> go<00:05:52.630> deep<00:05:52.930> and

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
slice pull a guy in then go deep and

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.170 
slice pull a guy in then go deep and
hard<00:05:53.979> with<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.250> next<00:05:54.490> shot<00:05:54.699> so<00:05:54.909> they<00:05:54.969> have<00:05:55.090> to

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
hard with the next shot so they have to

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.149 
hard with the next shot so they have to
back<00:05:55.360> up<00:05:55.599> and<00:05:55.780> defend<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.229> that's<00:05:56.800> how<00:05:56.979> you're

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
back up and defend and that's how you're

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.439 
back up and defend and that's how you're
gonna<00:05:57.250> get<00:05:57.430> some<00:05:57.610> short<00:05:57.849> Bowls<00:05:58.060> where<00:05:58.270> you<00:05:58.330> can

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
gonna get some short Bowls where you can

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.230 
gonna get some short Bowls where you can
move<00:05:58.599> in<00:05:58.979> so<00:05:59.979> that's<00:06:00.370> the<00:06:00.639> you<00:06:00.940> know<00:06:01.030> all<00:06:01.210> the

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
move in so that's the you know all the

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.390 
move in so that's the you know all the
other<00:06:01.360> things<00:06:01.449> being<00:06:01.750> equal<00:06:01.870> playing<00:06:02.860> well<00:06:03.159> I

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
other things being equal playing well I

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.610 
other things being equal playing well I
think<00:06:03.699> an<00:06:04.000> exchange<00:06:04.360> like<00:06:04.449> that<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:05.050> in<00:06:05.199> the

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
think an exchange like that and in the

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.320 
think an exchange like that and in the
lateral<00:06:05.949> positioning<00:06:06.610> moving<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:06.969> guy<00:06:07.060> four

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
lateral positioning moving the guy four

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.930 
lateral positioning moving the guy four
and<00:06:07.449> back<00:06:07.539> is<00:06:07.750> gonna<00:06:07.870> make<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.139> difference<00:06:08.169> so

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
and back is gonna make the difference so

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.490 
and back is gonna make the difference so
expect<00:06:09.940> a<00:06:10.000> great<00:06:10.180> match<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.780> conditions<00:06:11.050> are

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
expect a great match the conditions are

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.399 
expect a great match the conditions are
supposed<00:06:12.009> to<00:06:12.070> be<00:06:12.190> very<00:06:12.520> hot<00:06:12.759> sunny<00:06:13.479> not<00:06:14.229> too

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:14.409 
supposed to be very hot sunny not too

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.159 
supposed to be very hot sunny not too
much<00:06:14.560> wind<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.340> I<00:06:15.789> don't<00:06:16.780> think<00:06:16.930> you'll<00:06:17.020> see

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
much wind so I don't think you'll see

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.379 
much wind so I don't think you'll see
the<00:06:17.259> elements<00:06:17.710> wreaking<00:06:18.099> havoc<00:06:18.490> like<00:06:19.240> they

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
the elements wreaking havoc like they

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.939 
the elements wreaking havoc like they
did<00:06:19.539> at<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.719> US<00:06:19.990> Open<00:06:20.349> when<00:06:20.500> these<00:06:20.620> two<00:06:20.770> guys

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
did at the US Open when these two guys

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.610 
did at the US Open when these two guys
played<00:06:21.280> and<00:06:21.580> frankly<00:06:22.300> that<00:06:22.449> means<00:06:22.810> I<00:06:23.080> believe

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
played and frankly that means I believe

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.560 
played and frankly that means I believe
it<00:06:23.740> vanished<00:06:24.039> Djokovic<00:06:24.490> because<00:06:24.909> Djokovic<00:06:25.449> is

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
it vanished Djokovic because Djokovic is

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.240 
it vanished Djokovic because Djokovic is
very<00:06:25.719> much<00:06:25.900> a<00:06:25.990> rhythm<00:06:26.259> player<00:06:26.530> so<00:06:26.860> if<00:06:26.979> the<00:06:27.099> ball

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
very much a rhythm player so if the ball

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.939 
very much a rhythm player so if the ball
is<00:06:27.370> not<00:06:27.490> dancing<00:06:27.940> around<00:06:28.060> as<00:06:28.509> much<00:06:29.199> choke<00:06:29.800> of

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
is not dancing around as much choke of

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.060 
is not dancing around as much choke of
his<00:06:30.070> that<00:06:30.880> helps<00:06:31.150> Djokovic<00:06:31.599> but<00:06:31.900> that<00:06:32.800> said

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
his that helps Djokovic but that said

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.399 
his that helps Djokovic but that said
