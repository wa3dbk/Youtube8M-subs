00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
um as you can see it's come up quite

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.469 
um as you can see it's come up quite
nicely

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
nicely

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.959 
nicely
um<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.469> is<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> bit<00:01:28.860> hard<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:33.020> get<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
um it is a bit hard to get to the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.240 
um it is a bit hard to get to the
manifold<00:01:35.969> connection<00:01:36.479> but<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:38.039> bear<00:01:38.219> with

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
manifold connection but just bear with

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.090 
manifold connection but just bear with
it<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.060> center<00:01:39.890> or<00:01:40.890> two

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it and the one in the center or two

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.050 
it and the one in the center or two
which<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:41.880> center

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
which you're gonna be in the center

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.169 
which you're gonna be in the center
gonna<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.869> big<00:01:43.619> hard<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.369> which<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
gonna be a big hard to get to which you

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.789 
gonna be a big hard to get to which you
don't<00:01:45.390> really<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.869> too<00:01:46.109> much<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.679> go

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
don't really see too much but if we go

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
don't really see too much but if we go
around<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.159> other<00:01:47.250> side<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.299> see<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
around the other side you can see the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.840 
around the other side you can see the
difference<00:01:52.020> between<00:01:53.359> the<00:01:55.280> between<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.609> pipes

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
difference between the between the pipes

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.370 
difference between the between the pipes
I've<00:01:57.119> done<00:01:57.240> those<00:01:57.390> who<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.780> done<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
I've done those who have done the I

I've done those who have done the I
haven't<00:01:59.340> been<00:01:59.549> round<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.969> side<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:01.409> polish

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
haven't been round this side to polish

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.810 
haven't been round this side to polish
it<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.310> still<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:04.369> haven't<00:02:05.369> touched<00:02:05.520> these

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it so it's still I haven't touched these

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.740 
it so it's still I haven't touched these
two<00:02:07.130> I've<00:02:08.130> done<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.460> one<00:02:08.700> looked<00:02:09.600> about

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
two I've done this one looked about

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.850 
two I've done this one looked about
there<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.080> want<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.320> come<00:02:10.470> around<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.800> side

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
there I want to come around this side

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.110 
there I want to come around this side
and<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.480> doing<00:02:12.480> here<00:02:12.720> now<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.920> top<00:02:14.880> halves

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and do doing here now it's top halves

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and do doing here now it's top halves
which<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.840> lot<00:02:16.770> harder<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.490> see

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
which are a lot harder but you can see

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.979 
which are a lot harder but you can see
see<00:02:19.140> what<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.830> not<00:02:20.010> too<00:02:20.160> bad<00:02:20.930> but

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
see what I like is not too bad but

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.740 
see what I like is not too bad but
can<00:02:23.500> look<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.739> lot<00:02:23.890> better<00:02:25.560> let's<00:02:26.560> give<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.890> go

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
can look a lot better let's give it a go

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.670 
can look a lot better let's give it a go
there<00:02:28.750> we<00:02:28.870> go<00:02:29.050> all<00:02:29.830> polished<00:02:30.370> out<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:32.140> run

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
there we go all polished out and I run

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.380 
there we go all polished out and I run
out<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.830> time<00:02:33.099> I've<00:02:33.430> got<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.060> go<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.180> work

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
out of time I've got to go to work

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.280 
out of time I've got to go to work
unfortunately<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:37.690> like<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> done<00:02:38.170> it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
unfortunately so I would like to done it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.860 
unfortunately so I would like to done it
a<00:02:38.349> little<00:02:38.560> bit<00:02:38.769> better<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:40.420> come<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:40.660> quite

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
a little bit better it's come up quite

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.990 
a little bit better it's come up quite
well<00:02:42.120> see<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.360> was<00:02:43.480> probably<00:02:43.780> about<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.970> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
well see that was probably about one of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.220 
well see that was probably about one of
the<00:02:46.150> worst<00:02:46.590> near<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.709> manifold<00:02:48.989> awfully<00:02:49.989> hard

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
the worst near the manifold awfully hard

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.860 
the worst near the manifold awfully hard
to<00:02:50.349> get<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> one<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.030> center<00:02:52.299> so

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
to get to the one in the center so

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.809 
to get to the one in the center so
unless<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.650> want<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.860> take<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.220> off<00:02:54.370> when<00:02:54.700> you

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
unless you want to take it off when you

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.470 
unless you want to take it off when you
set<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> new<00:02:56.019> new<00:02:56.590> pet<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:57.340> new<00:02:57.970> set<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.360> pipes<00:03:00.480> or

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
set a new new pet a new set of pipes or

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.059 
set a new new pet a new set of pipes or
if<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.780> can<00:03:01.900> bothered<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.380> do<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.769> can't

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
if you can bothered to do it I can't

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.400 
if you can bothered to do it I can't
really<00:03:03.310> at<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.579> moment<00:03:03.970> maybe<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.349> the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
really at the moment maybe do it in the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.119 
really at the moment maybe do it in the
winter<00:03:05.970> but<00:03:06.970> yeah<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.209> comes<00:03:07.390> up<00:03:07.569> quite<00:03:07.810> nicely

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
winter but yeah it comes up quite nicely

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.880 
winter but yeah it comes up quite nicely
the<00:03:09.129> worst<00:03:09.730> was<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.720> centre<00:03:11.230> pipe<00:03:11.440> where<00:03:11.769> it's

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
the worst was the centre pipe where it's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.130 
the worst was the centre pipe where it's
pitted<00:03:12.220> obviously<00:03:12.549> all<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.790> crap<00:03:13.090> which<00:03:13.900> gets

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
pitted obviously all the crap which gets

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.009 
pitted obviously all the crap which gets
thrown<00:03:14.379> up<00:03:14.560> from<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.860> cinder<00:03:15.190> wheel<00:03:16.019> there

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
thrown up from the cinder wheel there

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.920 
thrown up from the cinder wheel there
it's<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.319> little<00:03:17.560> bit<00:03:17.879> little<00:03:18.879> bit<00:03:19.060> pitted<00:03:19.810> you

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
it's a little bit little bit pitted you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.300 
it's a little bit little bit pitted you
can't<00:03:20.140> really<00:03:20.319> see<00:03:20.530> too<00:03:20.709> much<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:23.310> around

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
can't really see too much but around

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.379 
can't really see too much but around
this<00:03:24.519> side<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.880> we<00:03:28.000> go

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
this side and there we go

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.400 
this side and there we go
not<00:03:28.930> bad<00:03:29.139> job<00:03:29.410> took<00:03:29.709> about<00:03:30.660> about<00:03:31.660> two<00:03:31.959> hours<00:03:32.139> I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
not bad job took about about two hours I

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.500 
not bad job took about about two hours I
suppose<00:03:32.680> bit<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.010> elbow<00:03:33.160> grease<00:03:33.459> could<00:03:34.389> do

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
suppose bit of elbow grease could do

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.190 
suppose bit of elbow grease could do
with<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:35.459> bit<00:03:36.459> better<00:03:36.670> job<00:03:36.940> again<00:03:37.209> in<00:03:38.109> a

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
with a bit better job again in a

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.289 
with a bit better job again in a
manifold<00:03:38.620> there<00:03:38.859> but<00:03:39.190> as<00:03:39.639> I<00:03:39.760> said<00:03:39.819> haven't<00:03:40.150> got

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
manifold there but as I said haven't got

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.900 
manifold there but as I said haven't got
too<00:03:40.510> much<00:03:40.660> time<00:03:40.959> but<00:03:41.139> there<00:03:41.290> we<00:03:41.410> go

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
too much time but there we go

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.800 
too much time but there we go
how<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> clean<00:03:43.810> your<00:03:43.840> pipes<00:03:44.410> um<00:03:45.599> easily<00:03:46.599> with

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
how to clean your pipes um easily with

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.809 
how to clean your pipes um easily with
rag<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.410> bit<00:03:47.680> also<00:03:47.859> so<00:03:48.329> an<00:03:49.329> elbow<00:03:49.660> grease<00:03:50.819> thanks

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
rag a bit also so an elbow grease thanks

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:00.059 
rag a bit also so an elbow grease thanks
very<00:03:52.000> much
