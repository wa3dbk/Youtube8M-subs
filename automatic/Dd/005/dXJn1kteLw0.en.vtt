computer<00:00:50.129> besides<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.969> chorus<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> 975<00:00:51.960> well

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
computer besides the chorus of 975 well

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.610 
computer besides the chorus of 975 well
it<00:00:52.980> does<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.399> intel<00:00:54.059> SSD<00:00:54.600> technology<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> has
