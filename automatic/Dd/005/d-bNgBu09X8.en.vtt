artifice<00:03:29.970> deck<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.329> some<00:03:30.480> reason<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.780> don't

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
artifice deck for some reason I don't

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.360 
artifice deck for some reason I don't
know<00:03:30.930> why<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.470> nothing<00:03:31.799> like<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.159> art<00:03:32.190> of

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
know why it's nothing like the art of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.559 
know why it's nothing like the art of
his<00:03:32.489> deck<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.720> feel<00:03:34.290> already<00:03:35.569> the

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
his deck just the feel already the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.629 
his deck just the feel already the
overall<00:03:36.900> design<00:03:37.829> feels<00:03:38.900> feels<00:03:39.900> really<00:03:40.319> good

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
overall design feels feels really good

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.690 
overall design feels feels really good
we<00:03:41.639> have<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.510> octopus<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.439> don't<00:03:44.069> think

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
we have the octopus I don't think

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.460 
we have the octopus I don't think
there's<00:03:45.060> any<00:03:45.269> reveal<00:03:46.189> in<00:03:47.189> here<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:49.290> there's

unique<00:04:04.019> playing<00:04:04.440> cards<00:04:04.829> visit<00:04:05.190> illusionists

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
unique playing cards visit illusionists

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.939 
unique playing cards visit illusionists
not<00:04:06.120> to<00:04:06.299> come<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:07.019> has<00:04:07.139> it<00:04:07.260> back<00:04:07.379> on<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.799> I

don't know mm-hmm
he's<00:04:09.930> after<00:04:10.139> some<00:04:10.349> kind<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.650> effect<00:04:11.810> we<00:04:12.810> can

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
he's after some kind of effect we can

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.240 
he's after some kind of effect we can
trash<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.669> trash<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.879> front

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.700 

we<00:04:17.880> have<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:20.640> ace<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:21.420> spades<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.230> love<00:04:22.500> that

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
we have the ace of spades I love that

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.580 
we have the ace of spades I love that
design<00:04:23.480> for<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.600> Spade<00:04:24.900> right<00:04:25.140> there

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.950 

pretty<00:04:28.590> good-looking<00:04:31.610> yeah<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.180> one<00:04:33.630> pip

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
pretty good-looking yeah and it one pip

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.420 
pretty good-looking yeah and it one pip
I<00:04:34.140> guess<00:04:34.410> on<00:04:34.740> every<00:04:35.010> card<00:04:35.280> has<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.730> bubble<00:04:36.180> II

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
I guess on every card has that bubble II

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.880 
I guess on every card has that bubble II
kind<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.460> effect<00:04:38.820> on<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:42.290> mix<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.410> kind<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.800> a

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
kind of effect on it mix for kind of a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.510 
kind of effect on it mix for kind of a
one-way<00:04:44.130> design<00:04:44.430> almost<00:04:44.820> I<00:04:45.450> can<00:04:45.840> see<00:04:46.020> some

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
one-way design almost I can see some

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.560 
one-way design almost I can see some
church<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.700> do<00:04:47.790> with<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:48.060> one<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.330> these<00:04:48.420> is

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
church to do with that one of these is

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.560 
church to do with that one of these is
faded<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.530> know<00:04:49.650> that's<00:04:49.860> pretty<00:04:50.850> neat<00:04:51.120> design

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
faded you know that's pretty neat design

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.320 
faded you know that's pretty neat design
choice<00:04:52.280> I'm<00:04:53.280> loving<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.640> cork<00:04:53.880> hard<00:04:54.090> look<00:04:54.240> at

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
choice I'm loving the cork hard look at

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:02.290 
choice I'm loving the cork hard look at
that<00:04:54.360> that's<00:04:54.630> cool<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:55.610> looks<00:04:56.610> awesome

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:07.759 
yeah this is their this is the same
stock<00:06:06.479> that's<00:06:06.749> on<00:06:06.869> the<00:06:06.990> artifice<00:06:07.379> that<00:06:07.649> I

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:07.769 
stock that's on the artifice that I

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:11.089 
stock that's on the artifice that I
believe<00:06:08.839> they<00:06:09.839> feel<00:06:10.229> a<00:06:10.259> lot<00:06:10.619> like<00:06:10.889> the

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
believe they feel a lot like the

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:16.609 
believe they feel a lot like the
infinity<00:06:12.050> infinity<00:06:13.050> series<00:06:13.669> I<00:06:14.669> know<00:06:15.619> the

00:06:16.609 --> 00:06:16.619 
infinity infinity series I know the

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.189 
infinity infinity series I know the
infinity<00:06:17.099> series<00:06:17.429> is<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:18.629> same<00:06:18.869> as<00:06:19.050> the

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
infinity series is the same as the

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:24.850 
infinity series is the same as the
artifice<00:06:19.589> is<00:06:19.830> just<00:06:22.099> that<00:06:23.099> was<00:06:23.189> it<00:06:23.279> really<00:06:23.490> poor

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
artifice is just that was it really poor

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:31.159 
artifice is just that was it really poor
really<00:06:25.860> poor<00:06:26.009> bridge<00:06:26.879> tough<00:06:27.180> play<00:06:30.169> he's

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
really poor bridge tough play he's

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.129 
really poor bridge tough play he's
broken<00:06:31.379> him<00:06:31.619> see<00:06:32.579> if<00:06:32.639> I<00:06:32.699> can<00:06:32.849> do<00:06:33.389> a<00:06:33.419> pharaoh

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.239 

these<00:06:37.139> are<00:06:37.349> as<00:06:37.619> terrible<00:06:39.979> it's<00:06:40.979> like<00:06:41.099> do<00:06:41.219> a

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
these are as terrible it's like do a
