00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello, today we will study 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.410
 tethering a hook which I 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.370
 call perfect especially for 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.029
 visibility prepared bakes sinks 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.980
 cords so let 's show this knot 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.480
 differs from the others in that never 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 No need to thread anything with his 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.019
 tethering of course apart from the rest 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.000
 merits 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.990
 the fact that crepe and there and other other other 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.800
 first we take a loop from the disks 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.829
 crochet hook 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.670
 surely we lay down the calf we take the handguard 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.170
 up under the thumb leave 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.789
 small loop depends on it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.059
 how much then when pruning we throw out what 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:54.020
 the tip of the fishing line and about such a loop 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.199
 leave the essence is to 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.109
 fore hook and here are these two lines 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.140
 to wrap this side here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.159
 do not touch the day 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.530
 it's all done with two fingers in 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.530
 the position of victoria about like that two times 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 three 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.980
 4 while necessarily controlled 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:30.110
 so that the fishing line does not touch 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:32.710
 tip of the hook 5 well, let us more 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.560
 intercept the knot with your left hand even May 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.900
 delayed we tighten rather mutuzil 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.840
 formed well now like this 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.040
 pre-shift delaying 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.840
 spatula well there should be a spatula 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.540
 Of course this revenue with a spatula 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.970
 well, and finally drags on 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.440
 aid tool all this fishing line here 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.640
 somehow so now i will show how it is 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.320
 made for them conditions on fishing with 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.970
 fishing line here's the tip of the fishing line 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.970
 where on torza flows for example 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.820
 damaged by pike tasty damaged 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.250
 plot 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:13.420
 set the loop take real 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:27.270
 real seeker hook apply 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:36.130
 knit 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:42.000
 keep pulling out running first 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.410
 tighten with clips then 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.830
 so a knot is formed here 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.530
 finally already well and the tip can 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.680
 eat under the very like faces under the spine 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.530
 here are three centimeters no more remains 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.760
 node more economical police liver here 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.760
 something like this
