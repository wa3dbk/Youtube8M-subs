00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.229 
thing Schoen and i are gonna try are the
wireless<00:02:53.160> controllers<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.030> said

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
wireless controllers and like I said

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.090 
wireless controllers and like I said
before<00:02:54.420> these<00:02:54.930> are<00:02:54.959> infrared<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.769> usually

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
before these are infrared and usually

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.500 
before these are infrared and usually
that's<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.370> very<00:02:56.549> bad<00:02:56.880> thing<00:02:57.209> but<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
that's a very bad thing but the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.120 
that's a very bad thing but the
experience<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.290> had<00:02:58.470> with<00:02:58.620> them<00:02:58.799> is<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
experience I had with them is that you

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.830 
experience I had with them is that you
could<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.459> these<00:02:59.610> very<00:03:00.030> far<00:03:00.330> away<00:03:00.450> at

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
could have these very far away at

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.900 
could have these very far away at
multiple<00:03:01.530> angles<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.280> never<00:03:02.610> lose

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
multiple angles and they never lose

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.729 
multiple angles and they never lose
connection<00:03:03.360> with<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> actual<00:03:04.080> console<00:03:04.590> which

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
connection with the actual console which

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.229 
connection with the actual console which
is<00:03:04.769> very<00:03:05.069> impressive<00:03:05.370> now<00:03:05.730> let's<00:03:05.910> take<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.090> look

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
is very impressive now let's take a look

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.910 
is very impressive now let's take a look
at<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> controller<00:03:06.750> itself<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.319> d-pad<00:03:07.739> is

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
at the controller itself the d-pad is

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.800 
at the controller itself the d-pad is
extremely<00:03:08.489> responsive<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.209> feels<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:09.690> like

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
extremely responsive it feels just like

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.840 
extremely responsive it feels just like
an<00:03:10.019> original<00:03:10.170> SNES<00:03:10.620> pad<00:03:11.130> it<00:03:11.340> actually<00:03:11.610> looks

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
an original SNES pad it actually looks

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.580 
an original SNES pad it actually looks
like<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.120> SNES<00:03:12.420> pad<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.019> buttons<00:03:13.350> also

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
like an SNES pad and the buttons also

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
now the L&amp;R triggers on top are the same

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.460 
now the L&amp;R triggers on top are the same
thing<00:03:17.430> as<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.030> turbo<00:03:18.420> B&amp;A<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:18.959> there<00:03:19.350> is

duplicate buttons there nothing special
but<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.420> controller<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.989> very<00:03:22.200> impressive

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
but the controller is very impressive

biggest one first and that is the amount

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680 
biggest one first and that is the amount
of<00:03:44.250> batteries<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.850> will<00:03:44.970> need<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.329> use<00:03:45.510> this

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
of batteries you will need to use this

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.560 
of batteries you will need to use this
as<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.049> home<00:03:46.230> console<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:47.040> takes<00:03:48.030> three

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
as a home console this takes three

as a home console this takes three
Triple<00:03:48.900> A<00:03:48.989> batteries<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.560> these<00:03:49.920> take<00:03:50.640> two

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
Triple A batteries and these take two

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.300 
Triple A batteries and these take two
triple<00:03:51.450> A<00:03:51.540> batteries<00:03:51.570> each<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.829> top<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.190> it

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
triple A batteries each and on top of it

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.309 
triple A batteries each and on top of it
this<00:03:53.489> does<00:03:53.730> not<00:03:53.880> have<00:03:54.150> any<00:03:54.420> kind<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.900> port<00:03:55.200> to

this does not have any kind of port to

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.229 
this does not have any kind of port to
hook<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.680> regular<00:03:56.040> Nintendo<00:03:56.489> controller<00:03:56.730> so

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
hook up a regular Nintendo controller so

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.180 
hook up a regular Nintendo controller so
you<00:03:57.299> have<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.840> use<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.260> wireless<00:03:58.500> peripherals

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
you have to use the wireless peripherals

you're gonna have to put a big
investment<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.590> batteries<00:04:05.069> now<00:04:05.430> one<00:04:05.670> thing

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
investment in batteries now one thing

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.280 
investment in batteries now one thing
that<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.090> will<00:04:06.329> know<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.959> battery

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
that I will know is that the battery

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.170 
that I will know is that the battery
life<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.709> very<00:04:08.100> decent<00:04:08.489> on<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:09.000> these

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
life is very decent on all these

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
regular controllers to it so you didn't

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.140 
regular controllers to it so you didn't
have<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> Spencer

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.770 
if I push the bottom one here the right
one<00:04:38.590> also<00:04:38.740> moves<00:04:39.160> there's<00:04:39.699> like<00:04:39.880> two<00:04:40.120> separate

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
one also moves there's like two separate

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.140 
one also moves there's like two separate
pieces<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.039> d-pad<00:04:42.430> it's<00:04:42.610> not<00:04:42.759> one<00:04:42.910> big

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
pieces to the d-pad it's not one big

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.060 
pieces to the d-pad it's not one big
piece<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.360> plastic<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.199> if<00:04:44.620> you're<00:04:44.740> playing<00:04:44.919> a

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
piece of plastic so if you're playing a

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.529 
piece of plastic so if you're playing a
game<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:45.430> section<00:04:45.940> Z<00:04:46.180> which<00:04:46.389> is<00:04:46.419> a

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
game like section Z which is a

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.060 
game like section Z which is a
shoot-'em-up<00:04:46.930> where<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.530> have<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.770> move<00:04:47.889> all

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
shoot-'em-up where you have to move all

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.230 
shoot-'em-up where you have to move all
over<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.250> screen<00:04:48.639> you<00:04:48.789> roll<00:04:49.030> your<00:04:49.210> thumb

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
over the screen you roll your thumb

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.330 
over the screen you roll your thumb
across<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:50.080> can<00:04:50.110> actually<00:04:50.650> press<00:04:50.979> down<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
across you can actually press down the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.430 
across you can actually press down the
whole<00:04:51.759> d-pad<00:04:52.300> at<00:04:52.449> once<00:04:52.690> which<00:04:53.110> could<00:04:53.320> be<00:04:53.410> a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
whole d-pad at once which could be a

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.170 
whole d-pad at once which could be a
problem<00:04:53.530> because<00:04:53.949> the<00:04:54.220> character<00:04:54.729> just<00:04:54.880> locks

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
problem because the character just locks

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.850 
problem because the character just locks
up<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.630> doesn't<00:04:55.930> move<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.470> kind<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.710> have

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
up and doesn't move so you kind of have

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.040 
up and doesn't move so you kind of have
to<00:04:56.889> go<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.699> consciously<00:04:58.510> think<00:04:58.960> about

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
to go and consciously think about

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.870 
to go and consciously think about
pressing<00:04:59.740> one<00:04:59.919> button<00:04:59.949> at<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.370> time<00:05:00.610> or

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
pressing one button at a time or

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.370 
pressing one button at a time or
pressing<00:05:01.210> two<00:05:01.389> at<00:05:01.539> a<00:05:01.600> time<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.960> not<00:05:02.080> pressing

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
pressing two at a time and not pressing

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.900 
pressing two at a time and not pressing
more<00:05:02.680> than<00:05:02.949> two<00:05:03.160> that's<00:05:03.490> kind<00:05:03.760> of<00:05:03.820> a

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
more than two that's kind of a

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.490 
more than two that's kind of a
shortcoming<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.570> it<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.780> mean<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.020> get<00:05:05.139> used<00:05:05.320> to

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
shortcoming to it I mean you get used to

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.990 
shortcoming to it I mean you get used to
it<00:05:05.560> doesn't<00:05:05.860> take<00:05:06.100> away<00:05:06.130> from<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.580> gameplay

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
it doesn't take away from the gameplay

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.120 
it doesn't take away from the gameplay
experience<00:05:07.030> too<00:05:07.750> much<00:05:07.990> but<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.650> was<00:05:08.770> something

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
experience too much but it was something

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.719 
experience too much but it was something
worth<00:05:09.310> noting

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
worth noting

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.570 
worth noting
so<00:05:10.090> flaws<00:05:10.510> aside<00:05:10.990> I<00:05:11.020> have<00:05:11.350> to<00:05:11.740> say<00:05:11.979> that<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.280> am

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
so flaws aside I have to say that I am

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.000 
so flaws aside I have to say that I am
truly<00:05:13.090> blown<00:05:13.660> away<00:05:13.990> by<00:05:14.350> this<00:05:14.410> piece<00:05:14.830> of
