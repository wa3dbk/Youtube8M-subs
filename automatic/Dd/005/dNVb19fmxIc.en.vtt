 for sharing this program together that 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.860
 such thanks to you alejandra for the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.050
 room and tell Andrew that is the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.700
 acupuncture for network acupuncture 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.460
 is composed of two words is one 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.260
 therapeutic that uses the cv that are 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.840
 the needles and the puncture that the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.610
 Bone penetration is a therapy theory 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.990
 the needle penetrating the skin and different 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.750
 different tissues for treatment 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.250
 pathologies as a traumatologist and as 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.370
 as a surgeon how did you come to the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.840
 Acupuncture looks like the orthopedist with 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.869
 surgeon what I can say is that there 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.820
 a wide range of pathologies that do not 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.830
 They have great solution and great treatment 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.050
 so looking like a 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.110
 therapeutic something else for the patient 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.210
 to be consulted by different 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.010
 pathologies of pain or chronic causes 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.979
 is one the treatments was the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.960
 acupuncture then what happens the 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.690
 contrary it is not scientific but 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.310
 good acupuncture that I learned that 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.630
 it's called anatomical acupuncture that a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.430
 from now on what we are going to do 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.460
 reference is to this kind of point 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.830
 specifically it is a course that 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.150
 dictated at the university of medicine 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.650
 texas san antonio 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.480
 and they have many scientific foundations 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.340
 and anatomically good acupuncture is 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.170
 clear good basically the contra 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.000
 traditional 99 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.650
 worldwide , what was traditional 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.990
 means this handles concepts 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.200
 abstract energy between the balance 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.240
 training and the yang and that there are meridians 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.480
 in which energy flows which is what 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.730
 that allows the well-being of one of the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.080
 health of a person then what is the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.030
 difference this does not exist any 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 scientific foundation that is all that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.720
 be cultural in Chinese medicine or 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.610
 traditional call in this way not 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.230
 there is a scientific foundation 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 positivist of the West then what 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.440
 did the teacher who taught me that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.900
 it was a picket or a doctor in 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.490
 medicine the doctor don of us the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.470
 Assistant professor at the University of 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.780
 texas in what he did was dissect point 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.550
 by point acupuncture and he realized 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.160
 that below that there were 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.070
 nerve structures that says it says 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.410
 that grabbed corpses and says digging point 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.910
 per point the 712 points discovered that 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.830
 actually the attachments are the points 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.450
 the meridians were simply all 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.730
 the nerve paths that exist 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.560
 our body so one 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.650
 in the knowledge of medicine could 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.670
 practice the culture in a simple way 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.890
 so basically the question 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.540
 anatomical is based on anatomy in the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.720
 knowledge of pathologies such as 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.390
 conventional medicine and that these points 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.030
 they have a sequence of positivize jon 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 that are measurable in each patient and 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.430
 has a direct relationship through 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.810
 the anatomy with according to the pathology 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.000
 what is to use what points or not to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.569
 use so I'm staying a little longer 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.099
 clear in the town and more as the closer 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.590
 until alternative medicine let's say 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.329
 of course, Chinese medicine is a 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.410
 alternative medicine then it's something 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.660
 that has to be clear even 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.400
 when I talk to colleagues medicine 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.920
 alternative refers a lot of 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.269
 East therapy groups or disciplines 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.489
 that have no scientific basis 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.530
 then it is cataloged as alternative 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.110
 really acupuncture is a 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.660
 therapeutically very effectively 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.760
 allows even how to practice it 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.860
 within the medical discipline then 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.320
 the idea is simply that acupuncture 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.720
 in the future it has only foundation 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.240
 anatomical that can be accepted by the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.430
 conventional or allopathic medicine in 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.780
 that is practiced and that is not called anymore 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.930
 well native center because it would be the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.460
 respective input a prejudice 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.370
 Chair that way because coi 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.530
 already be included with the 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.150
 Reiki with other pathologies that today in 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.950
 day although they may have results but 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.530
 today he has no scientific explanation 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.180
 of this as a traumatologist and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.250
 surgeon when there are cases that do not 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.600
 they can operate if we say accompany them 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.890
 in the pain 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.440
 well that's a very question 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.760
 interesting to see if the contracture or 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.200
 simply eliminate the symptoms 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.820
 so basically to see if we go to a 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.580
 of pathologies talking about 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.669
 column for example 10 percent of 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.250
 patients is surgical 30% nothing 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.470
 more of the patients is surgical the 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.970
 30% of patients resolve with the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.830
 kinesiology or with the others 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.190
 therapeutic treatments that remain for which we 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.080
 there is a 60% band that what is 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.180
 in the hood we do most of the 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.380
 patients is not in treatment 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.260
 so what do you do the 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.370
 culture basically eliminates the pain 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.840
 but there is a dissociation in medicine 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.960
 also that this is also seen by many 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.310
 the other doctors the magnitude of the 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.290
 pathology does not make him excellent 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.000
 correlates with the pain then the 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.720
 common was that it would cure the pain but not 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.720
 the basic pathology
