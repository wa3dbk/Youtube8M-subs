00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
that lost to darkside today in our tests

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.649 
that lost to darkside today in our tests
with<00:00:49.920> these<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.250> teams<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> Tengu<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.330> always

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.180 
with these two teams the Tengu is always
one<00:00:51.900> so<00:00:52.229> it'll<00:00:52.409> be<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.530> interesting<00:00:52.890> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
one so it'll be really interesting to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.119 
one so it'll be really interesting to
see<00:00:53.339> how<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.580> match<00:00:53.820> goes<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.620> ranges<00:00:55.979> we

logistics<00:01:16.260> first<00:01:16.469> I<00:01:16.619> think<00:01:16.859> if<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.670> tango's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
logistics first I think if these tango's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.969 
logistics first I think if these tango's
our<00:01:18.090> ham<00:01:18.329> fit<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.899> pl<00:01:19.140> team<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.619> isn't

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
our ham fit like the pl team which isn't

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.649 
our ham fit like the pl team which isn't
a<00:01:20.039> given<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.759> they'll<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.359> able<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> make

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
a given then they'll be able to make

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.029 
a given then they'll be able to make
short<00:01:21.960> work<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.259> these<00:01:22.409> slept<00:01:22.649> nerves<00:01:22.859> and

the pl setup I'd be very interested to
see<00:01:41.070> exactly<00:01:41.189> how<00:01:41.719> Black<00:01:42.719> Legion<00:01:42.899> went<00:01:43.200> about

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
copying this setup since they actually

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.029 
copying this setup since they actually
this<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.020> wasn't<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.499> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> ones<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.859> was

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039

that<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> hurt<00:01:55.229> it'll<00:01:55.469> be<00:01:55.560> pretty

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
that is going to hurt it'll be pretty

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.039 
that is going to hurt it'll be pretty
difficult<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.999> Black<00:01:57.569> Legion<00:01:57.719> come

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
difficult that for Black Legion come

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.779 
difficult that for Black Legion come
back<00:01:58.200> from<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.409> although<00:01:59.069> they<00:01:59.399> are

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
back from that although they are

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.969 
back from that although they are
applying<00:02:00.299> damage<00:02:00.780> interestingly<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
applying damage interestingly to one of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.559 
applying damage interestingly to one of
the<00:02:02.039> sabers<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.179> very<00:02:03.240> poor

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
the sabers I think that is a very poor

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.929 
the sabers I think that is a very poor
choice<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.340> sabers<00:02:05.340> are<00:02:05.429> not<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
choice the sabers are not going to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
choice the sabers are not going to
taking<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.210> lot<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.359> damage<00:02:06.539> from<00:02:06.749> hands<00:02:07.289> heavy

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
taking a lot of damage from hands heavy

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.020 
taking a lot of damage from hands heavy
assault<00:02:07.859> missiles<00:02:08.250> do<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.460> good<00:02:08.729> job<00:02:08.789> of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
assault missiles do a good job of

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.270 
assault missiles do a good job of
killing<00:02:09.360> large<00:02:09.750> things<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.710> are<00:02:11.039> really

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
killing large things but they are really

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
killing large things but they are really
signature<00:02:11.819> radius<00:02:12.180> limited<00:02:12.720> you're<00:02:13.410> not

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
signature radius limited you're not

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.020 
signature radius limited you're not
going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.830> kill<00:02:13.950> small<00:02:14.250> fast<00:02:14.520> things<00:02:14.819> with

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
going to kill small fast things with

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.670 
going to kill small fast things with
them<00:02:15.150> very<00:02:15.330> well<00:02:15.360> at<00:02:15.569> all<00:02:15.630> yeah<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.350> mean<00:02:16.470> I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
them very well at all yeah I mean I

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.150 
them very well at all yeah I mean I
guess<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.430> kind<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.210> situation<00:02:18.420> where

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
guess this is kind of a situation where

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.289 
guess this is kind of a situation where
they're<00:02:20.160> trying<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.610> deal<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:20.940> tackle

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
they're trying to deal with tackle

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.160 
they're trying to deal with tackle
because<00:02:21.540> they<00:02:21.629> need<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
because they need to get to the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
because they need to get to the
logistics<00:02:22.650> ship<00:02:22.860> right<00:02:23.519> because<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:23.879> can't

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
logistics ship right because they can't

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
logistics ship right because they can't
really<00:02:24.239> they<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.720> they're<00:02:24.840> not<00:02:24.900> going

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
really they know that they're not going

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.330 
really they know that they're not going
to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.230> able<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.440> kill<00:02:25.560> slip<00:02:25.830> nur<00:02:25.950> although

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to be able to kill slip nur although

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.589 
to be able to kill slip nur although
now<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.610> looks<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.849> they<00:02:26.970> could<00:02:27.510> have

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
now it looks like they could have

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.759 
now it looks like they could have
guessed<00:02:27.750> looking<00:02:28.230> they<00:02:28.410> could<00:02:28.560> very<00:02:28.709> easily

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
guessed looking they could very easily

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.589 
guessed looking they could very easily
have<00:02:29.040> killed<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.340> slippery<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.879> team

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
have killed a slippery with this team

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.210 
have killed a slippery with this team
because<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.959> do<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.260> much<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.620> damage<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
because you do so much more damage to a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.460 
because you do so much more damage to a
shield<00:02:32.519> slept<00:02:32.879> there<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.599> saber<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
shield slept there and do to a saber I

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.900 
shield slept there and do to a saber I
think<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.950> made<00:02:35.069> just<00:02:35.280> come<00:02:35.400> down<00:02:35.550> Andrew<00:02:35.730> they

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
think it made just come down Andrew they

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.160 
think it made just come down Andrew they
just<00:02:36.150> didn't<00:02:36.330> have<00:02:36.420> enough<00:02:36.450> practice<00:02:36.989> with

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
just didn't have enough practice with

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.800 
just didn't have enough practice with
this<00:02:37.319> team<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:38.489> have<00:02:38.819> kind<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.150> realized<00:02:39.569> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
this team to have kind of realized the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.720 
this team to have kind of realized the
dynamics<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:40.560> heavy<00:02:40.739> assault<00:02:40.920> missiles<00:02:41.280> so

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
dynamics with heavy assault missiles so

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.190 
dynamics with heavy assault missiles so
while<00:02:42.030> we've<00:02:42.150> been<00:02:42.209> talking<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.750> tengu<00:02:43.140> is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
while we've been talking a tengu is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.140 
while we've been talking a tengu is
already<00:02:43.680> dead<00:02:43.860> that's<00:02:44.459> leavener<00:02:44.819> probably

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
already dead that's leavener probably

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.580 
already dead that's leavener probably
will<00:02:45.269> die<00:02:45.480> because<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.810> think<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.080> tangles<00:02:46.470> yeah

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
will die because I think to tangles yeah

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.509 
will die because I think to tangles yeah
you'll<00:02:46.769> be<00:02:46.799> enough<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.129> break<00:02:47.280> through<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
you'll be enough to break through the

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.180 
you'll be enough to break through the
rest<00:02:47.730> it'll<00:02:48.390> be<00:02:48.450> close<00:02:48.629> though<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.379> commander

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
rest it'll be close though but commander

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.979 
rest it'll be close though but commander
Diaz<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.670> tango<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.060> also<00:02:51.299> dropping<00:02:51.510> extremely

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
Diaz is tango is also dropping extremely

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.690 
Diaz is tango is also dropping extremely
quickly<00:02:52.170> with<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:52.950> expand<00:02:53.220> upon<00:02:53.459> meet

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
quickly with you just expand upon meet

do well the tengu came one episode which
is<00:03:08.549> why<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.730> was<00:03:08.910> saying<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.239> although<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.510> kind

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
is why I was saying that although I kind

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.869 
is why I was saying that although I kind
of<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.230> outbreak<00:03:10.709> Morris<00:03:11.040> pilots<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.640> think

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
of like outbreak Morris pilots I think

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.190 
of like outbreak Morris pilots I think
that<00:03:12.060> Black<00:03:12.269> Legion<00:03:12.450> had<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> better<00:03:13.110> chance

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
that Black Legion had a better chance

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.470 
that Black Legion had a better chance
but<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.829> think<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.400> mistake<00:03:14.760> early<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.150> going

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
but I think that mistake early on going

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.059 
but I think that mistake early on going
after<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> Sabre<00:03:16.079> with<00:03:16.410> those<00:03:16.560> heavy<00:03:16.829> assault

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
after the Sabre with those heavy assault

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.890 
after the Sabre with those heavy assault
missile<00:03:17.160> tangos<00:03:17.730> which<00:03:17.940> obviously<00:03:18.480> was<00:03:18.720> not

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
missile tangos which obviously was not

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.390 
missile tangos which obviously was not
able<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.110> break<00:03:19.290> its<00:03:19.440> tank<00:03:19.680> that's<00:03:20.190> what

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
able to break its tank that's what

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.949 
able to break its tank that's what
killed<00:03:20.610> them<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.940> slowed<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.510> too<00:03:21.810> much

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
killed them it slowed it down too much

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.630 
killed them it slowed it down too much
and<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.470> did<00:03:22.680> finish<00:03:22.860> off<00:03:23.069> that<00:03:23.099> slept<00:03:23.489> nur

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
and they did finish off that slept nur

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.740 
and they did finish off that slept nur
but<00:03:23.849> it's<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.209> gonna<00:03:24.299> be<00:03:24.420> enough<00:03:24.569> at<00:03:24.660> this

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
but it's not gonna be enough at this

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.240 
but it's not gonna be enough at this
point<00:03:24.810> cuz<00:03:25.140> all<00:03:25.290> their<00:03:25.560> damage<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:25.980> gonna<00:03:26.129> be

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
point cuz all their damage is gonna be

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.890 
point cuz all their damage is gonna be
gone<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.579> my<00:03:26.670> tank<00:03:26.879> is<00:03:26.970> done<00:03:27.180> yes<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.660> voting

ILA's and worms on to the cemetery you

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.830 
ILA's and worms on to the cemetery you
just<00:03:47.639> use<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.970> damage<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.450> heavy<00:03:48.660> assault

missiles from the tanker used to break

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.559 
missiles from the tanker used to break
right<00:03:50.220> through<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.459> selectors<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.420> can

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
right through the selectors and you can

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.059 
right through the selectors and you can
actually<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.870> win<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.200> brawl<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:52.859> case

against a saber you're not doing full

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.830 
against a saber you're not doing full

enough to stabilize the tank we are

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.949 
enough to stabilize the tank we are
seeing<00:04:09.359> newts<00:04:10.230> coming<00:04:10.620> from<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:10.980> Gila<00:04:11.549> and

most effective against the seminar but
they're<00:04:17.370> not<00:04:17.489> going<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.669> survive<00:04:17.910> long<00:04:18.150> enough

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180

this<00:04:51.180> team<00:04:51.509> is<00:04:51.539> good<00:04:51.930> for<00:04:52.139> if<00:04:53.009> the<00:04:53.280> tangos<00:04:53.819> had

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
this team is good for if the tangos had

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.040 
this team is good for if the tangos had
gone<00:04:54.060> after<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.360> right<00:04:54.479> target<00:04:54.810> they<00:04:54.900> also

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
gone after the right target they also

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.089 
gone after the right target they also
would<00:04:55.259> have<00:04:55.349> been<00:04:55.440> good<00:04:55.530> for<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.860> but

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
would have been good for it but

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.589 
would have been good for it but
unfortunately<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.909> think<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.240> was<00:04:57.389> just

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
unfortunately I think that was just

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:58.999 
unfortunately I think that was just
saving<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.930> state<00:04:58.050> caused<00:04:58.289> by<00:04:58.500> an<00:04:58.590> experience

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
saving the state caused by an experience

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.790 
saving the state caused by an experience
for<00:04:59.099> the<00:04:59.190> particular<00:04:59.400> setup<00:04:59.729> so<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:01.229> does<00:05:01.590> it

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
for the particular setup so that does it

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.830 
for the particular setup so that does it
outbreak<00:05:02.639> dominating<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.419> match<00:05:03.569> even

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
outbreak dominating that match even

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.779 
outbreak dominating that match even
though<00:05:03.960> it<00:05:04.530> could<00:05:04.889> have<00:05:05.009> easily<00:05:05.219> gone<00:05:05.729> the

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
though it could have easily gone the

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.249 
though it could have easily gone the
other<00:05:05.909> way<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.210> congratulations<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.169> them

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259
