00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.150
 google android is how we are today 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.219
 I present the 5 new games that have 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.289
 followed already this 2013 and that undoubtedly 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.270
 will like it very much today is what I feel 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.800
 from my lexus 7 because I think it looks 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.689
 better since my fingers are smaller 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.600
 and the proportion of the screen as you see 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.849
 it's the same so let's start with golden 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.130
 ninja in this game when we give to the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.990
 do not go play different worlds 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 example we will press this on him there is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.190
 various levels we will also press a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.620
 random and I'll show you how it works 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.809
 attractively we are this ball 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.460
 and we have to reach the goal as much as 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.190
 possible fast and getting the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 maximum possible stars in it we can 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.780
 control our firing angle 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 although the real is the one that would follow in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 these blue dots also if we 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.270
 we throw inside we control the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
 power then there are different 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.010
 elements as you see and then we have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 hitting jumps to go up to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.719
 where we want to get this here is a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.010
 checkpoint in the event that we die 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.000
 reappear we have from this point 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 so 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.050
 a game a little strategy to know 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.290
 where to go jumping now as you see I've 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.720
 passed a star and this we give to the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.700
 success is the arrival this level as how 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.130
 you have seen it has been very simple like this 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.530
 that one level was taught a little more 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.170
 complicated for example this let's say 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.280
 I suppose in him we will have every time 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.530
 more elements these blue fish with 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.390
 computations are objects that we can not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.850
 touch and here in case we touch 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.770
 As you can see, we appear and go back to 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.180
 be at the starting point as you see 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.800
 now there is a new element as is the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.590
 wind in which if we enter it 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.840
 we will be shot in these bushes we 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.420
 we are caught and keep on pending or 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.430
 this there are jumps now as you see in the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.869
 water we can also move but not 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.050
 we have to wait to fall on the ground 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.940
 to give it back in the air now 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.640
 as you see, but instead, in these 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.950
 areas that are like smoke we can 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.440
 say that car here and from the air 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.500
 You may skip to the next the following 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.149
 that game is called ryan extreme 3 and it's 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.920
 for me the best motocross game that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.640
 exists for our phones with 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 android 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.959
 in the menu we give the play and do not know in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.270
 different scenarios where we can 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.950
 compete for example choose the first 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.980
 of the sport although there is also the beach 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.900
 in the desert and others you can compare 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.100
 our online results with rankings 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.760
 although I for example now I have 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.100
 skipped the control of the game is pretty 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.630
 quite intuitive and at the beginning 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.459
 it may seem a little complicated but 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.890
 as we play and five minutes we 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.470
 we skip perfectly then now 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.100
 as that scenario says that then yes 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.720
 we give it here we accelerate and here we brake 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.610
 tilting our device in the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.340
 player then tilted and change angle 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.620
 of motocross then now this 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.090
 level is a bit pretty simple and 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.610
 we have to go collecting the coins 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 so to get better scores 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.180
 here you see a small mini map 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.100
 of our progress and the green points 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.140
 about these traffic lights that in case 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.480
 we die, we reappear from this 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.640
 this third button that is here serves 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.220
 to make like a jump now like 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.560
 you have seen and then they give us also 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.850
 points for doing stunts and so on and 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.070
 we reach the goal 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.230
 in the free version there are some levels 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.220
 and although there is also the believe that as 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.800
 can get 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.930
 by the actor of or if you can afford us 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.300
 because the best thing you will pay legally is not 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.580
 then here as you see every time it gets 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.410
 of everything a little more complicated then 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.240
 is a game that you will definitely like 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.910
 very much if you like these games not 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.200
 accurate of a device with large 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.690
 powers even though it seems to have 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.880
 pretty good graphics and as you 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.710
 we are advancing the level goes complicated 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.720
 with new obstacles and without a doubt it is a 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.880
 game that will be tried a lot the 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.710
 next is called pudding monsters this 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.870
 it's a game of tactics that we play 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.450
 in vertical ok this is our scenario 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.000
 and thick in our characters what 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.530
 we have to do is move them but if 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.780
 we do towards a direction it's going 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.550
 automatically up to the mode limit 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.560
 that if we throw it to the right it's going 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.090
 of the map and we lose so we have to 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.160
 go to where there are then these 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.100
 obstacles the ultimate goal is 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.470
 get together and make them together if it is 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.730
 better always ending up on some 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.739
 stars as you see now has gotten 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.200
 three of three stars although little to 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.950
 As you can see, it is going to complicate a 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.140
 little bit 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.140
 so let's see what this would be like 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.760
 now as you can see I got three of 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.220
 three ok at this level there is this new guy 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.650
 of character which is where he goes from 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.220
 jaÃ©n was going in which then if by 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.210
 example we throw makes stays stuck 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.310
 automatically to this kind of slobber 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.630
 these blues instead on which 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.780
 they are asleep that we can 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.250
 use them and we can not move them but 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.950
 if when we hit against him we 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.260
 we wake up for example this level would be 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.110
 we wake him up to this and he does not join us 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.290
 now in this here we hit against 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.360
 the full we wake up to this and we go down and 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.620
 we get together thanks to the drool and now 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.480
 we have achieved the three stars 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.700
 now we go with a game called 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.340
 is pancreas is pancreas is a 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.960
 paranoia of game there are seven worlds but 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.240
 The good thing is that we do not have to pass the 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.220
 two previous ones to go to the next one 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.480
 I set a very easy level so that 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.700
 see what it is about 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.080
 we are this square from here in 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.200
 which we will have to simply touch 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.690
 the screen to jump and it happens to us 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.970
 level and each time then the one below but 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.010
 good is that once we pass level is 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.140
 as a checkpoint and if we die re 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.830
 we appear from this level as you see 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.320
 this has been 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.440
 very simple and you say good go look of 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.300
 game this is not super easy but not for 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.470
 example I go directly to a level a 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.330
 little more complicated 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.520
 this is how you see better is passed and 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.440
 So we have new types of surfaces 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.590
 what are we going this we can do 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.320
 to touch are the grays, instead, the roses 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.420
 yes and the browns what they do is then 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.510
 disappear once we touch against him 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.940
 against them then it 's a very game 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.470
 addictive is as well as platform that 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.150
 no doubt it will like very much 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.700
 there is to see yes 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.740
 and it's here we get new skills 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.270
 as the top the jump now as you see 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.460
 I am in a world where the more 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.770
 time I hit the highest screen 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.050
 our character now we move to 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.810
 last game which is called awesome 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.150
 free there is the free version version of 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.760
 payment as in all we will find a 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.560
 character who is a previous superhero 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.360
 well as a magazine and as you 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.830
 we are going through the levels as it goes 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.750
 watching as a little cartoon 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.180
 so now I'm in the second 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.490
 magazine about to move on to the next 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.650
 in the in each level we have to 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.510
 achieve various goals that we are 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.340
 they are accumulating game after game of 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.650
 that level for example get a 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.920
 certain number of stars the game is 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.080
 it looks pretty much like jetpack gates 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.480
 played then it will be the simply if 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.460
 we are walking we press the time and 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.710
 we jump or if we are in the air and 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.710
 keep pressed as it goes flying a 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.000
 little then upwards not then 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.680
 at this level for example we have to 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.270
 stop these skaters who have come by 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.970
 here and always what we have to do 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.920
 is to pick up these blue crystals that 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.310
 I suppose you have seen and above all 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.830
 dodge the red 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.260
 in this year entry for example then 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.090
 it takes us up here and the map is 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.640
 relatively quite large as 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.380
 at height we can run around here pick up 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.990
 various objects that will help us 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.250
 example some red plates and then for 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.050
 example these are the crystals that do not 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.700
 we can catch it is a very game 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.730
 interesting now I'm just in 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.370
 the second level although sure it 's shit
