looking at the bridge that we just blew

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.179 
looking at the bridge that we just blew
up<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.229> beyond<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> wall<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
up so it would be beyond the wall and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.649 
up so it would be beyond the wall and
this<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:09.000> look<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.509> you'd

challenges basically for you to overcome
yeah<00:01:34.679> I<00:01:34.710> wouldn't<00:01:35.069> say<00:01:35.190> better<00:01:35.399> cuz<00:01:35.640> horde<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
yeah I wouldn't say better cuz horde is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.180 
yeah I wouldn't say better cuz horde is
is<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.569> fun<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.350> say<00:01:37.470> better<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
is really fun you can say better know it

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.070 
is really fun you can say better know it
the<00:01:38.429> thing<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.759> ODST<00:01:39.300> firefight<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.929> it's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
the thing about ODST firefight is it's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.719 
the thing about ODST firefight is it's
just<00:01:40.229> different<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.520> makes

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
just different and the thing that makes

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.059 
just different and the thing that makes
it<00:01:41.880> different<00:01:42.330> is<00:01:42.450> we're<00:01:43.050> just<00:01:43.080> doing<00:01:43.800> we're

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
it different is we're just doing we're

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.969 
it different is we're just doing we're
really<00:01:44.220> leveraging<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:44.970> halo<00:01:45.149> 3<00:01:45.509> sandbox<00:01:46.049> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
really leveraging the halo 3 sandbox so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.639 
really leveraging the halo 3 sandbox so
you<00:01:47.039> not<00:01:47.340> only<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.729> vehicles<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.450> prior<00:01:49.440> 5

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you not only have vehicles on prior 5

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.230 
you not only have vehicles on prior 5
maps<00:01:49.830> someone<00:01:50.220> come<00:01:50.369> with<00:01:50.490> warthogs<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
maps someone come with warthogs and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
maps someone come with warthogs and
ghosts<00:01:51.569> you're<00:01:52.049> free<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.319> jump<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.649> those<00:01:52.830> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
ghosts you're free to jump in those and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
ghosts you're free to jump in those and
drive<00:01:53.280> them<00:01:53.399> around<00:01:53.630> of<00:01:54.630> course<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
drive them around of course all the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.620 
drive them around of course all the
great<00:01:55.350> AI<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.799> there<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.369> from<00:01:56.610> halo<00:01:56.850> 3<00:01:57.090> we're

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
great AI is there to from halo 3 we're

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.090 
great AI is there to from halo 3 we're
implementing<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.110> couple<00:01:58.380> new<00:01:58.560> cool<00:01:58.830> things

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
implementing a couple new cool things

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.680 
implementing a couple new cool things
though<00:01:59.340> which<00:01:59.549> really<00:01:59.759> set<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.060> apart<00:02:00.119> too<00:02:00.539> if

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
though which really set it apart too if

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.789 
though which really set it apart too if
you<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> left<00:02:01.289> hand<00:02:01.440> side<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.740> the

modifiers firefight is a set of waves

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.059 
modifiers firefight is a set of waves
that<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> fight<00:02:12.870> against<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.319> Covenant<00:02:13.709> and

that you fight against the Covenant and
with<00:02:14.220> each<00:02:14.250> round<00:02:15.180> around<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> set<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.620> waves

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
with each round around as a set of waves

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.259 
with each round around as a set of waves
it<00:02:17.160> gets<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.340> little<00:02:17.430> bit<00:02:17.610> tricky<00:02:17.879> but<00:02:17.970> trust<00:02:18.209> me

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
it gets a little bit tricky but trust me

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.119 
it gets a little bit tricky but trust me
it's<00:02:18.420> really<00:02:18.569> intuitive<00:02:18.870> once<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.230> play<00:02:19.470> when

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
it's really intuitive once you play when

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.890 
it's really intuitive once you play when
we<00:02:20.220> change<00:02:20.489> rounds<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.150> change<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.629> skulls

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
we change rounds we change the skulls

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380 
we change rounds we change the skulls
right<00:02:22.440> more<00:02:23.069> difficult<00:02:23.489> exactly<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.239> not

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
right more difficult exactly and not

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.970 
right more difficult exactly and not
necessarily<00:02:24.690> more<00:02:25.170> difficult<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.860> more

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
necessarily more difficult but just more

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.979 
necessarily more difficult but just more
interesting<00:02:26.459> yeah<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.269> if<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.690> were<00:02:27.780> fighting

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
interesting yeah so if you were fighting

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.410 
interesting yeah so if you were fighting
grunts<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> first<00:02:28.920> round<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:30.120> grunts

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
grunts in the first round and the grunts

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.820 
grunts in the first round and the grunts
in<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.569> second<00:02:30.900> round<00:02:30.989> will<00:02:31.200> behave<00:02:31.410> totally

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
in the second round will behave totally

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.170 
in the second round will behave totally
differently<00:02:32.190> they'll<00:02:32.459> throw<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.910> grenades

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
differently they'll throw more grenades

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.150 
differently they'll throw more grenades
you'll<00:02:34.080> only<00:02:34.260> get<00:02:34.440> health<00:02:34.650> back<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:35.040> you

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
you'll only get health back if you

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.250 
you'll only get health back if you
mainly<00:02:35.430> attack<00:02:35.700> them<00:02:35.879> so<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> halo<00:02:36.690> 3<00:02:36.900> sandbox

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
mainly attack them so the halo 3 sandbox

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.670 
mainly attack them so the halo 3 sandbox
is<00:02:37.410> always<00:02:37.709> evolving<00:02:37.980> okay

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
is always evolving okay

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.360 
is always evolving okay
kind<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:41.290> jump<00:02:42.290> alright<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.040> let's<00:02:43.189> jump

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
kind of jump alright so let's jump

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.860 
kind of jump alright so let's jump
easily<00:02:43.760> kick<00:02:43.939> I'm<00:02:44.120> just<00:02:44.180> going<00:02:44.359> to<00:02:44.390> start<00:02:44.659> the
