00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.400
 hey people here is the legendary and yes 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.960
 The snapshot is really great one can 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.330
 Now again with waves make as well 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.440
 earlier where I not that great to me from 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.070
 I could do it all day 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.390
 look at 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.740
 theoretically you could do this here 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.750
 of course, a simple blog 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.490
 connect and then it works 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.290
 fully automatic and maybe you 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.790
 Now why is this amazing? 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.800
 you have complicated with double 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.850
 change text and the whole stuff that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.130
 That's because if I just one now 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.590
 tipis nice with a stone block for 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.330
 if I put myself out there and 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.560
 which goes up which shot up 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.420
 problem is that works only with 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.850
 entities and if i put the sand blog here 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.619
 because he just gets high 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.450
 pushed that means I have to enter here 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.220
 blogger and 1 1 sand block and there must 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.720
 i retire the blog and while 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.760
 the sand blog falls I have to do it all 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.170
 move up then I tried it 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.880
 to do that 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.610
 but that did not work because if 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.050
 this slam box had gone he has 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.930
 The block pulled down 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.220
 that was not good so I have it then 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.630
 made is a pretty small module 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.520
 I think you can even see it that way 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.340
 how that works in principle your son 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.720
 david external controller if here 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.430
 even just flare and in between 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.300
 again so you all just 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.890
 can expand 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.390
 and never again on level 2 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.400
 so you can drive this out 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.560
 and yes that's the way the first module 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.850
 which I tried so it works 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.760
 but you could not do it alone 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.950
 expand and therefore not a single sand 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.690
 catapulted needs can you the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.100
 I also like to take it here 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.800
 can see everything very well here like 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.180
 that works and yes what he is with 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.530
 watch the video something I ever so 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.240
 can do anything with the snapshot 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.690
 what cool doors do not build yet 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.070
 can 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.070
 and then until next time
