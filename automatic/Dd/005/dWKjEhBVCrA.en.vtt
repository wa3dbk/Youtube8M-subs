one<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.130> hardest<00:00:42.430> in<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.700> game<00:00:42.910> if<00:00:43.210> not

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
one of the hardest in the game if not

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.780 
one of the hardest in the game if not
the<00:00:43.780> hardest<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.440> it's<00:00:45.280> one<00:00:45.550> of<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.700> most

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
the hardest and it's one of the most

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.450 
the hardest and it's one of the most
frustrating<00:00:46.060> in<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.840> game<00:00:47.020> as<00:00:47.230> well<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:48.130> this

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
frustrating in the game as well so this

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.280 
frustrating in the game as well so this
is<00:00:48.580> the<00:00:48.670> first<00:00:48.910> biggest<00:00:49.300> move<00:00:49.510> we<00:00:49.840> had<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.140> make

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
is the first biggest move we had to make

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.350 
is the first biggest move we had to make
we<00:00:50.740> have<00:00:51.130> to<00:00:51.250> transfer<00:00:51.700> over<00:00:51.820> on<00:00:52.030> that<00:00:52.180> big

jump to the right hand side to keep in

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.490 
jump to the right hand side to keep in
the<00:00:55.240> light<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.610> then<00:00:58.090> jump<00:00:58.960> across<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.290> this

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
the light and then jump across to this

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.830 
the light and then jump across to this
middle<00:00:59.770> gap<00:00:59.950> here<00:01:00.310> and<00:01:00.520> this<00:01:01.450> whole<00:01:01.660> time

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
middle gap here and this whole time

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.150 
middle gap here and this whole time
we're<00:01:02.020> going<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:02.200> try<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.410> build<00:01:02.650> up<00:01:02.830> enough

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
we're going to try to build up enough

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.890 
we're going to try to build up enough
boost<00:01:03.460> just<00:01:03.820> to<00:01:03.910> get<00:01:04.000> us<00:01:04.059> by<00:01:04.299> a<00:01:04.330> little<00:01:04.629> bit<00:01:04.750> we

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
boost just to get us by a little bit we

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.870 
boost just to get us by a little bit we
don't<00:01:05.049> need<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.229> huge<00:01:05.950> amount<00:01:06.159> for<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.610> entire

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
don't need a huge amount for the entire

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.330 
don't need a huge amount for the entire
run<00:01:07.119> we<00:01:07.990> do<00:01:08.140> want<00:01:08.350> enough<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.920> be<00:01:09.009> able<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.220> get

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
run we do want enough to be able to get

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.520 
run we do want enough to be able to get
us<00:01:09.460> through<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:10.360> do<00:01:10.510> have<00:01:10.630> three<00:01:10.960> rewinds

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
us through you do have three rewinds

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.030 
us through you do have three rewinds
they're<00:01:11.920> not<00:01:12.610> very<00:01:12.880> useful<00:01:13.120> because<00:01:13.690> if<00:01:14.320> you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
they're not very useful because if you

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.490 
they're not very useful because if you
get<00:01:15.190> yourself<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.700> bad<00:01:15.790> situation<00:01:16.500> it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
get yourself in a bad situation it's

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.200 
get yourself in a bad situation it's
really<00:01:17.740> hard<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:18.010> get<00:01:18.190> at<00:01:18.310> yourself<00:01:18.670> out<00:01:18.850> even

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
really hard to get at yourself out even

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.630 
really hard to get at yourself out even
with<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.450> rewinds<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.220> can<00:01:21.250> see<00:01:21.490> me

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
with the rewinds so here you can see me

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.490 
with the rewinds so here you can see me
keeping<00:01:22.090> as<00:01:22.240> much<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.960> right<00:01:23.140> hand<00:01:23.380> side

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500

keeping as much to the right hand side
as<00:01:23.800> I<00:01:23.920> can<00:01:24.190> very<00:01:25.180> very<00:01:25.360> critical<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:25.930> being
