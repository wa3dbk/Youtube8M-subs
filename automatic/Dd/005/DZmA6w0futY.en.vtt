00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
other teams putting the top laner with

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180

stuff<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
stuff do you not like that or do you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350

think<00:00:46.440> putting<00:00:46.620> top<00:00:46.890> lane<00:00:47.100> mid<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.149> first

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
think putting top lane mid in the first

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
think putting top lane mid in the first
few<00:00:48.480> minutes<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:48.960> important<00:00:49.379> well<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
few minutes is more important well it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
few minutes is more important well it
depends<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.579> guidance<00:00:50.969> mood<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.719> he

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
depends on guidance mood I think he

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
depends on guidance mood I think he
sometimes<00:00:52.590> goes<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.070> me<00:00:53.250> he<00:00:53.520> sometimes<00:00:53.969> goat

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
sometimes goes with me he sometimes goat

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.889 
sometimes goes with me he sometimes goat

amumu<00:03:26.170> will<00:03:26.470> be<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.920> first<00:03:27.160> one<00:03:27.370> because

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
amumu will be the first one because

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.789
