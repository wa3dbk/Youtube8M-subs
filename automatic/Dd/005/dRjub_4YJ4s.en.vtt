00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.160
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.509
 tutorial in sport climbing the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 technology is in our favor 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:29.739
 good anchors descuelgues helmet harness 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.349
 brakes assisted but all this chain 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.230
 security can be broken by a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.690
 factor the human factor 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.360
 we with our attitudes can 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.840
 lead to that all this does not serve to 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.879
 nothing in this tutorial let's see things 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.449
 typical that we can see in our area 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.760
 like for example what I have to leave 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 then he is insuring 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.520
 that is calm everything controlled 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 movies are going lately 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.600
 the last one I went to see was this eight 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 Basque last names another devotee very error 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.010
 generalized the one that ensures loses the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
 contact with the person above a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 external stimulus in this case a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.510
 partner before a conversation is 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.730
 produces the lack of coordination between 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.280
 both parts of the agreed upon has gone from 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.770
 situations where the person above 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 I had problems when I could cover 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.230
 it lacked rope as in this case a 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.460
 great sagging and therefore danger of a 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.150
 uncontrolled fall 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.150
 but now 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.040
 look at the sheets that have come down 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.890
 in this recreation we have seen how the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.630
 lack of attention and a sag 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.580
 exceedingly large carries out a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.620
 poor assurance in this case 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.870
 without consequences once it has been left 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.760
 a scare but the insurer has left 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.280
 shot without control supporting 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.650
 strongly back against the wall and 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.910
 not supporting for not being focused on 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.179
 the action supporting the feet on the wall 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.179
 attentive to this 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.570
 the rope do not take me to the weight 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.340
 another error that can be seen in the area 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.950
 of climbing in this case the climber 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.799
 Take the rope too tight is 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.110
 causing a burden in this case is that 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.150
 the insurer who is not 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.549
 familiar with your device and do not know 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.640
 conveniently winding this there 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.500
 than having it practiced and automated 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.640
 before arriving at places where the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.030
 climbing can be a problem for 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.030
 we 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.010
 I look that skipping is more attentive 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.120
 this situation also a basic error 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.129
 that too much sagging occurs 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.810
 mistrust effects in the one that ensures 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.680
 does not trust the person who is 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.500
 assuring you and a real danger of falling 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.030
 serious with consequences that can be 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.030
 hitting the ground 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.000
 another mistake is also in cutting us 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.590
 using an intermediate carabiner between 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.959
 a knot 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.069
 and the ring will come to ours 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.050
 will cause that having movement can 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.819
 cause it to stay transversally and 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.680
 in a fall in 'situation against a 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.030
 carabiner is very dangerous we have to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.519
 join our rope to our harness 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.069
 by a knot and this must be the 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.280
 adequate an error is not to monitor the 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.680
 position of the carabiner that joins the brake 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.180
 assisted with our ventral girl since 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.280
 can be in a position too 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.380
 transversal and as we said before 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.599
 this position before a fall is a 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.630
 situation of fragility for the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.459
 carabiner attentive so that it always remains 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.849
 in the correct position that is 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.730
 longitudinal this can be forwarded or 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.720
 mitigate using carabiner is that already 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.030
 are ready for the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.430
 brake positioning be the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.120
 correct do not miss the next 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.359
 tutorial we will continue talking about mistakes 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.750
 help us make the mountains more 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.750
 secure
