00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.120 
hope to get my hands on the super but
i'm<00:01:48.659> thinking<00:01:48.720> i'm<00:01:49.409> probably<00:01:49.710> gonna<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.070> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
i'm thinking i'm probably gonna have to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.789 
i'm thinking i'm probably gonna have to
get<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.369> off<00:01:50.460> ebay<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:50.939> something<00:01:51.329> because

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
get it off ebay or something because

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.590 
get it off ebay or something because
finding<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.159> nearly<00:01:53.670> impossible<00:01:54.439> but

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
finding it is nearly impossible but

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.700 
finding it is nearly impossible but
let's<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.930> ahead<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.170> open<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.500> thing

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
let's just go ahead and open this thing

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that there's a variance out there that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.570 
that there's a variance out there that
has<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> black<00:02:33.090> engine<00:02:33.860> but<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.010> one<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.340> not
