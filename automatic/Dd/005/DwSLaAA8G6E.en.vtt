played it the day it came out because a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
played it the day it came out because a
none<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:36.989> friends<00:00:37.140> actually<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.890> map

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
none of my friends actually have the map

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.220 
none of my friends actually have the map
pack<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:39.000> didn't<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:39.840> want<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> play

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
pack so I didn't really want to play

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.590 
pack so I didn't really want to play
alone<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.280> played<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.270> some

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
alone so I just played with them in some

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.680 
alone so I just played with them in some
team<00:00:42.840> deathmatch<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.860> also<00:00:44.219> double<00:00:44.850> XP

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
team deathmatch which was also double XP

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
team deathmatch which was also double XP
during<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> weekend<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
during the weekend I think it was a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.900 
during the weekend I think it was a
glitch<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> mistake<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.730> might

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
glitch or just a mistake but it might

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.060 
glitch or just a mistake but it might
have<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.210> been<00:00:51.420> who<00:00:51.600> knows<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.140> thought<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.949> was

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
have not been who knows I thought it was

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
have not been who knows I thought it was
the<00:00:53.670> double<00:00:53.940> XP<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> map<00:00:55.260> pack

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the double XP was just for the map pack

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
everyone just put 5 stars or 1 star
anyway<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.710> big<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.250> change

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520

have<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.360> UAV<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.710> believe<00:01:46.979> we

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
have a UAV up and actually I believe we

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.030 
have a UAV up and actually I believe we
just<00:01:47.369> had<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.729> UAB<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> same<00:01:49.140> time<00:01:49.500> due<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
just had to UAB at the same time due to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.850 
just had to UAB at the same time due to
a<00:01:50.540> lack<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> communication<00:01:52.500> when<00:01:52.649> putting

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
a lack of communication when putting

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.330 
a lack of communication when putting
them<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.939> um<00:01:54.090> our<00:01:54.659> rule<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.829> game<00:01:56.040> is

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
them up but um our rule for this game is

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.480 
them up but um our rule for this game is
all<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.030> friends<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:58.049> had<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.649> several<00:01:59.219> games

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
all of my friends we had a several games

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.999 
all of my friends we had a several games
where<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.689> made<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> rule<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.530> had<00:02:01.770> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
where we made the rule that you had to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.999 
where we made the rule that you had to
have<00:02:02.159> UAV<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.969> play<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.299> us<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:04.320> everyone

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
have UAV on to play with us so everyone

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.490 
have UAV on to play with us so everyone
in<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.340> game<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.689> my<00:02:06.780> party<00:02:07.170> which<00:02:07.380> i

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in this game that's in my party which i

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
in this game that's in my party which i
think<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.799> only<00:02:08.009> three<00:02:08.670> other<00:02:08.789> people<00:02:09.179> but

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
think is only three other people but

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.029 
think is only three other people but
that's<00:02:09.869> still<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> majority<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> team

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that's still the majority of the team

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.910 
that's still the majority of the team
has<00:02:11.310> UAV<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.270> believe<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.200> UAV

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
has UAV on I believe I have UAV

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.880 
has UAV on I believe I have UAV
harrier<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.760> pave<00:02:15.480> low<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.959> i'd<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.709> say

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
harrier and pave low and i'd like to say

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.070 
harrier and pave low and i'd like to say
that<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.819> IV<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.300> actually<00:02:18.840> better<00:02:18.959> than

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
that a you IV is actually better than

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.720 
that a you IV is actually better than
predator<00:02:19.440> missile<00:02:19.770> qatar<00:02:20.099> missile<00:02:20.459> usually

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
predator missile qatar missile usually

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.570 
predator missile qatar missile usually
get<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.970> one<00:02:21.180> maybe<00:02:21.450> two<00:02:21.510> kills<00:02:22.040> UAV<00:02:23.040> actually

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
get to one maybe two kills UAV actually

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.600 
get to one maybe two kills UAV actually
helps<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.970> ton<00:02:24.450> more<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> UAV

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
helps a ton more and if you have a UAV

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
helps a ton more and if you have a UAV
you're<00:02:26.910> getting<00:02:27.150> your<00:02:27.270> other<00:02:27.390> teammates<00:02:27.660> UAVs

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
you're getting your other teammates UAVs

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.770 
you're getting your other teammates UAVs
and<00:02:28.319> then<00:02:28.770> everyone<00:02:29.130> has<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> UAV<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and then everyone has a UAV and the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.890 
and then everyone has a UAV and the
games<00:02:31.050> are<00:02:31.440> super<00:02:32.310> easy<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.940> play<00:02:33.180> especially

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
games are super easy to play especially

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.990 
games are super easy to play especially
if<00:02:33.989> no<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:34.290> has<00:02:34.410> cold<00:02:34.650> blooded<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.130> they<00:02:35.280> do<00:02:35.340> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
if no one has cold blooded if they do it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.670 
if no one has cold blooded if they do it
doesn't<00:02:36.270> even<00:02:36.360> matter<00:02:36.540> because<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.530> never

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
doesn't even matter because you never

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.050 
doesn't even matter because you never
find<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.130> game<00:02:38.250> where<00:02:38.489> they<00:02:38.580> all<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.819> cold

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
find a game where they all have cold

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.229 
find a game where they all have cold
blooded<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:41.069> even<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.610> can<00:02:41.730> only<00:02:41.760> see<00:02:42.030> one

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
blooded so even if you can only see one

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.820 
blooded so even if you can only see one
that's<00:02:42.510> generally<00:02:43.200> where<00:02:43.349> they<00:02:43.530> spawn

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
that's generally where they spawn

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.229 
that's generally where they spawn
anyways<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:45.350> we<00:02:46.350> used<00:02:46.560> UAV<00:02:47.040> all<00:02:47.220> night<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.700> I

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
anyways so we used UAV all night and I

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.600 
anyways so we used UAV all night and I
think<00:02:48.300> we<00:02:48.630> went<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.470> crazy<00:02:50.100> winning

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
think we went on like a crazy winning

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.640 
think we went on like a crazy winning
streak<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.209> they<00:02:51.600> were<00:02:51.660> super<00:02:52.230> easy<00:02:52.350> game

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
streak and they were super easy game

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.380 
streak and they were super easy game
because<00:02:52.860> we<00:02:53.190> knew<00:02:53.340> exactly<00:02:53.730> where<00:02:54.180> they<00:02:54.330> were

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
because we knew exactly where they were

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
because we knew exactly where they were
so<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.799> are<00:02:56.540> playing<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:57.660> your<00:02:57.870> friends

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
so you are playing with your friends

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.680 
so you are playing with your friends
just<00:02:58.890> try<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.160> out<00:02:59.489> say<00:03:00.030> everyone<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> use

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
just try this out say everyone to use

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.780 
just try this out say everyone to use
UAV<00:03:01.200> at<00:03:01.350> first<00:03:01.620> everyone's<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.280> oh<00:03:02.459> no<00:03:03.590> UAV

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
UAV at first everyone's like oh no UAV

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.699 
UAV at first everyone's like oh no UAV
because<00:03:05.790> they<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.870> think<00:03:07.140> what<00:03:07.380> they<00:03:07.500> could

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
because they just think what they could

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.289 
because they just think what they could
get<00:03:07.920> say<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.340> they<00:03:08.459> had<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.790> predator

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
get say if they had that predator

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.940 
get say if they had that predator
missile<00:03:09.600> on<00:03:09.720> or<00:03:09.930> they<00:03:09.959> want<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.350> put<00:03:10.500> new<00:03:10.650> gone

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
missile on or they want to put new gone

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.670 
missile on or they want to put new gone
but<00:03:11.310> really<00:03:11.930> you'll<00:03:12.930> have<00:03:13.140> more<00:03:13.350> fun<00:03:13.410> with

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
but really you'll have more fun with

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.130 
but really you'll have more fun with
this<00:03:13.799> even<00:03:14.190> though<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.519> guess<00:03:15.060> if<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.110> think

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
this even though I guess if you think

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.039 
this even though I guess if you think
Nukus<00:03:16.680> phone<00:03:16.860> that'd<00:03:17.040> be<00:03:17.190> fine<00:03:17.670> just<00:03:18.049> tell

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
Nukus phone that'd be fine just tell

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.190 
Nukus phone that'd be fine just tell
them<00:03:19.260> if<00:03:19.560> they<00:03:19.739> want<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:19.980> use<00:03:20.070> nuke<00:03:20.310> just<00:03:20.579> used

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
them if they want to use nuke just used

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.370 
them if they want to use nuke just used
chopper<00:03:22.200> gunner<00:03:22.380> nuke<00:03:22.709> UAV<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.900> no<00:03:25.230> one

chopper gunner nuke UAV but that no one
did<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.890> don't<00:03:26.160> think<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:26.760> maybe<00:03:27.510> I'll<00:03:27.690> do

raffica because I actually ran out of

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.500 
raffica because I actually ran out of
ammo<00:03:36.750> with<00:03:37.049> my<00:03:37.200> fam<00:03:37.470> asst<00:03:37.680> because<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:39.150> have

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
ammo with my fam asst because I have

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.630 
ammo with my fam asst because I have
bling<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.079> because<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:40.829> love<00:03:41.070> having<00:03:41.459> a

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
silencer and the red dot is pretty nice

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.120 
silencer and the red dot is pretty nice
too<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.600> believe<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.290> actually<00:03:46.440> died<00:03:46.829> with

place<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.699> right<00:05:22.820> spot<00:05:22.880> or<00:05:23.330> don't<00:05:23.479> get

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
place it in the right spot or don't get

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.650 
place it in the right spot or don't get
lucky<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.699> reason<00:05:25.880> I<00:05:26.120> call<00:05:26.300> this<00:05:26.419> pavelow

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
lucky so the reason I call this pavelow

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.300 
lucky so the reason I call this pavelow
so<00:05:26.960> early<00:05:27.289> it's<00:05:27.410> just<00:05:27.560> because<00:05:27.860> if<00:05:28.039> you<00:05:28.160> look

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
so early it's just because if you look

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.300 
so early it's just because if you look
at<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:28.430> point<00:05:28.669> it's<00:05:29.289> 6500<00:05:30.289> so<00:05:30.680> there's<00:05:31.160> only

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
at the point it's 6500 so there's only

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.960 
at the point it's 6500 so there's only
like<00:05:31.840> 15<00:05:32.840> kills<00:05:33.169> left<00:05:33.500> or<00:05:33.710> 10<00:05:33.949> kills<00:05:34.280> left<00:05:34.550> yes

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
like 15 kills left or 10 kills left yes

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.320 
like 15 kills left or 10 kills left yes
10<00:05:35.240> kills<00:05:35.539> left<00:05:35.810> and<00:05:36.080> i<00:05:36.830> actually<00:05:37.099> have<00:05:37.880> never

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
10 kills left and i actually have never

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.210 
10 kills left and i actually have never
had<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.900> spawns<00:05:39.199> like<00:05:39.440> this<00:05:39.620> we<00:05:39.860> actually

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
had the spawns like this we actually

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.370 
had the spawns like this we actually
have<00:05:40.340> them<00:05:40.460> in<00:05:40.639> a<00:05:40.669> spawn<00:05:40.970> trap<00:05:41.360> on<00:05:41.630> this<00:05:42.020> side

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
have them in a spawn trap on this side

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.589 
have them in a spawn trap on this side
like<00:05:42.800> this<00:05:42.830> so<00:05:43.610> I'm<00:05:43.699> just<00:05:43.729> staying<00:05:44.150> here<00:05:44.479> in

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
like this so I'm just staying here in

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.810 
like this so I'm just staying here in
case<00:05:44.810> they<00:05:44.840> come<00:05:45.050> into<00:05:45.320> that<00:05:45.530> house<00:05:45.820> because

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
case they come into that house because

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.689 
case they come into that house because
um<00:05:47.080> they<00:05:48.080> are<00:05:48.260> actually<00:05:48.530> being<00:05:48.979> pressed<00:05:49.340> back

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
um they are actually being pressed back

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.810 
um they are actually being pressed back
really<00:05:50.419> far<00:05:50.720> enough<00:05:51.500> i<00:05:51.710> move<00:05:51.919> past<00:05:52.340> that<00:05:52.610> house

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
really far enough i move past that house

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.700 
really far enough i move past that house
then<00:05:53.150> they'll<00:05:53.300> start<00:05:53.539> spawning<00:05:53.900> behind<00:05:54.409> us<00:05:54.590> on

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
then they'll start spawning behind us on

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.990 
then they'll start spawning behind us on
the<00:05:54.830> other<00:05:54.949> side<00:05:55.250> which<00:05:55.520> would<00:05:55.699> be<00:05:55.760> bad<00:05:55.940> for

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
the other side which would be bad for

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.730 
the other side which would be bad for
the<00:05:56.330> two<00:05:56.510> people<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.780> aren't<00:05:57.199> on<00:05:57.289> our<00:05:57.500> team

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
the two people that aren't on our team

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.460 
the two people that aren't on our team
because<00:05:58.430> then<00:05:58.760> they'll<00:05:58.940> die<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.510> no<00:06:00.320> one

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
because then they'll die and no one

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.930 
because then they'll die and no one
really<00:06:00.500> likes<00:06:00.710> killing<00:06:01.130> their<00:06:01.310> teammates<00:06:01.699> and

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
really likes killing their teammates and

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.210 
really likes killing their teammates and
here<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.479> UAV<00:06:02.870> helped<00:06:03.139> me<00:06:03.260> once<00:06:03.440> again<00:06:03.650> I<00:06:03.830> got

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
here the UAV helped me once again I got

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.820 
here the UAV helped me once again I got
that<00:06:04.400> really<00:06:04.639> nice<00:06:04.880> kill<00:06:05.330> on<00:06:05.510> him<00:06:05.900> he<00:06:06.500> was<00:06:06.620> kind

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
that really nice kill on him he was kind

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.100 
that really nice kill on him he was kind
of<00:06:06.889> unsuspecting<00:06:07.610> about<00:06:07.849> it<00:06:08.000> and<00:06:08.210> I'm<00:06:08.810> stuck

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
of unsuspecting about it and I'm stuck

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.409 
of unsuspecting about it and I'm stuck
with<00:06:09.260> my<00:06:09.380> wrath<00:06:09.620> Luka<00:06:09.949> again<00:06:10.220> and<00:06:10.580> you'll<00:06:11.240> see

with my wrath Luka again and you'll see
here<00:06:11.889> after<00:06:12.889> this<00:06:13.039> kill<00:06:13.340> I<00:06:13.610> am<00:06:14.150> casing<00:06:14.840> this

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
here after this kill I am casing this

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.350 
here after this kill I am casing this
dude<00:06:15.289> and<00:06:15.650> it<00:06:16.280> would<00:06:16.490> have<00:06:16.610> been<00:06:16.669> a<00:06:16.729> pretty

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
dude and it would have been a pretty

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.390 
dude and it would have been a pretty
funny<00:06:17.750> last<00:06:18.050> kill<00:06:18.380> because<00:06:18.800> he<00:06:18.979> never<00:06:19.099> knew

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
funny last kill because he never knew

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.839 
funny last kill because he never knew
but<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:21.110> game<00:06:21.349> ended<00:06:21.830> and<00:06:22.130> we<00:06:22.159> actually

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
but the game ended and we actually

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.629 
but the game ended and we actually
pretty<00:06:23.449> much<00:06:23.659> dominated<00:06:24.409> them<00:06:24.740> with<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.250> UAV

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
pretty much dominated them with the UAV

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.700 
pretty much dominated them with the UAV
so<00:06:25.849> I<00:06:25.880> have<00:06:26.210> a<00:06:26.240> couple<00:06:26.659> more<00:06:26.900> games<00:06:27.139> coming<00:06:27.560> out

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710
