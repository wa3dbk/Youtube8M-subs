the<00:01:49.890> elite<00:01:50.430> quarterbacks<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.329> think

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the elite quarterbacks but I think

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that's gonna mess him up number two

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.280 
that's gonna mess him up number two
