00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.790
 other cops is a bombshell just 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.590
 but before it explodes we'll hear 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.590
 the official version is right 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.629
 lay you have to stop boring like that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.629
 the wall this city is not a Swiss cheese 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.829
 politicization 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.750
 always is 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.550
 it was you who promised me that this 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.649
 I would change that there would be a bastard like you 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.730
 to apply it the laws are not bad 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.730
 but the people that the applications 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.990
 they want to exclude us from their society 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.130
 we have our hardest and strongest and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.130
 It works very well as it is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 and stop boring the wall yes no 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.860
 It will be who we will turn into a colander 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.539
 Mr. President and that video reaches 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.189
 know the whole country will rise and already 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.350
 we have enough problems to 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.049
 add one more I go to the top of the g-10 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.000
 in rio de janeiro two days is the time 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.009
 that I give to solve this case with 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.719
 the biggest clear distraction is of what 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.250
 by Mr. President, we do it to 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.720
 the old one 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.720
 go down to the old 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.500
 take delight not to take risks 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.280
 he's out of control 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.120
 have another idea
