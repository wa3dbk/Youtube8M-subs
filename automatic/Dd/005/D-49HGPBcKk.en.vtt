00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
be dope and all black I think it'd be

be dope and all black I think it'd be
really<00:02:34.950> sick<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.310> would<00:02:35.460> probably<00:02:35.640> actually

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
really sick I would probably actually

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.090 
really sick I would probably actually
wear<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:36.570> but<00:02:37.290> anyways<00:02:37.590> back<00:02:37.620> onto<00:02:37.980> the
