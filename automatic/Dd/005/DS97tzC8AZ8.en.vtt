00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello girls how are the day is something 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.890
 started in the title what I took in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.559
 my little steel card when I go on a trip 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.450
 and then let's have us already 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.780
 on vacation if we are not almost going to 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.699
 go on vacation and good many times 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.390
 shares is synonymous as to travel 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.100
 go out sunbathing go to the beach and in the end 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 river not without where, but for my 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.750
 it implies thinking in hot ground and in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.269
 Tan and leave blank then 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.740
 the day dancing to bring clips and all the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.660
 whistles lead to extras of toilet views 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 to take care of my skin because although 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.600
 let's be on vacation does not mean that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.969
 we have to stop taking care of the skin 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.140
 it is more is very important to take care of it 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.469
 also on vacation 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.190

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.190

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.380
 Panthene shampoos and obviously I have 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.800

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.440
 when I go on vacation like to 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.390
 feel at the beach and good night towards 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.970

 used a couple of times and I love 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.140
 Besides, it's super important that they continue 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.320
 the hot earth and we will use 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.180

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.650
 our skin feels super soft 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.750
 then it is super important that the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.430
 exfoliates moss with any usually anti 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.410
 that they use the natural society to 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.630
 super important to exfoliate and when 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.810
 we explain it after we do not listen 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.259
 the cream and there is the almond oil 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.420
 that this is like the same team 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.130
 same little group and is super smooth and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 also that after exfoliating the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.690

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.230
 baby 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.150

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.879
 Doctors recommend laurencia de sol yo 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.459

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.510
 a blocker a first machine that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.550
 there will be a group launched to have 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.180
 a little more for 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.640
 but I do not recommend it at all but that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.770
 yes everyone has their skin and knows it 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.840
 use and remember to use a little 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.710

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.830
 I do not have that good time but they say 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.710

 it's super important how they style in 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.159
 our calculation is that soft that the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.810

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.569
 use a student that is terrific 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.400
