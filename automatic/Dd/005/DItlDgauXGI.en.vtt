00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 hi everyone with you i'm misha today i can 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:13.620
 call the computer in one of the previous 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.890
 our videos about raising fps bottle 4 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.880
 I promised to make a release about how I 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:26.010
 broke up your bye 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:29.359
 and today it is this day that went so 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.610
 we are going to overclock our processor and 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.950
 the first thing we need to do for this 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.500
 find out what kind of processor we have for 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.260
 This download program sepia z 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.219
 link is available in the description and see 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.280
 processor model 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.640
 I have mdf x 4100 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.870
 we also need a clock frequency 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.500
 bus frequency multiplier 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.149
 core voltage is more to us in this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.149
 the program does not need anything 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.500
 CPU overclocking implies a concept 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.839
 clock frequency clock frequency 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.330
 consists of the product of the multiplier by 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.729
 frequency of lice and that is, you need to go to bios 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 and can boost or bus frequency 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.540
 but before that you need to do a little 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.180
 homework see how much 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.900
 experienced people managed to disperse it 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.960
 your processor go to overclockers.ru 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.909
 and look for an article about your processor, I found 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.409
 an article 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.250
 where it was tested a lot 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.220
 CPU and watch the regular mode 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.740
 clock frequency is 3,600 megahertz yes it is 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.030
 exactly what our processor can even 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.920
 check bus frequency 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.009
 with the older 200 hertz look with us too 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.100
 200 megahertz as we can see the guys succeeded 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.860
 break up to 4600 megahertz but not worth it 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.720
 forget that they have something that they don't have 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.270
 us costly cooling and 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.270
 tremendous experience to enable 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.250
 bios we both boot computers dive 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.060
 very, very, very many times we press 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.060
 a case button 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.380
 this is the computer turned on and run our 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.600
 friend brother visited z as we see 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:05.470
 frequency has become 4075 megahertz frequency 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:09.550
 tires 225 that is, we broke up a little 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.240
 our processor should be happy should 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.040
 still check our computer on 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.799
 stability for this download 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:23.130
 programs throughout the network link is available in 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.130
 description and test our computer 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:32.160
 for the full test we need 1 hour 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.340
 that is, set the duration of one hour 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.770
 time we run the test and 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.910
 need to keep track of these windows which 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.640
 sleep processor frequency should be on 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.620
 level one that is not to fall sharply 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.540
 rise by date abruptly rise 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.670
 Everything should be smooth streaking. 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.060
 direct and temperature should not exceed 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.220
 70 degrees is very important because 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.130
 at this temperature can deteriorate 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.300
 by processes 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.030
 so we run the test and wait for 1 h 1 lose 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.590
 looking at the temperature 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:14.340
 if you have a computer is not zaglyuchil not 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:18.289
 reboot not shut down then it means 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.169
 overclocking should after 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.499
 Testing program will give you here 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.710
 Such are de cut consider the income 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:29.569
 in the middle will be only on now.ru 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.789
 look at all de security if you have on 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.699
 all written new rock means ringing 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.899
 success in everyday life to someone not 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:48.020
 will fly out due to overheating whitens 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:50.029
 because of the seeker Petrov and since you 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.539
 saw the process of overclocking a computer through 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:56.089
 bios is very simple so try 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.770
 but do not overdo it because always 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.050
 there is a risk to spoil 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.639
 some of your parts yet 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.550
 write in the comments 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:08.050
