since I put this in there she did kind

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.550 
since I put this in there she did kind
of<00:01:36.250> tip<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.610> a<00:01:36.670> bit<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.240> what<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.479> did<00:01:37.600> instill

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
of tip it a bit so what I did instill

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.070 
of tip it a bit so what I did instill
somewhat<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.810> added<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:42.390> strong<00:01:43.390> magnet<00:01:43.869> made

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
somewhat it I added a strong magnet made

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.109 
somewhat it I added a strong magnet made
by<00:01:44.229> zoom<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.799> is<00:01:44.950> very<00:01:45.189> strong<00:01:45.579> and<00:01:45.880> then

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
by zoom it it is very strong and then

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.300 
by zoom it it is very strong and then
I've<00:01:46.270> also<00:01:46.479> added<00:01:46.810> some<00:01:47.380> more<00:01:47.709> electrical

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
I've also added some more electrical

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.240 
I've also added some more electrical
ties<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.909> it<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.409> should<00:01:50.770> keep<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.130> in

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
ties to it so that should keep it in

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.559 
ties to it so that should keep it in
place<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.259> I've<00:01:53.259> added<00:01:53.409> more<00:01:53.770> gravel<00:01:54.569> trying

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
place and I've added more gravel trying

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.449 
place and I've added more gravel trying
to<00:01:55.780> Bank<00:01:56.079> in<00:01:56.259> a<00:01:56.319> bit<00:01:56.500> as<00:01:56.709> well<00:01:56.920> as<00:01:57.069> some<00:01:57.220> drift

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
to Bank in a bit as well as some drift

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.969 
to Bank in a bit as well as some drift
went<00:01:57.670> down<00:01:57.819> there<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.409> as<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.560> can<00:01:59.649> see<00:01:59.829> she

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
went down there so as you can see she

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.949 
went down there so as you can see she
just<00:02:00.009> climbed<00:02:00.340> up<00:02:00.489> there<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.630> didn't<00:02:01.869> even

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
just climbed up there and it didn't even

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.779 
just climbed up there and it didn't even
move<00:02:04.679> she's<00:02:05.679> a<00:02:05.770> very<00:02:05.890> friendly<00:02:06.099> turtle<00:02:06.579> I<00:02:06.640> have

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
move she's a very friendly turtle I have

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.630 
move she's a very friendly turtle I have
to<00:02:06.939> say<00:02:07.649> something<00:02:08.649> else<00:02:08.890> I've<00:02:09.039> added<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.579> a

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
to say something else I've added is a

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.449 
to say something else I've added is a
piece<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.239> bamboo<00:02:10.620> and<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.739> goes<00:02:11.980> almost<00:02:12.160> all

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
piece of bamboo and that goes almost all

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.180 
piece of bamboo and that goes almost all
the<00:02:12.639> way<00:02:12.730> down<00:02:12.940> from<00:02:13.120> bottom<00:02:13.480> by<00:02:13.600> two<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:15.040> we'll

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
the way down from bottom by two so we'll

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.039 
the way down from bottom by two so we'll
see<00:02:15.310> how<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.459> does<00:02:15.819> she<00:02:16.120> may<00:02:16.269> try<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.510> get<00:02:16.810> she

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
see how that does she may try to get she

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:24.240 
see how that does she may try to get she
may<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.880> afraid<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.970> try<00:02:19.180> it

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.490 

so<00:02:24.790> next<00:02:25.060> step<00:02:25.210> is<00:02:25.510> building<00:02:25.660> Howard<00:02:26.200> one<00:02:26.410> of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
so next step is building Howard one of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.580 
so next step is building Howard one of
those<00:02:26.650> jobs<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.130> well

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
those jobs as well

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.240 
those jobs as well
