00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:09.150
 There are Hello oversized 123 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.410
 I would like to continue doing It is a hot player in not saw in the previous video 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.769
 I went to buy a guitar a little while now I came to Ishibashi instrument 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 Ne 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.850
 I do things that I bought a little I thought it would be good garden goods that say this is an even 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.810
 This and if you look at all means that I also I'd such that Datte What 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.920
 Moe about such a thing is relaxed fan pick not 10 years 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.660
 I feel like I already had a guitar, but I collaborated with a small guitar 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.290
 I though there'm such mean things are 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.790
 It seems're also white guy that I Relax ish do that made it to the south motif 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.690
 But it feels like I'm printing because my sister is touching because the character is dark . 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.840
 I mean there 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.840
 Feeling rough 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.760
 It seems like that feels like having a non- slip role 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.180
 It is such a feeling that it is not bad at all quite like a tether and a pile Dian pick of the sender 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.220
 I feel a little thicker compared to 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.670
 So Well, I feel it 's such a close to or heavy I say in Midiamupikku of Fender 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.829
 To do 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.370
 I said that it was good for picks of characters but now it's time to go 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.400
 I wonder how practical it is, but I would like to use it from now on 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.480
 2 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.480
 I think it's pretty catchy and unnaturally smooth in the sense 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.590
 If you get it just because you get too stuck 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 Great 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.630
 ana 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.130
 car 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.969
 me 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.969

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.180
 Hmm 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.660

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.629
 bea 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.629
 car 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.769
 Well if sensibility get there was a feeling it 's such there is considerable work in than a major 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.730
 I felt that I could make a smooth stroke Even when I played one string one string 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.140
 About this caught was there a great good day consuming condition also I have and everyone is your favorite 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.280
 It may be a place where it divides widely, but the pick of the character thing is absolutely 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.390
 I feel that there is a place to focus on design 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.600
 I wonder if it might not come with a pin, but there was also such a feeling 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.790
 There was a feeling that practicality was also firm 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.770
 Well, it is good only for this pick, but actually it is used as an accessory to Mr. Yoshida 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 Mr. Yoshida, especially family 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.270
 Ne 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.110
 It is a character thing 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:13.640
 There is a feeling that various processings and variations are increasing. 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.390
 Let's think that there is something that will be fun even if you pick a pick 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.450
 I said this as a devil pick as one of the flowers I say so, but by all means 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.230
 You actually try it this way or join us 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.260
 By whether not it good to try to take advantage of that way to think that 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.910
 Well also next time now 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.810
 I want to live in the city off the table 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.810
 It is about that time
