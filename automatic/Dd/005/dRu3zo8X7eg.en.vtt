00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
dry channel which I'll really only use

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.350 
dry channel which I'll really only use
it<00:02:42.850> for<00:02:42.900> teatime<00:02:43.900> bit<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.200> grit<00:02:45.180> here<00:02:46.180> that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360
