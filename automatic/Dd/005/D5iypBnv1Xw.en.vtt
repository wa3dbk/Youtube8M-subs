have the iPad air here as you can see

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.759 
have the iPad air here as you can see
it's<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.850> working<00:02:46.299> hopefully<00:02:47.260> yeah<00:02:47.560> it's

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
it's it's working hopefully yeah it's

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.130 
it's it's working hopefully yeah it's
working<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.610> then<00:02:49.239> just<00:02:49.480> snap<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.019> two

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
working and then just snap the two

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.330 
working and then just snap the two
pieces<00:02:50.380> together<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:53.190> specifications<00:02:54.190> for

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
pieces together the specifications for

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.620 
pieces together the specifications for
this<00:02:54.489> case<00:02:54.730> are<00:02:55.230> 6.6<00:02:56.230> feet<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:57.400> 30<00:02:57.970> minutes<00:02:58.510> so

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
this case are 6.6 feet for 30 minutes so

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.380 
this case are 6.6 feet for 30 minutes so
it<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:58.870> be<00:02:59.350> submergible<00:03:00.070> up<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.060> depth

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
it can be submergible up to that depth

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.340 
it can be submergible up to that depth
so<00:03:01.900> I'm<00:03:02.019> going<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.590> start<00:03:03.450> video<00:03:04.450> here<00:03:04.930> okay<00:03:05.320> so

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
video here and like I said before make

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.390 
video here and like I said before make
sure<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.690> dry<00:03:53.959> off<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.680> entire<00:03:54.950> case

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
sure that you dry off the entire case

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.180 
sure that you dry off the entire case
very<00:03:55.880> carefully<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.620> don't<00:03:57.800> splash

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
very carefully so that you don't splash

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.030 
very carefully so that you don't splash
the<00:03:58.700> water<00:03:58.880> from<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.330> outside<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.959> inside

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
the water from the outside on the inside

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.150 
the water from the outside on the inside
so<00:04:01.040> when<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.550> have<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.940> dried<00:04:02.330> as<00:04:02.950> much<00:04:03.950> as

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
so when you have it dried as much as

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.759 
so when you have it dried as much as
possible<00:04:04.540> there's<00:04:05.540> always<00:04:05.810> going<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.260> be<00:04:06.380> some

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
possible there's always going to be some

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.090 
possible there's always going to be some
water<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.310> these<00:04:08.140> grades<00:04:09.140> here<00:04:09.590> where<00:04:09.890> the

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
water in these grades here where the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.000 
water in these grades here where the
speaker<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:11.180> mic<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.750> but<00:04:12.739> there's<00:04:12.920> a

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
speaker and the mic is but there's a

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.860 
speaker and the mic is but there's a
mesh<00:04:13.340> on<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.640> inside<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:14.330> should<00:04:14.510> prevent

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
mesh on the inside that should prevent

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.870 
mesh on the inside that should prevent
the<00:04:14.989> water<00:04:15.200> from<00:04:15.350> seeping<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.459> we'll

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
the water from seeping in and we'll

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.280 
the water from seeping in and we'll
check<00:04:17.150> if<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.450> latch<00:04:17.600> has<00:04:17.840> any<00:04:18.049> water<00:04:20.290> there

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
check if the latch has any water there

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.340 
check if the latch has any water there
is<00:04:21.440> some<00:04:21.650> water<00:04:21.859> on<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.370> latch<00:04:22.580> hinges<00:04:23.570> but

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
is some water on the latch hinges but

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.580 
is some water on the latch hinges but
there<00:04:24.530> isn't<00:04:24.890> any<00:04:25.130> water<00:04:25.430> on<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.910> actual

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
there isn't any water on the actual

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.870 
there isn't any water on the actual
waterproof<00:04:27.590> gasket<00:04:28.160> which<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.610> orange

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
waterproof gasket which is this orange

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.310 
waterproof gasket which is this orange
part<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.740> I'm<00:04:30.800> going<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.190> use<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.970> pair<00:04:32.390> of<00:04:32.419> pivot

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
part so I'm going to use a pair of pivot

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.830 
part so I'm going to use a pair of pivot
head<00:04:33.530> glasses<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.340> we<00:04:34.640> got<00:04:35.090> from<00:04:35.330> pivot<00:04:35.630> head

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
head glasses that we got from pivot head

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.860 
head glasses that we got from pivot head
and<00:04:36.110> they<00:04:36.979> basically<00:04:37.340> our<00:04:37.940> point<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.810> view

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
and they basically our point of view

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.020 
and they basically our point of view
shots<00:04:39.770> so<00:04:39.979> there's<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.220> camera<00:04:40.580> right<00:04:40.760> in<00:04:40.940> the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
shots so there's a camera right in the

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.130 
shots so there's a camera right in the
middle<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.450> glasses<00:04:41.950> so<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.900> can<00:04:44.900> see

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
middle of the glasses so you can see

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.830 
middle of the glasses so you can see
what<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.860> see<00:04:46.280> right<00:04:46.520> here<00:04:46.970> if<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:47.510> hold<00:04:47.720> it

glance<00:05:04.630> there<00:05:05.139> isn't<00:05:05.860> any<00:05:06.130> water<00:05:06.460> on<00:05:06.789> the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
glance there isn't any water on the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.110 
glance there isn't any water on the
inside<00:05:07.389> on<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:07.660> front<00:05:08.169> of<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.500> iPad<00:05:09.190> air<00:05:09.430> so

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
inside on the front of the iPad air so

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.400 
inside on the front of the iPad air so
I'm<00:05:10.210> going<00:05:10.389> to<00:05:10.449> look<00:05:10.690> at<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:11.020> front<00:05:11.350> here<00:05:11.919> and

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
I'm going to look at the front here and

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.670 
I'm going to look at the front here and
know

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
know

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.770 
know
so<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.100> splashes<00:05:15.729> that<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:16.030> see<00:05:16.300> here<00:05:16.660> is

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
so the splashes that you see here is

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.090 
so the splashes that you see here is
actually<00:05:16.990> on<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.440> outside<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.979> it's

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
actually on the outside and it's

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.939 
actually on the outside and it's
probably<00:05:18.310> me<00:05:19.210> from<00:05:19.539> ripping<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.500> pieces

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
probably me from ripping the pieces

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.879 
probably me from ripping the pieces
together<00:05:21.130> apart<00:05:21.789> I<00:05:22.030> mean<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:23.380> there<00:05:23.770> is

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
together apart I mean so there is

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.890 
together apart I mean so there is
nothing<00:05:24.580> that<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:24.850> see<00:05:25.150> here

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
nothing that I see here

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.230 
nothing that I see here
let's<00:05:26.110> check<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:27.030> headphone<00:05:28.030> jack<00:05:30.240> there's

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
let's check the headphone jack there's

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.689 
let's check the headphone jack there's
no<00:05:31.479> water<00:05:31.750> there<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.410> I<00:05:32.440> can<00:05:32.710> see<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.550> the

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
no water there that I can see so the

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.719 
no water there that I can see so the
iPad<00:05:34.150> air<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:35.110> front<00:05:35.470> of<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:35.860> is<00:05:36.039> completely

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
iPad air the front of it is completely

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.589 
iPad air the front of it is completely
dry<00:05:37.240> so<00:05:38.199> I'm<00:05:38.259> just<00:05:38.440> gonna<00:05:38.620> flip<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.759> there

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
dry so I'm just gonna flip it and there

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.529 
dry so I'm just gonna flip it and there
is<00:05:40.900> no<00:05:41.169> water<00:05:41.380> that<00:05:41.500> you<00:05:41.680> can<00:05:41.889> see<00:05:44.970> so<00:05:45.970> you

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
is no water that you can see so you

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.270

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
basically want to check all of the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.310

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
jack opening the camera all of the

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.020 
jack opening the camera all of the
meshes<00:05:53.289> and<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:56.080> bottom<00:05:56.440> around<00:05:56.710> here<00:05:57.490> where

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
meshes and the bottom around here where

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.670 
meshes and the bottom around here where
their<00:05:58.240> openings<00:05:58.720> are<00:05:59.050> so<00:05:59.289> as<00:05:59.380> you<00:05:59.470> can<00:05:59.620> see

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
there's water droplets around the edges

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.450 
there's water droplets around the edges
and<00:06:03.599> but<00:06:04.599> they<00:06:04.780> are<00:06:05.020> on<00:06:05.199> the<00:06:05.349> outside<00:06:05.380> of<00:06:06.340> the

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
and but they are on the outside of the

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.020 
and but they are on the outside of the
o-ring<00:06:06.940> which<00:06:07.330> is<00:06:07.599> okay<00:06:08.289> if<00:06:09.070> you<00:06:09.340> have<00:06:09.610> water

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
o-ring which is okay if you have water

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.870 
o-ring which is okay if you have water
outside<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.900> o-rings<00:06:11.320> that<00:06:12.190> is<00:06:12.340> fine<00:06:12.610> as<00:06:12.849> long

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
outside the o-rings that is fine as long

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.540 
outside the o-rings that is fine as long
as<00:06:13.270> it's<00:06:13.449> not<00:06:13.659> on<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.289> actual<00:06:14.500> inside<00:06:15.310> of<00:06:15.460> the

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
as it's not on the actual inside of the

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.469 
as it's not on the actual inside of the
