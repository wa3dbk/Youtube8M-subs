00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.700
 I'm here today with my Polish friend who 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:21.840
 always good 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.750
 Today the party is going on with crab 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 provide a fishing and packed 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.199
 it takes the south or it is this fishery 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.800
 today I'm going to teach you one 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.950
 that is not a new method is a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 which is widely used in the interior 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.620
 of São Paulo the fishing of piapara then I 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.730
 I will teach you more or less how it is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:59.989
 common see first you will remove 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:01:02.550
 all the crab legs 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:14.880
 how I'm fishing with a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:18.900
 line from 12 to 17 pounds low and then 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.189
 lead has to stay on the ground a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.420
 generator that will separate luti line 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:33.619
 at a flow rate of about 15 about 30 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.619
 30cm is the big secret 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.090
 or inep 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:48.360
 inside that side the pain 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.070
 it contains 2 11 that go in the crab 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.259
 Now I will explain to you how it is that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 we do this is this grandparents fixation 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:03.450
 no crab 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:07.050
 so let's get crab does has 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.580
 his cockpit here you start 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.319
 so opened here shot still had not 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.950
 known in the week 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.760
 So what do you do? Will you open it well? 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.959
 carapace of a hole of preference 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 To use a knife, this daughter is a knife. 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.959
 the wood it will serve as a guide 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.709
 to pass precisely this encapsulation 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:41.489
 inside the crab or else you go 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.489
 catch here will pass the other side 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 This is the time. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.550
 in fact the time to fix what 11 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.780
 elderly people go wine or in a way of 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:03.250
 one side you put on the other side you 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:06.670
 puts it because when the fish 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.130
 it hits the other side of the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.739
 Are you going to have more chances? 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.850
 success in this fishing because pacu 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.130
 piavuçu it tends to destroy the risk 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.530
 then automatically hit here the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:31.560
 hit here it will be made 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:31.560
 there you get her here you and me 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.930
 ready soon soon I'll come 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.519
 new plus other tips is and 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.540
 preference with the fish to 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.730
 show you who are here 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.500
 It works, it's very much here.
