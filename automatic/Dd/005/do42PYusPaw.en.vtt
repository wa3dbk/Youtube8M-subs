00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.650
 the final 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.530
 it takes in planned destruction but we do not see why place 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.759

 once again 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 he is pale 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:44.169
 the problem

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:03.830
 Stephen Harper 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.770
 by this action really 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.349
 almost 20% 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.680
 that's an order 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 this year in 1900 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.949

 it helps fight the blues 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.259
 so although you are well belga the women's team me on a board 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.070
 it is better that he can warned them the stands 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.470

 our average income whether it's on the side-by-side 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.229
 so you can why 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.760
 frankly but the same 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.760

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.029
 the strong franc 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:13.779
 like 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.089
 there is not really a lot of people on melbourne 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:19.930
 the causes and the date is often 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.550
 ordinarily 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.550
 Tottenham surprises

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.150
 It's done 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.539
 takuma sato wears well 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.560
 that's why it's important to see a screeching farm 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.279
 ask to close or stop 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.360
 in Frankfurt 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.360
 for jean-paul rouve there are people 

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:15.839

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:20.559
 we expect more gameplay come with their bodies 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.529

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.469
 among others 

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:49.529
 so 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:52.930
 Europe advances three more in June so still 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.210
 for example 

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.210
 Community myopia
