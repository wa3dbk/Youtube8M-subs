00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
see everything's pretty even I think I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
see everything's pretty even I think I
slightly<00:02:06.240> overcooked<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.260> bit<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
slightly overcooked them a little bit I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.660 
slightly overcooked them a little bit I
should<00:02:07.800> have<00:02:07.890> probably<00:02:07.979> taken<00:02:08.220> them<00:02:08.490> off<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
should have probably taken them off a

should have probably taken them off a
minute<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.149> two<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.810> least<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.979> stake<00:02:11.280> here

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
minute or two at least this stake here

all right I'll meet you back at my table
for<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.410> zoom<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.890> as<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:59.510> can<00:02:59.600> see<00:02:59.780> by<00:02:59.900> the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
for a zoom in as you can see by the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.650 
for a zoom in as you can see by the
bottom<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.380> pizza<00:03:00.770> I'd<00:03:01.520> say<00:03:01.790> profire<00:03:02.330> is

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
bottom of the pizza I'd say profire is

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.820 
bottom of the pizza I'd say profire is
fairly<00:03:03.170> efficient<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:03.980> cooking<00:03:04.910> evenly<00:03:05.270> it<00:03:05.830> is

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
fairly efficient at cooking evenly it is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.850 
fairly efficient at cooking evenly it is
a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.730> just<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.390> hair<00:03:08.660> darker<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.440> area

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
a little just a hair darker in this area

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.160 
a little just a hair darker in this area
than<00:03:10.490> in<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.790> area<00:03:11.180> this<00:03:11.360> was<00:03:11.540> probably<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
than in this area this was probably the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.760 
than in this area this was probably the
very<00:03:12.680> front<00:03:13.190> by<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.460> front<00:03:13.820> door<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.470> mean

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
very front by the front door but I mean

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.410 
very front by the front door but I mean
you<00:03:15.800> have<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.160> look<00:03:16.490> very<00:03:16.550> closely<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.240> even

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
you have to look very closely to even

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.820 
you have to look very closely to even
see<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:17.840> other<00:03:18.140> than<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.410> everything

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
see that other than that everything

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.070 
see that other than that everything
looks<00:03:18.950> exactly<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.550> same<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:20.210> I<00:03:20.390> would<00:03:20.900> say<00:03:21.020> it

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
looks exactly the same so I would say it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.110 
looks exactly the same so I would say it
definitely<00:03:21.410> passes<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.370> evenness<00:03:22.850> test

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
definitely passes the the evenness test

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.420 
definitely passes the the evenness test
I<00:03:23.420> hope<00:03:24.020> you<00:03:24.200> enjoyed<00:03:24.470> watching<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.980> profire
