00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.759 
much frosting should you add to each
cake<00:00:11.550> now<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.540> depends<00:00:13.139> because<00:00:13.469> every

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
cake now that depends because every

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
cake now that depends because every
cakes<00:00:13.980> different<00:00:14.429> some<00:00:14.610> invoice<00:00:14.849> some<00:00:15.179> are

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
cakes different some invoice some are

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.269 
cakes different some invoice some are
dry<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.139> not<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.350> easier<00:00:16.800> question<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
dry so it's not that easier question to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.340 
dry so it's not that easier question to
answer<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:18.240> today<00:00:18.600> I'm<00:00:18.750> making<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.170> easy

of<00:01:35.430> moist<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.259> take

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
of moist so now all you do is you take

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.030 
of moist so now all you do is you take
the<00:01:37.590> cake<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:39.540> scrunch<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:41.240> into<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> bowl

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.170 
the cake and you scrunch it into a bowl
and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.600> I'm<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> grab<00:01:46.049> this

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
and then I'm going to grab this

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.070 
and then I'm going to grab this
ready-made<00:01:48.180> frosting<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.020> calendar<00:01:49.530> packet

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:04.050 

squeeze<00:01:53.860> as<00:01:54.040> much<00:01:54.220> out<00:01:54.460> as<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.700> can<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:03.550> just

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
squeeze as much out as I can and just

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.700 
squeeze as much out as I can and just
mix<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.390> together<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.580> bit<00:02:09.760> messy<00:02:10.710> but

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
mix it together it's a bit messy but

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:38.040 
mix it together it's a bit messy but
that's<00:02:11.860> what<00:02:12.010> makes<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.280> good<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.870> actually

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
that's what makes it good and I actually

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.150 
that's what makes it good and I actually
think<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.440> going<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.770> perfect

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
think this is going to be perfect

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.270 
think this is going to be perfect
consistency<00:02:39.400> my<00:02:40.270> hands<00:02:40.480> are<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> bit<00:02:40.600> messy<00:02:44.280> but

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
consistency my hands are a bit messy but

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
precise and measure each one so that

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.259 
precise and measure each one so that
they're<00:03:11.709> even<00:03:12.070> if<00:03:12.640> you're<00:03:12.820> doing<00:03:12.970> something

into<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.520> fridge<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.759> chill<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.300> for<00:04:57.599> a<00:04:57.630> little

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
into the fridge to chill it for a little

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.640 
into the fridge to chill it for a little
while<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:59.660> helps<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.810> make<00:05:00.840> sure<00:05:01.229> that

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
while and that helps to make sure that

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.850 
while and that helps to make sure that
it<00:05:01.979> won't<00:05:02.810> fall<00:05:03.810> off<00:05:04.050> when<00:05:04.259> you're<00:05:04.440> dipping<00:05:04.770> it

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
it won't fall off when you're dipping it

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.320 
it won't fall off when you're dipping it
in<00:05:05.009> the<00:05:05.220> chocolate<00:05:07.760> if<00:05:08.760> you<00:05:08.940> just<00:05:09.090> tried<00:05:09.300> that

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
in the chocolate if you just tried that

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.600 
in the chocolate if you just tried that
straight<00:05:09.780> away<00:05:10.130> because<00:05:11.130> it's<00:05:11.280> not<00:05:11.400> really

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
straight away because it's not really

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.000 
straight away because it's not really
secure<00:05:12.030> it<00:05:12.210> hasn't<00:05:12.479> chilled<00:05:12.720> enough<00:05:13.020> probably

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
secure it hasn't chilled enough probably

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.350 
secure it hasn't chilled enough probably
the<00:05:14.190> cake<00:05:14.370> board<00:05:14.610> would<00:05:14.760> just<00:05:14.940> stay<00:05:15.120> in<00:05:15.240> the

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
the cake board would just stay in the

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.610 
the cake board would just stay in the
chocolate<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:15.900> don't<00:05:16.080> want<00:05:16.229> that<00:05:18.169> so<00:05:19.169> they've

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
chocolate you don't want that so they've

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.689 
chocolate you don't want that so they've
had<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.830> little<00:05:20.039> bit<00:05:20.159> of<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.310> chill<00:05:20.520> in<00:05:20.550> the

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
had a little bit of a chill in the

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.640 
had a little bit of a chill in the
fridge<00:05:20.789> for<00:05:21.210> a<00:05:21.270> few<00:05:21.330> minutes<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.080> now<00:05:22.470> they're

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
fridge for a few minutes and now they're

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.620 
fridge for a few minutes and now they're
pretty<00:05:22.770> secure<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:23.669> all<00:05:23.909> you<00:05:24.030> need<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.240> do<00:05:24.389> now

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
pretty secure so all you need to do now

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.390 
pretty secure so all you need to do now
is<00:05:25.729> dip<00:05:26.729> so<00:05:27.360> if<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.139> just<00:05:28.400> dip<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.430> around<00:05:29.820> and

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
is dip so if you just dip it around and

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.700 
is dip so if you just dip it around and
then<00:05:32.400> pull<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.699> out<00:05:32.840> that's<00:05:33.840> how<00:05:33.990> easy<00:05:34.169> it<00:05:34.590> is

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
then pull it out that's how easy it is

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.360 
then pull it out that's how easy it is
now<00:05:35.430> if<00:05:35.789> you<00:05:35.940> want<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.240> to<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.949> standing<00:05:37.949> up<00:05:38.070> one

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
now if you want it to be standing up one

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.560 
now if you want it to be standing up one
you<00:05:39.180> need<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.449> find<00:05:39.690> somewhere<00:05:40.199> to<00:05:41.300> pop<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.449> in

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
you need to find somewhere to pop it in

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.810 
you need to find somewhere to pop it in
so<00:05:42.810> it'll<00:05:43.020> dry<00:05:43.260> up<00:05:43.470> right<00:05:43.800> but<00:05:44.250> with<00:05:44.669> these

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
so it'll dry up right but with these

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.339 
so it'll dry up right but with these
ones<00:05:45.060> here<00:05:45.360> I'm<00:05:45.630> just<00:05:46.349> going<00:05:46.470> to<00:05:48.199> pop<00:05:49.199> them

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
ones here I'm just going to pop them

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.040 
ones here I'm just going to pop them
down<00:05:49.560> on<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.800> tray<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:50.659> then<00:05:51.659> you<00:05:51.780> can<00:05:51.930> just

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
down on the tray and then you can just

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.240 
down on the tray and then you can just
serve<00:05:52.229> them<00:05:52.409> on<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.560> plate<00:05:52.830> that's<00:05:53.010> a<00:05:53.130> bit

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
serve them on a plate that's a bit

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.070 
serve them on a plate that's a bit
easier<00:05:53.280> to<00:05:53.729> serve<00:05:53.940> them<00:05:54.180> so<00:05:54.510> just<00:05:54.840> do<00:05:55.050> that

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
easier to serve them so just do that

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.460 
easier to serve them so just do that
with<00:05:55.349> the<00:05:55.470> remaining<00:05:55.800> pops<00:05:59.120> just<00:06:00.169> allow<00:06:01.169> any

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
with the remaining pops just allow any

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.630 
with the remaining pops just allow any
excess<00:06:01.889> to<00:06:02.039> drip<00:06:02.070> off

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.510 

pop<00:06:07.640> dataset<00:06:08.180> and<00:06:08.890> that's<00:06:09.890> how<00:06:10.010> easy<00:06:10.040> it<00:06:10.400> is

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
pop dataset and that's how easy it is

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.460 
pop dataset and that's how easy it is
once<00:06:10.880> they<00:06:11.060> set<00:06:11.690> you<00:06:11.840> can<00:06:11.990> decorate<00:06:12.200> them

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
once they set you can decorate them

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.750 
once they set you can decorate them
