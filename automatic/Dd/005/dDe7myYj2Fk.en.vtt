 which I wanted to talk to you today 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 since I was recently browsing 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 by some forums and I found myself in the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.680
 forum from here rne stars some things 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.210
 quite interesting and said article 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.519
 I'm going to be mentioning a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.109
 I've found several things 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.760
 but anyway you know that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.340
 I in the description is going to leave the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.440
 forum just in case one of you 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.239
 curiosity read and want to know 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.950
 a little bit more there in the description what 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.629
 you can find but anyway 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.820
 let's start and I'll read you a 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.700
 little good news for all 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.129
 fans who are very anxious and wait 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.260
 play robberies to large banks 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.379
 author line and already have an exit date 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.050
 set for February 24 of the year 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.870
 2015 if the reports and rumors are 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.539
 certain cyber land informed the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.300
 forza users have not figured out 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.100
 entry and arrival of robberies to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.960
 banks of big cars line in the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.799
 playstation network store 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.770
 that would be available on February 24 of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.840
 year 2015 however the report also 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 notes that when the news of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.240
 input by filtered information are and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 they have the reports and change the entry 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 to the game and eliminated is said mention 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.310
 of February 24 ok you will know that the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 February 24 you know that always 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.490
 rockstargames has some hobby with the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.649
 Tuesday because he lives the grand game 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.020
 theft auto 5 updated Tuesday and if 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.880
 we took the calendar curiously on the 24th 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 that there are Tuesdays and also take into account 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 that the output of the computer game 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.990
 is set to March 24, no 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 so here they put us several things that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.490
 think curiously can be a month 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 exact before the departure because the month 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.190
 February has 28 days this is 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.020
 agree that if we put a date to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 today and we advance it a month 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.159
 interestingly it will fall within the same 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
 day can not be something pretty good and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.170
 the truth that I wait for them 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.610
 but this only information filtered by 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.440
 to say it in some way is a kind of 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.980
 moore rumor since this has been found 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.800
 in the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.940
 but like there's not a lot of evidence 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.140
 forceful not for that reason I tell you that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.450
 when I bring you filtered information 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.069
 there are times many things that do 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 it's true that in the end they end up being 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.940
 certain but there are many that are not going to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.470
 keep saying a little bit more 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.410
 It should be noted that however 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.480
 rockstargames has admitted that the gt5 of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.459
 bank robberies has a date of 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.720
 launch that would come before the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.580
 pc version 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.010
 rockstar has confirmed in the newswire 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.230
 official that the date of the launch of the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.810
 dlc of bank robberies establishes before 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.180
 March 24 of the grand launch 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.420
 theft auto 5 pc and they had said 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.099
 that our sincere apologies for 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.349
 the change of date that we never 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.319
 moved a date of release of a 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.420
 game but then we have planned to put it 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.099
 for March but nevertheless the heists 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.319
 to banks will come before for the four 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.079
 platforms a lot something that a lot of people 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.489
 he asks no and then decided saying 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.769
 that big pautÃ³ online and going to 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.480
 support up to more than 30 players and 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.609
 many things more than the truth are 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.530
 pretty good but here we all know 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.599
 that what was not imported was the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.460
 mention of bank robberies not 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.680
 that we are going to have them soon buoyant 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.690
 the arrival of great 5 pc cars 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.940
 so you tell me what you think of 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.280
 what do they think about this entry that there was 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.140
 of basically what he is doing 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.880
 the playstation network you have 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.620
 known that there have been some things 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.880
 that have leaked from the market place 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.340
 for those who do not know what the market is 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.320
 place then it is the xbox store and what 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.970
 they mean in a way maybe 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.730
 has leaked enough information I think 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.070
 what you see came the thing about the tlc de de san 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.930
 valentine last year and you can also 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.120
 be something that can happen not even though such 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.480
 once they are going to complete us with the dlc of 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.160
 valentine but I've seen the 14th day of 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.870
 February and interestingly, there is a Saturday 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.520
 and it does not fall on Tuesday but may arise 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.890
 enough things can not give us a 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.410
 small dlc some small event and the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.720
 mere day of what he is doing then the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.520
 February 24 , we may lack the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.920
 robberies to banks and I tell them that we 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.540
 100% information confirm they are only 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.490
 small leaks and some things 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.950
 that have been found and can reveal 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.840

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.550

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.840
 I'm going to leave the forum so they can read 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.180

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.160
