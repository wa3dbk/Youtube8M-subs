00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.650
 after the match with Slovakia penalty 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 penalties to assign us ericsson 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.810
 working chance of Robert Ziler 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.810
 do not be lazy 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.720
 probably there was no such chance 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.929
 because it was processed from itself 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.169
 and see how told to sleep 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.969
 iacon forests through center defense 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.390
 Argentine organized this 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.829
 attack 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.889
 I did not have time for bat yam to make secure and 

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:34.889
 bypassed 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.100
 no it did not go bertholazo tender was 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.990
 and the floor is obvious of course 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.060
 The first novelty of this episode was 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.570
 it is clear that the goal is erp 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 walked on this floor mouse on because nothing 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740
 he did not have a red card 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.510
 and the German national team remains from ten 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.290
 rum 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.700
 and someone is now very unlucky of the players 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.340
 German national team because 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.370
 and some of them will go now to 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.710
 replacement 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.700
 his grandfather we have marc andre so we go 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.200
 goalkeeper 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.960
 turnover of all menchengladbach 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 who is only 20 years old 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.770
 and which as well as today 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.060
 will hold your second match 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.110
 for the national team of Germany is real if 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 getting ready to beat a penalty 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.290
 small meeting end aliko titles 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.030
 her theme is left 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 near Andreas cap 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.360
 also past 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.500
 Germany goalkeeper 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.430
 getting ready to leave what they are the same to him 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.090
 will replace the question of the projectile whom 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.670
 then from the attacking line 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.090
 hardly three defenders will 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.040
 play in german national team 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 so work 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.659
 Well, maybe it only remains 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.659
 sympathize 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.830
 I think that Muller understood this replacement and without 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.000
 superfluous explanations 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 someone he had to donate 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.159
 his choice fell on mbk 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.349
 but the players are Ottoman 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.649
 meaning 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.239
 damn dozen 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.349
 however, aspen was miserable 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.060
 Well, let's see, and Lyon Messi still need 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.239
 score a penalty 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.010
 In the Champions League, Lyon is not a penalty month 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 scored and remembered chelsea gate 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.959
 Elisha 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.959
 but I would say 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.969
 sorry if you think that jinxed 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:41.559
 but 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.629
 commentator words 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.919
 here is built on 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.409
 football players on the field just do not need 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.089
 never tradition count penalties 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.089
 volunteered ball 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.669
 very bad hit obviously see 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.929
 but the fact that the movie is taken 1 Wednesday about it 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.849
 great help and 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.199
 very good momentum 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.109
 in order to 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.109
 keep up the good work 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.879
 being driven front guy 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.930
 crazy dope
