00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
a race to get a case if you if you want

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.550 
a race to get a case if you if you want
one<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:15.990> know<00:00:16.310> plenty<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.550> people<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.560> do

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
one I know plenty of people that do do

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.880 
one I know plenty of people that do do
not<00:00:19.740> use<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.689> case<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:21.990> life<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.380> which<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.650> think

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
not use a case for life on which I think

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.300 
not use a case for life on which I think
it's<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.130> little<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:24.320> little<00:00:25.320> bit<00:00:25.590> crazy<00:00:25.800> just

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
it's a little a little bit crazy just

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's a little a little bit crazy just
because<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.420> expensive<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.470> hard<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
because it's so expensive and hard to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.749 
because it's so expensive and hard to
replace<00:00:30.330> our<00:00:31.170> expensive<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.070> replace<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
replace our expensive to replace if you

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.959 
replace our expensive to replace if you
get<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> crack<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:35.579> anyways

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
get a crack or in like that but anyways

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.319 
get a crack or in like that but anyways
that's<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.890> that's<00:00:37.890> another<00:00:38.370> whole<00:00:39.030> video

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that's a that's another whole video

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
that's a that's another whole video
probably<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> itself<00:00:40.550> but<00:00:42.739> assuming<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.860> want

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
probably in itself but assuming you want

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.720 
probably in itself but assuming you want
the<00:00:44.399> case<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.860> than<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the case and you want more than just a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
the case and you want more than just a
bumper<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.750> bumper<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.590> kind<00:00:50.039> of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
bumper you know a bumper is just kind of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.869 
bumper you know a bumper is just kind of
a<00:00:50.160> plastic<00:00:50.700> rubber<00:00:51.030> ring<00:00:51.660> around<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.350> phone<00:00:52.879> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
a plastic rubber ring around the phone I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.330 
a plastic rubber ring around the phone I
don't<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.199> those<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.680> cases<00:00:56.160> those

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
don't think those really cases those

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
don't think those really cases those
we're<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.020> don't<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.289> giving<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
we're just I don't know giving you a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
we're just I don't know giving you a
false<00:00:59.010> impression<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.760> safety<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> guess<00:01:00.510> if

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
false impression of safety I guess if

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.119 
false impression of safety I guess if
you<00:01:00.719> drop<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.140> maybe<00:01:01.289> I'll<00:01:01.440> protect<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you drop it maybe I'll protect on the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.000 
you drop it maybe I'll protect on the
corners<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.500> anyway<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.559> I'm<00:01:04.739> talking<00:01:04.949> about

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
corners but anyway so I'm talking about

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.890 
corners but anyway so I'm talking about
sure<00:01:05.339> case<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.030> know<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.479> that's<00:01:06.659> has<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
sure case you know with one that's has a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.179 
sure case you know with one that's has a
protective<00:01:07.700> mechanism<00:01:08.700> around<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.630> rubber

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
protective mechanism around a rubber

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.940 
protective mechanism around a rubber
carbon<00:01:11.189> fiber<00:01:11.400> plastic<00:01:12.590> something<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
carbon fiber plastic something like that

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
carbon fiber plastic something like that
that's<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.700> able<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.299> drop<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that's going to be able you can drop it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.450 
that's going to be able you can drop it
and<00:01:15.960> you're<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:17.040> case<00:01:17.250> a

of iphone cases it's not waterproof but
it<00:01:45.689> takes<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.200> beating<00:01:47.119> it's<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.630> basically

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
itself that's unfortunate drawback that

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.959 
itself that's unfortunate drawback that

breaking it would go with the case and

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.209 
breaking it would go with the case and
you<00:02:22.859> lose<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.069> design<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:25.739> thing<00:02:25.980> weighs

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219

actually stopped using it because of

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.750 
actually stopped using it because of
that<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.769> also<00:02:46.889> one<00:02:47.189> of<00:02:47.219> the<00:02:47.370> few<00:02:47.400> cases

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
that this is also one of the few cases

it's<00:05:34.800> not<00:05:34.890> overwhelming<00:05:35.670> like<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:37.010> defender

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
it's not overwhelming like the defender

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.650 
it's not overwhelming like the defender
my<00:05:40.200> family<00:05:40.740> member<00:05:41.070> that<00:05:41.280> they<00:05:41.520> uses<00:05:42.300> this

my family member that they uses this

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.760 
my family member that they uses this
incipio<00:05:43.380> version<00:05:44.190> which<00:05:44.370> i<00:05:44.490> think<00:05:44.760> it's<00:05:45.770> it's

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
incipio version which i think it's it's

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.280 
incipio version which i think it's it's
unique<00:05:47.490> it's<00:05:47.910> definitely<00:05:48.360> as<00:05:48.480> a<00:05:48.510> plastic<00:05:48.840> ring

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
unique it's definitely as a plastic ring

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.340 
unique it's definitely as a plastic ring
all<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.280> way<00:05:50.370> around<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.940> it's<00:05:51.660> relatively

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
all the way around it it's relatively

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.970 
all the way around it it's relatively
thick<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:53.010> ports<00:05:53.460> are<00:05:53.640> exposed<00:05:54.650> for<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.770> most

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
thick the ports are exposed for the most

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.350 
thick the ports are exposed for the most
part<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.700> interesting<00:05:57.180> thing<00:05:57.330> about

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
part and the interesting thing about

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.290 
part and the interesting thing about
this<00:05:57.810> it<00:05:58.169> has<00:05:58.320> a<00:05:58.460> kind<00:05:59.460> of<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.669> credit<00:05:59.940> card

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
this it has a kind of a credit card

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.390 
this it has a kind of a credit card
money<00:06:00.780> case<00:06:01.140> on<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.470> back<00:06:01.620> rejection<00:06:01.950> light

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
money case on the back rejection light

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.510 
money case on the back rejection light
but<00:06:03.080> even<00:06:04.080> sepia<00:06:04.500> ones<00:06:04.740> aren't<00:06:04.950> available<00:06:05.220> yet

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.810 
but even sepia ones aren't available yet
and<00:06:06.300> I'm<00:06:07.200> undecided<00:06:07.680> about<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.460> width<00:06:08.700> the

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
and I'm undecided about the width the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.440 
and I'm undecided about the width the
width<00:06:09.060> is<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.450> much<00:06:09.720> more<00:06:11.360> more<00:06:12.360> wide<00:06:13.050> than<00:06:13.530> the

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
width is a much more more wide than the

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.220 
width is a much more more wide than the
otterbox<00:06:15.450> defender<00:06:17.270> this<00:06:18.270> was<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:18.510> iphone<00:06:18.960> 4

otterbox defender this was the iphone 4
of<00:06:19.410> course<00:06:19.680> maybe<00:06:19.950> they<00:06:20.160> shrank<00:06:20.490> it<00:06:20.730> down<00:06:20.760> for

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
of course maybe they shrank it down for

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.750 
of course maybe they shrank it down for
the<00:06:21.210> five<00:06:21.830> but<00:06:22.830> in<00:06:22.950> general<00:06:22.980> to<00:06:23.460> have<00:06:23.580> that

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
the five but in general to have that
