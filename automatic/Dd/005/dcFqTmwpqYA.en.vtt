00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 to make you in love and men better 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.930
 understand hey my name is he is always 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 there and that is the third part of the 14th 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.469
 part video series on the topic of man 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.870
 We want to lose today 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.260
 with the difference between no one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 to force something and someone to something 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.240
 to be inspired because you want 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 yes, that the man was educated with 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.949
 if you want someone else something 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.570
 for you or with you do you have 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.070
 basically two strategies you can 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.660
 force someone to do something on one 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.520
 side and you can turn someone into something 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.950
 Inspire you on the other side 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.570
 can force him to do something sounds 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.670
 somehow so hard on and most 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.950
 women if then yes I would never 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.770
 force a man to do something 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.899
 bullshit of course you make women 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.690
 We make men with women as well 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.390
 we ultimatums for example the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.219
 we say yes if you have to do it now 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 within the next 14 days 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.239
 decide what that is with us or what 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.920
 that is not with us what will become of us 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.500
 and if you meet within 14 days 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.350
 I have not decided then I am gone 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 or you have to stop smoking 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 otherwise I can with you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.140
 his or any other ultimatums 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.340
 ultimatums are always some 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.049
 kind of emotional blackmail 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.729
 There is also emotional blackmail in 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.350
 many other areas to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.229
 example passive aggressive behavior 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.210
 or manipulation against his will 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.650
 and without his knowledge and louder ones 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.960
 so there are many emotional ones 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 extorting things women make 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.130
 for example when they say maybe if 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.150
 you are not there and so on and so on 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.409
 continue around the man a bad one 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.450
 to do something if he has any 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.159
 I do know things as a spectator 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.509
 You would never do something and that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.860
 is okay too but maybe knows too 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.240
 other women who would do something like that 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 then you ought to tell you that they the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.399
 please refrain from this because 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.020
 emotional blackmail passive aggressive 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.540
 behave and what does not exist there 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.540
 that always only leads to you 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.070
 a bit more of imagination 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.439
 distanced maybe he comes to you though 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.939
 a piece of physical proximity because he 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.530
 then spend more time with her because 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.850
 he would have a bad conscience if he did 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.790
 out with his friends tonight 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 but the problem would be any 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.710
 if you are from a worldview of one 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.709
 That's exactly what motivation is all about 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.470
 This negative motivation is then leading 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.540
 that to the man 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.700
 limited in his freedom 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.220
 felt that you are coming but close 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.700
 emotionally he distances himself from you 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.250
 because the stronger a man's freedom 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.410
 So space leads the less freedom 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.330
 the stronger he becomes for his 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.290
 fight for freedom and everything in them 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.030
 his freedom somehow restricts 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.810
 fight against it and we want that 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.730
 of course not 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.920
 that's why it's important for you to have him 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.710
 not compelled or manipulated with 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.270
 join him to his sun 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.570
 Inspiration and inspiration is something 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.330
 quite another inspiration means 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.940
 that you show him that you are his 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.200
 simply shows the day x the might 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.520
 you have with me you could do that with me 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.600
 have that could you have with me that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.060
 could you have with me etc 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.000
 if you just put a lot of things on it 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.770
 the experience for him is such a high one 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.810
 show that he is the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.459
 I would like to gray with this woman 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.200
 necessarily be with this woman 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.790
 I want the rest of my life 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.610
 it is, however, spend 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.980
 important that you understand men because 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.810
 Of course if you do something lancing 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.850
 you want to sell yourself yes 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.750
 not now where literal sense 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.160
 sell where you want 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.750
 He wants to present himself for 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.480
 you decide then you have to know 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.239
 what your target group has for needs 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.920
 that means you have to understand like yours 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.660
 target group like tick men so how 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.000
 think about life how do you think 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.730

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.340
 You have passion in your life 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.140
 how do you understand proximity and distance like 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.430
 understand freedom how do you understand 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.709
 independence how do you understand

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.090

 personal freedom development 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.060
 success, etc 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.920
 all these things we do too 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.950
 deal within this video series 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.209
 You should at least be heard 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.040
 at least you should have thought 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.360
 make over it now if I am to 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.010
 for example, try an eskimo one 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.330
 refrigerator for sale, it is 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.459
 maybe not quite suitable for mine 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.019
 target group but if i am for africa 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.730
 or somewhere in the sahara 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.230
 sahara and there someone mine 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.459
 The refrigerator can be sold by solar 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.919
 is operated then that is natural 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.979
 for this target group there very much 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.360
 valuable and that's how you have to be for yours 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.240
 to 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.590
 group very very valuable so do it 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.030
 Think about how men think 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.900
 about life like men think about 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.939
 Relationships 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.530
 how do men think about goals 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.389
 passions in life and so on 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.770
 I will accompany you on this way 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.330
 but you can also go in 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.860
 watch men's magazines conti 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.479

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.610
 my men's books just read 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.500
 try things from the perspective of one 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.060
 To see man exactly the same 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.650
 By the way, I'm also a man, that's me 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.060
 look at things like sex and the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.710
 city ​​or other women's series 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.719
 women's magazines with simon a bit 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.550
 understand how is it out of sight 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.740
 the other people so sometimes 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.000
 really into the other person person 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.189

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.479

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.599
 can understand many things better 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.580

 we will deal with it like 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.279
 Men and women try the other 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.529
 but to inspire sex 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:25.150
 do everything wrong what they still do 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.650
