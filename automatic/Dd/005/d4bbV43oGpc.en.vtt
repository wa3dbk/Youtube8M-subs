00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.460
 hello to all larre here I am for a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.700
 new video so I came across 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.020
 a video that is fimo kawaii emotion 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.529
 so do not ask me how am I 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.900
 fell on it 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.660
 I was watching I know what video 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.579
 of sugar or and I saw this video was 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.210
 side I saw two words poured suddenly 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.000
 called me 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.230
 and suddenly I looked and I think 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.239
 it's a technique that should be 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.829
 share with you if it works has 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.660
 so here I test with you and I 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.220
 never tested so we'll see 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.340
 so actually the person of the video 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.480
 so take a bowl of water 1 so I do not 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.740
 must not be in English I do not know 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 not so our and cold or hot I think 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.800
 that it does not change anything and she 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 put seal ap 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.120
 so I do not know how it is said in 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.110
 English but a priori it would be soap 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.480
 so 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.820
 seen as it is in his video I think 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.230
 that it 's washing up liquid and so 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.120
 I will test because when she mixes 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.230
 silicone in it is handy so I 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.230
 will test with you 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.350
 so at that moment I mix silicone and 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.880
 I do not know at all how will 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 to do it will stick to the finger 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 or not verdict 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.170
 so it sticks slightly but actually it 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.149
 blood glue so ultimately flowed 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.100
 it sticks but with the dishwashing liquid 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.200
 the gray matter or sticks to it 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.240
 the silicone slip forgiveness and suddenly 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 you can handle the silicone a little 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.600
 like you and so you see in pictures 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.750
 it's really very very practical very 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.610
 very simple I advise you suddenly 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.439
 technique instead of the other - from 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.009
 wanted to do both but that's it 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.530
 give an appointment at Beijing so technical 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.270
 to prove tested and approved by this 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.700
 American if I remember correctly 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.009
 and so here I show you how 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.720
 do the job as usual I 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.530
 really wet what I found 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.610
 at hand it was really a test 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.500
 and you can see that we can really 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.640
 do a 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.640
 bull without worry 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.060
 so that's the kind mold still of 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.510
 others it was little things in 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.579
 resin so I tested porcelain a 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.439
 resin cabochon is no problem 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.810
 the seed gate is very very 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.970
 good by cons waited well 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.069
 let's say a half re I will not say what 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.750
 I had heard half an hour a half 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.349
 hour an hour and was not all to 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.959
 made dry 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.370
 but that's what it gives I hope that 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.989
 this tutorial will have pleased you 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.360
 do not hesitate to go for a ride on 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.030
 the chain from there that I decided at all 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.560
 at first I do not know her but here it is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.830
 to her that I found this 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.390
 technical so I refer you to and 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.190
 in any case I hope you liked it
