00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
wave right about there and we'll split

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
wave right about there and we'll split
it<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.789> by<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> Edit<00:00:57.899> tab<00:00:58.140> under

further<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.470> some<00:01:49.710> mirror<00:01:50.009> options

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
further and you see some mirror options

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.160 
further and you see some mirror options
so<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.850> actually<00:01:51.299> change<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> direction

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
so you can actually change the direction

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.310 
so you can actually change the direction
the<00:01:52.590> surfer<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.720> even<00:01:54.720> flip<00:01:55.200> them

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the surfer is going even flip them

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.190 
the surfer is going even flip them
upside<00:01:55.710> down<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> next<00:01:57.930> group

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
upside down but it's the next group

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
upside down but it's the next group
where<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.409> see<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:58.860> motions<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.729> fades

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
where we see some motions and fades

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.660 
where we see some motions and fades
where<00:02:00.570> you'll<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.930> some<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.259> cool

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
where you'll see some really cool

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.420 
where you'll see some really cool
effects<00:02:02.689> like<00:02:03.689> 3d<00:02:04.170> ripple<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.890> example

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
effects like 3d ripple for example

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.449 
effects like 3d ripple for example
fading<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.270> from<00:02:06.570> black<00:02:07.039> there's<00:02:08.039> some<00:02:08.220> cool

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
fading in from black there's some cool

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.479 
fading in from black there's some cool
ones<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.149> hues<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.979> kind<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.340> like

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
ones here for hues and I kind of like

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.640 
ones here for hues and I kind of like
this<00:02:11.640> pixelate<00:02:12.209> option<00:02:12.629> too

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this pixelate option too

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.800 
this pixelate option too
might<00:02:13.799> be<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> good<00:02:14.189> option<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.579> a<00:02:14.819> clip<00:02:15.060> but

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
might be a good option for a clip but

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.509 
might be a good option for a clip but
I'm<00:02:15.900> thinking<00:02:16.290> actually<00:02:16.439> let's<00:02:16.920> scroll<00:02:17.159> up<00:02:17.220> to

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
I'm thinking actually let's scroll up to

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.910 
I'm thinking actually let's scroll up to
the<00:02:17.640> top<00:02:17.909> here<00:02:18.269> where<00:02:18.599> we<00:02:18.750> see<00:02:18.959> under<00:02:19.170> artistic

the top here where we see under artistic
that<00:02:20.670> cartoonish<00:02:21.450> edge<00:02:21.629> detection<00:02:22.409> effect

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that cartoonish edge detection effect

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.789 
that cartoonish edge detection effect
we'll<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.610> click<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.090> apply<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.739> now<00:02:25.739> we

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
we'll just click it to apply it now we

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.100 
we'll just click it to apply it now we
can<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.250> whole<00:02:26.459> portion<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.329> our<00:02:27.420> clip<00:02:27.750> by

clicking<00:02:28.349> play<00:02:28.879> that's<00:02:29.879> kind<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.299> neat<00:02:30.510> right

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
clicking play that's kind of neat right

clicking play that's kind of neat right
there<00:02:31.079> okay<00:02:31.829> now<00:02:32.670> if<00:02:32.939> we<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.480> first

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
transition we can apply a transition to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.089 
transition we can apply a transition to
the<00:02:48.209> second<00:02:48.629> half<00:02:48.780> make<00:02:49.260> sure<00:02:49.409> that<00:02:49.560> clip<00:02:49.920> is

gradually switch us from reality into
our<00:03:06.299> edge<00:03:06.510> detection<00:03:07.109> effect<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:07.859> let's<00:03:07.889> use

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
our edge detection effect so let's use

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.729

and gradually there he goes he turns

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.330 
and gradually there he goes he turns
into<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.329> cartoon<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.260> gives<00:03:19.410> us<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.680> splash<00:03:20.040> I
