00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:10.410
 Arcane enemy 77 I will start doing 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.110
 the tutorial today we're going to see how to use the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.260
 hamchi to be able to play that inflated 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.550
 absorbed good we got off obviously 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.550
 we look for hamachi 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.850
 and see the first tab that is the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.850
 official page download 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 install 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:50.040
 I do not have somewhere 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:52.200
 of those 4 mb a window before 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.410
 open it we have to put panel 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.410
 control 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.289
 networks and internet center networks and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 here I am important to change the 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.320
 adapter configuration so that 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.670
 so that in another game take this 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.880
 configuration as main 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.140
 we are missing halt we have options 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.680
 advanced 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.410
 after setting anza 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.070
 is open and never if you succeed 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.690
 have here and know what we do 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 respect the cool up two 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.800
 Sometimes it takes place first we give it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.800
 to accept 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.840
 round 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.869
 we open it and we will see it being this is not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.780
 work except we can afford or be 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:48.830
 we sell host will start the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.980
 to synchronize what we can not walk an ip 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.870
 Right 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.150
 but if we are going to adjust we have to 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.460
 do the following they created their network creates 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.460
 a network we name the network 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 and a password 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.890
 and we give him luck 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.140
 and so that our friend can not be 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.790
 with us through talking 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.180
 virtual what does this create 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.180
 program 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.349
 we have to give the name and the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.120
 password they have to enter network 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.260
 join an existing network and put the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.620
 name and password 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.069
 2 3 and 13 and the true password 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.610
 and you can join we should be 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.580
 diaz land 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.610
 then with this open we open in 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.840
 quilÃ­n 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.200
 After opening the killing as what 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.890
 they are host 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.470
 game and let's see rules 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.950
 good we see that the lancer this delicate 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.480
 and everything in select the map the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.390
 difficulty of all that and we put list 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.120
 so many 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.260
 now we are going to join a game 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.549
 we have multiple 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.650
 and in the cndh we should already see the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.650
 game that our friend has created 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.670
 should already appear in case it does not 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.890
 look like 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.990
 we put open and p 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.990
 we enter the following 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.860
 well we have to ask our stipe 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.480
 friend until I'm here so it comes out 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.340
 on your computer if you can 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.040
 direct us directly to the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.270
 heading and well that was the tutorial
