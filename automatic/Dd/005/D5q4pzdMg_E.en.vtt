00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.419
 twice is the traditional Taunus loop driven with the 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.109
 Difficulties in Ruppertshain and Eckstein and the legendary rise 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.390
 up to the Mammolshainer mountain 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.180

 Mary attentively 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.330
 that is the situation mentioned difficult, of course, falls enormously 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.690
 So the first refusal 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.870
 by Fabian Wiegmann 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.760
 However, the patio door open 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.130
 at its first victory in 2004, there were a few who offered the services 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.460
 at that time in Darmstädter Landstraße 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.690
 maybe they still remember being here 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.140
 in Frankfurt on the now that is already by his concerns 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.330
 front 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 50 60 meters that opens up 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.240
 Read Malik 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.399
 drive nicely on the edge so you do not slow down 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.440
 just leave a gap 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.880
 little the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.590
 in the direction of travel live 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.460
 the Briton in those 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.960
 last final gyro have the same that banks so now it is that 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.880
 Brandt opens 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.619
 by Carsten Paulun from the end of March on the left hand Tanner we hold 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.060
 want to equalize on the track the equalizer irregular tolerance 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.150
 Day Report continues 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.060
 Wegner was the world were the sports car manufacturer for the eighth edition 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.140
 Place at the 48 Lauf Lage to that for that in Frankfurt the successor 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.570
 appointed by the Henninger Turm it gives way to a strict diet 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.380
 the placements 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.359
 Derived it's defense is allowed says Oryem 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.359
 I think he drives on 11 so that's it 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:18.369
 my dear friend that was a day for the team Milram the places one and 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.720
 three this is the lucky winner of the German champions 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 Fabian Ecker 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.880
 many minutes are the at the end also pre-calculated march table and me 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.079
 believe there are a few tears with us at Fabian Wegmann 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.819
 the exact same juniors and demand will be whether later 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.629
 but we still leave you there wonderful while I mean that one 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.769
 take a great breath 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.999
 Now he thinks I have gone so far as to see Gertler Jackwerth 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.969
 that makes us very happy in Seelower tears balm this life 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.099
 means 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.499
 that means so much to me when they actually make everything new 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.229
 an absolute dream to win here 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.689
 it just meant 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.299
 So who worked out very well as a team you always top pop 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.779
 always want to represent her 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.439
 In the end, as she shows you, you have to be absolutely perfect 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.649
 and 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:13.579
 and since I knew the channel works at 7 9 percent they would have 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.889
 also fast and percent 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.889
 Gutermann baseline strokes I want a "very close to you" 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.839
 it started working well did not know exactly right 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.169
 who needs to get out of Bordeaux with this as long as William Walton Anke da 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.569
 I did not perceive Erfurt properly 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.569
 and I have a fiftieth century with Renault 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.109
 it has been enough Goral Action kW 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.560
 fitting the question to them are about the big man went to the final round 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:43.249
 she got me the better position first what did you do wrong what did he have 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:47.479
 better done to him than she was just a gallery tailor I say 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.879
 So sometimes more attacked, »he said 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.139
 the sentiment before the finish 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:53.959
 vintage 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.719
 I already realized that she might be 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:57.819
 and he 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.499
 So in Stendal II right position at the ballot box is size alone 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.280
 He also won twice 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.270
 At nice that they were so struggling to reclaim everything ever gone 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.650
 Portheine was not quite ready for the match 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.670
 Performance speak now it is in cycling but also not so 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.959
 be sure to always win the best team because of course all of them 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.680
 Team al-Assad has looked at several so yes it was too 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.360
 Hard to live with ActiveX 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.610
 but and you have to let some loose we knew until today knew that we 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.930
 In a good mood are smashed his term repeatedly tried and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.809
 Phew that was very clear which was not hers forever with 700 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:37.289
 and 15 degrees 20 seconds before the pollen 20 man who drove under 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.349
 yes he caught it on the lap but that it got bigger and then the 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.860
 Mittermeier recovers seven times on the podium black and white lighter 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.279
 continue from Russia now we are also moose with Karsten tournament on 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.430
 He has already won this castle social Carsten Bohn twice 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.759
 you did not have to bake at all 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.419
 not at all 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.150
 the own 4 4 liked knew 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.059
 because if he does not want to beat she had to be short sprint 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:03.520
 Bayer to defeat 6 2 it goes 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.030
 he can not be too long and percent of good he has not attacked 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.809
 Sistema left Danger is not held on my cheek 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.759
 However, the channel has to be fair so far 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.349
 «There came again an anger on a roundabout and 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.300
 All or nothing is for that now 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.220
 was vegetate because there were a lot of white stripes I knew 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.650
 Not 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.390
 until the end, Weber went through covered b no matter who what which 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.460
 Write that is there you have to do it in one fell swoop though 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.169
 So maybe a word on the mood next to the track very short 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.569
 the gorgeous Suma always beautiful here 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.989
 SEPPmail people over under the crickets rules and wild mint one by one 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.529
 Eels 1 percent 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.529
 nice weather and a lot of spectators 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.949
 the man needs 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.339
 Rank 1 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.819
 first they already have you should that be in the hierarchy he is 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.289
 impressively said 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.569
 Fabian Diekmann I wanted to be safe and he was in a wall 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.039
 Porter r 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.110
 what else here at the Weser also a home race 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.259
 You receive 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.259
 since the driver Rennverein high 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.719
 There were the German premiere 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.759
 but here he learned nothing 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.759
 at the time he fell a few weeks ago 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.560
 why the joy so special a very special kind look at it 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.830
 The last 50 meters they buy are the sprint in Linz 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.000
 Wittmann the direction of travel 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.080
 the whole environment was crowns and 4 quarters 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:33.550
 in the end 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.550
 clear success 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.169
 a short intense jumps 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.849
 precisely because on this roundabout was 7 ground-breaking victories with the bottom 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.490
 a classic sense not least a long at least test 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:51.900
 and that is the
