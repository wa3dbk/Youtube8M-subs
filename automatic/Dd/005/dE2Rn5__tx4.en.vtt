00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.700
 let's consider with you here such 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:12.139
 the microphone came from the store then did not 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.600
 Here is such he upakovochke 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:21.080
 plastic packaging ps but 58 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:27.619
 let's see it open 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.619
 test it for one I took it 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.510
 comments were good i chose 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.610
 There are a lot of microphones out there. 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 mikrofonchik because there was a lot 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 good comments about him precisely about 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:51.320
 this model so let's see 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.320
 what does he present himself so here he is 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:00.809
 there is enough cable here 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:05.129
 meter and a half dita meter eighty stock 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:11.100
 the cord of this microphone here is natural with 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.100
 plastic made velvet surface 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 my ordinary velvet paper 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 paper but does not slide have guides 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:34.939
 so he can see that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.040
 have u need so do so let yes 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:45.110
 so on top there is a button button 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:50.720
 on-off at the back we see 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.720
 such is the inscription in Chinese 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:03.670
 live for three and a half years connector 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.280
 the inevitable plug three and a half us 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:14.980
 let's test it let's see how 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:18.970
 it will work to the wire here 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.370
 quite enough at least 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.860
 long well write meter eighty 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.250
 the wires are really long connecting 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.250
 by 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.989
 Well , now we connect a microphone 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.239
 testing graphon testing 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.030
 pinnacle studio is happening 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.450
 since I bought it specifically for 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.060
 video editing that's why testing 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.799
 testing in this program but here 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.070
 I'm on the microphone now 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:03.340
 a distance of 10-15 minutes 20 centimeters 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.380
 here you hear the natural sound now 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:11.910
 I am at a microphone distance 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:17.200
 about 1 meter two meters by microphone 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.000
 for example, to put closer turns on 20 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.730
 centimeters to microphone round sound 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.830
 it becomes a little bit more frequent and the only 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.220
 minus and a little bit bugged 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.769
 floating sound sound a little swim 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.010
 microphone is natural that the price of a microphone 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.250
 low therefore 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.360
 the microphone is certainly not for vocals therefore 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.360
 the cost of it 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.960
 8 dollars that's 41 cents 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.510
 On site Tanya affairs but if whom will this 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.060
 interesting at least probably more 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.430
 less one of the better microphones which 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.380
 On this site there is if anyone will 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.010
 you can look here interesting 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.540
 look again well urals and all 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.540
 Thanks for attention
