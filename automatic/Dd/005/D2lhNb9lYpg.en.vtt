00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.770
 even what to tell about him but can 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.280
 great legs perfectly cuts from somewhere 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.670
 to go fishing with you in the forest 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.100
 generally excellent legs in blade thickness i 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.020
 the public didn’t measure it but she’s not 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.149
 very thin and not very thick in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.640
 principle like u for some kind of kitchen 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.550
 Knife even a little bit probably plump 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.850
 Well, for some camping knife 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.649
 thin but it seems to me that it will be enough 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.239
 behind the eyes in principle in principle can 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.429
 made in sweden 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.530
 in principle, I don't know what else to say 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:01:00.109
 let's see how the legs work like 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.059
 he cuts the paper's closest literal 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.900
 out of the box, man, by the way, I forgot 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:21.420
 say legs worth this to me both silk 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:25.920
 12 dollars fine cuts new 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.500
 my side where is my home and carnations 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.990
 then so chip bothering we will 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 take off the chips in the eyes of the legs took off 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.140
 pretty thin 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.970
 so of course nick you came 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.270
 probably do not see it but for Boeing 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.360
 But there is in the place where I shot the mug 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.640
 for a warrior, to eat means steel then in principle 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 I'm not good but you don't feel 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 but well, my feet did not kill 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:09.149
 here further to try to cut 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:12.720
 Tomato and not a rope sling together 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:21.360
 that cuts perfectly even without a wire without 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:23.819
 photo reason here so we remove the side 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.890
 will cut tomatoes certainly apologize 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.230
 such tomatoes I live Belarus principle 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.859
 country evergreen tomatoes 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:37.859
 see I 'm cutting fine not learn it not 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:39.000
 vomits no problems okay 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.739
 honestly i don't know what else 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.109
 tell about this knife great knife 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.570
 some small kitchen knife 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.430
 ax nil but exactly such a knife 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.239
 to cut something exactly 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.680
 need to cut they were eager not to break here 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.410
 great man 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.150
 have long wanted such a knife to everyone and how 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.269
 that but they are even sold here 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.430
 stores but here you go past you need to buy 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.079
 need to buy or no money with you or 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.609
 forget there you go buy something 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.829
 other 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.200
 constantly lacked how can you even 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.760
 neither time nor memory that it is necessary 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.810
 buy but now I finally did 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.959
 I ordered and they brought me this one today 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.690
 man can be another one the same 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.300
 buy for spouse because basically 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.210
 very often we spouse we go or 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.840
 fishing and some of the forest some 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.270
 hikes 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.940
 so let them be well too 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.940
 actually I literally today in 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.730
 hour of using this knife is very pleased 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.750
 here are no complaints on him 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.090
 no problems too 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.480
 In principle, to escape Boeing what I 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.740
 did i instantly turned into bars 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.600
 for editing 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.210
 razors me if you sticks 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.160
 some more ancient times 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.880
 some ancient here and numbers even 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.360
 military what else wanted to say about this 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.330
 knife 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.830
 very very comfortable for me here at 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.170
 at least I use such a plan 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.270
 fastening on the belt that is me 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.490
 naturally some kind of field conditions 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.980
 I can put it on the backpack I can put 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.100
 backpack can immediately go answer 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.440
 belt on the train and also i can wear on 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.739
 pocket for trouser pocket for jacket pocket 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.169
 on the discharge pocket it is very convenient 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.370
 because let's say last time on 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.919
 fishing I went to my m65 jacket and she 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.250
 as if a little below the pocket that is 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.190
 if the legs hang on the belt at the very 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.700
 straps then jacket need to lift it 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.480
 not very uncomfortable here thanks here 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.419
 that's it 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.280
 I can hook up elementary just 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.740
 here's a pocket of jeans on a pocket of trousers 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.010
 some and it weighs it hangs beautifully 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.050
 Here are no problems with him so that 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.810
 This, too, is to some extent a plus. 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.880
 of this knife and to be honest I'm here already 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.700
 I go probably somewhere around the house now 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.520
 specially hung on the pocket given 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.979
 Case Well, of course, except for those moments 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.930
 when I shoot a video does not fly off obvious 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.890
 I sit down here I specifically sit on the chair 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.080
 I sat down on the sofa the department several times 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.520
 tried the same jacket to move 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.240
 hands does not interfere at all 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.190
 well, just hanging on your pocket for the year 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.500
 say yes how on the edge of the pocket I will 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:29.180
 outside hanging here just do not have a show 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.810
 hand no let's say that's my pocket in 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.810
 edge of the pocket here hand like this 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.680
 Moscow tightly comes that is here on 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.130
 the edge of the pocket hangs a simultaneous hand in 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.570
 pocket can be inserted here and legs 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:54.050
 removed elementally does not merge with 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.300
 pocket very hard hanging i think everything 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.130
 it is clear well actually here if still 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.790
 of course there will be some thoughts 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.590
 ideas I will finish writing about 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.050
 tell this but for now I'm pretty 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.850
 I honestly am delighted with this knife 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.120
 no problems with them in the well, in addition 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.610
 that he has so much baggy and 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.980
 but they often say that I still wanted for 12 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.620
 dollars are beautiful legs and perfect 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.380
 how the legs say it is not a pity that is 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.630
 if somewhere he breaks if he 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.360
 get lost then no problem go 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.830
 buy the exact same one also 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.400
 Need to of course say that the rubber 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.490
 a pen 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.810
 rubber handle with a texture 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.270
 a little gruff 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.580
 lies fine I have not tried to cut 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.470
 nothing fat but i told the spouse that 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.720
 went bought fat of course very much the game is not 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.120
 went but must go buy today 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.760
 pork me around we are specially fat 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.280
 Hands cut all fat meat if you 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.580
 watched my others still review this in 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.400
 In principle, it is important to handle 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.380
 did not slip out of hand if on some 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.130
 fat songs and cut meat there or fish 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.110
 oily, that is, it is very convenient 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.600
 when it sounds and does not slip out of hand 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.060
 that is, we cut the pork and the knife is not 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.770
 trying to come out constantly rush out well 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.950
 Of course, I still think here 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.500
 drill a hole under this beam 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:18.940
 not by a scaffold under the eyelet in order 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:23.060
 so that this knife can be fastened 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:25.550
 for some rope to the belt for what 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.070
 if it is admissible to catch a boat to catch 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.860
 from the boat and several times I had that 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.210
 some things were paid in a year and therefore 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.100
 This is me now prefer all the same 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:37.700
 tie and all your little knives 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:40.910
 even some small pen room 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.400
 his pockets are the same quiz and i always 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.409
 tied for such a small loop to 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.869
 imagine there cell pocket 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:51.589
 to the belt somewhere because all the same 

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:54.679
 may fall and drown this legs 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:56.569
 did not float well, that's all for now 

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:58.219
 again I will say that if they are still 

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:00.949
 some thoughts I have some ideas 

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:02.929
 what then let's say the opening pagan 

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.529
 muzhik then of course I will continue to shoot 

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:05.529
 video
