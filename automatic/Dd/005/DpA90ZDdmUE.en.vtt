00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.730
 but little by little they also go sant and metopas I cover me too 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.980
 outputs 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.489
 when I go to the front 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.579
 and in front 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.579
 worse ifema I also have many options 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 I'm going to give you this exit 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.860
 to be set to remove this advance 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.240
 and the saw to cover it with mud 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.410
 let's see if the play falls or another game is planned 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.590
 gave an advance for the blocks 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.590
 we have already left different 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.830
 we are going to advance this one to leave could advance more 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.600
 but if the one who thought he could enjoy this 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 for me I'm going to cover it on this side 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.680
 here I will serve well like this back to back 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.190
 and he front 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.320
 to block him is 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.320
 and you should go with is behind you already saw 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.490
 next to this couple and closing 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 if we are counting on your family Mossos and not what it is 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.060
 and well I'm not me too happens to me but do not touch the mafia 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.550
 the metapán 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 well let's see now this one I'm going to advance 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.330
 continue with this good the front to the front armed the cross to enter 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.530
 little one is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 this duet duo with this tour quillas 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.220
 is that I will be a little more than goal 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 he also excelled because I called 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.459
 for freshness letting out extra for it do not remove me will also cover 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.529
 bolocco 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.269
 willemstad blocking that with this one 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.269
 more than me that with the cross I'm helping a lot 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.469
 Saleh now 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.069
 with the colors from the front to the front 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.559
 that's why now I'm going ahead to accommodate and deconcentrate quickly 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.509
 I'm going to put together you're doing 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.289
 together 4 shepard place it in the best way to enter 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:54.710
 fast 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.940
 because he already knows how to play well and he is blocking me so as not to leave me a band 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.559
 and I even crashed the best way I have to leave yes 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.469
 well let's see 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.509
 now we are going to move forward with this 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.509
 to come out later this cycle is washing me 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:28.819
 work if I have to do something 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.689
 take three aldir here I'm going to move this 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.689
 to have input I with this one two three and to the bottom 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.159
 and if it comes out with this one 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.159
 zabaleta to block it 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.569
 they saw something 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.619
 he advanced today and wanted to move the side to take advantage of this exit on this side 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.619
 theoretical I remove this device not to let it pass 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.560
 I have options to jump here and here but left everything for her to 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:00.139
 that entertains this side 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.009
 and if mou other 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.369
 I have to give it extra output 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.369
 went to the front 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.129
 to give it an outlet, it should fall well located 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.519
 trachea and another question if I remove 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.779
 She goes taqui taqui and here 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.599
 let's give it extra output 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.749
 to take it off and may give it 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.659
 I'm going to give him this exit but I care 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.189
 I go to the side praised the front to the front and waits inside 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.990
 but that cross is very easy to enter 1 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.620
 it leaves dj exits but as they are 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.180
 to it we must highlight here picaresque tv to not help 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.930
 here the front and the front 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.849
 and that is giving you entrance is on the side and the state front fund 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.849
 let's try wolves to solve the two that fall on this side 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.080
 in front 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.080
 so you can give me your exit with this 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:02.479
 who cares to join her 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.479
 the central base to which the center center and here 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.400
 and to see front to front and álava was well located 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.389
 and despite his game, all the compounds were left 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.449
 but the crack in front 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.559
 and in the background 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.559
 bravo and with state were the front and the front 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.240
 and in what well placed his marbles for those 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.729
 so it took a lot 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.539
 I'm going to the front 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.509
 that's why it's important that 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.909
 when then come forward to try to fall into a position that tello 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:41.710
 quite 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.919
 Beijing the game is over 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.999
 I hope you liked this explanation 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.270
 and I know there are six leave me a comment and 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.580
 I would like them 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.570
 if they want to offer the most Chinese play
