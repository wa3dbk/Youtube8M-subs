00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.230 
version and the PC if the ps2 version
actually<00:04:45.890> one<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.750> faster<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:49.790> know<00:04:49.880> as<00:04:50.060> you

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240

actually one is faster you know as you
can<00:04:50.270> believe<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.930> does<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.560> know

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120
