00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
would probably swap the gold on the top

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.450 
would probably swap the gold on the top
with<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.600> air<00:01:24.750> defense<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> top<00:01:25.710> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the Electra storage on the top right I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.660 
the Electra storage on the top right I
noticed<00:01:43.320> there's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> double<00:01:44.070> stack<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
noticed there's a double stack of the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
noticed there's a double stack of the
walls<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.659> would<00:01:45.810> actually<00:01:45.990> take<00:01:46.440> one<00:01:46.680> of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
walls and I would actually take one of

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.740 
walls and I would actually take one of
those<00:01:46.860> walls<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> use<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.940> close<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
those walls and use it to close up the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.020 
those walls and use it to close up the
gap<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.200> between<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.130> gold<00:01:50.340> sword<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.120 
gap in between the gold sword and the
Barbarian<00:01:51.479> came<00:01:51.690> altar<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.070> now

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
Barbarian came altar because right now

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
Barbarian came altar because right now
if<00:01:53.460> goblins<00:01:53.909> were<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.299> take<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> gold

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
if goblins were to take out the gold

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
if goblins were to take out the gold
storage<00:01:55.320> they<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.070> basically<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
storage they would have basically a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.460 
storage they would have basically a
clear<00:01:56.909> path<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.450> dark<00:01:57.690> elixir<00:01:57.960> storage

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
clear path to the dark elixir storage

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.950 
clear path to the dark elixir storage
this<00:01:59.190> is<00:01:59.369> also<00:01:59.549> another<00:01:59.820> reason<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.570> swap<00:02:00.810> out

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this is also another reason to swap out

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.990 
this is also another reason to swap out
that<00:02:01.020> clan<00:02:01.470> castle<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.549> dark<00:02:02.790> elixir

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that clan castle with that dark elixir

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.480 
that clan castle with that dark elixir
storage<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.260> last<00:02:04.470> thing<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
storage now the last thing is and you

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490 
storage now the last thing is and you
can<00:02:05.520> refer<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:05.970> my<00:02:06.270> five<00:02:06.810> base<00:02:07.200> building

fundamentals guide well link to that is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750 
fundamentals guide well link to that is
on<00:02:09.869> your<00:02:10.019> screen<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.409> alternate<00:02:11.400> your<00:02:11.519> gold

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
on your screen is alternate your gold

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.630 
on your screen is alternate your gold
and<00:02:12.000> elixir<00:02:12.120> collectors<00:02:12.930> right<00:02:13.799> now<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.370> gold

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and elixir collectors right now the gold

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.490 
and elixir collectors right now the gold
collectors<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:15.239> concentrated<00:02:16.049> on<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> left

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
collectors are concentrated on the left

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.559 
collectors are concentrated on the left
hand<00:02:16.739> side<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:17.939> do<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.299> inactive

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
hand side so if you do go inactive

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.900 
hand side so if you do go inactive
collector<00:02:19.290> loot<00:02:19.470> will<00:02:19.709> pile<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.430> it's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
collector loot will pile up and it's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.370 
collector loot will pile up and it's
that<00:02:21.090> much<00:02:21.270> easier<00:02:21.510> for<00:02:21.900> someone<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.200> take

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
that much easier for someone to take

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.930 
that much easier for someone to take
that<00:02:22.560> loot<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.950> leave

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940
