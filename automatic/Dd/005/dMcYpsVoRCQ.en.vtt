00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.300
 Welcome to another video and 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.460
 Today video I have a good news. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.699
 Nice to show you that the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.619
 Tim's game producer has made available 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.789
 another great track 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.950
 the players from outside five and the intention 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.850
 this video is to show this circuit to 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.130
 you 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.980
 so here we are with my schaub ct 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:45.430
 500 for the trunk and then I go 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.470
 put him in the camera outside the car 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.690
 for you to have an idea of ​​how the 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.970
 circuit the name circuit is called road 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.809
 america is a track of the united states 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.270
 created if I'm not mistaken in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.800
 955 is a very old lane by the way 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.810
 and nothing better than try it on a 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.220
 American car in an American car that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 ground floor 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:19.150
 Dude, I was really happy because I did not 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:22.090
 I thought about the possibility of the tam 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.430
 dictionary tracks like that of god né que 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.920
 They are the license and the coolest of all 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.330
 is that this should be serious 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.670
 This is not a mistake I'm updating. 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.030
 Automatic at least for me it was a 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.830
 automatic update due to I tile 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.910
 this option checked to update 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.140
 automatically 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.039
 but then this new Delhi c 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.830
 free of charge the second must be 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.030
 free and of the mouth so what more 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.610
 make me happy 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.990
 it is not just because he is released 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.090
 Look, now we're getting in here. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.369
 lane in the curve those clothes had to 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.160
 do and try to do right here in 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.340
 curve here they gave they adopted the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.990
 name is not carousel, what would it be? 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.470
 traffic carousel 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:13.120
 Portuguese is a very scrotal name but 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.360
 already make this legal and that curve is 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.650
 is a curve that usually the galley that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.930
 play outside 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.480
 at least there is no shortage of 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.269
 people would love to pull that curve on the drift 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.900
 and gives because it has enough space 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.360
 It's even nice for me, but I take 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.420
 be deleted 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.030
 so this is it from there let's leave it simple 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.019
 so you will vote the video will 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.180
 return the game today the whole video 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.780
 so we are with the car here one 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.680
 little complicated to fly a 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.380
 thing that I noticed is that the cars 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 with the case here of the class but focus on 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.630
 they have a type difficulty in 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.230
 Samba to play for the guys who play 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.120
 with assists all connected 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.620
 You know what I'm talking about if you do not 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.200
 hold your foot 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.980
 you go away so stay a little 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.049
 complicated 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.019
 Good now talking a little more of the track. 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.540
 in the one that is the intention of the video 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.329
 this track has plenty of open fields 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.780
 as you can see and it is not a clue 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.810
 for a lot of grandstands a thing that 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.030
 people can quietly notice 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.489
 besides the car is skidding to 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:36.609
 fuck then called nelson streetcar 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.270
 too but the track is fucking the car is just 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:43.320
 hit 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.320
 and here we have a magnificent line 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.980
 oh my god and now watch the streak or catch 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.030
 grip handle or no handle and that it was 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.970
 in your marketing 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.310
 So people, I was very happy. 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.800
 As I told you. 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.140
 because I think I have 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.170
 possibility of new clues 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.030
 also by size or five not only this and 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.750
 one clue that I keep enough is the 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.270
 north nurburgring track which is one of the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.170
 my favorite the biggest lane in the world 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:24.190
 beaten 8pm on then i'm very happy 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.110
 of afternoon in these da lcs for free 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.560
 not yet 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.960
 and one thing a cool curiosity 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.729
 it makes so much difference so this galera 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.199
 Who is curious to know that clue? 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.389
 It's a little big as you could. 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.750
 realize it has six miles points 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:43.979
 52 I'm not mistaken and has a total of 14 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.159
 then it 's a very strategic lane. 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.439
 so in real life she was very 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:52.500
 used is also used 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:55.169
 Nazca championships word team just think 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.779
 that something five Czechs to the cap 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.569
 I 'm not very resourceful remembering 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.969
 of this information 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.030
 the fucking past is past and stay 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.600
 friend 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.260
 slowly AHETA boston we are here to 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.970
 car in the sky 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.500
 I will not do the carousel carlos 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:18.350
 andrade 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:22.190
 though I would like it to be the shell bené 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.850
 It tells you it was not so piraquive 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.250
 schelb he gives a lot of game back 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.540
 bringing much back pulls then it is 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.090
 fuck is gay, fuck in English, I was not 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.330
 Fucking hard to control the 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.610
 It's really hard, it 's hard, it 's hard. 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:45.670
 I liked the one on the track. 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:49.070
 She looks very good with the one with the 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:52.100
 how much real life but the scenario has changed 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.510
 a little bit not much so speak 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.680
 fuck is that part that was different 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.990
 so damn 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.780
 but this results from the pressure of 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.050
 adaptations that the company itself makes 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.530
 so it does not feel so ok I do not know 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.020
 I do not know why they do not do much the same 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.630
 I also do not know how to explain to you and 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.460
 we got here on the final stretch I went 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.080
 commenting on random subjects but 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.600
 I also hope you have provided 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.430
 attention in the circuit he was released the 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.980
 two different circuits is that the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.380
 whole circuit a fu circuit and also 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.150
 another circuit that I will not show 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.690
 this video but in future videos and 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.280
 photos so they are probably going to have 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.530
 these days you go with 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.030
 sure to see the other circuit is also a 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.010
 shorter circuit 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.140
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:43.040
