00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.570
 surely more than once they have 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.809
 heard that the key to a good 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.599
 relationship is communication I 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.519
 I am one of those who disagree that no 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.440
 I think communication is the key 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.780
 I think in many ways the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.180
 communication is a symptom I'm going to 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.760
 explain why there are people who are capable 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.220
 to express clearly what 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.519
 are feeling there are some cultures 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.070
 especially where they manage to say with 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.289
 all clarity what they want what 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.090
 they feel what they think they live 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.800
 times in Argentina and if you go 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.170
 to Argentina that an Italian community 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.839
 very large where a mixture is produced 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.089
 culturally interesting in observing that 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.789
 people are able to gesticulate 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.509
 talk about expressing saying and taking out 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:13.850
 all however there are so many problems of 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.770
 couple as in any other place of 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.509
 soon I have found other communities 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.630
 I remember being in a place of 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.899
 Ecuador where people are more is more 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.329
 Silent silent can not express 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.230
 much and has equal amount of 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.990
 problems 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.420
 one of the aspects that will help and goes 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.700
 to collaborate is to learn to learn 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.650
 communicate but we have to learn 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.870
 to communicate we not only have to 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.060
 learn to say things and there it is 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.920
 where we have to learn the meaning of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.780
 the correct communication in a couple 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.630
 in psychology there is a lot of talk about 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.180
 assertiveness assertiveness is the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.710
 ability to say what I am 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.070
 meaning but without humiliating without 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.950
 offend without exalting the voice without using 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.800
 hurtful expressions I hope to say with 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.900
 all clarity what I 'm feeling what 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.400
 that it seems to me that it is not correct what 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.399
 that I think is right 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.830
 also etcetera who lacks in some 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.250
 couples do not lack communication 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.040
 they lack assertiveness that are two things 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.520
 different many couples start to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.130
 have communication conflicts not 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.930
 because they are not communicating but for 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.720
 how they are doing 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.280
 when assertiveness is taught they are 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.050
 teach people first 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.790
 choose the right time 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.320
 and talk at 2 in the morning when the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.990
 people are tired is not a good 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.360
 idea to talk about the mornings is a good 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.190
 idea to speak in a neutral place is to say 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.470
 that is not your house other than the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.840
 bedroom but talking in a restaurant 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.180
 or talk in a park where they have the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.800
 possibility of being content of some 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.530
 way by the presence of other people 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.100
 It is also a good idea 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.260
 Write previously what you are going to say 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.530
 to say it in such a way that it does not go to 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.710
 hurting is also a good idea to talk to you 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.620
 in the mirror thinking you're talking to him 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.080
 Your husband or your wife is not bad either 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.270
 idea because it somehow prepares you 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.850
 for what are you going to say who it is 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.270
 a bad idea to say what you're 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.150
 thinking without measuring your words without 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.480
 measure your expressions and finally that 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.460
 it's like loosing goose feathers that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.080
 finally you want to keep them 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.080
 you want to look later but now 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 let go if you said a bad word if 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.010
 you said a hurtful expression 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.290
 if you used a form of 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.210
 expression that finally ends up being 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.150
 of scale 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.810
 no matter how much you ask for forgiveness for much 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.810
 you regret the damage is already and what 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.850
 it was said you can not withdraw it though 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.180
 ask for forgiveness forgiveness is necessary 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.670
 even if you regret it, you will have done 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.490
 dent in the relationship therefore 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.580
 communicating is not enough is necessary 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.420
 learn to be assertive is necessary 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.810
 learn to say things in such a way 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.590
 let us say our emotions our 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.680
 feelings without hurt without offending without 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.890
 humiliate in some serious cases if not 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.200
 you know how to do it you need to ask for help 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.600
 a professional to guide you to 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.910
 overcome other kinds of things because 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.610
 some people are blocked and they say 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.700
 anything and in that say go 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.250
 destroying the relationship the relationship of 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.270
 couple is built communication is 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.510
 an element is vital however here what 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.270
 what matters is learning to be assertive 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.580
 communicate calmly without offending 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.580
 using the correct words 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.120
 and 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.650
 Y 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.979
 and 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.189
 and
