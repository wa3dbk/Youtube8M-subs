as<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:12.179> common<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.870> lot<00:00:12.900> of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
as is common in a lot of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.760 
as is common in a lot of
dodge<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.920> radiator<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.150> leak<00:00:18.770> under

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
dodge the radiator and so leak under

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.930 
dodge the radiator and so leak under
pressure<00:00:20.630> you'll<00:00:21.630> notice<00:00:22.460> it's<00:00:23.460> leaking

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
pressure you'll notice it's leaking

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.530 
pressure you'll notice it's leaking
around<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:25.020> metal<00:00:25.410> scene

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
around that metal scene

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.280 
around that metal scene
there's<00:00:26.990> no<00:00:27.290> way<00:00:27.500> to<00:00:28.180> fix<00:00:29.180> that<00:00:29.510> so<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.230> only

there's no way to fix that so the only
thing<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:30.680> do<00:00:30.800> is<00:00:31.100> replace<00:00:31.640> it<00:00:32.170> first<00:00:33.170> step<00:00:33.380> in

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
thing to do is replace it first step in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.600 
thing to do is replace it first step in
any<00:00:33.970> automotive<00:00:34.970> repair<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:36.260> move<00:00:36.770> the

any automotive repair is to move the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.870 
any automotive repair is to move the
battery<00:00:38.390> cable<00:00:38.900> we<00:00:39.739> want<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.070> make<00:00:40.370> sure<00:00:40.400> that

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
battery cable we want to make sure that

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.060 
battery cable we want to make sure that
you<00:00:42.489> remove<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.879> prevent<00:00:44.180> any<00:00:44.830> arcing<00:00:45.830> as

you remove it to prevent any arcing as
you're<00:00:46.699> gonna<00:00:46.879> be<00:00:47.059> working<00:00:47.210> around<00:00:47.510> other

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
you're gonna be working around other

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.340 
you're gonna be working around other
electrical<00:00:48.800> wires<00:00:49.629> now<00:00:50.629> that<00:00:50.809> we<00:00:50.870> have<00:00:51.020> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
see that I've already removed it on this

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.620 
see that I've already removed it on this
side<00:02:18.640> they're<00:02:19.640> held<00:02:19.880> in<00:02:19.970> place<00:02:20.030> by<00:02:20.270> these

little plastic grommets I have not been
very<00:02:26.209> successful<00:02:27.020> in<00:02:27.080> getting<00:02:27.230> them<00:02:27.500> out

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
very successful in getting them out

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.740 
very successful in getting them out
without<00:02:27.950> ripping<00:02:28.490> them<00:02:28.790> apart<00:02:28.820> as<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.480> can

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
without ripping them apart as you can

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.770 
without ripping them apart as you can
see<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:30.200> one<00:02:30.440> kind<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.340> tore<00:02:31.550> apart<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:32.630> one

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
see this one kind of tore apart this one

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.800 
see this one kind of tore apart this one
is<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:32.990> 2003<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.160> these<00:02:34.310> plastic<00:02:35.120> are<00:02:35.270> over<00:02:35.510> 11

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
is a 2003 so these plastic are over 11

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.780 
is a 2003 so these plastic are over 11
years<00:02:35.840> old<00:02:36.290> but<00:02:36.560> they<00:02:37.130> can<00:02:37.280> easily<00:02:37.640> be

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
years old but they can easily be

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.050 
years old but they can easily be
replaced<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.800> next<00:02:39.920> step<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.400> I'm<00:02:40.550> also<00:02:40.730> going

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
replaced the next step is I'm also going

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.800 
replaced the next step is I'm also going
to<00:02:42.010> take<00:02:43.010> off<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:44.360> radiator<00:02:44.780> hose<00:02:45.010> as<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:47.660> can

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
to take off the radiator hose as you can

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.810 
to take off the radiator hose as you can
see<00:02:48.050> it's<00:02:48.530> held<00:02:48.800> in<00:02:48.920> place<00:02:49.070> by<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.400> one<00:02:49.730> of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
see it's held in place by just one of

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.610 
see it's held in place by just one of
the<00:02:49.910> tension<00:02:50.720> clamps<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:54.140> there's<00:02:54.320> one<00:02:54.470> on

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the tension clamps and there's one on

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.690 
the tension clamps and there's one on
this<00:02:54.739> side<00:02:54.980> too<00:02:56.560> there<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:57.860> particular<00:02:58.190> tool

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
this side too there is a particular tool

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.340 
this side too there is a particular tool
that's<00:02:59.420> designed<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.650> use<00:03:00.980> with<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:02.350> because

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
that's designed to use with this because

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.259 
that's designed to use with this because
I<00:03:03.560> don't<00:03:03.620> work<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.160> cars<00:03:04.400> all<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.640> time<00:03:04.760> I

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
I don't work on cars all the time I

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.720 
I don't work on cars all the time I
don't<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.690> one<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.870> those<00:03:06.019> tools<00:03:06.730> instead

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
don't have one of those tools instead

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.789 
don't have one of those tools instead
what<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> use<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.570> pair<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.900> channellocks<00:03:09.470> and

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
what I use is a pair of channellocks and

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.790 
what I use is a pair of channellocks and
it<00:03:10.280> works<00:03:10.459> just<00:03:10.670> fine
