00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.799
 new circuit now patrick to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.460
 their direction I tell you Africa 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.730
 from South 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.490
 we are in 1983 is our host and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.290
 alain prost 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.750
 so there it is it is well done 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.990
 roll this not quite the same to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.199
 the year with its immense a line 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.869
 right of the South African circuit it is necessary 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.910
 very well hold the left we see the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 delimit this exit of the stands very 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 long to the end of the line 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.710
 right with a huge rage and then 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.300
 we go back to it now in a 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 sequence of very fast curves 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.790
 it's true that the circuits had a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.790
 tendency to see a lot more this kind 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.070
 big curves that have me 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.129
 that he no house today alas was 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.739
 of those right dauchy lens was 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.710
 particularly delicate and we arrive 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.860
 on a slower and fairer portion 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.879
 behind the stands below and who 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.210
 is the 6 consists of a nice my turn to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 right followed by a left of a left 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 means your that the adhesion is 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 excellent bac it's basically 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.680
 a circuit of two performances of 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.259
 motorizations here right went up with 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.630
 micro pressure and only went back to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 a right a hairpin bend the most 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 slow circuit 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.630
 I ran out of gas 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 there a little bit later in 84 a few 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 a few laps from the finish then 7th 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.670
 long straight lines of cases at night 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 with what was not a turn 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.440
 since it was almost finally 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.350
 win is so essentially a 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.420
 very high speed head circuit and 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.270
 power with good stability at 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.440
 braking here for that right before 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.510
 chaining in front of the free loan 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.280
 he left for a second round 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.260
 actually at altitude level at 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 years old and that it was located high enough in 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.229
 altitude is good what is it 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.760
 really changes a lot of things loss 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.740
 power for engines 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.780
 atmospheric turbo engines a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.600
 little less in sight than peace 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.369
 their direct competitors but especially 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.470
 this sequence of two big curves 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.260
 which is necessary to have a chassis 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.260
 perfectly balanced and very effective 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.470
 always on the thread of the trajectory 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.510
 we hear alain prost here demoted to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.819
 reviving the turbo engine so 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.069
 important because the reports were very 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.189
 long on this circuit is there for this 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.890
 left turn will look for the second 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.379
 and it was difficult at the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.769
 handling of the gearbox 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.579
 on all this on the renault of having a 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.370
 efficiency in the downshift 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.459
 so passage of years reports and is a 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.450
 single-seater rather difficult to drive in 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.450
 this technical area
