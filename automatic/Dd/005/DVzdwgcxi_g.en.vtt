00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.839 

okay<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> topic<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.450> time<00:00:13.049> travel<00:00:13.379> is<00:00:14.099> it

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
okay the topic here is time travel is it

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.510 
okay the topic here is time travel is it
possible<00:00:15.539> even<00:00:15.869> in<00:00:16.260> theory<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.949> do<00:00:17.070> something

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
possible even in theory to do something

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.190 
possible even in theory to do something
like<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.110> or<00:00:19.110> not<00:00:19.520> well<00:00:20.520> moving<00:00:21.450> forward<00:00:22.050> in

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
like this or not well moving forward in

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.490 
like this or not well moving forward in
time<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.829> no<00:00:23.130> problem<00:00:23.599> as<00:00:24.599> far<00:00:24.660> as<00:00:25.020> physicists

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
time is no problem as far as physicists

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
time is no problem as far as physicists
are<00:00:25.680> concerned<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.670> no-brainer<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
are concerned it's a no-brainer the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.839 
are concerned it's a no-brainer the
answer<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> yes<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.830> course<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.789> fact

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
answer is yes of course we can in fact

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.359 
answer is yes of course we can in fact
we're<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.929> doing<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> right<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:31.949> we're<00:00:32.250> all

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
we're all doing it right now we're all

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
we're all doing it right now we're all
moving<00:00:32.640> forward<00:00:33.210> uniformly<00:00:34.110> pretty<00:00:34.470> much

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
moving forward uniformly pretty much

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.030 
moving forward uniformly pretty much
through<00:00:35.070> time<00:00:35.339> and<00:00:35.699> we<00:00:36.449> can<00:00:36.660> move<00:00:36.900> forward<00:00:37.260> in

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
through time and we can move forward in

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.340 
through time and we can move forward in
time<00:00:38.280> enormous<00:00:39.180> amounts<00:00:39.660> millions<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.320> even

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
time enormous amounts millions or even

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.040 
time enormous amounts millions or even
billions<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.250> years<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:42.269> travel<00:00:42.600> fast

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
billions of years if we travel fast

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.010 
billions of years if we travel fast
enough<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:45.180> faster<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.170> move<00:00:46.410> through<00:00:47.309> space

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
enough the faster you move through space

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.770 
enough the faster you move through space
the<00:00:49.020> more<00:00:49.289> slowly<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.430> move<00:00:50.699> through<00:00:51.000> time<00:00:51.360> in

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the more slowly you move through time in

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
the more slowly you move through time in

maybe everyone on earth is dead and you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
maybe everyone on earth is dead and you
know<00:01:24.420> half<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> million<00:01:25.170> generations<00:01:25.650> have

know half a million generations have

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
know half a million generations have

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.340 
passed by moving forward into the future
and<00:01:29.000> staying<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.420> no<00:01:30.750> problem<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.259> all

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and staying there is no problem at all

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800 
and staying there is no problem at all
going<00:01:32.280> backwards<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> much<00:01:33.030> more<00:01:33.240> problematic

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
going backwards is much more problematic

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
going backwards is much more problematic
of<00:01:34.079> course<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> paradox<00:01:35.400> issues

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of course because of the paradox issues

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
of course because of the paradox issues

paradox<00:02:52.530> issues<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.700> if<00:02:53.850> i<00:02:53.970> were<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.210> heavy

then<00:02:58.830> again<00:02:58.980> lots<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.820> physicists<00:03:00.300> around

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
then again lots of physicists around

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.830 
then again lots of physicists around
1901<00:03:01.500> 1902<00:03:02.310> would<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.820> told<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.270> there's

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
1901 1902 would have told you there's

1901 1902 would have told you there's

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.810 
flying machine and just a year later
they<00:03:09.930> were<00:03:09.990> all<00:03:10.260> proved<00:03:10.820> embarrassingly

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
they were all proved embarrassingly

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.180 
they were all proved embarrassingly
wrong<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.260> I'm<00:03:13.410> going<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.650> leave<00:03:13.950> the

wrong and so I'm going to leave the
possibility<00:03:14.940> open<00:03:15.170> just<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
possibility open just so that as the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.310 
possibility open just so that as the
time<00:03:17.970> travelers<00:03:18.450> start<00:03:18.720> appearing<00:03:19.020> in<00:03:19.290> the

time travelers start appearing in the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
next few minutes or hours or whatever

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000 
next few minutes or hours or whatever
around<00:03:21.720> me<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.080> won't<00:03:22.560> look<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.890> complete
