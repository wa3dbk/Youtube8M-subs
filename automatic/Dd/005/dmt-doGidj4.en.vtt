00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.750
 new video of max de my name is max 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.110
 and I want you mobile today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.019
 Introduce battery of raw power with 1400 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.849
 millennia yes so they die 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.710
 packaging from when you have the device 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.020
 For example , Amazon ordered for about 35 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.859
 Euro 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.140
 on the back is a few more 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.600
 devices where you then also with 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.300
 can charge eg ipad iphone and ipod 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.380
 and of course other phones or tablets 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.380
 or mp3 player 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.390
 The device has as I said 14,000 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.860
 milli-hour capacity is called here 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 rpp b13 is the exact model name 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.750
 and it is here advertising up to 500 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.329
 sometimes rechargeable or a little more even than 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 500 times the delivery scope looks like this 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.559
 we have here a guide we have 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.190
 here one more 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.070
 thanks card and a guarantee card then 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.760
 we have several cables once a micro 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.489
 USB cable to normal usb with flat 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.820
 cable so can not prevent 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.970
 then we have a micro usb too 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.330
 normal usb cable a little longer with 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.710
 flat cable then we have one 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.490
 adapter from normal micro usb to mini 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.860
 usb for mini usb devices to load and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.869
 then we have a samsung 30 pin 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.439
 adapter for example for samsung galaxy 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.119
 so until the older generation tablets 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:38.340
 2012/2013 rum 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.750
 yes that's what's on cable is then 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.430
 we still have a nice bag with us 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.829
 where we just get it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.630
 can keep when we are in the backpack 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.399
 or whatever you are traveling with 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.270
 have the device looks like that 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.439
 most important are certainly the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.590
 Connections on the front here we have 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.180
 1 amp output usb connection and here 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.520
 the second usb connection with 2 amps 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.439
 output that lends itself for example 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.960
 For tablets that usually want to 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.280
 a little more charging current will be charged and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.860
 are just then accordingly 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.180
 faster one more here 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.359
 flashlight function or a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.950
 the led and then the charging connection with it 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.319
 you can recharge the battery, the charging time 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.989
 is about ten hours when the device 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.890
 Teacher is relatively long though 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.200
 you then have the possibility 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.040
 really very long time at it 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.540
 to charge here on the front we have 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.980
 four leds and we can do that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.689
 check charging status by simply clicking here 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.810
 click on it and then you see already 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.079
 that now all four leds are lit and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.750
 Accordingly, the device is just from above 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.530
 if only the logo and on the sides 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.989
 is nothing 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.349
 on the back is then again 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.019
 we raise output with output one 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.900
 and two each have 5 volts 1 and 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.040
 2 amps yes and the input it also 5 volts 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.489
 and 1 5 ampere 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.370
 yes, personally, if the device is great 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.629
 Well that feels well handled too 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.939
 It does not sound good to me now 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.280
 shiny plastic but beautiful 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.230
 frosted and yes this weight is 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.239
 naturally high 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.799
 however, I personally think it is 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.150
 for the 14,000 milliard already 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.979
 good for a backpack it is actually 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.500
 ideal if for example longer 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.629
 hiking or power plane or 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.269
 In the train really a lot of battery needs then 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.799
 The device is ideal for the price of 35 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.609
 euro in any case recommended my 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.260
 galaxy s 4 for example has it with the 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.840
 2600 milliamps about four 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.859
 charged up to five times depending on what 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.569
 I think it's pretty good and 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.919
 according to iphones with the smaller ones 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.530
 Battery can then significantly more often 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.389
 so much to the raw are charged 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.609
 power battery with 14,000 milliamp hours 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.840
 if you still have questions about the device then have 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.840
 like to comment on it
