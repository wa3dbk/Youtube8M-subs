as you can see I've lined up the print
this<00:00:32.460> right<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> called<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> selvage

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this right here is called the selvage

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.810 
this right here is called the selvage

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
from this printed edge all the way

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.299 
from this printed edge all the way
around<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.329> other<00:00:48.539> printed<00:00:48.870> edge<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> when

we cut your yardage we cut from this end

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.200 
we cut your yardage we cut from this end
up<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.170> end<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
up to that end so here you can see I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.229 
up to that end so here you can see I
have<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.899> yardstick<00:00:58.489> sitting<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.910> edge<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
have a yardstick sitting on this edge of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479 
have a yardstick sitting on this edge of
the<00:01:00.300> fabric<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.129> yard<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the fabric so this is what one yard of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
the fabric so this is what one yard of
fabric<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.300> 36<00:01:04.110> inches<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.680> fabric<00:01:06.200> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
fabric is this is 36 inches of fabric to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.649 
fabric is this is 36 inches of fabric to
measure<00:01:07.409> your<00:01:07.740> selvage<00:01:08.220> edge<00:01:08.510> we're<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
measure your selvage edge we're going to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.460 
measure your selvage edge we're going to
take<00:01:09.810> our<00:01:09.930> yardstick<00:01:11.720> line<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.229> edge

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
take our yardstick line up on this edge

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
take our yardstick line up on this edge
we're<00:01:14.189> gonna<00:01:14.340> come<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.360> I've<00:01:15.479> made

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
we're gonna come over here now I've made

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.719 
we're gonna come over here now I've made
it<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> print<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.710> even<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.340> very

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it so that the print is even or very

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.760 
it so that the print is even or very
close<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:19.080> quite<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.290> even<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.650> this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
close to it not quite as even on this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.240 
close to it not quite as even on this
side<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:20.939> we've<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.330> between<00:01:21.840> 33<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.970> 34

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
side but so we've got between 33 and 34

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.020 
side but so we've got between 33 and 34
inches<00:01:27.740> doesn't<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> focus<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.939> we've

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
inches doesn't want to focus so we've

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
inches doesn't want to focus so we've
got<00:01:30.150> between<00:01:30.390> 33<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> 34<00:01:31.170> inches<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
got between 33 and 34 inches so that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.270 
got between 33 and 34 inches so that
gives<00:01:32.040> us<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> total<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:34.250> 66<00:01:35.450> 67<00:01:36.450> inches<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
gives us a total of 66 67 inches so this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.510 
gives us a total of 66 67 inches so this
fabric<00:01:38.579> cut<00:01:39.329> right<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:40.049> 36<00:01:40.950> inches<00:01:41.130> tall

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
fabric cut right here is 36 inches tall

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.020 
fabric cut right here is 36 inches tall
which<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:42.090> yard<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> fabric<00:01:42.600> by<00:01:43.790> 67<00:01:44.790> inches

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
which is one yard of fabric by 67 inches

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.899 
which is one yard of fabric by 67 inches
wide<00:01:45.829> now<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.220> were<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.640> cut<00:01:47.790> the

wide now if you were going to cut the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.819 
wide now if you were going to cut the
fabric<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> resell<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.259> fat<00:01:50.189> cast<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.680> would

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.520 
fabric to resell a fat cast you would
literally<00:01:53.130> cut<00:01:53.720> how<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.020> folded<00:01:55.290> right

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
literally cut how I have it folded right

now<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:12.360> would<00:02:12.480> go<00:02:12.629> right<00:02:12.750> down<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> center

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
now you would go right down the center

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.550 
now you would go right down the center
and<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.410> would

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and you would

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.180 
and you would
cut<00:02:13.770> all<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.880> way<00:02:14.970> along<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.480> center<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
cut all the way along the center so the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.449 
cut all the way along the center so the
person<00:02:17.550> would<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.700> getting<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.950> entire

person would be getting this entire
strip<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.090> fabric<00:02:21.209> here<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.670> half<00:02:23.940> on

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
strip of fabric here have this half on

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.589 
strip of fabric here have this half on
this<00:02:24.390> end<00:02:24.660> both<00:02:25.080> sides<00:02:25.410> if<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:27.030> are<00:02:27.120> selling<00:02:27.450> a

this end both sides if you are selling a
phat<00:02:28.349> flutter<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.250> fabric<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:29.880> literally<00:02:30.269> a

quarter anytime you have the word phat

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.370 
quarter anytime you have the word phat
it's<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.090> same<00:02:33.300> amount<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.630> fabric<00:02:33.810> it's<00:02:34.140> just

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
it's the same amount of fabric it's just

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
it's the same amount of fabric it's just
any<00:02:34.680> fat<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.220> form<00:02:35.730> versus<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> skinny<00:02:36.510> form

because<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.680> was<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> cut<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.130> regular

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
because if I was to cut a regular

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.930 
because if I was to cut a regular
quarter<00:02:38.819> of<00:02:38.940> fabric<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:40.519> regular<00:02:41.519> quarter<00:02:41.760> yard

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
quarter of fabric a regular quarter yard

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
quarter of fabric a regular quarter yard
of<00:02:42.030> fabric<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.480> about<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.170> much<00:02:43.230> it

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
of fabric would be about that much it

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.030 
of fabric would be about that much it
would<00:02:44.099> be<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.370> entire<00:02:44.730> strip<00:02:45.120> right<00:02:45.269> here<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
would be this entire strip right here a

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.229 
would be this entire strip right here a
fat<00:02:47.040> quarter<00:02:48.860> would<00:02:49.860> be<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.610> layer<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.120> what

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
fat quarter would be one layer of what

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.570 
fat quarter would be one layer of what
we're<00:02:51.420> seeing<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.590> top<00:02:53.010> piece<00:02:53.340> of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
we're seeing just this top piece of

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.870 
we're seeing just this top piece of
fabric<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:55.500> half<00:02:55.739> yard<00:02:56.010> height<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.459> 18

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
fabric but a half yard height so 18

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880 
fabric but a half yard height so 18
inches<00:02:57.180> but<00:02:57.720> whatever<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.200> width<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.470> fabric

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
inches but whatever the width the fabric

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.860 
inches but whatever the width the fabric
is<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.790> difference<00:03:00.090> between<00:03:00.180> quilting

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
is the difference between quilting

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.570 
is the difference between quilting
Cotton's<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.560> knits<00:03:02.010> which<00:03:02.280> some<00:03:02.459> people

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
Cotton's and knits which some people

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.850 
Cotton's and knits which some people
don't<00:03:02.819> recognize<00:03:03.239> realize<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.709> by

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
don't recognize realize is that it is by

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.320 
don't recognize realize is that it is by
the<00:03:04.920> width<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.489> fabric<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.660> fat<00:03:07.140> quarter<00:03:07.440> is

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
the width of fabric so a fat quarter is

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.380 
the width of fabric so a fat quarter is
half<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.780> yard<00:03:10.290> high<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:11.489> only<00:03:11.610> half<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.239> width

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
half a yard high but only half the width

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.420 
half a yard high but only half the width
so<00:03:12.599> if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> had<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.049> quilting<00:03:13.530> cotton<00:03:13.890> which

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so if you had a quilting cotton which

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.770 
so if you had a quilting cotton which
are<00:03:14.610> forty<00:03:15.000> four<00:03:15.209> inches<00:03:15.420> you're<00:03:15.599> going<00:03:15.630> to

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
are forty four inches you're going to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.470 
are forty four inches you're going to
have<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> 22<00:03:16.500> inch<00:03:16.650> wide<00:03:16.860> strip<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:18.209> case

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
have a 22 inch wide strip in this case

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.610 
have a 22 inch wide strip in this case
you're<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.959> 33<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.590> half

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you're going to have a 33 and a half

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.550 
you're going to have a 33 and a half
inch<00:03:20.130> wide<00:03:20.220> strip<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.109> some<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
inch wide strip so that is some of the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.729 
inch wide strip so that is some of the
basics<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.070> how<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.310> measure<00:03:23.760> fabric<00:03:24.739> most

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
basics of how to measure fabric most

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.280 
basics of how to measure fabric most
people<00:03:26.160> will<00:03:26.340> list<00:03:26.640> height<00:03:27.540> by<00:03:27.930> with<00:03:28.109> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
people will list height by with the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.289 
people will list height by with the
fabric<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.220> if<00:03:29.340> you're<00:03:29.489> selling<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.940> piece<00:03:30.090> of

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
fabric so if you're selling a piece of

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.220 
fabric so if you're selling a piece of
fabric<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.989> say<00:03:32.359> 36<00:03:33.359> inches<00:03:33.690> long<00:03:33.750> so

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
fabric that is say 36 inches long so

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.180 
fabric that is say 36 inches long so
it's<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.410> yard<00:03:34.650> long<00:03:35.030> but<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.150> only<00:03:36.950> 40<00:03:37.950> inches

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
it's a yard long but it's only 40 inches

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.250 
it's a yard long but it's only 40 inches
wide<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.730> would<00:03:38.850> want<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.060> list<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.390> 30<00:03:39.959> inches

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
wide you would want to list it 30 inches

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.160 
wide you would want to list it 30 inches
by<00:03:40.859> 40<00:03:41.280> inches<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.819> when<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.750> wash<00:03:42.989> your

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
by 40 inches and when you wash your

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.629 
by 40 inches and when you wash your
fabric<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.620> are<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.069> lose<00:03:44.190> measurement

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
fabric you are going to lose measurement

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.280 
fabric you are going to lose measurement
so<00:03:44.760> always<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:45.030> sure<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.299> set<00:03:45.600> how<00:03:45.750> people<00:03:46.079> if

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
so always be sure to set how people if

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.140 
so always be sure to set how people if
it's<00:03:46.440> pre<00:03:46.650> washed<00:03:46.859> or<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.060> the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
it's pre washed or not so that is the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.900 
it's pre washed or not so that is the
basics<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.630> how<00:03:48.690> to
