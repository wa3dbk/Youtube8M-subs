overall it really is great comfort and
at<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.460> same<00:00:55.670> time<00:00:55.730> you<00:00:56.090> can<00:00:56.240> change<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
at the same time you can change the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.570 
at the same time you can change the
program<00:00:57.080> to<00:00:57.260> have<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.500> more<00:00:57.740> sporty<00:00:58.040> program<00:00:58.460> if

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
program to have a more sporty program if

program to have a more sporty program if
you<00:00:58.700> want<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.150> so<00:00:59.690> there's<00:00:59.900> a<00:00:59.960> lot<00:01:00.140> of

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
you want to so there's a lot of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.840 
you want to so there's a lot of
different<00:01:00.620> functionality<00:01:01.280> but<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.580> really

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
different functionality but it really

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.539 
different functionality but it really
overall<00:01:02.240> gives<00:01:02.630> us<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.930> great<00:01:03.110> edge<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.430> new

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
overall gives us a great edge in the new

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.969 
overall gives us a great edge in the new
transmission<00:01:05.150> technology<00:01:05.689> super<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.740> tell

locking differentials and the do you

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.450 
locking differentials and the do you
have<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.720> torque<00:01:12.049> vectoring<00:01:12.470> differentially

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
have a torque vectoring differentially

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.180 
have a torque vectoring differentially
know<00:01:14.420> we<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.870> we<00:01:15.170> basically<00:01:15.530> have<00:01:15.890> on<00:01:16.040> this

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
know we have a we basically have on this

car standard equipment Quattro with 40
60<00:01:19.130> over<00:01:19.670> 40<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.090> is<00:01:20.210> rear<00:01:20.480> valance<00:01:21.200> rear<00:01:21.500> OS

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
60 over 40 so it is rear valance rear OS

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.670 
60 over 40 so it is rear valance rear OS
Quattro<00:01:22.340> exactly<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.780> course<00:01:23.810> edl<00:01:24.409> on

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
Quattro exactly and of course edl on

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.760 
Quattro exactly and of course edl on
each<00:01:24.830> side<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.540> front<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:26.750> rear<00:01:26.900> of<00:01:27.229> the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
of the differential to them split power

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.770 
of the differential to them split power
sideways<00:01:30.620> as<00:01:30.860> well<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:31.580> it's<00:01:31.850> really<00:01:32.120> adapted

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
sideways as well so it's really adapted

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.410 
sideways as well so it's really adapted
to<00:01:32.810> any<00:01:33.050> surface<00:01:33.770> traction<00:01:34.280> any<00:01:34.790> environment

to any surface traction any environment

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.730 
to any surface traction any environment
that<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.750> can<00:01:35.900> have<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.170> courage<00:01:36.530> yes

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
that you can have the courage yes

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.740 
that you can have the courage yes
absolutely<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.850> not<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.600> a

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
absolutely and it is not it is a

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.480 
absolutely and it is not it is a
full-time<00:01:39.140> all-wheel<00:01:39.530> drive<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.159> is<00:01:40.250> not

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
full-time all-wheel drive so it is not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.000 
full-time all-wheel drive so it is not
waiting<00:01:41.030> for<00:01:41.299> slip<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.810> happen<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:42.830> not

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
waiting for slip to happen it is not

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.310 
waiting for slip to happen it is not
reactive<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:43.940> really<00:01:44.270> proactive<00:01:44.540> in<00:01:45.200> the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
reactive it is really proactive in the

and<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.440> really<00:04:00.769> holds<00:04:01.280> just<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.880> multitude<00:04:02.600> of

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
and it really holds just a multitude of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.259 
and it really holds just a multitude of
new<00:04:03.200> things<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.950> new<00:04:04.010> improvements<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:05.120> is

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
new things and new improvements it is

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.360 
new things and new improvements it is
hard<00:04:05.540> drive<00:04:05.780> base<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.709> now<00:04:06.860> have<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.099> hard

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
hard drive base so we now have a hard

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.490 
hard drive base so we now have a hard
drive<00:04:07.520> which<00:04:08.150> stores<00:04:08.540> all<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.780> navigation

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
drive which stores all the navigation

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.410 
drive which stores all the navigation
data<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:10.250> navigation<00:04:10.970> feature

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
data the navigation feature

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.210 
data the navigation feature
itself<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:11.870> vastly<00:04:12.349> improved<00:04:12.860> we<00:04:13.099> are

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
itself is vastly improved we are

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.040 
itself is vastly improved we are
actually<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.730> first<00:04:13.970> ones<00:04:14.330> to<00:04:14.480> use<00:04:14.630> an

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
actually the first ones to use an

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.560 
actually the first ones to use an
automotive<00:04:15.500> grade<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.160> video<00:04:16.549> chip<00:04:16.880> which

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
automotive grade and video chip which

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.780 
automotive grade and video chip which
really<00:04:17.959> gives<00:04:18.350> us<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.799> ability<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.430> display

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
really gives us the ability to display

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.350 
really gives us the ability to display
in<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.150> very<00:04:20.419> crisp<00:04:20.810> way<00:04:21.079> fantage<00:04:21.769> at<00:04:22.040> 3d<00:04:22.700> map<00:04:23.030> a

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
in a very crisp way fantage at 3d map a

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.900 
in a very crisp way fantage at 3d map a
true<00:04:23.780> 3d<00:04:24.230> map<00:04:24.440> with<00:04:25.040> topographic<00:04:25.790> information

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
true 3d map with topographic information

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.420 
true 3d map with topographic information
and<00:04:26.630> buildings<00:04:27.169> throughout<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.010> entire<00:04:28.280> US

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
and buildings throughout the entire US

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.270 
and buildings throughout the entire US
so<00:04:28.730> it<00:04:28.880> really<00:04:29.120> is<00:04:29.360> very<00:04:29.389> very<00:04:30.020> nice<00:04:30.169> we<00:04:31.130> also

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
so it really is very very nice we also

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.230 
so it really is very very nice we also
have<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.730> new<00:04:32.419> Audi<00:04:33.050> music<00:04:33.740> interface<00:04:34.240> which

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
have a new Audi music interface which

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.450 
have a new Audi music interface which
doesn't<00:04:36.110> really<00:04:36.290> take<00:04:36.500> up<00:04:36.650> any<00:04:36.860> space<00:04:36.889> in<00:04:37.160> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
doesn't really take up any space in the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.120 
doesn't really take up any space in the
glove<00:04:37.669> box<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.150> just<00:04:38.389> a<00:04:38.480> little<00:04:39.130> connector

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
glove box it is just a little connector

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.070 
glove box it is just a little connector
on<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.370> side<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.669> you<00:04:41.030> plug<00:04:41.240> in<00:04:41.450> any<00:04:41.630> kind<00:04:41.930> of

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
on the side that you plug in any kind of

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.740 
on the side that you plug in any kind of
device<00:04:42.620> into<00:04:43.070> that's<00:04:43.910> also<00:04:44.180> available<00:04:44.630> as

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
device into that's also available as

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.240 
device into that's also available as
part<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.200> new<00:04:45.320> system<00:04:45.560> there's<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:46.010> lot<00:04:46.220> of

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
part of the new system there's a lot of

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.680 
part of the new system there's a lot of
improvements<00:04:46.940> when<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.180> comes<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.510> voice

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
improvements when it comes to voice

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.440 
improvements when it comes to voice
recognition<00:04:48.610> we<00:04:49.610> have<00:04:49.820> actually<00:04:50.180> true

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
recognition we have actually true

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.510 
recognition we have actually true
text-to-speech<00:04:50.990> engine<00:04:51.410> inside<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.100> car<00:04:52.340> and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
text-to-speech engine inside the car and

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.330 
text-to-speech engine inside the car and
just<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.270> multitude<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:53.990> new<00:04:54.650> improvements<00:04:55.070> we

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
just a multitude of new improvements we

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.650 
just a multitude of new improvements we
also<00:04:55.520> have<00:04:55.700> a<00:04:55.729> joystick<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.360> probably

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
also have a joystick you probably

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.920 
also have a joystick you probably
noticed<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.200> on<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.430> only<00:04:59.030> mm<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.419> controller

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
noticed that on the only mm I controller

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.290 
noticed that on the only mm I controller
right<00:05:00.229> which<00:05:00.680> allows<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.490> scroll<00:05:01.880> within

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
right which allows you to scroll within

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.110 
right which allows you to scroll within
the<00:05:02.450> map<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.169> much<00:05:03.560> more<00:05:03.910> elastic<00:05:04.910> now

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
the map so it is much more elastic now

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.850 
the map so it is much more elastic now
I've<00:05:05.330> got<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.540> brand-new<00:05:05.960> iphone<00:05:06.470> which<00:05:06.710> I'm

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
I've got a brand-new iphone which I'm

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.710 
I've got a brand-new iphone which I'm
really<00:05:06.979> excited<00:05:07.130> about<00:05:07.760> tell<00:05:08.389> me<00:05:08.479> how<00:05:08.600> I<00:05:08.630> can

really excited about tell me how I can

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.480 
really excited about tell me how I can
use<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.229> with<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.470> car<00:05:09.680> well<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.220> plug<00:05:10.460> that

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
use that with the car well you plug that

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.700 
use that with the car well you plug that
in<00:05:10.820> just<00:05:10.940> like<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.180> regular<00:05:11.510> ipod<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:12.290> works<00:05:12.500> the

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
in just like a regular ipod it works the

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.100 
in just like a regular ipod it works the
same<00:05:12.740> way<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.880> displays<00:05:14.240> all<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.630> songs

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
same way and it displays all the songs

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.830 
same way and it displays all the songs
in<00:05:15.440> in<00:05:15.979> your<00:05:16.340> MMI<00:05:16.760> system<00:05:16.789> just<00:05:17.479> like<00:05:17.660> you

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
in in your MMI system just like you

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.360 
in in your MMI system just like you
would<00:05:17.960> see<00:05:18.169> them<00:05:18.260> on<00:05:18.380> your<00:05:18.530> iPhone<00:05:18.890> and<00:05:19.160> how

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
would see them on your iPhone and how

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.740 
would see them on your iPhone and how
does<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:19.580> interface<00:05:20.090> with<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.360> hands-free

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
does it interface with a hands-free

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.810 
does it interface with a hands-free
system<00:05:21.110> for<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.500> telephone<00:05:21.890> works<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.789> same

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
system for the telephone works the same

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.000 
system for the telephone works the same
way<00:05:23.030> so<00:05:23.210> as<00:05:23.330> long<00:05:23.720> as<00:05:23.780> it's<00:05:24.050> bonded<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.800> will

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
way so as long as it's bonded it will

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.800 
way so as long as it's bonded it will
actually<00:05:25.190> work<00:05:25.640> and<00:05:25.940> it<00:05:26.060> will<00:05:26.210> also<00:05:26.330> manage

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
actually work and it will also manage

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.110 
actually work and it will also manage
the<00:05:26.990> priority<00:05:27.500> so<00:05:27.740> if<00:05:27.979> you're<00:05:28.310> playing<00:05:28.610> song

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
the priority so if you're playing song

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.270 
the priority so if you're playing song
for<00:05:29.390> example<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.050> your<00:05:30.380> phone<00:05:30.590> call<00:05:30.830> comes<00:05:31.070> in

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
for example and your phone call comes in

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.100 
for example and your phone call comes in
your<00:05:31.760> phone<00:05:32.030> will<00:05:32.210> simply<00:05:32.600> ring<00:05:32.780> you'll<00:05:32.960> be

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
your phone will simply ring you'll be

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
your phone will simply ring you'll be
able<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.410> pick<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:33.740> up<00:05:33.860> with<00:05:34.039> the

able to pick it up with the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.070 
able to pick it up with the
multifunction<00:05:34.729> steering<00:05:34.850> wheel<00:05:35.240> it's<00:05:35.780> all

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
multifunction steering wheel it's all

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.050 
multifunction steering wheel it's all
integrated<00:05:36.410> in<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.979> really<00:05:37.250> great<00:05:37.400> way<00:05:37.610> now<00:05:38.000> I
