 friends closing this year 2014 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.030

 so I hope we will continue 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.210
 grow and it's thanks to your loyalty

 warm in the heart happy new year to all the

 world for this new year 2015 this 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.969
 which awaits us today 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.680
 you guys are safe in seven healthy body 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.690
 finally apple to lamborghini since jesus 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.859
 and I was able to read precisely there are few 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.300
 time a comment from a person who 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.309
 asked me if lamborghini was doing 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.789
 appearance on a project of cars it's not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.649
 at all the case 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:08.149
 and to do that we go on clio are 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.160
 appeal to curious it goes on to this 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.390
 Corsa who also announced us a 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.770
 very good thing is they did 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.050
 simply acquiring the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.030
 license - borghini and because of this they 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.520
 will share nine models 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.320
 lamborghini that will make appearance 2015 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.240
 swore this model there it is about love 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.700
 lamborghini huracan which will also be 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.049
 available as gt3 which will have 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.150
 the sale to say that I mark I 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.560
 impatient therefore repairs to test they 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.240
 also have the count on a the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.790
 gallardo and other models that I do not 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.079
 do not know my thing to 9 models side 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.930
 tattered online will make appearance 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.400
 for 2015 on the a7 corson model that we have 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.720
 under the eyes it is simply 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.280
 a mode that can be downloaded 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.869
 free on the internet 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.990
 just like the circuit we are going to have 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.939
 exploit face alias and the road america 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.619
 little course on laps and here I go 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.479
 just validated against my setting that 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.070
 I called test since indeed 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.930
 come to overcome the little worries that 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.000
 can meet in relation to the settings 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.770
 by default which is simply a 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.210
 driving in the bar the slightest bend 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.870
 less braking his share a little 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.300
 little in every way 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.289
 we will hope that the small adjustments 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.480
 that I finally made him 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.709
 bore fruit and we will try to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.890
 finish on the podium so see who 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.989
 dirty the Indian file that allows me to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.769
 able to return from within and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.769
 take third place 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.180
 I was 4th at the mans I say there I 'm going 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.650
 take me third place 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.510
 and I will try to keep it because 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.310
 that honestly from you to me I hang on 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.140
 not at all I'm not hanging on 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.340
 58 because it's something pretty 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.560
 unpredictable I'm not actually at 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.340
 comfortable I feel like being tense 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.870
 when I have the ball in my hands 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.269
 because I'm afraid she'll leave 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.530
 little bit of lollipop and for any 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.849
 what about the fact that it is for 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.139
 braking for is not there for 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.819
 criticize since it is a mode 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.469
 but here is a little felt 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.639
 that we can have and its sweet on the 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.859
 price is available it only has one 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.209
 man who was doing mine is available this 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.379
 which at times makes me tend to 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.980
 believe that they do not hinder none 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.569
 not turn 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.940
 yes I prefer to avoid who touches me 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.269
 because by experience with some 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 minutes of testing a year ago less 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.170
 of an hour because I downloaded 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.860
 that just now his cars just 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.299
 touching him 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.250
 unfortunately I finished everything from 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.170
 continuation in the grass it was a little bit 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.209
 annoying for me but here I am 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.770
 second I scratched a place I'm going 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.270
 try to keep 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.650
 on the tour 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.650
 what our vision on trajectories 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.769
 respect the trajectories 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.660
 he also the tendency to be so I would 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.440
 am not alone to undergo 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.440
 he 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.660
 these long bends I would have hoped to 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.340
 take a little faster 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.940
 we will be content with that 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.190
 renault engine brake 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.020
 the city to finish on loeb at the level of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.670
 setting irathen touch to the split 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.800
 braking because without destabilizing 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.050
 at the corner entrance I had the back 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.069
 who was going to the front and 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.239
 I accentuated the support 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.409
 Besides, there was someone who had me 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.819
 asked for a comment if what you want 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.799
 present my settings on project of 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.569
 kearl in terms of car settings 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.010
 in video friends possibly on 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.230
 the settings of bagnols there is also a 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.019
 very good thing about projects on each 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.969
 slider that allows me to know 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.299
 there silence see a little bit how that 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.829
 ten slider cats with the description 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.540
 when we go right next to that we 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.370
 allows you to see 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.870
 because it could accept as a type 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.440
 of behavior on the break if we 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.400
 increases it decreases the value concerned 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.350
 I made a video to give you a 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.160
 little bit my settings 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.320
 how in any case I tend to 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.520
 do as I did a video 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.780
 for the drifting cat and the settings 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.780
 terrible that I had already been able to present 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.699
 I see that at the braking level 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.080
 that I take 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.369
 same for the road america ensures that 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.899
 it's been a while that I have not exploited 

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:44.860
 so with a car that I have 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:46.300
 downloaded within an hour 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.070
 it's a little bit on a ball in the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.780
 heart 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.040
 200 can refresh a little bit 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.040
 the inside of the games really dragged this 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.080
 ground there if it allows to have 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.770
 new futuristic little game design of the 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.700
 Bobigny share and then an interior that 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.700
 looks like the golden delta 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.020
 I really love to see a little 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.699
 what the developers 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.620
 you will not book us on this model 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.620
 there for example even at home 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.510
 this case not bad already two modes 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.850
 available on the season 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.360
 unfortunately they are paying 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.360
 categories 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:28.380
 dtm models audi there is not bad 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.380
 too much but it pays 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.670
 invest in it 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.849
 just that I stick to iton because 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.020
 I still believe in flying finger 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.509
 I'm really not comfortable with this 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.110
 car I thought why not 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.849
 satisfy people who 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.350
 wanted me to introduce more 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.800
 super case outside of them 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.540
 May 15 that are available on you 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.760
 soon enough it happens to him like a bomb 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.740
 behind 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.740
 child I was sure I'm going to retack 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.639
 we the diet I do them outright 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.620
 go down to the bottom 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.389
 because with being able to define the type and the 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.389
 engine is highlighted by scanning 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.699
 I'm going to focus because there 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.120
 I arrive at the last corner and tomorrow 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.229
 that he is right behind 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.220
 I take this as an error of 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.820
 driving here I love you how they 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.820
 bomb 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.200
 this time I do not feel that 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:33.580
 the inspiration on the photo 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.220
 So here and finish the race 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.860
 second place this discovery with 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.490
 you on the on this car on this 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.020
 lamborghini huracan five years old at least 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.980
 that it is me who is wrong but here is 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.390
 in any case we could put it to 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.370
 the race against the ia on this circuit 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.200
 american hard fixing on two rounds 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.580
 we finished second it is a very good 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.540
 thing but it's true that startup has 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.800
 been favorable to me 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.030
 so do not hesitate to leave a 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.680
 comment even a little bit your 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.120
 opinion on it and especially on what 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.310
 you can think of the coming of 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.480
 lamborghini you this corsa it can be 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.860
 obviously a good thing in all 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.870
 case for me it will do me a lot 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.490
 pleasure to be able to test its novelties 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.960
 and to have that side again 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.640
 refreshment or the share of 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.690
 developers for this game so it's me
