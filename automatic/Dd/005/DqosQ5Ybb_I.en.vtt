00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
little while first so that they have a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.930

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
cooks up quicker it's smaller so it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.040 
cooks up quicker it's smaller so it
cooks<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.160> quicker<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:50.480> then<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.720> avoid

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
cooks that quicker and then you avoid

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
using the tines of the fork pushing them

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the can and that way that opens up the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.740 
the can and that way that opens up the
beans<00:04:55.440> and<00:04:55.770> lets<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.730> starch<00:04:57.030> out<00:04:57.210> into<00:04:57.630> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
beans and lets the starch out into the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:06.970 
beans and lets the starch out into the
chili

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.980 

or<00:05:07.980> some<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.280> it<00:05:08.460> out<00:05:08.640> so<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.390> can<00:05:09.450> really<00:05:09.750> get<00:05:09.870> in

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
or some of it out so I can really get in

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:41.400 
or some of it out so I can really get in
there<00:05:10.140> mash<00:05:10.440> up<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.740> rest<00:05:12.560> all<00:05:13.560> right<00:05:15.170> work

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:50.200 

chili<00:05:42.410> powder<00:05:47.979> now<00:05:48.979> this<00:05:49.099> is<00:05:49.160> a<00:05:49.310> cheaper<00:05:49.819> chili

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
chili powder now this is a cheaper chili

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.150 
chili powder now this is a cheaper chili
powder<00:05:50.449> so<00:05:50.750> I'm<00:05:50.870> using<00:05:51.199> more<00:05:51.530> chili<00:05:51.860> powder

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
powder so I'm using more chili powder

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.790 
powder so I'm using more chili powder
than<00:05:52.479> probably<00:05:53.479> most<00:05:53.599> folks<00:05:54.080> would<00:05:54.349> so<00:05:54.590> if<00:05:54.710> you

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
than probably most folks would so if you

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.080 
than probably most folks would so if you
have<00:05:54.919> a<00:05:54.949> better<00:05:55.130> chili<00:05:55.460> powder<00:05:55.729> then<00:05:56.000> you

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
have a better chili powder then you

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.589 
have a better chili powder then you
don't<00:05:56.240> have<00:05:56.300> to<00:05:56.509> go<00:05:56.599> as<00:05:56.750> heavy<00:05:58.300> plus<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.449> like

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
don't have to go as heavy plus I like

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:07.120 
don't have to go as heavy plus I like

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
and the links on the side and cilantro

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.730 
and the links on the side and cilantro
leaves<00:06:14.300> the<00:06:14.720> original<00:06:15.110> recipe<00:06:15.440> calls<00:06:15.650> for

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
leaves the original recipe calls for

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.860 
leaves the original recipe calls for
oregano<00:06:16.430> and<00:06:16.460> somehow<00:06:17.060> i'm<00:06:17.330> out<00:06:17.479> of<00:06:17.509> oregano

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
oregano and somehow i'm out of oregano

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.950 
oregano and somehow i'm out of oregano
so<00:06:19.180> we<00:06:20.180> used<00:06:20.330> some<00:06:20.509> cilantro<00:06:20.930> leaves<00:06:21.289> a<00:06:22.960> little

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
so we used some cilantro leaves a little

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.350 
so we used some cilantro leaves a little
bit<00:06:24.169> of<00:06:24.259> salt<00:06:24.440> not<00:06:25.400> too<00:06:25.460> much<00:06:25.729> salt<00:06:26.000> because<00:06:26.030> of

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
bit of salt not too much salt because of

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.189 
bit of salt not too much salt because of
the<00:06:26.419> beans<00:06:26.630> and<00:06:26.960> the<00:06:27.710> chicken<00:06:28.039> broth<00:06:29.139> so<00:06:30.139> I'm

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
the beans and the chicken broth so I'm

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:31.749 
the beans and the chicken broth so I'm
going<00:06:30.259> to<00:06:30.409> take<00:06:30.650> taste<00:06:31.039> it<00:06:31.280> in<00:06:31.340> a<00:06:31.400> little<00:06:31.639> while

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
going to take taste it in a little while

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.879 
going to take taste it in a little while
to<00:06:31.940> see<00:06:32.150> how<00:06:32.180> it<00:06:32.449> is<00:06:32.539> that<00:06:33.080> an<00:06:33.259> add<00:06:33.440> more<00:06:33.680> salt

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889

when what while the water is boiling or
you<00:07:12.349> could<00:07:12.470> also<00:07:12.620> use<00:07:12.770> cornstarch<00:07:13.660> to<00:07:14.660> make<00:07:14.810> it

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
you could also use cornstarch to make it

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.110 
you could also use cornstarch to make it
a<00:07:14.990> little<00:07:15.199> thicker<00:07:15.440> but<00:07:16.280> it<00:07:16.460> will<00:07:16.639> thicken<00:07:16.880> a

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
a little thicker but it will thicken a

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.700 
a little thicker but it will thicken a
little<00:07:17.360> bit<00:07:17.449> as<00:07:17.599> it<00:07:17.810> cooks<00:07:18.050> as<00:07:18.289> those<00:07:18.470> beans

start to break down and since the

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.870 
start to break down and since the

going to let this cook for about 3540

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.240 
going to let this cook for about 3540
minutes<00:07:29.270> or<00:07:29.599> so<00:07:29.810> so<00:07:30.500> that<00:07:30.710> the<00:07:30.800> chicken<00:07:31.130> gets

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
minutes or so so that the chicken gets
