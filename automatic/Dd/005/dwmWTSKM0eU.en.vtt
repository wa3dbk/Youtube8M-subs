00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.500
 a little bit of you guys from that car 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.570
 enjoy that he is with almost 15 thousand 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.090
 From there, take some doubts. 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.840
 of staff who also use this 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 buy maybe good car is with a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.230
 a year and a half a little more than a year and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.510
 half is with almost 15 thousand kilometers 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.930
 It's a little rough, but come on. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.790
 happened in those fifteen thousand kilometers 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.180
 I always went very well at the dealership. 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.170
 Attended is it has undergone three revisions 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.149
 it is always for a period of time but always 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.899
 I was very well attended always resolved 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.899
 all I needed 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:01:01.399
 the time but the only thing that had 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.399
 what I need to solve 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.909
 was a problem that occurs 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.939
 that he was not playing 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.220
 very well in this last service was the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.200
 third of a year and a half he was not 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.080
 playing very well I commented this with the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.720
 personnel of the concessionaire but 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.380
 are resolved until very fast revisions 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.540
 never took more than half a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 day so I left in the morning in the afternoon 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.560
 I was ready to leave late to go back 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.570
 it was ready 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.340
 It's more that was the only problem I 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.740
 I had this car on the problem 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.119
 mechanic a lot of people say that this engine 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.130
 starts to fail is but what I read 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.220
 respect is that this happens with the use of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.600
 and I 've never used gasoline. 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.210
 in these cases alcohol 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.250
 so I do not know how to say but with me, never 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.689
 had a mechanical problem not one month 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.570
 a lamp burned in the car is consumption 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.900
 with time 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.520
 consumption has improved a lot and will 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.869
 make cool medicine but if they see 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.789
 here 11.7 we go with a liter in alcohol 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.100

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.020
