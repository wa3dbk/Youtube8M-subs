broadcasting in UHF and that's why it is

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.730 
broadcasting in UHF and that's why it is
important<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.639> change<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.749> antenna<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.350> more

for that digital antenna and that's what

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.379 
for that digital antenna and that's what
the<00:01:59.859> jack<00:02:00.159> antenna<00:02:00.490> accomplished<00:02:00.969> shot<00:02:01.149> was

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
the jack antenna accomplished shot was

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.569 
the jack antenna accomplished shot was
just<00:02:01.600> that<00:02:01.959> sort<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.259> directly<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.950> opposite

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
just that sort of directly the opposite

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.819 
just that sort of directly the opposite
of<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:04.060> standard<00:02:04.630> batwing<00:02:05.049> antenna<00:02:05.469> that<00:02:05.679> you

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
of the standard batwing antenna that you

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.620 
of the standard batwing antenna that you
see<00:02:06.069> I<00:02:06.100> think<00:02:06.459> although<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:07.270> antenna

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
see I think although that antenna

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.210 
see I think although that antenna
receives<00:02:08.140> both<00:02:08.550> UHF<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.789> VHF<00:02:10.410> previously<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
majority of that was VHF that now that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.730 
majority of that was VHF that now that
we've<00:02:15.760> changed<00:02:16.030> over<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.290> digital

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
we've changed over to the to the digital

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.070 
we've changed over to the to the digital
you

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.560 
you
more<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.440> UHF<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.250> although<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.670> standard

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
more of a UHF and although the standard

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.050 
more of a UHF and although the standard
antenna<00:02:20.870> will<00:02:21.110> pick<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.470> up<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:22.400> not<00:02:22.730> as

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
antenna will pick that up it's not as

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.990 
antenna will pick that up it's not as
useful<00:02:23.570> as<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.200> new<00:02:24.530> antenna<00:02:24.950> that's<00:02:25.310> designed

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
useful as a new antenna that's designed

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.990 
useful as a new antenna that's designed
specifically<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.960> pick<00:02:27.260> up<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.100> UHF<00:02:28.730> signals

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
specifically to pick up the UHF signals

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.510 
specifically to pick up the UHF signals
that's<00:02:29.480> crap<00:02:29.780> right<00:02:30.110> we've<00:02:30.680> actually<00:02:30.830> got<00:02:31.280> a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
that's crap right we've actually got a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.670 
that's crap right we've actually got a
working<00:02:31.910> antenna<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:32.900> we'll<00:02:33.140> tell<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
working antenna here we'll tell you a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.620 
working antenna here we'll tell you a
little<00:02:33.800> bit<00:02:33.980> about<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.520> this<00:02:34.850> antenna<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
little bit about it this antenna the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.510 
little bit about it this antenna the
jack<00:02:35.810> antenna<00:02:36.170> actually<00:02:36.530> has<00:02:36.680> an<00:02:36.860> amplified

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
device that you plug into 110 that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.980 
device that you plug into 110 that
supplies<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.700> power<00:02:43.730> today<00:02:44.210> amplify<00:02:44.690> head

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
supplies the power today amplify head

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.500 
supplies the power today amplify head
and<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.470> actually<00:02:45.590> see<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.490> red<00:02:47.240> light

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
and you can actually see the red light

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.060 
and you can actually see the red light
on<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.750> antenna<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.350> actually<00:02:48.800> working

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
on the antenna that's actually working

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.260 
on the antenna that's actually working
now<00:02:49.460> so<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:51.680> one<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.250> we've<00:02:52.550> taken<00:02:52.850> your

now so this one here we've taken your

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.290 
now so this one here we've taken your
standard<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.140> 10<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.280> arms<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.940> are<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.180> an

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
standard and 10 up arms that are on an

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.540 
standard and 10 up arms that are on an
RV<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.900> changed<00:02:57.740> over<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.220> put<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.400> new

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
RV and changed over and put a new

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.120 
RV and changed over and put a new
bracket<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.570> change<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.470> head<00:03:00.709> that's

bracket on it and change the head that's

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.949 
bracket on it and change the head that's
what<00:03:01.370> we've<00:03:01.550> done<00:03:01.580> here<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:02.030> correct<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.750> that

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
what we've done here is correct and that

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.720 
what we've done here is correct and that
that<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.560> believe<00:03:03.860> comes<00:03:04.070> in<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.280> kit<00:03:04.459> right

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
that I believe comes in the kit right

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.760 
that I believe comes in the kit right
what<00:03:05.180> all<00:03:05.300> comes<00:03:05.600> in<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.840> kit<00:03:06.080> tells<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.530> yep

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
what all comes in the kit tells that yep

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.130 
what all comes in the kit tells that yep
well<00:03:07.430> there<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.180> pole<00:03:08.600> mount<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.080> you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
well there is the pole mount that you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.949 
well there is the pole mount that you
see<00:03:09.500> for<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:10.100> for<00:03:10.970> residential<00:03:11.420> use<00:03:11.600> for

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
see for the for residential use for

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.570 
see for the for residential use for
round<00:03:12.200> Pole<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:12.920> we<00:03:13.130> have<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
round Pole and then we have the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.120 
round Pole and then we have the
rectangular<00:03:14.030> mount<00:03:14.360> for<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.810> common<00:03:15.440> RV<00:03:15.860> list

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
rectangular mount for the common RV list

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.830 
rectangular mount for the common RV list
like<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.520> have<00:03:16.730> there<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.000> have<00:03:17.360> here<00:03:17.570> right

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
like you have there I have here right

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.800 
like you have there I have here right
also<00:03:18.160> complete<00:03:19.160> instruction<00:03:19.790> manual<00:03:20.180> comes

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
also complete instruction manual comes

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.350 
also complete instruction manual comes
in<00:03:20.990> each<00:03:21.110> kit<00:03:21.380> there's<00:03:22.040> also<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.489> 110<00:03:23.090> power

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
in each kit there's also a 110 power

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.509 
in each kit there's also a 110 power
supply<00:03:23.870> that's<00:03:24.110> included<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.420> adapter

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
supply that's included and the adapter

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.490 
supply that's included and the adapter
that's<00:03:28.519> feeding<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.000> 110<00:03:29.420> power<00:03:29.690> then<00:03:30.019> up<00:03:30.260> to

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
that's feeding the 110 power then up to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.530 
that's feeding the 110 power then up to
the<00:03:30.530> coax<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.310> your<00:03:31.550> booster<00:03:31.910> on<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.209> antenna

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the coax to your booster on the antenna

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.930 
the coax to your booster on the antenna
goes<00:03:32.900> around<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.290> antenna<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.610> you<00:03:34.670> have

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
goes around the antenna so you have

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.190 
goes around the antenna so you have
everything<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.510> need<00:03:35.540> here<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.080> actually

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
everything you need here to actually

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.199 
everything you need here to actually
hook<00:03:36.620> this<00:03:36.830> up<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.459> correct<00:03:37.850> right

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
hook this up that is correct right

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.110 
hook this up that is correct right
so<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:39.170> jack<00:03:39.410> antenna<00:03:39.860> can<00:03:40.100> be<00:03:40.220> replaced<00:03:40.670> on

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
so the jack antenna can be replaced on

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.150 
so the jack antenna can be replaced on
regular<00:03:41.870> batwing<00:03:42.260> antennas<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:42.860> are<00:03:42.950> out

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
regular batwing antennas that are out

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.380 
regular batwing antennas that are out
there<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.430> can<00:03:43.790> use<00:03:44.030> them<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.269> new

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
there you can use them in new

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.660 
there you can use them in new
installations<00:03:45.170> residential<00:03:45.920> installations

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
installations residential installations

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.250 
installations residential installations
and<00:03:47.330> things<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.810> nature

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
and things of that nature

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.290 
and things of that nature
correct<00:03:48.620> right<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.670> we're<00:03:49.880> going<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.030> talk<00:03:50.239> a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
correct right so we're going to talk a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.960 
correct right so we're going to talk a
little<00:03:50.570> bit<00:03:50.840> about<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.260> Sherlock<00:03:51.970> signal

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
little bit about the Sherlock signal

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.750 
little bit about the Sherlock signal
meter<00:03:53.150> here<00:03:53.420> in<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.570> second<00:03:54.250> basically<00:03:55.250> what

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
meter here in a second basically what

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.580 
meter here in a second basically what
that's<00:03:55.910> doing<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.510> it's<00:03:56.750> helping<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.230> pick<00:03:57.410> up

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
that's doing is it's helping you pick up

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.500 
that's doing is it's helping you pick up
a<00:03:57.709> signal<00:03:59.380> whenever<00:04:00.380> we<00:04:00.739> have<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.519> standard

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
a signal whenever we have a standard

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.020 
a signal whenever we have a standard
antenna<00:04:02.959> that's<00:04:03.769> trying<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.250> pick<00:04:04.400> up<00:04:04.430> digital

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
antenna that's trying to pick up digital

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.840 
antenna that's trying to pick up digital
signals<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:07.010> don't<00:04:07.220> get<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.400> picture<00:04:07.760> you

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
signals you don't get a picture you

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.120 
signals you don't get a picture you
don't<00:04:08.000> get<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.330> snowing<00:04:08.959> picture<00:04:09.320> tell<00:04:09.769> us<00:04:09.920> a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
don't get that snowing picture tell us a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.650 
don't get that snowing picture tell us a
little<00:04:10.310> bit<00:04:10.459> about<00:04:10.700> how<00:04:10.850> that<00:04:10.910> works<00:04:11.269> between

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
little bit about how that works between

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.740 
little bit about how that works between
the<00:04:12.170> analog<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.160> digital<00:04:13.580> sir<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.209> analog

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
the analog and the digital sir in analog

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.780 
the analog and the digital sir in analog
broadcast<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.650> would<00:04:15.799> get<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:15.980> picture<00:04:16.489> on<00:04:16.760> the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
broadcast you would get a picture on the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.409 
broadcast you would get a picture on the
screen<00:04:17.859> may<00:04:18.859> not<00:04:19.040> be<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.220> good<00:04:19.580> quality<00:04:20.000> picture

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
screen may not be a good quality picture

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:20.819 
screen may not be a good quality picture
maybe

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
maybe

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.129 
maybe
snowy<00:04:21.129> picture<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:21.729> refer<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.479> then<00:04:23.020> you

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
snowy picture you refer to and then you

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.929 
snowy picture you refer to and then you
would<00:04:23.289> rotate<00:04:23.470> your<00:04:23.949> antenna<00:04:24.370> till<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:24.819> get

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:24.939 
would rotate your antenna till you get

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.179 
would rotate your antenna till you get
the<00:04:25.060> best<00:04:25.300> picture<00:04:25.509> you<00:04:25.810> can<00:04:25.990> get<00:04:26.229> right<00:04:26.830> into

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:27.189 
the best picture you can get right into

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.790 
the best picture you can get right into
digital<00:04:27.639> broadcast<00:04:28.509> you<00:04:29.229> don't<00:04:29.409> get<00:04:29.560> that

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
digital broadcast you don't get that

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.679 
digital broadcast you don't get that
picture<00:04:30.069> so<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.849> screen<00:04:31.120> basis<00:04:31.509> it's

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
picture so the screen basis it's

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.010 
picture so the screen basis it's
basically<00:04:32.259> blue<00:04:32.650> or<00:04:33.009> black<00:04:33.669> or<00:04:34.090> blank<00:04:34.389> I<00:04:34.569> don't

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
basically blue or black or blank I don't

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.990 
basically blue or black or blank I don't
know<00:04:35.169> you're<00:04:35.830> usually<00:04:36.219> in<00:04:36.310> an<00:04:36.400> area<00:04:36.699> that<00:04:36.729> you

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
know you're usually in an area that you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.369 
know you're usually in an area that you
don't<00:04:37.150> know<00:04:37.270> what<00:04:37.449> channels<00:04:37.900> you're<00:04:38.050> looking

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:38.379 
don't know what channels you're looking

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.140 
don't know what channels you're looking
for<00:04:38.590> or<00:04:38.770> anything<00:04:39.009> like<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.789> you<00:04:39.819> can't

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
for or anything like that so you can't

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.570 
for or anything like that so you can't
even<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:41.139> can't<00:04:41.319> find<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.650> signal<00:04:42.009> if<00:04:42.129> everyone

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
even you can't find a signal if everyone

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.469 
even you can't find a signal if everyone
so<00:04:43.419> what<00:04:43.689> the<00:04:43.810> Sherlock<00:04:44.620> does<00:04:45.280> is<00:04:45.669> it<00:04:45.819> helps<00:04:46.120> us

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
so what the Sherlock does is it helps us

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.589 
so what the Sherlock does is it helps us
aim<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:47.409> antenna<00:04:47.800> in<00:04:48.099> the<00:04:48.849> right<00:04:49.030> area<00:04:49.419> in<00:04:49.509> the

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
aim the antenna in the right area in the

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.469 
aim the antenna in the right area in the
right<00:04:49.750> area<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:50.229> it's<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.800> it's<00:04:51.099> a<00:04:51.479> novel

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
right area so it's a it's a novel

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.409 
right area so it's a it's a novel
battery-operated<00:04:53.940> device<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.270> goes

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
battery-operated device that goes

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.390 
battery-operated device that goes
between<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:55.960> antenna<00:04:56.409> and<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.740> TV<00:04:57.159> set

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
between the antenna and the TV set

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.540 
between the antenna and the TV set
itself<00:04:57.759> and<00:04:58.120> it<00:04:58.719> has<00:04:58.750> four<00:04:59.319> LED<00:04:59.889> lights<00:05:00.190> and

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
itself and it has four LED lights and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.999 
itself and it has four LED lights and
you<00:05:01.000> simply<00:05:01.240> rotate<00:05:01.629> your<00:05:02.050> intent<00:05:02.469> until<00:05:02.830> you

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
you simply rotate your intent until you

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.670 
you simply rotate your intent until you
get<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.639> most<00:05:03.849> lights<00:05:04.180> lights<00:05:04.599> it<00:05:05.169> also<00:05:05.319> has<00:05:05.650> a

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
get the most lights lights it also has a

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.100 
get the most lights lights it also has a
sensitivity<00:05:06.280> control<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:07.419> that<00:05:07.449> allows<00:05:07.719> us<00:05:07.930> to

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
sensitivity control so that allows us to

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.890 
sensitivity control so that allows us to
adjust<00:05:08.199> the<00:05:08.590> sensitivity<00:05:08.949> based<00:05:09.849> on<00:05:10.180> if<00:05:10.509> we're

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
adjust the sensitivity based on if we're

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.350 
adjust the sensitivity based on if we're
far<00:05:11.289> from<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.710> city<00:05:11.919> or<00:05:12.250> closer<00:05:12.729> to<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.150> city

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
far from the city or closer to the city

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.420 
far from the city or closer to the city
where<00:05:13.599> the<00:05:13.750> broadcast<00:05:14.259> antennas<00:05:14.710> are<00:05:14.860> located

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
where the broadcast antennas are located

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.610 
where the broadcast antennas are located
right<00:05:15.610> now<00:05:16.000> we've<00:05:16.210> got<00:05:16.330> three<00:05:16.599> lights<00:05:16.990> on<00:05:17.259> on

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
right now we've got three lights on on

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.769 
right now we've got three lights on on
here<00:05:18.009> we've<00:05:18.219> got<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.460> adjusted<00:05:18.939> up<00:05:19.090> a<00:05:19.509> little

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
here we've got it adjusted up a little

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.779 
here we've got it adjusted up a little
bit<00:05:19.960> high<00:05:20.139> and<00:05:20.439> we<00:05:20.889> don't<00:05:21.039> have<00:05:21.189> a<00:05:21.219> picture<00:05:21.520> but

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
bit high and we don't have a picture but

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.480 
bit high and we don't have a picture but
as<00:05:21.879> soon<00:05:22.090> as<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.449> was<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.379> raise<00:05:23.590> my<00:05:23.860> antenna<00:05:24.310> and

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
as soon as I was to raise my antenna and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.510 
as soon as I was to raise my antenna and
start<00:05:24.789> moving<00:05:25.659> it<00:05:26.080> I'm<00:05:26.319> eventually<00:05:26.830> going<00:05:27.370> to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
start moving it I'm eventually going to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.540 
start moving it I'm eventually going to
get<00:05:27.849> an<00:05:28.419> extra<00:05:29.110> lighter<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.830> that's<00:05:30.279> going<00:05:30.430> to

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
get an extra lighter to that's going to

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.279 
get an extra lighter to that's going to
tell<00:05:30.759> me<00:05:30.940> I'm<00:05:31.090> now<00:05:31.300> picking<00:05:31.629> up<00:05:31.840> digital

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289

TV actually pick up a picture correct

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.490 
TV actually pick up a picture correct
and<00:05:37.210> that's<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.569> beauty<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.080> Sherlock

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
and that's the beauty of the Sherlock

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.350 
and that's the beauty of the Sherlock
you're<00:05:38.800> able<00:05:39.099> to<00:05:39.129> figure<00:05:39.400> out<00:05:39.669> where<00:05:40.150> you're

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
you're able to figure out where you're

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.540 
you're able to figure out where you're
at<00:05:40.560> without<00:05:41.560> actually<00:05:41.979> seeing<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.310> pitch<00:05:42.520> right

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
at without actually seeing a pitch right

at without actually seeing a pitch right
which<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.449> Sherlock<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:44.259> a<00:05:44.289> nice<00:05:44.589> accessory

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
which the Sherlock is a nice accessory

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.610 
which the Sherlock is a nice accessory
for<00:05:45.370> any<00:05:45.610> digital<00:05:46.089> antenna<00:05:46.389> it<00:05:46.719> is<00:05:47.199> compatible
