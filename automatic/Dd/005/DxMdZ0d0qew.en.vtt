00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.270 
and what you can see right there is that
as<00:03:35.690> bad<00:03:35.930> as<00:03:36.110> it's<00:03:36.290> been<00:03:36.380> for<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.770> US<00:03:37.010> dollar

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
as bad as it's been for the US dollar

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.480 
as bad as it's been for the US dollar

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
since 1950 from inflation debasement and

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.670 
since 1950 from inflation debasement and
all<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.700> problems<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.210> we<00:03:41.390> faced<00:03:41.660> it's<00:03:42.230> even

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
all the problems that we faced it's even

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.590 
all the problems that we faced it's even
worse<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:43.580> british<00:03:43.820> pound<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.360> british

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
worse for the british pound the british

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.090 
worse for the british pound the british
pound<00:03:44.780> has<00:03:44.930> lost<00:03:45.170> more<00:03:45.410> purchasing<00:03:45.950> power

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
pound has lost more purchasing power

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.950 
pound has lost more purchasing power
because<00:03:46.760> we're<00:03:46.910> comparing<00:03:47.270> both<00:03:47.570> currencies

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
because we're comparing both currencies

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.840

at that at the chart at the bottom there

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.640 
at that at the chart at the bottom there
from<00:04:03.760> 1950<00:04:04.760> until<00:04:05.060> 2000<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.230> can<00:04:06.410> see<00:04:06.620> that

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
from 1950 until 2000 you can see that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.150 
from 1950 until 2000 you can see that
over<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.340> period<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:07.760> time<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:09.160> the
