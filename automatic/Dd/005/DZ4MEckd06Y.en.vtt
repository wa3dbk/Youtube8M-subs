know staff NCOs to come out here and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.320 
know staff NCOs to come out here and
they<00:00:29.490> learn<00:00:29.699> from<00:00:29.880> our<00:00:30.029> training

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
they learn from our training

environments where they can take not

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.069 
environments where they can take not
only<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.579> different<00:00:32.910> training<00:00:33.660> standards

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
only the different training standards

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.750 
only the different training standards
that<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.320> achieved<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:35.010> today<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.489> terms<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that we achieved here today in terms of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.299 
that we achieved here today in terms of
demolition<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.899> also<00:00:37.200> safety<00:00:37.559> standards<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
demolition but also safety standards and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.799 
demolition but also safety standards and
that<00:00:38.700> way<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.120> train<00:00:39.329> them<00:00:39.480> their

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that way they can train them their

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.560 
that way they can train them their
soldiers<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.739> same<00:00:40.920> standards<00:00:41.700> typically

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
soldiers to the same standards typically

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.440 
soldiers to the same standards typically
the<00:00:42.870> UAE<00:00:43.770> they've<00:00:44.430> seen<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> basic<00:00:45.180> type<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the UAE they've seen the basic type of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
the UAE they've seen the basic type of
demolition<00:00:45.989> charges<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.219> manufacturer

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
demolition charges the manufacturer

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.549 
demolition charges the manufacturer
charges<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.360> we'd<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> introduce<00:00:49.379> them

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
charges so we'd like to introduce them

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
charges so we'd like to introduce them
something<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.100> some<00:00:50.730> stuff<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.149> have

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
something to some stuff that they have

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810 
something to some stuff that they have
not<00:00:51.449> seen<00:00:51.480> before<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> lot<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.699> their

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
not seen before so a lot of their

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
not seen before so a lot of their
training<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.300> don't<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.570> urban<00:00:55.020> breaching

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
training they don't do urban breaching

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
training they don't do urban breaching
shots<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> big<00:00:56.940> big<00:00:57.270> kicker

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
shots like we do that's a big big kicker

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.970 
shots like we do that's a big big kicker
for<00:00:57.690> youî<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.620> urban

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
for youî they really like the urban

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.330 
for youî they really like the urban
breaching<00:00:59.280> shot<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.670> show<00:00:59.789> them<00:00:59.969> today<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
breaching shot so we show them today so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.119 
breaching shot so we show them today so
we<00:01:02.340> looked<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.730> trying<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.300> expedient

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
we looked at trying to do expedient

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.299 
we looked at trying to do expedient
