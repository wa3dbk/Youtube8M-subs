 this new version 8.1 is more 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.570
 customizable than 7 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.380
 we were able to change the menu background 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.420
 start 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 in addition to dimensioning and organizing 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.910
 icons as we have seen in previous classes 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.310
 you can also change the image of the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.580
 lock screen and bar colors 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.580

 see that in the first part we can 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.800
 choose a pre-loaded background image 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.800
 defined 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.800
 for now it is not possible to choose a 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.760
 image file only times that already 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.760

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.420
 in case you do not want these images 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.850
 colorful 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.369
 you can leave the option invisible where 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.330
 image you have in the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.400

 below are four more guides to 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.599
 The first one is the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.599
 background wallpaper 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.490
 In this window we can select one or 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.390
 more pictures we want to put on the plane

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.930

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.500
 if you choose more than one they 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.500
 they alternated from time to time 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.210
 and below we can define the position 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.780
 the image so that it fits well in the 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.390
 to set the color that pleases you 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.159
 if you want to use something colorless or

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.780
 inactivity and define if we want 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.340
 the login screen appears when the 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.340
 screen saver finish 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.729

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.139
 settings in this course 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:03.880
 after selecting the desired protector 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.880
 we set the time and press ok 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.250

 change of the locking screen is 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.680
 intuitive and does not have 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.680

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.820
 in the first part we can change the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.740
 background image which can be a 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.690
 set from windows or we can 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.690

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:17.599
 we want you to appear on this screen and 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:17.599
 we can use up to seven options 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.009
 and the last option is the camera 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.330
 If you have a webcam on your computer, you 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:34.720
 you can record a video or take a picture 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:38.200
