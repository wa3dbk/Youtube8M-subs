00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.719
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.309
 mac skill tutorial or 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 today we will make a small bet 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.199
 at the point compared to the glued cut that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 is available on many systems 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.240
 but that is not available in the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 oasis finder then indeed it can 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.699
 be considered a gap but 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.030
 Apple has always preferred moving 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.890
 files from one window to another 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.190
 more than just make a cut and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.469
 to forget to stick it so despite everything 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.670
 that there are a lot of people who are clamoring 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.950
 this function then I'm going to you 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.039
 show a little trick or mental 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.070
 nahyan that makes it possible to make a coupe 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.160
 stuck but not daring to say it really 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.809
 so you see here I have six images his 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 office that I want to put in my 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.870
 folder images so I'm going to open a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.570
 finder window open the folder 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.729
 image so the method that apple 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 recommend is to do everything 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 just slide the pictures here but 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.509
 if for example you have to move 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.820
 documents of which londres accurate to another 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.970
 without being able to simply drag 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.790
 move you're going to do you go 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.619
 select your files make a click 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.710
 law 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.860
 to copy or an order is to make you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.110
 in the destination folder do of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.479
 again a right click while holding the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.159
 alt key is here you see if I 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.259
 loose the alt key I only have 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.820
 stuck if I press alt I moved 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.799
 so I hold the alt key and I 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.549
 clicks on squares and six elements 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.540
 here is so it's not really a 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.060
 cut glued 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.680
 it's a collar is moved but ultimately 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.960
 it's almost the same 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.140
 do not forget a right click and the touch 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.119
 alt to have the function of places and 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.379
 this was a little trick I you 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.770
 wish a good continuation on 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.770
 your mac
