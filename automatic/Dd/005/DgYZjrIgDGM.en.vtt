00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.339 
know what I'm talking about all right
first<00:00:29.609> off<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> control<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> use

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
first off this is the control that I use

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.130 
first off this is the control that I use
it<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> dmx<00:00:32.160> 44<00:00:32.640> by<00:00:32.850> survey<00:00:33.210> I'm<00:00:33.750> sure<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it as the dmx 44 by survey I'm sure it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
it as the dmx 44 by survey I'm sure it
looks<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.500> similar<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.130> 40<00:00:35.399> be

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
looks really similar to your 40 be

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.979 
looks really similar to your 40 be
because<00:00:35.969> i<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> 40<00:00:36.660> b<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.870> what

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
because i think the 40 b is what

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
because i think the 40 b is what
replaced<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:37.680> i<00:00:37.770> can't<00:00:37.920> remember<00:00:38.040> right<00:00:38.250> so

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
replaced it if i can't remember right so

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.740 
replaced it if i can't remember right so
i'm<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.969> start<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.270> all<00:00:39.390> these<00:00:39.480> faders

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
i'm going to start with all these faders

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.770 
i'm going to start with all these faders
down<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> matter<00:00:41.430> okay<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
down it's not going to matter okay so

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.950 
down it's not going to matter okay so
and<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.920> got<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:45.030> color<00:00:45.239> palette<00:00:45.600> sitting<00:00:45.899> up

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and I got one color palette sitting up

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
and I got one color palette sitting up
here<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> turn<00:00:47.640> power<00:00:47.789> on

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
here and we're going to turn power on

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.630 
here and we're going to turn power on
the<00:00:48.809> controller<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.010> palate<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.489> on

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the controller is on the palate is on

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.740 
the controller is on the palate is on
now<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> already<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.050> set<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.969> DMX<00:00:54.480> mode

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
now I already have this set to DMX mode

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.099 
now I already have this set to DMX mode
so<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> upside<00:00:56.370> down<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so if this is upside down so that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.860 
so if this is upside down so that
doesn't<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.590> anything<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.609> um<00:00:59.870> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
doesn't do anything for you but um this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.630 
doesn't do anything for you but um this
is<00:01:01.050> D<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> address<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> 0<00:01:02.760> 0<00:01:03.059> 1<00:01:03.329> okay

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
is D and then the address is 0 0 1 okay

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.109 
is D and then the address is 0 0 1 okay
DMX<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.820> great<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:09.090> down

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
DMX in great so what we do is go down

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.410 
DMX in great so what we do is go down
here<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> controller<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.979> now<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
here to the controller and right now the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
here to the controller and right now the
reason<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> light<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> way<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
reason that the light is on the way it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
reason that the light is on the way it
is<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.320> scene<00:01:17.119> on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.259> bank

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is is because it is on scene on the bank

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
is is because it is on scene on the bank
1<00:01:19.500> scene<00:01:19.950> 1<00:01:19.979> okay<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.060> automatically<00:01:21.630> goes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
1 scene 1 okay and automatically goes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.910 
1 scene 1 okay and automatically goes
there<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.740> need<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
there so what I need to do is I need to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.200 
there so what I need to do is I need to
grab<00:01:23.009> control<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.820> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.000> kick

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
grab control that so I'm going to kick

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.469 
grab control that so I'm going to kick
fixture<00:01:25.020> number<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:26.000> see<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> lights<00:01:27.270> on

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
fixture number one on see the lights on

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.969 
fixture number one on see the lights on
so<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.409> control<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> fixture

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
so I know that I have control a fixture

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.789 
so I know that I have control a fixture
number<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.720> first<00:01:30.720> fader<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> how<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
number one first fader on the how the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
number one first fader on the how the
color<00:01:32.100> palette<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.790> tells<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.390> kind

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
color palette is what tells it what kind

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.319 
color palette is what tells it what kind
of<00:01:33.829> channel<00:01:34.829> mode<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.790> 27

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.260 
of channel mode to be in for you have 27
channel<00:01:36.659> mode<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
channel mode then you have a what is it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.560 
channel mode then you have a what is it
a<00:01:40.549> 15<00:01:41.549> channel<00:01:41.939> mode<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> 9<00:01:42.420> channel<00:01:42.810> mode<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
said i was at number 66 in the value

through all the auto modes which
sometimes<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.990> need<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.350> all<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.619> up

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
sometimes you need to go all the way up

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.310 
sometimes you need to go all the way up
for<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.790> controller<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> grab<00:02:06.600> control<00:02:06.899> of

for the controller to grab control of
your<00:02:07.560> fixture<00:02:08.209> sometimes<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.780> let<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.560> you

your fixture sometimes if you let if you
let<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> fainter<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.700> sit<00:02:11.910> at<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> number<00:02:12.360> for

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
move in that we finally got control when

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.420 
move in that we finally got control when
I<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.440> all<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.710> way<00:02:25.800> up<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.010> almost<00:02:26.220> it's

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
I get all the way up you almost it's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.820 
I get all the way up you almost it's
like<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.940> sweep<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:28.410> controller

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
like you have to sweep the controller

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.490 
like you have to sweep the controller
for<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> grab<00:02:29.580> control<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.390> fixture<00:02:30.810> so

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
for it to grab control of the fixture so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.290 
for it to grab control of the fixture so
now<00:02:31.620> we're<00:02:31.740> back<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:32.280> 65<00:02:32.880> let's<00:02:33.180> see

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
is her when you have it like an auto

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.260 
is her when you have it like an auto
mode<00:02:41.970> it'll<00:02:42.690> set<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.740> time<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.880> takes<00:02:45.030> for

it to go through each beat or whatever

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.090 
it to go through each beat or whatever
when<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.870> auto<00:02:49.200> programs<00:02:49.680> Ethan

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
when it's in the auto programs Ethan

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.770 
when it's in the auto programs Ethan
don't<00:02:50.250> please<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.700> they'll<00:02:51.239> channel<00:02:51.600> three

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
don't please and they'll channel three

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.970 
don't please and they'll channel three
we<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.050> need<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.230> mess<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:52.560> because<00:02:52.830> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
we don't need to mess with because that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.770 
we don't need to mess with because that
strobes<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.850> let's<00:02:54.000> turn<00:02:54.180> channel<00:02:54.510> 3<00:02:54.690> up

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
strobes it so let's turn channel 3 up

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.850 
strobes it so let's turn channel 3 up
once<00:02:55.160> see<00:02:56.160> what<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.489> does<00:02:57.410> see<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> strobe

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
once see what this does see the strobe

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.670 
once see what this does see the strobe
so<00:02:59.459> we're<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.360> turn<00:03:00.810> channel<00:03:01.140> 3<00:03:01.260> off<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
so we're going to turn channel 3 off and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.229 
so we're going to turn channel 3 off and
the<00:03:02.010> reason<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.340> we're<00:03:02.550> doing<00:03:02.640> blue<00:03:02.910> green

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
the reason that we're doing blue green

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.170 
the reason that we're doing blue green
is<00:03:03.510> because<00:03:04.140> since<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.010> was<00:03:05.130> set<00:03:05.459> when<00:03:06.030> we

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
is because since it was set when we

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.570 
is because since it was set when we
turned<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.540> on<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.130> whatever<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.190> preset

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
turned it on and whatever the preset

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.070 
turned it on and whatever the preset
value<00:03:08.910> was<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.209> thinks<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.570> five<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.930> six

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
value was it thinks that five and six

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.970 
value was it thinks that five and six
are<00:03:10.170> all<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.350> way<00:03:10.440> up<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.680> we're<00:03:10.800> going<00:03:10.890> to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
are all the way up so we're going to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.250 
are all the way up so we're going to
sweep<00:03:11.280> 5<00:03:11.580> watch<00:03:12.330> what<00:03:12.510> happens<00:03:12.810> when<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:12.959> sweep

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
sweep 5 watch what happens when I sweep

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.780 
sweep 5 watch what happens when I sweep
five<00:03:13.530> it's<00:03:14.130> going<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.310> be<00:03:14.400> hard<00:03:14.550> for<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
five it's going to be hard for you to

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.990 
five it's going to be hard for you to
see<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.180> camera<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:16.430> see<00:03:17.430> greens<00:03:17.760> down

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
see in the camera but see greens down

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.170 
see in the camera but see greens down
we're<00:03:18.989> going<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.170> sweep<00:03:19.350> six<00:03:19.650> blues<00:03:20.640> off<00:03:20.850> okay

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
we're going to sweep six blues off okay

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.150 
we're going to sweep six blues off okay
now<00:03:21.360> we're<00:03:21.510> down<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.660> zero<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.230> let's<00:03:22.980> say<00:03:23.130> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
now we're down to zero so let's say I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.539 
now we're down to zero so let's say I

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
sometimes you have to grab control of it

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.120 
sometimes you have to grab control of it
in<00:04:00.690> order<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.410> do<00:04:01.560> anything<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:02.040> it

doing<00:04:04.470> fine<00:04:04.860> but<00:04:05.220> sometimes<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.299> leave<00:04:06.540> it

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
doing fine but sometimes it's a leave it

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.530 
doing fine but sometimes it's a leave it
at<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:06.989> value<00:04:07.579> 179<00:04:08.579> it's<00:04:08.850> not<00:04:09.000> it's<00:04:09.299> kind<00:04:09.510> of

at that value 179 it's not it's kind of
faded<00:04:10.519> let<00:04:11.519> go<00:04:11.790> back<00:04:12.470> see<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.560> not<00:04:13.680> moving

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
faded let go back see it's not moving

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.530

how<00:04:14.220> do<00:04:14.280> they<00:04:14.370> move<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.610> fader<00:04:14.760> till<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.420> get

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
how do they move the fader till I get

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
all the way down to the bottom so you

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.770 
all the way down to the bottom so you

not<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.710> 27<00:04:31.220> channel<00:04:31.460> controller<00:04:31.790> it's<00:04:32.090> all

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
not a 27 channel controller it's all

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.230 
not a 27 channel controller it's all
messed<00:04:32.450> up<00:04:32.690> so<00:04:33.560> what<00:04:34.280> we<00:04:34.400> want<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.670> do<00:04:34.820> is<00:04:35.180> you

into 6 channel mode so we're moving the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.650 
into 6 channel mode so we're moving the
fader<00:04:42.860> up<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.280> 65<00:04:43.940> let's<00:04:44.210> say<00:04:44.300> it's<00:04:44.450> halfway

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
fader up to 65 let's say it's halfway

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.090 
fader up to 65 let's say it's halfway
and<00:04:44.870> it's<00:04:45.140> in<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.350> middle<00:04:45.590> with<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.890> front<00:04:46.040> of

and it's in the middle with the front of

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.190 
and it's in the middle with the front of
the<00:04:46.160> values<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.640> told<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.000> now<00:04:47.780> we<00:04:47.840> can

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
the values that I told you now we can

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.630 
the values that I told you now we can
control<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.590> colors<00:04:48.980> red<00:04:49.490> green<00:04:51.220> blue<00:04:52.220> which

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
controller not to the fixture turn that

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.450

the<00:06:08.390> fact<00:06:08.600> if<00:06:08.780> you<00:06:08.840> go<00:06:08.960> up<00:06:09.200> it's<00:06:09.410> really<00:06:09.740> fast

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
the fact if you go up it's really fast

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.000

see<00:06:11.150> on<00:06:11.240> my<00:06:11.360> hand<00:06:11.570> is<00:06:11.660> changing<00:06:11.990> color<00:06:12.140> bring

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
see on my hand is changing color bring

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.920 
see on my hand is changing color bring
that<00:06:13.160> baby<00:06:13.280> down<00:06:13.550> slow<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:14.300> down<00:06:14.420> to<00:06:14.870> whatever

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
that baby down slow it down to whatever

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.899 
that baby down slow it down to whatever
so<00:06:17.930> don't<00:06:18.170> know<00:06:18.230> more

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:24.730 

that's<00:06:22.909> slowed<00:06:23.150> down<00:06:23.330> quite<00:06:23.509> a<00:06:23.599> bit<00:06:23.719> but<00:06:24.319> and

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
that's slowed down quite a bit but and

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.350 
that's slowed down quite a bit but and
then<00:06:25.009> we'll<00:06:25.129> fade<00:06:25.369> it<00:06:25.520> once<00:06:25.789> we<00:06:25.909> get<00:06:25.999> a<00:06:26.059> slower

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
then we'll fade it once we get a slower

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.529 
then we'll fade it once we get a slower
speed<00:06:26.509> like<00:06:26.779> that<00:06:26.960> we<00:06:27.080> can<00:06:27.199> feed<00:06:27.469> this<00:06:28.539> it's

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
speed like that we can feed this it's

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.540 
speed like that we can feed this it's
not<00:06:29.659> fades<00:06:30.169> nice<00:06:30.649> into<00:06:31.159> a<00:06:31.189> color<00:06:32.680> which<00:06:33.680> just

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
not fades nice into a color which just

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.379 
not fades nice into a color which just
did<00:06:34.789> there<00:06:35.289> so<00:06:36.289> that's<00:06:37.129> how<00:06:37.249> you<00:06:37.339> would<00:06:37.520> mess

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
did there so that's how you would mess

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.499 
did there so that's how you would mess
with<00:06:38.419> your<00:06:38.619> chases<00:06:39.619> and<00:06:39.889> get<00:06:40.520> your<00:06:40.729> colors<00:06:41.360> to

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
with your chases and get your colors to

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.379 
with your chases and get your colors to
change<00:06:41.779> everything<00:06:42.169> else<00:06:42.379> so<00:06:42.909> in<00:06:43.909> the<00:06:44.059> manual

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
change everything else so in the manual

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:45.879 
change everything else so in the manual
for<00:06:44.689> your<00:06:44.719> controller<00:06:45.169> and<00:06:45.349> Emmanuel<00:06:45.770> for

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
for your controller and Emmanuel for

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:47.290 
for your controller and Emmanuel for
your<00:06:46.009> fixture<00:06:46.339> should<00:06:46.550> go<00:06:46.699> over<00:06:46.849> this<00:06:46.999> but

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300
