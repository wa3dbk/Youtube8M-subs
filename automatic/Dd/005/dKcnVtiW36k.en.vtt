00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.040
 hi how is here brings you a new 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.309
 video of how to download and install 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.610
 frac see this good of a program to 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.340
 defragment the disk and I've set 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.290
 search to see if there were already videos in 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.230
 youtube and well there was not and I think that 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.470
 this is the first video this the last 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.900
 version came out this year and well I wanted to 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.640
 bring only good while the description 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.430
 of the video 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.340
 and then address this page they go 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.559
 to go to programs and will be at 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.100
 principle but also seeing this 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.019
 moment 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.019
 and well you have to read more 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.540
 and well here you can contact me and good 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.180
 This 15 if they want what is it 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.430
 I'm going to apply when I have it 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.980
 installed good I will load it with 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.890
 mega fire is very good are the three web 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.309
 three pages and well here I'm going to put you 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.309
 the code 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.900
 and I do not think that sometimes you are here 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.900
 you have to give it double 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.299
 I'm going to give it to keep in the 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:34.310
 desktop let's save and very 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.310
 enclosing these pages that were opened 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.620
 and as you see, it's already being downloaded 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.620
 it did not take long 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:50.360
 and good 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.070
 and here it will be the end and 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.490
 Well, there will be a file left if 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.350
 I want to understand this topic if ashraf 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.720
 there will be a video of how to install it and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.390
 download them 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.390
 straight 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 here 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.069
 and the executable will remain in the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.110
 drill of fragments 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.700
 Double click 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.700
 and here they are going to put Spanish 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.810
 the next language they will remove 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.810
 everyone was going to leave it first was a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.459
 Most recommended are everything and only 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.180
 we select the first ones you will give 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.180
 what to install 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.599
 to see note of the version remove it is the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.599
 remove 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.730
 and I do not know what happened to him and now he swallowed 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.260
 here 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.110
 and well we are going to give you to finish who is 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.100
 you will run and good since it opened 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.460
 is that they are going to select the disk that 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.740
 you are going to represent in this case the 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.390
 of being placed and stopping to analyze 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.440
 we're going to get here to start from 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.400
 analyze what is analyzing how they see more 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.450
 Quick 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.450
 then also 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.590
 it's less than half 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.349
 I liked using 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.790
 and maybe that's also why your check already 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:35.250
 is in you and these new staff 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.250
 when we are going to wait here to finish 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.640
 and here I finish and they have to give him 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.930
 other activity 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.930
 I will never put it 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.230
 yes 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.490
 here is going to start 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.520
 this is the most recommended thing that they give 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.860
 in the other and here as I'm recording 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.490
 I prefer to do it faster so that 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.760
 the video is extended 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.160
 maybe a little faster I do not know 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.740
 really good if it's going to ferment 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.730
 but not so much 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.730
 working 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.230
 will begin to fragment 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.750
 I was like preparing it 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:39.280
 and good here goes from here is going to delay 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.280
 I'm going to pause and now I come 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:49.039
 and well here we returned from 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:55.749
 fragment the disk and it lasted me around 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.749
 of 34 hours and it's not that I started using it 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:04.430
 approving on the thing and good 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.890
 I'm here it was fragmented 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.730
 and well I hope you liked the 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.800
 video 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.800
 Camilo General has 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 held down 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.190
 and her cousin to the east channel 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.920
 It will be your next video and before leaving 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.349
 I was seeing something and it 's that disk 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:33.750
 Hard only fragmented 21% 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:36.750
 because 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.750
 Quick 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.570
 If only 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:52.709
 and well maybe you oppose fragmenting 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:04.610
 to the front 100% to 50 and well I hope 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:09.830
 that you liked the video and its kids 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:12.400
 through and if the car helped him give line 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.400
 bye
