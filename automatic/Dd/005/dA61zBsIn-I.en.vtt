00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 very well today we are going to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.790
 present these feet or legs of 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.010
 press fabrics to step on I have these two 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.950
 for example this is so 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.650
 this is a simple leg 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.550
 As you can see, he has a good 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.580
 slope here 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.090
 and that makes the grief go away 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.520
 I believe and have a 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.720
 a small opening to put the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.070
 other thread I will teach how it works 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.050
 this is another one is different this is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 similar as the normal so to speak 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.650
 but it has a screw back that if it 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.800
 it tightens it as it makes the pucker more 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.140
 thick or if it loosens makes the fade 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.559
 we'll see how it works 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 in each one to show them how it looks 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 the result and you can also perform 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.430
 hand 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.800
 ok let's continue and I'll teach you 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.800
 how these two pieces work 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 very well first let's use this 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.190
 patita finally 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.330
 and we are going to loosen everything 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.330
 and we are going to do 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:02:16.950
 we see that if jose press because we see 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.770
 that does not change much we're going to stop their 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.990
 walkway footbridges and let's separate 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.670
 I'll show it later now let's 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.000
 see with this page 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.280
 How is it 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.280
 they are also thing the rectum 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:50.840
 and put your finger back to hold the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:53.780
 fabric and to make the hand simply 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.730
 we put our our good compress 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.209
 fabrics or pasta with our entities and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.910
 We give you a straight seam without finishing and 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.269
 we left a few centuries we put in the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:14.420
 highest stitch and we simply give a 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:17.239
 sewing let's see how we were left with 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.640
 Our press legs fabrics for 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.010
 step for example this is not much 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.650
 what you step on is to lightly give 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.470
 clisÃ©s and when it is not so heavy is 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.049
 this you decide if you want to buy it or 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.819
 It is not for industrial machine but 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.489
 there is also in its machine version 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.250
 homemade either from different brands going to 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.040
 find your different types either 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.760
 or similar but with the same function 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.360
 Like are you to me is because of the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.930
 better because it produces very well and there is no 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.170
 to regulate him nothing 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.299
 and that's how our sample shows us 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.549
 clips is very nice if you want to do it 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.400
 hand as I said before with the 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.709
 straight consul and nothing else 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.310
 we stretch the opposite threads by 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.310
 example I have the back thread 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.090
 and the front thread is the only thing 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.090
 is stretch 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.010
 I will go frowning accommodating 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.560
 the same thing on this side in case 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.770
 you want to do it by hand 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.590
 so that it is more I do not know more uniform 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.260
 these are three types to gather their 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.570
 fabrics you will already decide which one is 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.750
 it suits you better well I hope that 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.080
 this tutorial will serve you and we'll see you in 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.080
 the next
