these<00:00:34.039> ones<00:00:34.309> are<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.519> little<00:00:34.820> bit<00:00:35.090> bigger<00:00:35.300> than

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
these ones are a little bit bigger than

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.000

marbles next we're gonna take you to
those<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.460> roll<00:00:40.640> them<00:00:40.789> into<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:41.000> snake<00:00:41.390> shape

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
those and roll them into a snake shape

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.650 
those and roll them into a snake shape
just<00:00:41.989> like<00:00:42.140> we<00:00:42.289> did<00:00:42.440> with<00:00:42.649> your<00:00:42.800> little<00:00:43.070> kids

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
just like we did with your little kids

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.759 
just like we did with your little kids
and<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:44.719> want<00:00:44.929> to<00:00:44.989> make<00:00:45.109> sure<00:00:45.289> that<00:00:45.440> these<00:00:45.589> are

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
and you want to make sure that these are

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.799 
and you want to make sure that these are
pretty<00:00:46.070> equal<00:00:46.519> in<00:00:46.670> length<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.210> roll<00:00:47.510> them<00:00:47.629> both

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
pretty equal in length so roll them both

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.110 
pretty equal in length so roll them both
out<00:00:47.989> compare<00:00:48.859> them<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.280> then<00:00:49.670> just<00:00:49.879> kind<00:00:50.030> of

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
out compare them and then just kind of

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.060 
out compare them and then just kind of
go<00:00:50.210> back<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.449> forth<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.050> tweak<00:00:51.710> them<00:00:51.949> by

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
go back and forth and tweak them by

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.650 
go back and forth and tweak them by
rolling<00:00:52.519> them<00:00:52.579> a<00:00:52.699> little<00:00:52.910> bit<00:00:53.059> further<00:00:53.359> just

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
rolling them a little bit further just

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.750 
rolling them a little bit further just
to<00:00:54.410> make<00:00:54.739> sure<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.039> they're<00:00:55.219> about<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.609> same

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
to make sure that they're about the same

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.139 
to make sure that they're about the same
length

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
length

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.329 
length
it<00:00:56.719> doesn't<00:00:57.050> need<00:00:57.109> to<00:00:57.230> be<00:00:57.320> exact<00:00:57.679> it<00:00:57.920> should<00:00:58.249> be

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
it doesn't need to be exact it should be

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.960 
it doesn't need to be exact it should be
pretty<00:00:58.489> close<00:00:58.730> though<00:01:03.520> so<00:01:04.520> once<00:01:04.670> you've<00:01:04.820> done

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
pretty close though so once you've done

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.760 
pretty close though so once you've done
this<00:01:05.180> take<00:01:05.420> your<00:01:05.570> finger<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:05.930> lightly<00:01:06.380> press

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770

on<00:01:07.490> both<00:01:07.940> of<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.180> shapes<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.720> flatten<00:01:09.230> them

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
on both of the shapes to flatten them

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.900 
on both of the shapes to flatten them
down<00:01:09.410> a<00:01:09.590> bit<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.010> don't<00:01:10.160> want<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.370> mash<00:01:10.610> them

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
down a bit you don't want to mash them

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.670 
down a bit you don't want to mash them
into<00:01:11.030> your<00:01:11.330> table<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:11.870> just<00:01:12.050> want<00:01:12.260> them<00:01:12.410> to<00:01:12.440> be

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
into your table you just want them to be

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.860 
into your table you just want them to be
slightly<00:01:13.010> flatter<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.910> then<00:01:14.510> once<00:01:14.750> you've

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
slightly flatter and then once you've

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.210 
slightly flatter and then once you've
done<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.350> can<00:01:15.440> rub<00:01:15.680> your<00:01:15.710> finger<00:01:16.130> along

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
done that you can rub your finger along

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.950 
done that you can rub your finger along
the<00:01:16.400> top<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.790> get<00:01:17.060> rid<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.240> any<00:01:17.420> fingerprints

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
the top to get rid of any fingerprints

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.870 
the top to get rid of any fingerprints
you<00:01:18.140> might<00:01:18.290> have<00:01:18.410> left<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.700> should<00:01:19.850> look

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
you might have left so it should look

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.160 
you might have left so it should look
something<00:01:20.210> like<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:22.360> make<00:01:23.360> sure<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:23.960> they

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
something like that make sure that they

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.870 
something like that make sure that they
stayed<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.620> same<00:01:24.890> length<00:01:25.190> because<00:01:25.520> sometimes

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
stayed the same length because sometimes

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.250 
stayed the same length because sometimes
you<00:01:26.030> mash<00:01:26.240> them<00:01:26.420> too<00:01:26.600> hard<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:26.990> it<00:01:27.110> gets

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
you mash them too hard and it gets

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.610 
you mash them too hard and it gets
messed<00:01:27.530> up<00:01:28.060> then<00:01:29.060> take<00:01:29.300> one<00:01:29.870> end<00:01:30.140> on<00:01:30.440> each

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
messed up then take one end on each

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.980 
messed up then take one end on each
earring<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.220> pinch<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.390> little<00:01:32.540> bit<00:01:32.720> so

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
earring and pinch it a little bit so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.750 
earring and pinch it a little bit so
that<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.230> comes<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.590> more<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:33.920> point<00:01:34.160> we're

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
that it comes to more of a point we're

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.190 
that it comes to more of a point we're
going<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:34.940> leave<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.210> other<00:01:35.360> end<00:01:35.720> blunt<00:01:41.200> next

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
going to leave the other end blunt next

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.990 
going to leave the other end blunt next
grab<00:01:42.410> another<00:01:42.770> color<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:43.280> clay<00:01:43.580> that<00:01:43.850> we'll

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
grab another color of clay that we'll

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.880 
grab another color of clay that we'll
use<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.510> make<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.780> suction<00:01:45.170> cups<00:01:45.410> I'm<00:01:45.620> using

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
use to make the suction cups I'm using

thin<00:01:53.420> snake<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:54.170> actually<00:01:54.440> used<00:01:54.770> way<00:01:55.130> too<00:01:55.190> much

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
thin snake I actually used way too much

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.730 
thin snake I actually used way too much
way<00:01:56.420> more<00:01:56.660> than<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:56.900> needed<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.380> only<00:01:57.470> need

pieces<00:02:09.110> out<00:02:09.470> of<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.950> contrasting<00:02:10.700> color<00:02:11.000> of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
pieces out of this contrasting color of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.650 
pieces out of this contrasting color of
clay<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.440> each<00:02:12.620> one<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.890> these<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.370> be

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
clay so each one of these is going to be

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.000 
clay so each one of these is going to be
suction<00:02:13.990> cups<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.410> don't<00:02:14.590> want<00:02:14.710> them<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.890> be

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
suction cups you don't want them to be

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.740 
suction cups you don't want them to be
too<00:02:15.220> big<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.270> don't<00:02:16.390> want<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.600> be

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
too big and you don't want to be

too big and you don't want to be
immensely<00:02:17.110> small<00:02:17.650> either<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> you're<00:02:19.090> gonna

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
immensely small either so you're gonna

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.880 
immensely small either so you're gonna
roll<00:02:19.480> them<00:02:19.600> between<00:02:19.900> your<00:02:20.020> fingers<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.770> make

roll them between your fingers to make

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
roll them between your fingers to make
sure<00:02:21.070> that<00:02:21.250> they're<00:02:21.460> really<00:02:21.760> really

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
sure that they're really really

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.610 
sure that they're really really
spherical<00:02:22.840> make<00:02:23.350> little<00:02:23.980> teeny<00:02:24.160> tiny<00:02:24.250> balls

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
spherical make little teeny tiny balls

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.260 
spherical make little teeny tiny balls
then<00:02:26.620> place<00:02:26.980> your<00:02:27.130> tentacles<00:02:27.610> side-by-side

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
then place your tentacles side-by-side

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.750 
then place your tentacles side-by-side
and<00:02:28.570> start<00:02:29.350> putting<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.740> suction<00:02:30.100> cups<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.520> I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
and start putting the suction cups on I

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.820 
and start putting the suction cups on I
like<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.270> do<00:02:31.450> them<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.350> technical<00:02:32.680> side

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
like to do them with the technical side

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.650 
like to do them with the technical side
by<00:02:33.010> side<00:02:33.250> because<00:02:33.820> then<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.150> can<00:02:34.330> make<00:02:34.480> sure

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
by side because then I can make sure

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.660 
by side because then I can make sure
that<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.960> placement<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.800> same<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.400> each

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
that the placement is the same on each

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.700 
that the placement is the same on each
earring<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.360> just<00:02:37.960> want<00:02:38.170> them<00:02:38.230> evenly

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
earring and you just want them evenly

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.460 
earring and you just want them evenly
spaced<00:02:39.040> obviously<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.210> number<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.900> suction

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
spaced obviously the number of suction

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.780 
spaced obviously the number of suction
cups<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:41.920> you're<00:02:42.010> gonna<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.610> gonna

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
cups that you're gonna have is gonna

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.690 
cups that you're gonna have is gonna
vary<00:02:43.450> depending<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.260> how<00:02:44.320> long<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.830> tentacles

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
vary depending on how long the tentacles

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.970 
vary depending on how long the tentacles
are<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.780> long<00:02:46.990> as<00:02:47.140> they're<00:02:47.290> evenly<00:02:47.590> spaced

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
are so long as they're evenly spaced

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.790 
are so long as they're evenly spaced
it'll<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.910> fine

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.020 

now<00:02:53.800> when<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.010> put<00:02:54.190> them<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.370> make<00:02:54.760> sure<00:02:54.910> you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
now when you put them on make sure you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.210 
now when you put them on make sure you
don't<00:02:55.120> press<00:02:55.450> them<00:02:55.600> on<00:02:55.780> too<00:02:56.170> hard<00:02:56.410> because<00:02:57.070> you

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
don't press them on too hard because you

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.090 
don't press them on too hard because you
don't<00:02:57.460> want<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.700> flatten<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.150> ball<00:02:58.330> out<00:03:02.100> so

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
don't want to flatten the ball out so

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.930 
don't want to flatten the ball out so
when<00:03:03.250> you're<00:03:03.370> done<00:03:03.490> it<00:03:03.700> should<00:03:03.730> look

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
when you're done it should look

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.970 
when you're done it should look
something<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.020> notice<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
something like this and notice that the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.670 
something like this and notice that the
suction<00:03:06.340> cups<00:03:06.550> decrease<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.300> size<00:03:07.570> as<00:03:07.960> they<00:03:08.530> go

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
suction cups decrease in size as they go

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.900 
suction cups decrease in size as they go
down<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> point<00:03:09.490> at<00:03:09.640> end<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.090> tentacle

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
down to the point at end of the tentacle

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.610 
down to the point at end of the tentacle
so<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.030> next<00:03:13.270> bit<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.690> where<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.050> magic

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
so the next bit is where the magic

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.210 
so the next bit is where the magic
happens

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
happens

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.610 
happens
take<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> tool<00:03:16.330> like<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:17.140> is<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.470> a

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
take a tool like this this is just a

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.260 
take a tool like this this is just a
stick<00:03:17.890> pin<00:03:18.130> stuck<00:03:18.490> in<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.730> end<00:03:18.850> of<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.030> pencil

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
stick pin stuck in the end of a pencil

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.110 
stick pin stuck in the end of a pencil
you<00:03:19.900> can<00:03:20.080> also<00:03:20.260> use<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.770> flat<00:03:21.160> end<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.760> a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
you can also use the flat end of a

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.750 
you can also use the flat end of a
wooden<00:03:22.360> skewer<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.290> all<00:03:23.980> we're<00:03:24.130> gonna<00:03:24.220> do<00:03:24.520> is

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
wooden skewer and all we're gonna do is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.120 
wooden skewer and all we're gonna do is
press<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.390> little<00:03:25.690> tool<00:03:25.930> into<00:03:26.680> each<00:03:26.830> of<00:03:27.040> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
press this little tool into each of the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.670 
press this little tool into each of the
balls<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:28.090> tentacle<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.140> what<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.440> does

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
balls on the tentacle so what that does

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.800 
balls on the tentacle so what that does
is<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.250> presses<00:03:30.790> down<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.150> center<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.600> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
is it presses down the center of the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.960 
is it presses down the center of the
ball<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.320> leaves<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.709> outer<00:03:32.860> edge<00:03:33.220> raised

see<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.430> difference<00:05:10.250> next<00:05:11.250> we're<00:05:11.340> gonna<00:05:11.400> bend

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
see the difference next we're gonna bend

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.430 
see the difference next we're gonna bend
the<00:05:11.850> earrings<00:05:12.210> into<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.630> shape<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:12.900> we<00:05:13.110> need

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
the earrings into the shape that we need

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.710 
the earrings into the shape that we need
so<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.039> need<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.490> take<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.820> blunt<00:05:15.120> end<00:05:15.389> and

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
so you need to take the blunt end and

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.870 
so you need to take the blunt end and
curl<00:05:16.289> it<00:05:16.320> in<00:05:16.590> on<00:05:16.770> itself<00:05:16.800> making<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.699> little

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
curl it in on itself making a little

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.969 
curl it in on itself making a little
teeny<00:05:18.150> tiny<00:05:18.449> coil<00:05:18.900> because<00:05:19.530> that's<00:05:19.800> where

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
teeny tiny coil because that's where

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.770 
teeny tiny coil because that's where
we're<00:05:20.100> gonna<00:05:20.190> attach<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.729> hardware<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.750> that

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
we're gonna attach the hardware so that

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.240 
we're gonna attach the hardware so that
we<00:05:21.990> can<00:05:22.139> actually<00:05:22.289> wear<00:05:22.680> these<00:05:22.860> as<00:05:23.070> earrings

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
we can actually wear these as earrings

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.670 
we can actually wear these as earrings
now<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.120> really<00:05:24.780> should<00:05:24.810> have<00:05:25.080> done<00:05:25.110> this<00:05:25.440> step

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
now I really should have done this step

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.920 
now I really should have done this step
before<00:05:25.830> I<00:05:26.160> added<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.580> powder<00:05:26.850> because<00:05:27.720> the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
before I added the powder because the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.870 
before I added the powder because the
powder<00:05:28.169> makes<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:28.949> that<00:05:29.160> this<00:05:29.490> clay

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
powder makes it so that this clay

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.400 
powder makes it so that this clay
doesn't<00:05:30.270> want<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.479> stick<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.840> itself<00:05:31.110> anymore

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
doesn't want to stick to itself anymore

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.650 
doesn't want to stick to itself anymore
but<00:05:32.130> that's<00:05:32.310> okay<00:05:32.639> I<00:05:32.669> just<00:05:32.970> pinched<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.419> really

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
but that's okay I just pinched it really

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.080 
but that's okay I just pinched it really
hard<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.139> worked<00:05:34.289> out<00:05:34.470> so<00:05:35.370> coil<00:05:35.669> one<00:05:35.880> end

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
hard and it worked out so coil one end

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.300 
hard and it worked out so coil one end
around<00:05:36.389> and<00:05:36.660> then<00:05:37.260> kind<00:05:37.680> of<00:05:37.740> lay<00:05:37.919> it<00:05:37.950> out<00:05:38.160> on

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
around and then kind of lay it out on

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.760 
around and then kind of lay it out on
your<00:05:38.430> workspace<00:05:38.789> in<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.780> general<00:05:40.260> shape<00:05:40.530> that

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
your workspace in the general shape that

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.830 
your workspace in the general shape that
you<00:05:40.889> want<00:05:41.130> it<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:41.490> can<00:05:41.520> tweak<00:05:42.000> this<00:05:42.270> right<00:05:42.690> up

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
you want it you can tweak this right up

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.450 
you want it you can tweak this right up
until<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.260> point<00:05:43.440> when<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.770> clay<00:05:43.979> goes<00:05:44.220> into

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
until the point when the clay goes into

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.070 
until the point when the clay goes into
the<00:05:44.550> oven<00:05:44.580> so<00:05:45.150> don't<00:05:45.330> worry<00:05:45.510> about<00:05:45.630> getting<00:05:45.840> it

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
the oven so don't worry about getting it

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.910 
the oven so don't worry about getting it
perfect<00:05:46.260> from<00:05:46.710> start

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.070 

now<00:05:54.920> when<00:05:55.250> I<00:05:55.280> go<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.610> match<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.420> shapes<00:05:56.660> I<00:05:56.870> like

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
now when I go to match the shapes I like

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.420 
now when I go to match the shapes I like
to<00:05:57.260> make<00:05:57.530> the<00:05:57.650> earrings<00:05:57.980> so<00:05:58.160> that<00:05:58.280> they're

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
to make the earrings so that they're

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.090 
to make the earrings so that they're
facing<00:05:58.730> each<00:05:59.060> other<00:05:59.240> and<00:05:59.540> then<00:06:00.170> mirror<00:06:00.800> the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
facing each other and then mirror the

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.940 
facing each other and then mirror the
shape<00:06:01.340> of<00:06:01.750> both<00:06:02.750> of<00:06:02.960> them<00:06:03.140> so<00:06:03.500> that<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:03.710> just

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
shape of both of them so that I just

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.010 
shape of both of them so that I just
find<00:06:04.100> it's<00:06:04.250> easier<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.640> do<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:05.210> I<00:06:05.600> messed<00:06:05.870> up

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
find it's easier to do and I messed up

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.080 
find it's easier to do and I messed up
some<00:06:06.710> of<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.950> suction<00:06:07.490> cups<00:06:07.700> I<00:06:07.850> had<00:06:07.940> to<00:06:08.000> go

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
some of the suction cups I had to go

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.240 
some of the suction cups I had to go
back<00:06:08.240> and<00:06:08.480> fix<00:06:08.660> them<00:06:08.930> it's<00:06:09.260> okay<00:06:09.590> you<00:06:10.070> make

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
back and fix them it's okay you make

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.330 
back and fix them it's okay you make
mistakes<00:06:10.700> sometimes<00:06:11.380> so<00:06:12.380> once<00:06:12.950> you've<00:06:13.130> got

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
mistakes sometimes so once you've got

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.890 
mistakes sometimes so once you've got
the<00:06:13.550> earrings<00:06:13.970> in<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.210> shape<00:06:14.540> that<00:06:14.780> you<00:06:14.870> want

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
the earrings in the shape that you want

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.710 
the earrings in the shape that you want
we're<00:06:15.710> gonna<00:06:15.800> take<00:06:16.100> a<00:06:16.130> pair<00:06:16.610> of<00:06:16.670> eye<00:06:17.180> pins

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
we're gonna take a pair of eye pins

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.900 
we're gonna take a pair of eye pins
which<00:06:18.080> is<00:06:18.230> just<00:06:18.470> a<00:06:18.650> little<00:06:18.890> metal<00:06:19.250> piece<00:06:19.670> with

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
which is just a little metal piece with

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.060 
which is just a little metal piece with
a<00:06:19.940> loop<00:06:20.210> on<00:06:20.390> the<00:06:20.450> end<00:06:20.600> and<00:06:20.990> those<00:06:21.650> are<00:06:21.770> gonna<00:06:21.860> go

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
a loop on the end and those are gonna go

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.340 
a loop on the end and those are gonna go
right<00:06:22.310> through<00:06:22.340> that<00:06:22.580> coiled<00:06:23.060> up<00:06:23.150> area<00:06:23.570> so

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
right through that coiled up area so

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.950 
right through that coiled up area so
here<00:06:24.530> I'm<00:06:24.650> kind<00:06:24.860> of<00:06:24.980> eyeballing<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:26.330> see<00:06:26.750> how

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
here I'm kind of eyeballing to see how

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.360 
here I'm kind of eyeballing to see how
long<00:06:27.170> they<00:06:27.380> need<00:06:27.410> to<00:06:27.620> be<00:06:27.800> and<00:06:28.160> then<00:06:28.250> I'm

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
long they need to be and then I'm

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.170 
long they need to be and then I'm
cutting<00:06:28.670> them<00:06:28.730> a<00:06:28.850> little<00:06:29.270> bit<00:06:29.390> shorter<00:06:29.960> and

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
cutting them a little bit shorter and

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.390 
cutting them a little bit shorter and
then<00:06:32.180> taking<00:06:33.170> the<00:06:33.410> eye<00:06:33.740> pin<00:06:34.130> and<00:06:34.310> just

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
then taking the eye pin and just

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.940 
then taking the eye pin and just
sticking<00:06:35.330> it<00:06:35.510> in<00:06:36.050> through<00:06:36.380> that<00:06:36.530> curled<00:06:36.800> up

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
sticking it in through that curled up

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.250 
sticking it in through that curled up
area<00:06:37.280> you<00:06:37.820> can<00:06:37.940> see<00:06:38.120> when<00:06:38.330> I<00:06:38.360> make<00:06:38.600> mine<00:06:38.870> I<00:06:38.900> like

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
area you can see when I make mine I like

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.590 
area you can see when I make mine I like
to<00:06:39.410> have<00:06:39.620> one<00:06:39.650> suction<00:06:40.430> cup<00:06:40.610> right<00:06:41.000> at<00:06:41.210> the<00:06:41.330> top

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
to have one suction cup right at the top

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.210 
to have one suction cup right at the top
of<00:06:41.840> that<00:06:41.960> coiled<00:06:42.410> area

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
of that coiled area

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.220 
of that coiled area
I<00:06:43.250> just<00:06:43.790> think<00:06:43.910> looks<00:06:44.120> cool<00:06:44.360> but<00:06:44.900> if<00:06:45.020> yours

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
I just think looks cool but if yours

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.110 
I just think looks cool but if yours
didn't<00:06:45.530> line<00:06:45.650> up<00:06:45.680> that<00:06:45.980> way<00:06:46.160> it's<00:06:46.490> fine

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
didn't line up that way it's fine

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.880 
didn't line up that way it's fine
so<00:06:47.390> long<00:06:47.570> as<00:06:47.720> it'll<00:06:47.930> go<00:06:47.960> through<00:06:48.410> the<00:06:48.680> whole

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
so long as it'll go through the whole

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.060 
so long as it'll go through the whole
coil<00:06:49.280> you're<00:06:49.970> good<00:06:50.590> so<00:06:51.590> once<00:06:51.740> you've<00:06:51.860> got<00:06:52.040> both

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
coil you're good so once you've got both

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.370 
coil you're good so once you've got both
of<00:06:52.280> the<00:06:52.490> eye<00:06:52.520> pins<00:06:52.940> in<00:06:53.180> grab<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:53.900> cookie<00:06:54.110> sheet

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
of the eye pins in grab a cookie sheet

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.200 
of the eye pins in grab a cookie sheet
that<00:06:54.530> you<00:06:54.650> don't<00:06:54.830> like<00:06:55.070> toss<00:06:55.610> the<00:06:55.790> earrings<00:06:56.060> on
