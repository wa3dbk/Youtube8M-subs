00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.210

 when the product arrives agree 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.310

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.870

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.000
 as well as you want 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.919

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.610
 mobile and oh well then we talk to 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.020
 calm agree agree here I must say 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.870
 that I'm really curious to hear the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:58.770
 your piece but certainly on guys 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:01.200
 and 12 nice you can't cell that 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.150
 it sounds too much when it is too much 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.040
 was not called world is only the 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.000
 phone watch that all ii 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.650
 citizens 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.900
 this means not having at least 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.000
 respect for others and will be seen as 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:23.190
 in the case of monstrous with questionnaires a 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.810
 ridiculous this is something he made of 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.960
 all the mobile with the gallery from me 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.960
 we 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.240
 look, I'm mortified , please don't 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.850
 go away 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.410
 we choose a lot and left and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.330
 to make it up to me I decided to 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.580
 give her my brand new cell phone 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.310
 exact well it seems minimal if you want 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.530
 still have some hope 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.810
 yes, however, let 's say yes, but certainly that is before 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.790
 I meant that it has so many features 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:02.380
 new you can do everything happened 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:09.350
 make yourself not only the voice call 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:11.650
 very little memory of me treat it well 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:16.220
 leave us for the choirs every evening 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:22.160
 I recommend however now the melody of 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:26.170
 to sow a little girl I feel like 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.170
 that we will not register the year
