00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello everyone i'm serzh today perhaps 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.929
 as I usually do a new review 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:17.000
 test version 12w 08 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:20.880
 but for the most part there is little change 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.240
 but they fixed some singing first 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 created a more accurate brother returned generation 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.859
 cave that was more precise that does not 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.980
 was at 07 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.850
 a and b versions and also changed the system 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.969
 lighting which was also not working 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.780
 in previous versions 07 a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.239
 and 07 b and in this version actually 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 guidance only 2 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 first is there you can insert a ladder 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.789
 not only so but so let's say 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.420
 decorative 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.189
 thing helps to create let's say 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.520
 columns some more application for 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 there is no ceiling 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.610
 you can and the second novelty created it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.240
 new mob 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.240
 where he will have 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.369
 he appears in the village 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.369
 the garden is an iron golem 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.229
 market fear 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.429
 honestly actually you appear in 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 trees for protection and these residents 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:51.030
 from zombies and the like 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.630
 he himself is attacking the zombies elite 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.090
 at 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:02.159
 many mobs are counted except it seems gastov 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:06.569
 creeper and someone else I do not remember this 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.420
 Both 150 life if hearts 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.170
 penetrates the dragon stop that is he 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 pretty pretty she is led up to kill and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.860
 also does quite a bit of damage 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.569
 it is from three and a half 7 to 10 that is 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.569
 with one blow, he can kill you 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.430
 he is so slow 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:33.769
 done slowly but if he hit 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.950
 flashes quickly relatively quickly 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.600
 also 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.959
 if you delete these here also 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.170
 you will throw so to speak but only 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.150
 not in creative ie if you play 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.750
 normal mode then it will be 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:56.040
 it doesn't happen otherwise 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.870
 actually as usual snow 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.359
 snowman golem 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.519
 it can also be crafted but 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.180
 Unfortunately, he will not come in 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.700
 it will be just like walking on 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.730
 all terrain and 20 in a row it seems 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.450
 actually out of four google iron and 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:23.540
 from above . 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:26.209
 here's another one that they actually say 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.750
 after even killing them then 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:36.519
 reborn in the village 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.519
 mentioning you can check let me hit 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.400
 already as he began to move a little 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.000
 faster and when it comes to you but 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.349
 waving your arms and trying to hit you 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.069
 with him near 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:55.400
 i'm just trying to even kill him 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:04:00.829
 must ski dollar with his death him 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:05.030
 the faces of it here are iron bars and 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:09.910
 sometimes and then on to 2 red flowers 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.910
 not put the power of the red citrus but 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.769
 so that's what we did, so let's aner 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.730
 I will try to enter now here touch 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:27.490
 points enter normal mode and see 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:31.340
 what happens to create a new world 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:36.710
 the seed stayed up super flat ready 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:41.900
 ordinary survival create so guitars van 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:46.060
 the village now see how much they are 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.060
 golems are dangerous 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:04.410
 for some reason he fell asleep for 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:08.750
 let's take a fence 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.750
 sees him beat a resident and 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:25.150
 Well, if you read like, if 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:29.970
 round dance and a lot of me even if you 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:33.520
 beat the resident and he 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:37.620
 parents are not that even if he does not see something 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.620
 he will still attack you 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.139
 not just interesting even empty like u 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.259
 killed me whether he attack me 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.259
 again 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.390
 it is also written that it will not be fulfilled only 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.350
 in big villages that is if there 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:19.370
 there will be a 12 house card he is unlikely there 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:21.700
 this golems will appear so find 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.940
 will have to look no more money 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.940
 walks quietly 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.240
 once again he stands i will hit the viewers and 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.460
 yeah here he starts after me according to nations 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.610
 I think maybe kill the hand well, this is it 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:56.700
 will be somewhere around 100 beats learn 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.700
 Oh, he also threw me 

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:13.379
 that's all 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:19.220
 with two blows kills well you 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:19.220
 put a lem somewhere in the yard 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:27.389
 Well, actually this is not the same 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:33.530
 one innovation is small but in 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:36.030
 competition will not tell him but 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.310
 additional camera control 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.780
 functions led 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:44.130
 if you know you could be turning 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:46.290
 there somehow tilt it now it 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.880
 You can still add something there if 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:52.800
 it will be interesting to someone go to 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:55.410
 Wikipedia and read it all there 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.330
