00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
I'll turn off high quality because I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.180

don't<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.899> a<00:01:07.930> good<00:01:08.409> connection<00:01:08.830> at<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
don't have a good connection at the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.130 
don't have a good connection at the
moment<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.180> then<00:01:13.360> we<00:01:13.479> just<00:01:13.659> wait<00:01:13.869> for<00:01:13.899> the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
video to load while it's loading you can

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.770 
video to load while it's loading you can

think you can read the description yeah

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.219 
think you can read the description yeah
so<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.229> can<00:01:20.350> see<00:01:21.149> read<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.240> description<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
so you can see read the description and

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.820 
so you can see read the description and
you<00:01:23.530> can<00:01:23.560> look<00:01:23.800> around<00:01:23.950> other<00:01:24.399> stuff<00:01:25.679> it<00:01:26.679> is<00:01:26.800> a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
you can look around other stuff it is a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.080 
you can look around other stuff it is a
little<00:01:27.100> bit<00:01:27.250> slow<00:01:27.490> loading<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:28.030> video<00:01:28.330> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
little bit slow loading the video I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.880 
little bit slow loading the video I
would<00:01:31.090> say<00:01:31.479> it's<00:01:31.659> probably<00:01:31.960> my<00:01:32.289> connection

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
would say it's probably my connection

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.710 
would say it's probably my connection
but<00:01:33.100> then<00:01:33.250> at<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.460> same<00:01:33.520> time<00:01:33.970> if<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.360> was<00:01:34.539> to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
but then at the same time if I was to

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.380 
but then at the same time if I was to
load<00:01:34.869> this<00:01:35.020> video<00:01:35.350> up<00:01:35.530> on<00:01:35.770> my<00:01:36.069> cellphone<00:01:36.909> it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
load this video up on my cellphone it

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.200 
load this video up on my cellphone it
would<00:01:37.569> be<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:38.710> would<00:01:38.830> be<00:01:38.860> what<00:01:39.580> I'd<00:01:39.880> be<00:01:40.000> playing

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
would be it would be what I'd be playing

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.710 
would be it would be what I'd be playing
by<00:01:40.509> now

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
by now

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.710 
by now
so<00:01:41.190> to<00:01:42.190> some<00:01:42.399> degree<00:01:42.729> it's<00:01:42.880> definitely<00:01:43.420> the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
so to some degree it's definitely the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.340 
so to some degree it's definitely the
app<00:01:44.500> or<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.429> 2d<00:01:46.240> s<00:01:46.390> rather<00:01:46.810> than<00:01:47.110> my

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
app or the 2d s rather than my

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.420 
app or the 2d s rather than my
connection<00:01:48.539> anyway<00:01:49.539> let's<00:01:49.720> just<00:01:50.159> wave<00:01:51.159> this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
connection anyway let's just wave this

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.709 
connection anyway let's just wave this
load<00:01:51.880> shouldn't<00:01:52.329> take<00:01:52.479> too<00:01:52.509> much<00:01:52.810> longer<00:01:54.719> turn

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
load shouldn't take too much longer turn

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
load shouldn't take too much longer turn
up<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.020> volume

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.190 

I<00:01:59.430> think<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.000> already<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:02.060> here<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.119> go<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I think it's already are here you go you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.289 
I think it's already are here you go you
can<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.250> high<00:02:06.030> quality

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
can see because it's not in high quality

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.260 
can see because it's not in high quality
mode<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.429> even<00:02:08.580> filling<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
mode it's it's not even filling the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.610 
mode it's it's not even filling the
holes<00:02:09.479> run<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.780> then<00:02:13.050> put<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> high

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
holes run so if we then put a high

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.479 
holes run so if we then put a high
quality<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:15.769> you'll<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.069> will<00:02:17.160> buffer

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
quality on you'll see it will buffer

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.500 
quality on you'll see it will buffer
again<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.099> now<00:02:20.340> full<00:02:20.760> screen<00:02:23.209> now<00:02:24.209> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
again and it's now full screen now you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.530 
again and it's now full screen now you
can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.050> quality<00:02:25.590> isn't<00:02:26.040> amazing<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.819> if

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
can see the quality isn't amazing but if

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.470 
can see the quality isn't amazing but if
you're<00:02:27.660> holding<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.560> know<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:29.420> couple<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
you're holding it you know a couple of

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.360 
you're holding it you know a couple of
foot<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.350> couple<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.739> feet<00:02:31.890> away<00:02:31.920> from

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
foot or a couple of feet away from

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.420 
foot or a couple of feet away from

an aeroplane
I<00:03:16.840> often<00:03:17.200> only<00:03:17.560> had<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.860> two<00:03:17.890> D<00:03:18.220> s<00:03:18.310> because

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
I often only had the two D s because

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.479 
I often only had the two D s because

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
isn't a good example I see because most

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.190 
isn't a good example I see because most
airplanes<00:03:27.819> don't<00:03:28.209> have<00:03:28.300> Wi-Fi<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.020> if<00:03:29.110> they

airplanes don't have Wi-Fi and if they
do<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.470> costs<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.800> fortune<00:03:30.010> but<00:03:30.850> there<00:03:31.000> are

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
do it costs a fortune but there are

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.699 
do it costs a fortune but there are
times<00:03:31.300> when<00:03:31.570> I'm<00:03:31.690> just<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.200> airport
