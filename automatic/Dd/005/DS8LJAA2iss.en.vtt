00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:14.610
 and a strangely strange race 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 because they are simply contain flying 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.060
 that is the typical thing that you see by the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.750
 street does not pass anything quiet see that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.250
 grandma give two dogs cars trees and 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.660
 you also look at the sky and see apart from the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.310
 Sun as a row to contain is the most 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.880
 normal of the world guys when the car 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.660
 I was here in this race and eye because 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 to get there 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.160
 uyuyuy ok we arrived 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.950
 perfectly do not die to this line 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.820
 kid baleares 19 people and the truth 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.129
 it's going to be a bit complicated 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.520
 win it but it will not be impossible for me to 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.610
 be the jump here to kingdom where ever 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.620
 that a kid a kid that I do not know how 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.110
 I call it okay to see well late it was for 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.980
 a little to the side and go down and catch 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.980
 a little bit of run 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.410
 eye is not the perfect career 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.740
 eye that I go second I have here about 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.520

 love that it was motorbike I jumped up 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.670
 it's a detail that really moves me 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.670
 put the wheel in half 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.040

 As to features and aesthetically 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.000
 with a bike that really seems to me 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.930
 rather more advanced in terms of the no 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.490

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.920

 less than the one for you and not be 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.209

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.030

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.900

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.450

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.920
 little bit there is 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.780

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.590
 1 maica a wing chopped wintour is worth 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.269
 at least I think the second one 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.099
 cited finally have a couple that 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.269
 today will jump and I do not know how we're going 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.769
 I think the second is second to 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.660
 second one does not need much 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.540
 power does not need much 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.120
 power we go down we're not going to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.129
 going down and living implies a 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.470
 pica a peak for intermediate boy touches 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.090
