00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
every time I blogged about my way to if

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.600 
every time I blogged about my way to if
I<00:02:29.000> was<00:02:29.150> losing<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.680> did<00:02:31.340> lose<00:02:31.580> a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
I was losing and this and I did lose a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.690 
I was losing and this and I did lose a
lot<00:02:32.000> at<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.269> very<00:02:32.480> beginning<00:02:32.950> or<00:02:33.950> more<00:02:34.459> than<00:02:34.640> I

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
lot at the very beginning or more than I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.009 
lot at the very beginning or more than I
guess<00:02:34.879> most<00:02:35.150> people<00:02:35.209> because<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.690> kept<00:02:35.930> getting

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
guess most people because I kept getting

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.900 
guess most people because I kept getting
comments<00:02:36.349> about<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.879> decided

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
comments about it and so then I decided

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.820 
comments about it and so then I decided
no<00:02:38.450> I'm<00:02:38.599> getting<00:02:38.930> I'm<00:02:39.349> not<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.739> give

these<00:02:39.950> updates<00:02:40.310> anymore<00:02:41.890> which<00:02:42.890> was<00:02:43.099> good

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
these updates anymore which was good

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.710 
these updates anymore which was good
because<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.730> actually<00:02:43.970> gained<00:02:44.299> some<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.599> it

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
because I actually gained some of it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.789 
because I actually gained some of it
back<00:02:46.060> as<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.390> today<00:02:47.780> I'm<00:02:48.560> down<00:02:48.950> 47<00:02:49.880> pounds<00:02:50.769> so<00:02:51.769> I

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
back as of today I'm down 47 pounds so I

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.910 
back as of today I'm down 47 pounds so I
actually<00:02:52.160> hit<00:02:52.579> 50<00:02:53.090> at<00:02:53.329> one<00:02:53.510> point<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.049> I<00:02:54.769> was

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
actually hit 50 at one point and I was

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.470 
actually hit 50 at one point and I was
excited<00:02:55.250> but<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.610> didn't<00:02:55.940> want<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.150> say<00:02:56.450> it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
excited but I didn't want to say it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.780 
excited but I didn't want to say it
because<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:58.040> didn't<00:02:58.430> know<00:02:58.549> if<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.730> would

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
because I just didn't know if I would

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.319 
because I just didn't know if I would
keep<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.299> there<00:02:59.599> you<00:02:59.840> know<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.970> I'm<00:03:02.060> still

and we've talked about this blog for a

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.520 
and we've talked about this blog for a
while<00:04:13.340> but<00:04:13.489> we<00:04:13.639> thought<00:04:13.849> about<00:04:14.079> p3<00:04:15.079> mess<00:04:15.290> tabs

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
while but we thought about p3 mess tabs

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.680 
while but we thought about p3 mess tabs
things<00:04:15.919> that<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.310> must<00:04:16.549> have<00:04:16.820> or

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
things that you must have or

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.300 
things that you must have or
that<00:04:18.230> you<00:04:18.380> might<00:04:18.590> want<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:18.920> have<00:04:19.070> before
