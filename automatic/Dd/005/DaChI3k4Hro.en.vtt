00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
to be tackling the shotguns this is a

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.220 
to be tackling the shotguns this is a

well for lack of better terms pump

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
well for lack of better terms pump
shotgun<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.789> certainly<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.360> full<00:00:57.629> auto<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
shotgun it's certainly not full auto and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
shotgun it's certainly not full auto and
it's<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.620> guess<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.280> could<00:00:59.309> say<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's I guess you could say it is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's I guess you could say it is
semi-automatic<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.379> feels<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.739> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
semi-automatic but it feels like you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.260 
semi-automatic but it feels like you
have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> wait<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> small<00:01:02.550> pump<00:01:02.820> before<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
have to wait a small pump before the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.359 
have to wait a small pump before the
fire<00:01:03.449> rate<00:01:03.690> gets<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.049> again<00:01:04.170> however<00:01:05.070> with

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
fire rate gets up again however with

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
fire rate gets up again however with
enough<00:01:05.610> mods<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.330> actually<00:01:06.930> turn<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
enough mods you can actually turn it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
enough mods you can actually turn it
into<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.439> replacement<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> bore<00:01:08.460> making

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.580 
really a big issue until you start
getting<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.610> distance<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.260> again<00:05:19.260> that's

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
getting the distance and again that's

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.500 
getting the distance and again that's
the<00:05:19.770> point<00:05:19.890> of<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.130> shotgun<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:21.090> be<00:05:21.330> sure<00:05:21.360> to

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
the point of the shotgun so be sure to

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.180 
the point of the shotgun so be sure to
pick<00:05:21.720> this<00:05:21.900> up<00:05:21.960> if<00:05:22.320> you<00:05:22.470> like<00:05:22.680> how<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:22.980> sounds

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
pick this up if you like how it sounds

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.210 
pick this up if you like how it sounds
so<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.540> it<00:05:24.750> from<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.170> shotgun<00:05:25.710> end<00:05:26.100> of

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
so that is it from the shotgun end of

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.670 
so that is it from the shotgun end of
things<00:05:26.370> next<00:05:27.180> we'll<00:05:27.390> be<00:05:27.420> doing<00:05:27.900> likely<00:05:28.560> the

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
things next we'll be doing likely the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.800 
things next we'll be doing likely the
sniper<00:05:29.010> rifles<00:05:29.580> until<00:05:30.540> then<00:05:30.780> that's<00:05:31.500> it
