I guess wondering about that had attack
power<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.620> were<00:01:01.710> looking<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:02.039> earlier<00:01:03.229> if

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
power that we were looking at earlier if

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.140 
power that we were looking at earlier if
you're<00:01:04.439> wondering<00:01:04.769> how<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you're wondering how to to get the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
you're wondering how to to get the
number<00:01:06.420> find<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.080> attack<00:01:07.350> power<00:01:07.430> there

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
number find out your attack power there

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.510 
number find out your attack power there
is<00:01:08.640> an<00:01:08.760> equation<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:10.320> can't<00:01:10.770> ask<00:01:10.920> me<00:01:11.010> how<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
is an equation I you can't ask me how it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.170 
is an equation I you can't ask me how it
works<00:01:11.760> out

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
works out

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780 
works out
because<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.750> no<00:01:12.990> idea<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:13.700> looking<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
because I have no idea I've looking it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.039 
because I have no idea I've looking it
up<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.090> everything<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.750> don't

so with that sum of 28 and in the sum of
eight<00:02:04.530> from<00:02:05.460> our<00:02:05.579> level<00:02:05.850> times<00:02:06.030> two<00:02:06.270> we're

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
eight from our level times two we're

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.139 
eight from our level times two we're
gonna<00:02:06.659> add<00:02:06.869> those<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.290> together

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
gonna add those two together

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.170 
gonna add those two together
and<00:02:09.239> come<00:02:09.929> up<00:02:10.079> with<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> number<00:02:10.379> 36<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.090> how

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and come up with a number 36 that is how

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.030 
and come up with a number 36 that is how
you<00:02:12.239> find<00:02:12.480> out<00:02:12.689> your<00:02:12.930> your<00:02:13.409> ranged<00:02:13.769> attack
