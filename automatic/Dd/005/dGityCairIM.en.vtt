wonderful airplane the way the batteries

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
wonderful airplane the way the batteries
installed<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.380> comes<00:00:31.590> right<00:00:31.769> up

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
installed on this is it comes right up

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
installed on this is it comes right up
here<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> nose<00:00:32.399> here<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.570> actually

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
here on the nose here and it actually

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.420 
here on the nose here and it actually
has<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> little<00:00:34.290> pocket<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> slide

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
has a little pocket here that you slide

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.069 
has a little pocket here that you slide
the<00:00:35.550> battery<00:00:35.700> back<00:00:36.059> into<00:00:36.450> which<00:00:36.630> makes<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the battery back into which makes it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020 
the battery back into which makes it
really<00:00:37.890> convenient<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> battery

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
really convenient because the battery

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.610 
really convenient because the battery
packs<00:00:39.239> easy<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> same

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
packs easy to get to but at the same

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.049 
packs easy to get to but at the same
time<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.280> does<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.300> come<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> flight<00:00:44.059> so

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
time it does not come out and flight so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.900 
time it does not come out and flight so
here<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:47.000> plugs<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.539> that

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
here we go here plugs right in like that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
here we go here plugs right in like that
and<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.210> slide<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> right<00:00:51.629> back<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.350> its

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and you slide it right back there in its

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.529 
and you slide it right back there in its
pouch<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.039> we're<00:00:53.640> actually<00:00:53.760> flying<00:00:54.239> ours

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
pouch and we're actually flying ours

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.080 
pouch and we're actually flying ours
today<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.530> optional<00:00:56.520> outdoor

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
today with the optional outdoor

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.060 
today with the optional outdoor
propeller<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:57.930> increases<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
propeller which actually increases the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.910 
propeller which actually increases the
thrust<00:00:59.969> by<00:01:00.210> probably<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.350> twenty<00:01:01.770> five

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
thrust by probably about twenty five

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.789 
thrust by probably about twenty five
percent<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.550> gives<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.910> lot<00:01:03.059> more<00:01:03.270> thrust

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
percent it gives it a lot more thrust

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
percent it gives it a lot more thrust
Authority<00:01:04.799> climb<00:01:05.280> Authority<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.869> do

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
Authority climb Authority and you can do

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
Authority climb Authority and you can do
a<00:01:07.020> lot<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.229> aerobatic<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> too<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> as

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a lot more aerobatic with it too and as

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.210 
a lot more aerobatic with it too and as
you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.049> actually<00:01:10.650> fly

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you can see here you can actually fly

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.840 
you can see here you can actually fly
your<00:01:11.580> airplane<00:01:11.610> while<00:01:12.479> you're<00:01:12.720> charging<00:01:13.200> your

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
your airplane while you're charging your

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.670 
your airplane while you're charging your
second<00:01:14.850> onboard<00:01:15.450> lipo<00:01:15.780> battery<00:01:16.080> pack<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.500> once

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
second onboard lipo battery pack so once

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.230 
second onboard lipo battery pack so once
you're<00:01:16.799> done<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.850> land<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you're done with one you can land it and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.270 
you're done with one you can land it and
switch<00:01:18.840> battery<00:01:19.170> packs<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.590> which<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> pretty

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
switch battery packs out which is pretty

00:01:20.280 --> 00:02:36.429 
switch battery packs out which is pretty
pretty<00:01:20.700> neat<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> here<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.200> go

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.289 

so<00:02:37.439> this<00:02:37.560> must<00:02:37.829> if<00:02:38.430> fire<00:02:38.639> actually<00:02:38.909> fly

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
so this must if fire actually fly

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.709 
so this must if fire actually fly
realflow<00:02:39.930> 42<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:42.000> actually<00:02:42.120> got<00:02:42.450> quite

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
realflow 42 and it's actually got quite

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.530 
realflow 42 and it's actually got quite
good<00:02:43.139> thrust<00:02:43.469> thrust<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.700> what<00:02:44.939> it<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.510> I

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
good thrust thrust for what it is to I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.539 
good thrust thrust for what it is to I
mean<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.409> can<00:02:46.590> lose<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:46.920> thing<00:02:46.980> straight

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
mean you can lose this thing straight

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.160 
mean you can lose this thing straight
out<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> level<00:02:48.060> flight<00:02:48.269> just<00:02:48.569> by<00:02:48.719> flooring<00:02:49.139> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
out of level flight just by flooring the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.110 
out of level flight just by flooring the
thing<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.739> pull<00:02:50.310> them<00:02:50.370> back<00:02:50.579> on<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.909> elevator

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
thing and pull them back on the elevator

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.239 
thing and pull them back on the elevator
and<00:02:51.359> it'll<00:02:51.689> come<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:51.870> around<00:02:52.109> for<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:55.249> or

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:56.249 
and it'll come right around for you or

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.039 
and it'll come right around for you or
you<00:02:56.459> can<00:02:56.549> slow<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.849> way<00:02:56.969> down<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.659> be<00:02:57.810> some

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
you can slow it way down and be some

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.839 
you can slow it way down and be some
real<00:02:58.260> nice<00:02:58.409> loaf<00:02:58.859> line<00:02:59.129> and<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.489> can<00:02:59.639> flatten

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
real nice loaf line and you can flatten

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.789 
real nice loaf line and you can flatten
a<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.419> confined<00:03:00.810> area<00:03:01.200> as<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.469> can<00:03:01.590> see

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
a really confined area as you can see

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.979 
a really confined area as you can see
here<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.909> field<00:03:03.150> we're<00:03:03.359> flying<00:03:03.689> with

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
here that the field we're flying with

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.229 
here that the field we're flying with
here<00:03:04.379> is<00:03:04.409> actually<00:03:04.889> just<00:03:05.040> writing<00:03:06.000> some<00:03:06.120> of

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
here is actually just writing some of

here is actually just writing some of
the<00:03:06.329> house<00:03:06.480> here<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.730> not<00:03:08.730> an<00:03:08.909> issue<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.239> this

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
the house here and not an issue for this

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.330 
the house here and not an issue for this
little<00:03:09.719> plane<00:03:10.049> if<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.769> sitting<00:03:11.069> bumped

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
little plane if you sitting bumped

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.860 
little plane if you sitting bumped
around<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.699> air<00:03:11.849> here<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> little<00:03:12.329> bit<00:03:12.510> there

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
around the air here a little bit there
