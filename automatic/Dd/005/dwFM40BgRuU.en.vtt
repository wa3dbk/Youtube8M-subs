back stitch there now let's turn this
over<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.229> see<00:02:00.409> what<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.619> looks<00:02:00.830> like<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:03.470> just

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
over and see what it looks like it just

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.100 
over and see what it looks like it just
looks<00:02:03.799> really<00:02:03.890> really<00:02:04.880> nice<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.750> can<00:02:05.869> barely

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
looks really really nice you can barely

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.410 
looks really really nice you can barely
see<00:02:06.440> where<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.799> seam<00:02:07.009> starts<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.700> ends<00:02:08.179> and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
see where the seam starts and ends and

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.930 
see where the seam starts and ends and
this<00:02:09.020> might<00:02:09.229> be<00:02:09.380> easier<00:02:09.739> for<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.489> then<00:02:10.700> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
this might be easier for you then the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.180 
this might be easier for you then the
crisscross<00:02:11.360> method<00:02:11.930> or<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.800> other<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:13.040> might

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
crisscross method or the other one might

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.740 
crisscross method or the other one might
be<00:02:13.220> easier<00:02:13.640> but<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.510> one<00:02:14.720> looks

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
be easier but I think this one looks

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.350 
be easier but I think this one looks
nicer
