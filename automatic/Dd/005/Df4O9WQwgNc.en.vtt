canvas I painted it and didn't like the
way<00:00:57.930> turned<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> decided<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.390> put<00:01:00.690> two

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
with the way it turned out actually so I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.020 
with the way it turned out actually so I
colored<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> canvas<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> bays<00:01:08.610> and

colored the canvas which is the bays and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.320 
colored the canvas which is the bays and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.090 
hanging is great for any sort of wall i
think<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.870> know<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.709> wouldn't<00:04:06.920> have<00:04:07.010> to

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
think you know you wouldn't have to

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.979 
think you know you wouldn't have to
worry<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.580> it<00:04:08.120> wouldn't<00:04:08.450> match<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.840> wall

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
worry that it wouldn't match the wall

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.820 
worry that it wouldn't match the wall
that<00:04:09.100> you've<00:04:10.100> got<00:04:10.370> because<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:11.360> holds<00:04:12.170> on<00:04:12.650> its

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
that you've got because it holds on its

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.610 
that you've got because it holds on its
own<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:14.090> i<00:04:14.299> think<00:04:14.570> it<00:04:14.720> would<00:04:14.900> sort<00:04:15.170> any<00:04:15.350> kind

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
own and i think it would sort any kind

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.400 
own and i think it would sort any kind
of<00:04:15.709> all<00:04:15.860> so<00:04:16.609> if<00:04:17.419> you're<00:04:17.570> giving<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:17.930> away<00:04:18.049> as<00:04:18.380> a

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
of all so if you're giving it away as a

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.839 
of all so if you're giving it away as a
present<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:19.130> don't<00:04:19.459> think<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.729> would<00:04:19.820> have

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
present I don't think you would have

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.880

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
problems for it to suit the
