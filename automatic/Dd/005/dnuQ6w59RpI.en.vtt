00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.100
 it does not matter much what not 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.780
 has deformed is a nuclear double that in 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.850
 the first video was recorded the main 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.160
 globalist time but I will talk more 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.190

 normal and good what I wanted to tell you 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.969
 basically in this video was 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.000
 what was the inactivity of the channel 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.129
 during you can say these two or three 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.829
 weeks I do not know how much it has been since only 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.789
 you had a nuclear bing and 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.190

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.589
 it is then from two the thanks and 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.379

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.479
 time because now I'm going to explain myself 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.360
 I've had enough things to do and what 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.820

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.590
 I was sick and things like that well 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.780
 we were able to bring video to the channel and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.520
 good for all who do not know and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.470
 six new ones in the channel because we are already 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.780
 four thousand many kids subscribers 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.659
 thanks to all I do not know how many will have 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.970
 run out of assets after all this 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.619
 inactivity of the channel but good that is 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.920
 I thank you very much everyone for 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.930
 the 4,000 subscribers and well then that 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.300

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.430
 as many you will not know vinillo we are 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.740
 in 2nd year of bachelor who is the last 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.770
 bachelor course the hardest no doubt 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.990
 of all your studies using account 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 when you are coming to this course, no 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 because you form where I already tell you so 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.150
 a very hard course because also later 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.210
 you have like selectivity like that so 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.200
 good come kids we've had to be 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.010

 for my part I have finished the evaluation 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.880

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.160
 whole week but good is holy week 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.150
 of many to think and know you have 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.200

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.750
 course with the class and all that there is 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.300
 party there to visit several cities of 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.520
 italy and well he was not at home 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.490
 until the last week 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.560
 until last week the last week 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.950
 of holy week that here is party in 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.330
 where in the place where we live and then 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.520
 well that week I had to be 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.010
 studying for a couple of exams that 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.810
 I had to do yesterday that the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.690
 finish I'm eating our day 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.880
 Thursday and well I hope that 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.320
 that you value the effort that is 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.610
 doing now because if the exams 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.370
 tomorrow when you are watching this video 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.180
 I will be going to see the notes because 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.110
 they give them to me already tomorrow to the day Friday and 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.580
 Well, if you are watching this video 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.980
 I guess I'll know the notes that 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.300
 I will have taken out and if it opens by bus and 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.250
 well this will affect the channel of the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.250
 way that if I approve all kids 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.879
 you are going to have more videos during this 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.219
 week and more streaming by twitch than 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.150
 I'll do it because I started doing it 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:35.709
 time without playing there giving him cane and then 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.349
 good is approved all of the pri more videos 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.230
 and if he suspends any then you're going to 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.430
 have to be without videos speakers or 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.730
 without more constant video up 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.439
 the last day June 9 and ask already 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.200
 you know why but we do not have the 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.819
 selectivity you will all know what is the 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.260
 selectivity to be studied 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.480
 very much and good by the way here is 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.969
 is the first nuclear they are without more 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.829
 normalitas in three minutes but I liked 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:05.400
 also because in the end it's a nuclear 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.900
 you will see the one that reads or I write you forgive it 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.370
 that the world also has a little 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.950
 locked 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.319
 and well then that we have the selectivity 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.690
 in June and you have to prepare it not because 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.150
 will have all the stuff of the whole year 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.359
 all the year of bachelor of the second 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.710
 bachelor and therefore good subjects for 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.350
 subjects you have to study what 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.120
 that for up to nine months and that 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.910
 apply it in an hour and a half exam 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.060
 not that it helps you to enter a 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.380
 university or not so that's why you do not 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.870
 You can play it because the studios 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.160
 always goes ahead of youtube or 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.190
 this hobby not that we have here and 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.810
 raising items so that's not what 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.699
 I say to you always put the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.740
 studies ahead because it's really 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.830
 what the future will give you 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.270
 think about leaving school and 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.949
 grow little by little on YouTube you go to 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.300
 live on this because there is not much less 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.919
 people who have left school 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.139
 like some great youtubers but 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.599
 well those are cases apart yes 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.460
 it is not necessary to mention the aquino and 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.919
 Well, all this has been due to the 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.180
 inactivity of the channel and well then 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.029
 I'm here to tell you 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.849
 this video that to see tomorrow already when 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:16.629
 receive the notes that you tell me and you 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.340
 approved had and good as I already told 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.069
 Bini to send a message from Lay 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.270
 because I recorded it in movies and well, so 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.990
 if you want to give the idea while 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.849
 I'm following this and well then that 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.500
 because yes there are going to be several changes 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:34.659
 in the fuck channel and good as is like 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.199
 You see, it 's if I'm a little fucked up and 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:40.449
 let's start new series I do not 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.729
 it seems to me to give a new direction to 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.210
 channel like this while we can upload some 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.680
 videos because consume only expensive public 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.569
 criticizes the latter is good is 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.120
 quite good because it motivates you to see 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.800
 games like this give you or you want to 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.720
 you and to enter to play to try 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.780
 take it out yes 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:04.270
 that is for me it is the purpose that has 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.680
 such as games and good 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.600
 had a comment on the long web and 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.430
 is about to finish kids wanted 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.560
 tell you that the subject of promotions 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.020
 we have not left a bit apart 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.060
 because since we would have come 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.640
 we do not want to upload videos either 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.190
 from people to the channel without you having 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.980
 comments from us so good 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.290
 here is already very little video 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.750
 is about a minute and a half 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.820
 and we will advance a little bit the type of 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.680
 series that we are going to upload to the channel that 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.299
 new series that we have thought suite 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.819
 that was white 2 

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:42.009
 I'm wrong the series to upload if 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:44.499
 we were nuclear with weapons of 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.129
 diamond with diamond camouflage as 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:50.829
 You know it costs a lot does not bring good 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:52.659
 we want to raise diamond weapons taken out 

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:55.029
 with a place that is so if you do not know is 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:56.889
 that a hacker is what all weapons 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:59.469
 everything is played so that I in my 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:02.319
 main account I started to upload the 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:03.999
 diamond weapons and I already have enough to 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.909
 diamond like snipers the 

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:08.829
 rifles the assault rifles and good 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.649
 I shotguns is very little 

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:13.059
 so, well, I think that being 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:15.369
 well because in addition to uploading 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:17.679
 nuclear and diamond we will explain 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:19.629
 a little bit the best class with the weapon 

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:21.279
 so that you to try it and if we 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.199
 you will tell a little bit how smooth you 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:26.019
 because we are pretty good at those 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.069
 classes and good to finalize the video 

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.419
 that is very little here will go 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.829
 studying at the point that this is a 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:32.769
 frame play here defending the 

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:33.429
 point and taking taking it not and good 

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:36.609
 finish 

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:38.349
 that we have thought about raising our 

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:41.910
 statistics to the channel in a week 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:43.650
 so when he finished the exams 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.060
 and on the other hand I'm going to make a 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.220
 streaming questions and answers for 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.510
 solve all the doubts that you have like this 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.130
 what good I hope it is like the video that 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:54.570
 support it and everything you can and since 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.620
 it's an effort for us to upload these 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.220
 videos and good I hope that I have 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.220
 liked kids
