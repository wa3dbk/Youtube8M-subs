only<00:01:16.439> major<00:01:16.650> issue<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.340> these<00:01:17.490> tapes<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
only major issue with these tapes is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
only major issue with these tapes is
that<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.270> were<00:01:18.330> sort<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.290> brief<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.890> thought

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that they were sort of brief I thought

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.910 
that they were sort of brief I thought
young<00:01:20.460> fathers<00:01:20.909> were<00:01:21.150> we're<00:01:21.540> writing<00:01:21.810> really

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920 

fantastically<00:01:25.920> catchy<00:01:26.549> songs<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> also

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
fantastically catchy songs but I also

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.999 
fantastically catchy songs but I also
couldn't<00:01:28.290> help<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.560> feel<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:28.950> were

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
couldn't help but feel like they were

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.390 
couldn't help but feel like they were
sort<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> holding<00:01:30.659> back<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:31.380> terms<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
sort of holding back in terms of the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520 
sort of holding back in terms of the
length<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.939> their<00:01:33.090> overall<00:01:33.360> projects<00:01:34.140> holding

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
length of their overall projects holding

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.499 
length of their overall projects holding
back<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:35.009> something<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.329> more

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
back from something with just a bit more

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.749 
back from something with just a bit more
runtime<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:37.500> ambition<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.369> also

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
runtime and a lot more ambition I also

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
runtime and a lot more ambition I also
suspected<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.299> coming<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.869> music<00:01:40.200> on

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
suspected that coming out with music on

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
suspected that coming out with music on

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
honestly for me it comes down to two

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.589 
honestly for me it comes down to two
things<00:03:13.230> one<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.340> instrumentals<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.359> LP

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
things one the instrumentals on this LP

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.309 
things one the instrumentals on this LP
are<00:03:16.049> some<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.409> most<00:03:16.560> redundant<00:03:17.400> and

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
are some of the most redundant and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.990 
are some of the most redundant and
repetitive<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.620> young<00:03:19.889> fathers<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.609> put

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
repetitive that young fathers have put

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.509 
repetitive that young fathers have put
together<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.510> far<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.049> some<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.739> songs<00:03:22.980> on

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
together so far and some of the songs on

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.949 
together so far and some of the songs on
this<00:03:23.699> record<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.239> think<00:03:24.299> are<00:03:24.540> some<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> most

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
this record I think are some of the most

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.740 
this record I think are some of the most
lackluster<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:26.489> they've<00:03:26.849> put<00:03:27.090> out<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.449> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
lackluster that they've put out to the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.539 
lackluster that they've put out to the
instrumentals<00:03:28.349> on<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.590> LP<00:03:28.859> show<00:03:29.220> very

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
instrumentals on this LP show very

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.659 
instrumentals on this LP show very
little<00:03:30.090> change<00:03:30.449> from<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.260> beginning<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.919> the

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
little change from the beginning to the

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.189 
little change from the beginning to the
end<00:03:32.699> of<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.120> track<00:03:33.449> the<00:03:33.690> really<00:03:33.930> quirky

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
end of the track the really quirky

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.439 
end of the track the really quirky
keyboards<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.370> primal<00:03:35.819> drums<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.269> main

catchiest track on this entire LP but

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.180 
catchiest track on this entire LP but
even<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.930> really<00:04:01.079> infectious<00:04:01.560> chorus

doesn't draw away from the fact that the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.979 
doesn't draw away from the fact that the
rhythm<00:04:04.199> section<00:04:04.500> feels<00:04:04.889> so<00:04:05.659> redundant<00:04:06.659> this

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
rhythm section feels so redundant this

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.599 
rhythm section feels so redundant this
is<00:04:07.109> actually<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> difficult<00:04:07.859> thing<00:04:08.129> for<00:04:08.310> me<00:04:08.519> to

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
is actually a difficult thing for me to

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.009 
is actually a difficult thing for me to

come to terms with when listening to

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.390 
come to terms with when listening to
this<00:04:10.199> record<00:04:10.440> because<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.979> is<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.159> last

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
this record because this is the last

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.819 
this record because this is the last
thing<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.540> thought<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:12.900> would<00:04:13.079> feel<00:04:13.379> while

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
thing that I thought I would feel while

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.649 
thing that I thought I would feel while
listening<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.519> tracks<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:15.000> dead<00:04:15.239> given

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
listening to the tracks on dead given

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.479 
listening to the tracks on dead given
that<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.840> recording<00:04:16.440> quality<00:04:16.590> on<00:04:17.039> dead<00:04:17.340> is

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
that the recording quality on dead is

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.399 
that the recording quality on dead is
better<00:04:17.789> than<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.389> last<00:04:18.630> two<00:04:18.900> tapes

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
better than that of the last two tapes

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:20.719 
better than that of the last two tapes
I<00:04:19.530> would<00:04:19.739> only<00:04:19.829> assume<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.519> would<00:04:20.639> be

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
I would only assume that it would be

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.180 
I would only assume that it would be
easier<00:04:21.209> for<00:04:21.329> young<00:04:21.690> fathers<00:04:22.139> to<00:04:22.320> write<00:04:22.500> more

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
easier for young fathers to write more

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.000 
easier for young fathers to write more
dynamic<00:04:23.820> songs<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:24.419> very<00:04:24.599> subtle<00:04:25.080> lows

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
dynamic songs with very subtle lows

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.850 
dynamic songs with very subtle lows
of<00:04:26.280> highs<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.270> just<00:04:27.660> doesn't<00:04:28.260> happen

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
of highs but it just doesn't happen

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.500 
of highs but it just doesn't happen
there<00:04:29.250> are<00:04:29.310> plenty<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.730> tracks<00:04:30.000> on<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.330> LP

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
there are plenty of tracks on this LP

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.990 
there are plenty of tracks on this LP
where<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.050> vocals<00:04:31.500> feel<00:04:32.000> particularly

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
where the vocals feel particularly

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
where the vocals feel particularly
beautiful<00:04:33.690> or<00:04:34.520> intense<00:04:35.520> like<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.510> screaming

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
beautiful or intense like the screaming

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.810 
beautiful or intense like the screaming
on<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.230> track<00:04:37.470> paying<00:04:37.860> or<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.640> really

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
on the track paying or the really

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.150 
on the track paying or the really
soulful<00:04:39.180> singing<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:39.990> song<00:04:40.230> dip<00:04:40.500> but

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
soulful singing on the song dip but

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.060 
soulful singing on the song dip but
instrumentally<00:04:42.030> dead<00:04:42.270> feels<00:04:42.540> way<00:04:42.960> too<00:04:43.070> mid

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
instrumentally dead feels way too mid

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.300 
instrumentally dead feels way too mid
paced<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.700> too<00:04:44.940> mild<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:46.200> be<00:04:46.320> as<00:04:46.500> exciting<00:04:47.220> as

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
paced and too mild to be as exciting as

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.040 
paced and too mild to be as exciting as
anything<00:04:47.700> young<00:04:47.910> fathers<00:04:48.300> have<00:04:48.450> done<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:48.810> far

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
anything young fathers have done so far

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.050 
anything young fathers have done so far
I<00:04:49.260> think<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.590> only<00:04:49.710> visceral<00:04:50.310> spot<00:04:50.640> for<00:04:50.880> me<00:04:51.030> on

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
I think the only visceral spot for me on

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.150 
I think the only visceral spot for me on
this<00:04:51.270> entire<00:04:51.570> LP<00:04:51.990> was<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.290> opening<00:04:52.650> track<00:04:52.890> no

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
this entire LP was the opening track no

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.460 
this entire LP was the opening track no
way<00:04:53.400> with<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.760> hammering<00:04:54.600> kick<00:04:54.900> drums<00:04:55.230> at<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
way with the hammering kick drums at the

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.110 
way with the hammering kick drums at the
very<00:04:55.710> end<00:04:55.890> of<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.100> song<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.640> like<00:04:56.910> I<00:04:57.060> said

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
very end of the song and like I said

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.760 
very end of the song and like I said
before<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.540> do<00:04:57.630> think<00:04:57.960> there<00:04:58.080> are<00:04:58.110> some<00:04:58.410> songs

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
before I do think there are some songs

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.980 
before I do think there are some songs
on<00:04:59.010> here<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.250> are<00:04:59.580> sort<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.000> lacking<00:05:00.420> as<00:05:00.750> well

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
on here that are sort of lacking as well

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.440 
on here that are sort of lacking as well
the<00:05:01.260> song<00:05:01.470> am<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.830> not<00:05:02.010> your<00:05:02.190> boy<00:05:02.400> a<00:05:02.730> beautiful

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
the song am I not your boy a beautiful

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.720 
the song am I not your boy a beautiful
tune<00:05:03.660> really<00:05:03.930> great<00:05:04.350> ballad<00:05:04.890> on<00:05:05.040> here<00:05:05.340> but<00:05:05.550> a

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
tune really great ballad on here but a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.610 
tune really great ballad on here but a
song<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> think<00:05:06.750> really<00:05:06.990> could<00:05:07.230> have<00:05:07.410> done

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
song that I think really could have done

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.140 
song that I think really could have done
with<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:08.100> climax

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
with a climax

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.640 
with a climax
there's<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.660> song<00:05:09.900> get<00:05:10.140> up<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.440> already

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
there's the song get up that I already

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.440 
there's the song get up that I already
mentioned<00:05:10.920> that<00:05:11.310> while<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.820> is<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.090> catchiest

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
mentioned that while it is the catchiest

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.660 
mentioned that while it is the catchiest
song<00:05:12.570> on<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:12.990> entire<00:05:13.290> LP<00:05:13.710> maybe<00:05:13.980> because<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
song on the entire LP maybe because the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.110 
song on the entire LP maybe because the
refrain<00:05:15.000> is<00:05:15.290> repeated<00:05:16.290> so<00:05:16.880> liberally<00:05:17.880> but

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
refrain is repeated so liberally but

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.490

that<00:06:10.470> seems<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.890> be<00:06:11.040> written<00:06:11.970> with<00:06:12.360> a<00:06:12.750> mother

in mind and it's sort of confessional in

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.450 
in mind and it's sort of confessional in
a<00:06:15.540> way<00:06:15.690> telling<00:06:16.140> her<00:06:16.230> that<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.590> boy<00:06:16.800> that<00:06:17.190> you

once<00:06:17.760> were<00:06:17.910> is<00:06:18.300> dead<00:06:18.750> now<00:06:18.960> many<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.830> songs

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040

do<00:06:20.430> have<00:06:20.670> gripping<00:06:21.300> nice<00:06:21.840> characteristics

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
do have gripping nice characteristics

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.020 
do have gripping nice characteristics
and<00:06:22.890> I<00:06:22.950> think<00:06:23.190> young<00:06:23.370> fathers<00:06:23.850> have

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
and I think young fathers have

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.300 
and I think young fathers have
maintained<00:06:24.660> their<00:06:24.900> personality<00:06:25.830> over<00:06:26.190> the

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
maintained their personality over the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.010 
maintained their personality over the
course<00:06:26.550> of<00:06:26.730> making<00:06:26.910> this<00:06:27.090> album<00:06:27.630> as<00:06:27.780> well<00:06:27.990> I

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
course of making this album as well I

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.990 
course of making this album as well I
mean<00:06:28.350> there<00:06:28.500> aren't<00:06:28.800> any<00:06:29.010> groups<00:06:29.790> out<00:06:29.970> there

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
mean there aren't any groups out there

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.520 
mean there aren't any groups out there
that<00:06:30.270> I<00:06:30.300> can<00:06:30.480> really<00:06:30.630> name<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:31.020> have<00:06:31.170> a<00:06:31.200> sound

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
that I can really name that have a sound

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.400 
that I can really name that have a sound
quite<00:06:31.890> like<00:06:31.920> young<00:06:32.550> fathers<00:06:33.000> but<00:06:33.480> the<00:06:34.020> biggest

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
quite like young fathers but the biggest

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.410 
quite like young fathers but the biggest
hindrance<00:06:34.860> to<00:06:34.980> this<00:06:35.220> LP<00:06:35.610> is<00:06:35.730> that<00:06:35.910> there's

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
hindrance to this LP is that there's

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.880 
hindrance to this LP is that there's
just<00:06:36.870> not<00:06:37.110> a<00:06:37.350> lot<00:06:37.590> of<00:06:37.620> variation<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.490> these

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
just not a lot of variation to these

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.380 
just not a lot of variation to these
the<00:06:40.010> better<00:06:40.190> sound<00:06:40.520> and<00:06:40.700> the<00:06:40.760> better<00:06:40.910> singing

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
the better sound and the better singing

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.600 
the better sound and the better singing
on<00:06:41.510> this<00:06:41.630> LP<00:06:41.870> do<00:06:42.260> balance<00:06:42.710> out<00:06:42.920> what<00:06:43.250> I<00:06:43.280> don't

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
on this LP do balance out what I don't

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.210 
on this LP do balance out what I don't
like<00:06:43.880> about<00:06:44.150> it<00:06:44.210> in<00:06:44.450> a<00:06:44.600> sense<00:06:44.900> but<00:06:45.200> really<00:06:45.950> dead

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:46.220 
like about it in a sense but really dead

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.010 
like about it in a sense but really dead
is<00:06:46.460> a<00:06:46.490> step<00:06:46.850> down<00:06:47.060> for<00:06:47.300> me<00:06:47.420> in<00:06:47.510> terms<00:06:47.720> of

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
is a step down for me in terms of

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.890 
is a step down for me in terms of
memorability<00:06:48.890> and<00:06:49.450> enjoyability<00:06:50.450> I'm
