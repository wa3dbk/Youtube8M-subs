this<00:00:51.149> gives<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> image<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.960> color<00:00:52.230> scheme<00:00:52.590> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
this gives the image of color scheme so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.590 
this gives the image of color scheme so
that<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.190> more<00:00:53.309> appealing<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.239> also

let's do that press shift a and click
color<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:05.369> color<00:01:05.880> balance<00:01:07.369> now<00:01:09.380> we're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
color and then color balance now we're

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.179 
color and then color balance now we're
going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> move<00:01:11.070> these<00:01:11.280> up<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:14.299> now

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
going to have to move these up a lot now

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.300 
going to have to move these up a lot now
how<00:01:17.189> loads<00:01:17.549> work<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.439> that<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.590> use<00:01:19.920> these

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
how loads work is that we use these

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.260 
how loads work is that we use these
little<00:01:20.640> yellow<00:01:21.000> dots<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:22.220> input<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
little yellow dots as input on the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
little yellow dots as input on the
always<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> left<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> output<00:01:25.890> which<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
always on the left and output which is

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.690 
always on the left and output which is
on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.500> output<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.340> render

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
on the right so the output of the render

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.030 
on the right so the output of the render
layer<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:34.079> basic<00:01:34.500> image<00:01:34.710> we've

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040

areas remain the same so just the two
wheels<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.890> right<00:02:20.180> like<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:26.090> you'll

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
wheels on the right like so you'll

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.690 
wheels on the right like so you'll
notice<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.260> play<00:02:28.500> around<00:02:28.830> with

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
notice that as you play around with

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.759 
notice that as you play around with
these<00:02:29.879> values<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.750> color<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.500> image

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
these values the color of the image

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.720 
these values the color of the image
changes<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.830> careful<00:02:35.190> how<00:02:35.340> much<00:02:35.400> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
changes so be careful how much you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:45.500 
changes so be careful how much you
adjust<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:41.569> think<00:02:42.569> that's<00:02:42.750> fine<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:45.209> next

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
adjust it I think that's fine the next

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.580 
adjust it I think that's fine the next
thing<00:02:45.630> we<00:02:45.780> want<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.049> do<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.500> add<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.670> vignette

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
thing we want to do is add a vignette

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.500 
thing we want to do is add a vignette
list<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.890> darkening<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> edges<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.269> an

image since blender does not have a
specific<00:02:54.060> vignette<00:02:54.810> node<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.769> have<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.040> use<00:02:56.190> a

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
specific vignette node we have to use a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
specific vignette node we have to use a
combination<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:57.030> loads<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:58.230> add<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.440> lens

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
combination of loads so add a lens

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.960 
1 if you connect this to the viewer node
you'll<00:03:12.900> notice<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.459> image<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.790> now

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you'll notice that the image is now

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.080 
you'll notice that the image is now
squished<00:03:15.390> into<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> big<00:03:16.140> oval<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.670> what<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:20.819> want

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
squished into a big oval so what we want

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.809 
squished into a big oval so what we want
is<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.720> oval<00:03:22.260> in<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.590> center<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.700> be

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
is this oval in the center to be

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.690 
is this oval in the center to be
completely<00:03:24.239> transparent<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.859> add<00:03:26.130> a<00:03:26.190> math

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
completely transparent so add a math

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.059 
completely transparent so add a math
mode<00:03:31.489> change<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.910> greater<00:03:33.720> then<00:03:34.069> change

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
mode change it to greater then change

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.949 
mode change it to greater then change
the<00:03:35.220> bottom<00:03:35.609> value<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.299> 1<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:38.269> then<00:03:39.269> connect

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the bottom value to 1 and then connect

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.909 
the bottom value to 1 and then connect
it<00:03:40.079> all<00:03:40.200> nicely<00:03:40.530> oh<00:03:42.109> it<00:03:43.109> change<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.560> bottom

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
it all nicely oh it change the bottom

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.539 
it all nicely oh it change the bottom
value<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.459> not<00:03:44.730> not<00:03:45.359> one<00:03:46.220> it's<00:03:47.220> now<00:03:47.370> you'll

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
value to not not one it's now you'll

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.849 
value to not not one it's now you'll
notice<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:48.150> center<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.750> mostly<00:03:49.109> white<00:03:49.410> which

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
notice the center is mostly white which

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.900 
notice the center is mostly white which
is<00:03:50.010> perfect<00:03:50.459> but<00:03:51.299> vignette<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.900> isn't

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
is perfect but vignette a isn't

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.509 
is perfect but vignette a isn't
perfectly<00:03:53.910> round<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.510> sharp<00:03:54.870> like<00:03:55.109> this<00:03:55.519> so

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
perfectly round and sharp like this so

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.180 
perfectly round and sharp like this so
add<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:57.239> blur<00:03:58.049> node<00:04:00.319> change<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.470> too<00:04:01.590> fast<00:04:01.889> or

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
add a blur node change it too fast or

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.479 
add a blur node change it too fast or
Shin<00:04:02.400> check<00:04:03.239> relative<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.230> change<00:04:05.010> both<00:04:05.280> of

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
Shin check relative and change both of

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.099 
Shin check relative and change both of
these<00:04:05.609> values<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.359> 0.3<00:04:08.450> then<00:04:09.450> reconnect<00:04:09.660> it

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
these values to 0.3 then reconnect it

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.900 
these values to 0.3 then reconnect it
all<00:04:10.260> up<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:11.690> you'll<00:04:12.690> notice<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:14.370> darker

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
all up and you'll notice that the darker

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.089 
all up and you'll notice that the darker
while<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.720> edges<00:04:16.139> are<00:04:16.289> talker<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.979> the

over<00:05:05.400> yet<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:07.020> with<00:05:09.860> next<00:05:10.860> we<00:05:10.980> need

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
over yet and that is with next we need

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.770 
over yet and that is with next we need
to<00:05:11.220> brighten<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.760> image<00:05:11.790> up<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.360> bit<00:05:12.540> since

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
to brighten the image up a bit since

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.410 
to brighten the image up a bit since
it's<00:05:13.020> very<00:05:13.260> dark<00:05:13.530> so<00:05:14.400> add<00:05:14.580> an<00:05:14.790> RGB<00:05:15.180> curve<00:05:15.660> and

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
it's very dark so add an RGB curve and

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.450 
it's very dark so add an RGB curve and
adjust<00:05:18.420> it<00:05:19.070> about<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.310> much<00:05:22.100> make<00:05:23.100> sure<00:05:23.130> you

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
adjust it about that much make sure you

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.130 
adjust it about that much make sure you
connect<00:05:23.820> at<00:05:23.970> each<00:05:24.090> time<00:05:24.420> to<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.690> viewer<00:05:24.930> node

just<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.680> see<00:05:25.890> what<00:05:26.040> you're<00:05:26.220> doing<00:05:28.850> you'll

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
just to see what you're doing you'll

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.700 
just to see what you're doing you'll
notice<00:05:30.270> that<00:05:30.300> this<00:05:30.600> is<00:05:30.780> now<00:05:30.960> very<00:05:31.260> bright

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.840 
compared to what it used to be we needed
like<00:05:34.590> this<00:05:34.830> for<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.400> next<00:05:35.430> step<00:05:37.520> we<00:05:38.520> need<00:05:38.550> to

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
like this for the next step we need to

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.270 
like this for the next step we need to
add<00:05:39.000> some<00:05:39.030> contrast<00:05:39.810> into<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.440> image<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:41.040> add

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
add some contrast into the image so add

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.520 
add some contrast into the image so add
a<00:05:41.640> gamma<00:05:42.000> node<00:05:42.330> not<00:05:42.840> brightness<00:05:43.350> contrast

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
a gamma node not brightness contrast

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.170 
a gamma node not brightness contrast
gamma<00:05:44.780> it's<00:05:45.780> much<00:05:45.960> easier<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:47.240> connect<00:05:48.240> it<00:05:48.360> up

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
gamma it's much easier and connect it up

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.380 
gamma it's much easier and connect it up
change<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.390> gamma<00:05:51.600> value<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.290> 1.2<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.490> you'll

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
change the gamma value to 1.2 and you'll

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.880 
change the gamma value to 1.2 and you'll
notice<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.080> goes<00:05:55.260> dark<00:05:55.650> quite<00:05:56.490> quickly

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
notice that it goes dark quite quickly

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:06.380 
notice that it goes dark quite quickly
slightly<00:05:58.890> but<00:05:59.610> it's<00:06:00.180> noticeable

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.790 

finally<00:06:07.390> we<00:06:07.720> need<00:06:07.870> to<00:06:07.990> add<00:06:08.140> some<00:06:08.560> highlights

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
finally we need to add some highlights

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.700 
finally we need to add some highlights
into<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.430> image<00:06:09.840> just<00:06:10.840> to<00:06:11.020> make<00:06:11.200> it<00:06:11.230> a<00:06:11.440> little

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
into the image just to make it a little

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:23.600 
into the image just to make it a little
bit<00:06:12.100> more<00:06:12.280> attractive<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:14.710> add<00:06:14.980> a<00:06:16.920> glare<00:06:17.920> node

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.010 

now<00:06:24.610> since<00:06:25.600> our<00:06:25.810> image<00:06:26.110> is<00:06:26.260> very<00:06:26.770> dark<00:06:27.900> sort<00:06:28.900> of

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
now since our image is very dark sort of

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.920 
now since our image is very dark sort of
cars<00:06:29.590> very<00:06:29.920> dark<00:06:30.190> anyways<00:06:30.520> we<00:06:31.300> need<00:06:31.450> to<00:06:31.600> change

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
cars very dark anyways we need to change

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.500 
cars very dark anyways we need to change
this<00:06:32.770> threshold<00:06:33.190> value<00:06:33.790> to<00:06:34.530> 0.7<00:06:36.330> now<00:06:37.330> you'll

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
this threshold value to 0.7 now you'll

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.710 
this threshold value to 0.7 now you'll
notice<00:06:37.600> that<00:06:38.230> a<00:06:39.040> whole<00:06:39.310> lot<00:06:39.760> more<00:06:40.030> things<00:06:40.390> are

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
notice that a whole lot more things are

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.000 
notice that a whole lot more things are
brightened<00:06:41.140> up<00:06:41.310> from<00:06:42.310> one<00:06:43.470> where<00:06:44.470> you<00:06:44.830> just

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
brightened up from one where you just

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.370 
brightened up from one where you just
have<00:06:45.160> a<00:06:45.190> little<00:06:45.370> bit<00:06:45.610> there<00:06:45.850> one<00:06:46.600> part<00:06:47.020> they're

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
have a little bit there one part they're

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.500 
have a little bit there one part they're
2<00:06:48.150> 0.7<00:06:49.150> a<00:06:50.070> lot<00:06:51.070> of<00:06:51.190> it<00:06:51.280> as<00:06:51.370> bright<00:06:51.610> but<00:06:52.360> it's

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
2 0.7 a lot of it as bright but it's

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.530 
2 0.7 a lot of it as bright but it's
very<00:06:52.690> noticeable<00:06:53.500> when<00:06:53.950> you<00:06:54.070> have<00:06:54.310> a<00:06:54.610> vertical

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
very noticeable when you have a vertical

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.080 
very noticeable when you have a vertical
and<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.230> horizontal<00:06:56.260> streaks<00:06:57.160> we<00:06:57.610> only<00:06:57.790> want

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
and the horizontal streaks we only want

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.970 
and the horizontal streaks we only want
horizontal<00:06:58.810> because<00:06:59.110> it's<00:06:59.290> more<00:06:59.440> attractive

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
horizontal because it's more attractive

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.760 
horizontal because it's more attractive
but<00:07:00.550> you<00:07:00.670> can<00:07:00.850> play<00:07:01.060> around<00:07:01.180> with<00:07:02.080> however<00:07:02.560> men

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
but you can play around with however men

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.900 
but you can play around with however men
you<00:07:02.860> like<00:07:03.010> so<00:07:03.700> change<00:07:03.910> streaks<00:07:04.450> 22<00:07:05.760> now<00:07:06.760> you'll

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
you like so change streaks 22 now you'll

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.020 
you like so change streaks 22 now you'll
see<00:07:07.120> it<00:07:07.210> looks<00:07:07.420> better<00:07:07.600> with<00:07:08.140> the<00:07:08.290> horizontal

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
see it looks better with the horizontal

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.480 
see it looks better with the horizontal
only<00:07:10.030> and<00:07:10.800> that's<00:07:11.800> it<00:07:12.510> make<00:07:13.510> sure<00:07:13.540> all<00:07:13.990> these
