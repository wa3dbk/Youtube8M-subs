to<00:05:43.060> get<00:05:43.180> rid<00:05:43.360> of<00:05:43.390> still

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
to get rid of still

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.030 
to get rid of still
and<00:05:44.520> a<00:05:44.550> couple<00:05:44.910> of<00:05:44.970> players<00:05:45.150> really<00:05:45.360> Turing<00:05:45.810> it

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
and a couple of players really Turing it

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.330
