00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.410
 a short one to start with 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.120
 introduction 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 it should be remembered that the outbreak 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.260
 of the First World War in 1910 goes 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.760
 to conclude what is coming 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.410
 commonly called belle epoque 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.870
 of the time and in French 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.430
 this name is not chosen at random but comes 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 used to indicate a riding period 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 between the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.590
 nine hundred in which Europe lived a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 period of peace and economic prosperity 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.239
 how come there were styles in this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 period scientific progress flowers 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.290
 greatly and gave birth to the current 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.970
 philosophical positivism that praised 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.350
 science and believed it had 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.049
 now solved the major problems 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.400
 of the human, however, to live the first 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.840
 world war almost broke out a 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.549
 to awaken Europe from a dream 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.700
 showing for science also a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.100
 negative aspect one of the symbols of the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.750
 progress was definitely the neoplasms in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 this period in fact we see the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.090
 birth of the reaction both civil and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.830
 military 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.630
 as indeed during the first war 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.220
 that the planes came to the world 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 first used for war purposes 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.760
 on them were mounted 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.130
 air-cooled fixed machine guns 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.810
 that were operated by the pilot in 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.210
 other cases especially in phases 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 Initials of their military use is the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.750
 place came along the data above the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.970
 enemy trenches and controlled by the pilot 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 while a second passenger launches the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.900
 his enemies and objects of various kinds 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.790
 among the stones to the grave this example 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.590
 the area a single-seater triplane with double 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.390
 fixed and one coaxial machine gun 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.820
 reconstruction of the one led by 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.830
 celebrated manfred von richthofen past 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.270
 to history as a red baron 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.550
 he was probably the most skilled 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.140
 pilot of history as rabat 80 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.909
 abatements against him 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.980
 he died killed in the umpteenth aerial duel 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.659
 fought at a disadvantage because of 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.900
 presence of anti-aircraft artillery 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.119
 enemy but not the progress of science 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.340
 they limited themselves to another reaction 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.349
 the lethal novelty of the time was the use of 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.599
 poisonous gases introduced for the first 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.400
 of the French were then adopted 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.200
 from all the fighting nations one 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.810
 once proved by their potential 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.849
 they were released in conditions 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.650
 favorable wind or thrown through 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.170
 ammunition that launches special monde 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.299
 on the black trenches that you used full 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.489
 hybrid and successor is derivative of the globe 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.959
 this case is not yellowish in color 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.060
 caused an immediate death of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.870
 choking but creating gaps in the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.150
 skin 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.159
 building respirators and sometimes paralysis 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.549
 taking the soldiers from here harmless 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.900
 free whose skin derives the counter 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.610
 these were then often finished 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.549
 killed during the assaults that 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.290
 bass release followed 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.230
 another novelty brought by science 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.420
 this time ballistics were the shrags 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.370
 designed by the English soldier inventor in 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.560
 ricera were a type of ammunition 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.120
 anti-personnel available for cans that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.760
 it was launched above the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.720
 prisons that the malfunction was 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.239
 simple enough 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.769
 the spice had the dual purpose of 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.959
 approaching date was real 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.760
 tenico and to light an internal fuse 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.440
 to it that would have united a second 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.750
 charge placed on the bottom of the bullet 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.370
 which in turn projected an average of 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.319
 different metallic and fragments 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.269
 of the surface of the projectile itself 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.790
 against the enemy with effects easily 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.220
 imaginable but the most characteristic 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.500
 the weapon of this war was certainly the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.269
 life aces up recovery of bass for the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.370
 first time a machine capable of 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.019
 explode an average of 400 projectiles from 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.209
 minute against the enemy takes 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.859
 widely used in a conflict e 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.569
 lady of having hemp with various 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.340
 machine gun versions reaped 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.099
 millions of victims on the various fields of 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.470
 battle between German mg 8 machine of

 eu miter in german to daughter 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.590
 beautiful pal that English were gods 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.239
 best 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.129
 the difference between limits the atc of 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.690
 this generation of their ancestor 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.940
 American was the mechanism that 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.859
 allowed them fire and flurry in the 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.750
 pa which was the energy provided by one 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.299
 lever that was stolen by a soldier 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.919
 that national while in his heirs was 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.109
 the pressure supplied by the gases produced 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.060
 from the explosion of the boss to push 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.250
 back the hammer the part of the weapon 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.720
 responsible for the explosion of the boss e 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.329
 allow a fire completely 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.039
 automatic always in the field of weapons 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.680
 from fire we have the breech - loading rifles 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.510
 mary you the difference of precedents 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.729
 Napoleonic muskets gun 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.470
 muzzle muzzle smooth these weapons 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.789
 became the weapon in various versions 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.830
 of order of all armies 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.050
 they had far more fire rates 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.539
 supported by a stroke in about a minute 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.090
 for muskets, cut up to 10 per minute 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.860
 for rifles reloading this thanks 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.840
 to the internal shipper who allowed to 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.940
 not having to reload him suddenly and to the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.860
 back-up system that through the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.860
 traction of the shutter will allow to 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.390
 recharge the world 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.460
 they also had a lot of precision 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.740
 greater due to the rifled barrel and ai 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.360
 bullets but the aerodynamic profile 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.310
 one of the reasons why the first war 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.530
 world was fought like that of 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.840
 research was indeed widespread use of weapons 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.610
 so powerful and precise the first one 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.260
 conflict fought using rifle a 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.540
 the ruled war was the civil war 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.370
 American during which the labors of 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.650
 cremona then all in and out of fire 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.240
 extremely open field needed 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.820
 with the use of inaccurate guns such as 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.070
 host to canalis caused countless 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.300
 dead and revealed the need for new ones 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.060
 tactics for field battles 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.610
 offer the rifle in the image and mauser 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.270
 g 98 German order rifle with 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.490
 bayonet attached strip loader 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.740
 dulcis in fundo the so-called teng o 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.510
 tank these ridiculous parasites 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.410
 they were used almost exclusively by the 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.030
 allies 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.940
 in fact , Germany only produces them 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.590
 20 were assault transportation vehicles 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.990
 reinforced with thick metal plates 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.030
 in order to protect them from light fire 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.870
 of hand grenades and firearms of 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.240
 small caliber 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.370
 initially they were introduced as 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.900
 means to undermine the enemy barbed wire 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.730
 that was rolled around a 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.410
 rotating cylinder placed in the part 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.660
 front of the channels 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.730
 subsequently having the impact that they 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.080
 they had on the enemy and their chance 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.180
 to cross highly scenario 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.580
 bombed like those of the land of 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.650
 between the two trenches they were precisely 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.750
 armed first with machine guns then to 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.910
 cannons turning them into the weapon from 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.410
 war by definition the most model 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.900
 famous was what I showed 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.370
 the English mark 5 that thanks to his 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.470
 rhomboid shape and now e 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.850
 considerable size was able to 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.710
 overtake the howitzer bouquets e 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.360
 even trenches smashing it 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.970
 enemy deployment without difficulty 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.560
 as already mentioned the German deployment 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.270
 remained behind on this front of 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.890
 berico development since he was forced to 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.110
 focus on finding weapons 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.030
 antitank to combat already numerous 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.400
 French and English armored 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.130
 in this regard the mauser was created 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.140
 13.2 caliber rifle from the caliber 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.500
 enough to break through the armor of the 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.500
 equal
