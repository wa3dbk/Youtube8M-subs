00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
high voltage full metal servo and our

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.639 
high voltage full metal servo and our
orange<00:00:40.929> receiver<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:44.140> cuz<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:44.379> had<00:00:44.530> it

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
orange receiver and just cuz I had it

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.810 
orange receiver and just cuz I had it
laying<00:00:44.890> around<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.399> that<00:00:45.550> was<00:00:45.609> the<00:00:45.699> only

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
laying around and that was the only

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
laying around and that was the only
sensor<00:00:46.449> that<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:46.690> had<00:00:46.899> I'm<00:00:47.350> using<00:00:47.710> one<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.129> my

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
sensor that I had I'm using one of my

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.279 
sensor that I had I'm using one of my
traxxas<00:00:49.989> VXL<00:00:50.800> Valente<00:00:51.550> ons<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:54.370> right<00:00:54.460> so

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
traxxas VXL Valente ons all right so

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.790 
traxxas VXL Valente ons all right so
that<00:00:56.289> server<00:00:56.620> out

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that server out

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.030 
that server out
and<00:00:59.400> get<00:00:59.610> cracking<00:00:59.790> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.150> build<00:01:00.560> so<00:01:01.560> here<00:01:01.860> we

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
and get cracking on the build so here we

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.070 
and get cracking on the build so here we
have<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> mortar<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.300> said<00:01:03.360> we're

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
have the mortar and as I said we're

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.630 
have the mortar and as I said we're
gonna<00:01:04.170> start<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:04.770> lead<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.370> I'm<00:01:05.460> gonna

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
gonna start it on the lead so I'm gonna

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.630 
gonna start it on the lead so I'm gonna
do<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.090> gonna<00:01:06.510> connect<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.190> sensor<00:01:08.190> wire

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
do here is gonna connect the sensor wire

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.420 
do here is gonna connect the sensor wire
make<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> easier<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:09.840> once<00:01:10.800> it's<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.160> stabbed

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
make it easier for once it's all stabbed

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
make it easier for once it's all stabbed
into<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> chassis<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.830> gonna<00:01:13.830> push<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
into the chassis just gonna push it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.750 
into the chassis just gonna push it
through<00:01:15.410> so<00:01:16.410> and<00:01:16.560> add<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> screws<00:01:17.190> in<00:01:17.340> opinion

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
through so and add the screws in opinion

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.400 
through so and add the screws in opinion
off-camera<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.360> save<00:01:18.750> us<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:18.930> little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
off-camera that save us a little bit of

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.960 
off-camera that save us a little bit of
time<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.950> yeah<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.460> forget<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> thread

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
time but yeah don't forget the thread

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.649 
time but yeah don't forget the thread
lock<00:01:21.150> those<00:01:21.330> screws

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
lock those screws

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
lock those screws
all<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.079> we're<00:01:25.229> back<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.829> screws<00:01:26.789> are

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
all right so we're back the screws are

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.669 
all right so we're back the screws are
install<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.420> motor<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.810> well<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.140> opinion

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
install for the motor as well as opinion

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.069 
install for the motor as well as opinion
so<00:01:29.640> everything<00:01:29.969> is<00:01:30.090> smooth<00:01:30.539> there's<00:01:30.929> no

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
so everything is smooth there's no

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:39.620 
so everything is smooth there's no
binding<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:35.429> servo<00:01:38.179> so<00:01:39.179> fish

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
binding so now on to the servo so fish

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
binding so now on to the servo so fish
our<00:01:39.780> wires<00:01:40.020> through<00:01:40.140> make<00:01:40.740> sure<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.159> got

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
our wires through make sure we got

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.889 
our wires through make sure we got
clearance<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.000> pinched<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.420> between<00:01:42.719> any

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
clearance or not pinched in between any

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:51.069 
clearance or not pinched in between any
belts<00:01:43.610> stab<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.819> servo<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:49.039> we<00:01:50.039> have

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
belts stab the servo in here and we have

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:58.309 
belts stab the servo in here and we have
two<00:01:52.079> screws<00:01:53.840> get<00:01:54.840> those<00:01:55.109> into<00:01:55.409> place<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:57.319> and

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
two screws get those into place here and

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.289 
two screws get those into place here and
yeah<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.890> mentioned<00:01:59.340> yet<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.700> really<00:02:00.119> like

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
yeah I have mentioned yet I really like

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.240 
yeah I have mentioned yet I really like
that<00:02:00.479> look<00:02:00.539> at<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.989> see<00:02:01.319> why<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> servo

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that look at that see why a servo

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.179 
that look at that see why a servo
first<00:02:03.209> all<00:02:03.509> I'm<00:02:04.049> sure<00:02:04.319> what<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.679> have<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
first all I'm sure what I have like that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.940 
first all I'm sure what I have like that
so<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.939> think<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> fits<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.959> car<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.770> well

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so I think it fits the car just well

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.660 
so I think it fits the car just well
stands<00:02:08.459> out<00:02:08.670> nice<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:10.769> if<00:02:11.250> I'm<00:02:11.370> not<00:02:11.400> here

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
stands out nice and if I'm not here

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
stands out nice and if I'm not here
these<00:02:11.819> guys<00:02:12.030> are<00:02:12.090> lightning<00:02:12.840> fast<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.470> we'll

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
these guys are lightning fast so we'll

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.789 
these guys are lightning fast so we'll
see<00:02:16.400> all<00:02:17.400> right<00:02:17.579> so<00:02:18.000> we're<00:02:18.629> secure<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:22.590> I'm

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
see all right so we're secure now I'm

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.650 
see all right so we're secure now I'm
just<00:02:22.950> gonna<00:02:23.069> connect<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.579> servo<00:02:23.970> horn<00:02:24.090> which

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
just gonna connect the servo horn which

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.500 
just gonna connect the servo horn which
is<00:02:24.930> directly<00:02:25.769> connected<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.510> steering

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
is directly connected to the steering

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.059 
is directly connected to the steering
rod<00:02:29.000> no<00:02:30.380> worry<00:02:31.380> about<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.709> screw<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.040> that

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
rod no worry about the screw in that

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.550 
rod no worry about the screw in that
later<00:02:32.430> first<00:02:33.060> you're<00:02:33.329> gonna<00:02:33.600> fish<00:02:33.959> oh<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.470> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
later first you're gonna fish oh it's a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.420 
later first you're gonna fish oh it's a
sensor<00:02:34.980> wire<00:02:37.310> connect<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.760> V<00:02:39.090> excel

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
sensor wire connect that to the V excel

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.009 
sensor wire connect that to the V excel
in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.609> long<00:02:41.760> I'll<00:02:42.000> probably<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.389> different

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
in the long I'll probably be different

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.990 
in the long I'll probably be different
centered<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:44.579> think<00:02:44.819> there's<00:02:44.940> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
centered you see I think there's a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.910 
centered you see I think there's a
little<00:02:45.120> bit<00:02:45.209> overkill<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:45.959> for<00:02:46.650> now<00:02:46.769> that's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
little bit overkill but for now that's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.319 
little bit overkill but for now that's
all<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.190> had<00:02:47.430> for<00:02:47.459> censored<00:02:49.069> okay<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.130> find<00:02:51.120> nice

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
all I had for censored okay so find nice

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.080 
all I had for censored okay so find nice
little<00:02:51.630> spots<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.290> use<00:02:53.280> two<00:02:53.489> sided<00:02:53.730> tape<00:02:53.910> to

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
little spots and use two sided tape to

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.289 
little spots and use two sided tape to
stick<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.450> there<00:02:57.349> alright<00:02:58.349> so<00:02:59.269> you<00:03:00.269> see

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
stick that there alright so you see

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.360 
stick that there alright so you see
secure<00:03:01.260> there's<00:03:01.590> gonna<00:03:01.739> connect<00:03:02.099> everything

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
secure there's gonna connect everything

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
forget those Dean's connected one of my

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.089 
forget those Dean's connected one of my
old<00:04:09.569> trail<00:04:09.870> batteries<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.500> she's<00:04:10.889> a<00:04:10.920> little

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
old trail batteries so she's a little

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.270 
old trail batteries so she's a little
rough<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:12.109> mean<00:04:13.109> so<00:04:13.760> turn<00:04:14.760> on<00:04:14.909> the<00:04:15.120> AC

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
rough I mean so turn on the AC

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:26.980 
rough I mean so turn on the AC
good<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:21.919> looks<00:04:22.919> pretty<00:04:23.100> quick

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.400 

she'll<00:04:27.770> do<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.039> trick<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.280> sure<00:04:29.259> better<00:04:30.259> than

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
she'll do the trick for sure better than

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.060 
she'll do the trick for sure better than
what<00:04:30.530> was<00:04:30.680> in<00:04:30.860> there<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:33.020> as<00:04:33.229> expected
