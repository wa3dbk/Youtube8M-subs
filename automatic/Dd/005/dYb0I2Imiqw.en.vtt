00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hi everyone, I'm a professional that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.379
 people are going to make a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.690
 two classic examples are not of 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.360
 numerical expression the comparisons well 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.570
 simple it is for you to recalls by 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.570
 example, they will get two thirds less 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.130
 sometimes 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.280
 three bedrooms 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.970
 more 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.970
 the mei 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.110
 then the operation is the teacher's 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 first in a numeric expression 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 power and hynes have power no 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.500
 Then there are those who multiply and divide 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.610
 has multiplication division has these two 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.309
 are here multiplication in the then solve 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.730
 resolving multiplication two months 36 to 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.370
 34 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:06.149
 are 12 x original game - with more or 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.960
 less and it was there that I repeat that 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.960
 one more half 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.090
 12 and 6 12 and a half and now that I 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.210
 I do 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.980
 In that case, there, who was more 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.050
 smartass can think six months is a 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.250
 But that was not quite the case. 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.350
 than show 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 but in this case I could take a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:37.080
 minimum multiple with gold or mc between 12 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:46.690
 and 21 years between 12 and 21 years gives for two 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:48.369
 not 16 na for 2 3 a 1 and gives for 3 gives one e 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.440
 gives a multiple multiple with a 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:58.150
 multiplication of cousins ​​2 times two 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:04.810
 are 44 times three are 12 place 12 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:07.000
 2 becomes the final number 12 of 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.280
 - is here and now I do that process 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.790
 video divided by the bottom 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:22.030
 multiply up 12 by 2 to 1 16 6 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:26.440
 12 for 2 of the 66 times 16 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.250
 and then how do I do low cooperation? 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.440
 from below 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.410
 right 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.590
 and make a turn up these attacks 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.630
 are the six negatives with six positives 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.770
 from zero, that is, if you take two 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.360
 thirds if you make at least two-thirds 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.630
 negative times three quarters plus one 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.590
 means the answer of 02 in both that is the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.590
 answer to 0 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.500
 Who pulls life is all this for the most 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.330
 this is the process property blank 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.620
 expression of the first power and 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.500
 roots is easy 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.080
 after multiplication and division after 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.070
 sum subtraction here we made first 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.920
 multiplication 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:19.880
 then we'll just take it just to be 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:26.500
 another example - 16 squared 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.500
 it's not another third 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.620
 times - me 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.760
 in this character of bridge times 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.500
 Good, then, first, I have power. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.780
 more time here 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.750
 looks at the negative basis of a pair dispute 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:53.430
 or squares is one of those 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:58.160
 1 giving a correct two months 24 clothes 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:02.580
 that I did in the law gives four 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.680
 come on, you need it on 122 the fourth 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.620
 14 low sprint negative for more and 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.660
 then the rest the remaining mp could 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.560
 do it right here could have a 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.269
 multiplication in the sequence I will not do 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.010
 huh 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.260
 so come on I have a sum one 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.700
 multiplication who first solved the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.020
 multi-pressure 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.350
 one of these 113 times two 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.520
 are six original game multiplication 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.560
 has more with less gives - and there 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.220
 the offense subtraction have to take 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.930
 my mother whom 6 in room did not take one 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.319
 boy between six and four - year 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.520
 cousins that in two three five and seven are 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.389
 the main 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:56.789
 as one who gives for two of 14 4 per 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:05:02.069
 2 to 2 to 6 also in 6/2 to 3 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:05.159
 who gives for two still 2/2 of 13 as 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:08.819
 not the team for 3 1 in the Andradas daum 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.979
 ends and bill met on the day because 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:16.050
 still three of Portugal's three 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:18.889
 one and give 22 44 times 3 12 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.919
 so now the denominator space a being 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:29.159
 instead of four and six were 12 here 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:32.849
 12 min ok let's process video of 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:40.169
 low multiplies by 5 12/4 3 3 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:45.270
 times 13 12/6 22 months 12 response from 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:50.159
 I repeat repeat 12/3 positive eyeliner 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:53.060
 with two negatives 3 - 2 11 12 years 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.719
 this exercise response recalls 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.610
 property of the expression in america 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.810
 first solve the signs I do not 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.759
 I put an example with signs 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.780
 mathematician with the relative queens and 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.060
 brackets would need another video 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.240
 but in this case the priority here is 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.920
 solve the root power first in this 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.850
 first had not resolved first 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.960
 who to multiply are then to solve 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.780
 just a subtraction 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.870
 in this example, the jet does not have 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.570
 who power solved power 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.419
 I then resolved the multiplication left over 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.690
 a subtraction of infractions and then I 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.960
 I solved personal beauty until the next 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.960
 video
