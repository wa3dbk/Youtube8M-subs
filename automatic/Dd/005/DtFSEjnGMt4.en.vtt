going<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> bring<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> flow<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.270> like

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
going to bring the flow down like

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.600 
going to bring the flow down like
30-something<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.540> now<00:02:03.540> paint<00:02:03.840> across<00:02:04.610> look

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
30-something and now paint across look

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.240 
30-something and now paint across look
at<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> difference<00:02:07.250> basically

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
at that see the difference basically

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.669 
at that see the difference basically
what's<00:02:08.459> happening<00:02:08.550> within<00:02:09.149> Photoshop<00:02:09.679> when

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679

what's happening within Photoshop when
you<00:02:10.860> bring<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.760> flow<00:02:12.090> that's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
you bring down the flow that's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.380 
you bring down the flow that's
how<00:02:12.870> much<00:02:13.080> ink<00:02:13.349> or<00:02:13.739> paint<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.550> coming<00:02:15.209> out<00:02:15.360> of

away<00:02:51.739> but<00:02:52.739> if<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.430> change<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.420> something

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
away but if I change this to something

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.770 
away but if I change this to something
other<00:02:54.959> than<00:02:55.110> white<00:02:55.319> let's<00:02:55.530> say<00:02:55.650> gray<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.880> I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
other than white let's say gray and I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.539 
other than white let's say gray and I
painted<00:02:58.200> look<00:02:59.040> what<00:02:59.190> happens<00:03:01.099> it's<00:03:02.099> gray<00:03:02.489> so

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
painted look what happens it's gray so

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.870 
painted look what happens it's gray so
you're<00:03:03.030> raised<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.599> between<00:03:04.170> white<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.470> black

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
you're raised in between white and black

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.900 
you're raised in between white and black
so<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.090> given<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.510> transparency<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.430> blue

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
so it's given a transparency of the blue

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.710 
so it's given a transparency of the blue
okay<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.230> makes<00:03:10.260> sense<00:03:10.440> I'm<00:03:10.890> painting

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
okay that makes sense I'm painting

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.180 
okay that makes sense I'm painting
