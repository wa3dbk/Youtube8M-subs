00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
today we take a look at violin riffs

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.450 
today we take a look at violin riffs
volume<00:00:11.840> 160<00:00:12.840> plus<00:00:13.020> authentic<00:00:13.680> violin<00:00:14.160> loops

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
volume 160 plus authentic violin loops

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
volume 160 plus authentic violin loops
now<00:00:15.240> I've<00:00:15.360> loaded<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> different<00:00:16.139> loop<00:00:16.289> banks

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
now I've loaded the different loop banks

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.770 
now I've loaded the different loop banks
into<00:00:16.830> Ableton<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.610> and<00:00:18.270> we'll<00:00:18.390> go<00:00:18.510> ahead<00:00:18.600> and

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
into Ableton here and we'll go ahead and

00:00:18.780 --> 00:01:19.899 
into Ableton here and we'll go ahead and
get<00:00:18.900> started<00:00:19.020> previewing<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.130> these

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.820 

now<00:01:20.909> I'll<00:01:21.060> load<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.509> reason<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
now I'll load it up reason and a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.040 
now I'll load it up reason and a
sequence<00:01:23.250> start<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.610> quick<00:01:23.880> drum<00:01:24.210> loop<00:01:24.420> just

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
sequence start a quick drum loop just

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.469 
sequence start a quick drum loop just
something<00:01:25.440> basic<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.580> pulled<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.090> dr.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
something basic and I pulled up the dr.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.300 
something basic and I pulled up the dr.
rex<00:01:27.690> engine<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.320> loaded<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> Rex

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
rex engine and loaded up one of the Rex

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
rex engine and loaded up one of the Rex
two<00:01:29.640> files<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.330> come<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.660> our<00:01:30.810> download<00:01:31.289> um

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
two files that come with our download um

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.609 
two files that come with our download um
here's<00:01:32.310> playback<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.030> loop

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.010 

so<00:01:40.619> essentially<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.310> dr.<00:01:41.670> rex<00:01:42.020> resamples

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so essentially the dr. rex resamples

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
so essentially the dr. rex resamples
that<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.409> puts<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.800> in<00:01:43.950> slices<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.940> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that and puts it in slices for you and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.570 
that and puts it in slices for you and
lays<00:01:45.569> them<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.050> your<00:01:46.200> keyboard<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
lays them out on your keyboard so you

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.149 
lays them out on your keyboard so you
can<00:01:47.850> retrigger<00:01:48.330> them<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.899> any<00:01:49.619> fashion<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
can retrigger them in any fashion that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.520 
can retrigger them in any fashion that
you'd<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.539> here<00:01:51.750> are<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.899> individual

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you'd like so here are the individual

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.960 
you'd like so here are the individual
slices<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:59.190> we're<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.489> go<00:01:59.640> ahead<00:01:59.849> and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
slices so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.029 
slices so we're going to go ahead and
use<00:02:00.149> those<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.750> play<00:02:01.349> around<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.770> create

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
use those and play around and create

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.820 
use those and play around and create
some<00:02:02.220> different<00:02:02.399> variations<00:02:03.590> playing<00:02:04.590> back

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
some different variations playing back

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:58.690 
some different variations playing back
with<00:02:05.039> this<00:02:05.190> drum<00:02:05.489> loop

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.070 

so<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.790> can<00:02:59.940> see<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.270> can<00:03:00.420> create<00:03:00.690> some<00:03:00.840> pretty

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
so you can see we can create some pretty

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.800 
so you can see we can create some pretty
cool<00:03:01.290> variations<00:03:02.090> now<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> did<00:03:03.390> record

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
cool variations now I did record

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.090 
cool variations now I did record
something<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:06.150> over<00:03:06.450> here<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> I'll<00:03:07.950> go

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
something and it's over here so I'll go

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.900 
something and it's over here so I'll go
ahead<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.340> drag<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.820> over<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.490> gonna<00:03:11.610> put

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
ahead and drag it over and I'm gonna put

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.160 
ahead and drag it over and I'm gonna put
it<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.090> my<00:03:12.210> loop<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:12.840> I'm<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:12.960> gonna

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.490 
it in my loop here so I'm just gonna
delete<00:03:13.410> those<00:03:13.710> drums<00:03:14.960> and<00:03:15.960> drag<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.380> over
