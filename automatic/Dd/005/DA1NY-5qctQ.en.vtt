mistaken it should be called flying see
when<00:00:24.939> it<00:00:25.029> makes<00:00:25.150> its<00:00:25.300> way<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:25.509> the<00:00:25.689> TCG<00:00:26.349> it's

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
when it makes its way to the TCG it's

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.400 
when it makes its way to the TCG it's
from<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.400> same<00:00:27.580> family<00:00:28.090> as<00:00:28.119> Maxie<00:00:28.930> and<00:00:29.200> black

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
from the same family as Maxie and black

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.050 
from the same family as Maxie and black
shiny<00:00:29.650> see<00:00:29.950> so<00:00:30.130> obviously<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.610> monsters<00:00:30.939> are

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
shiny see so obviously the monsters are

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.000 
shiny see so obviously the monsters are
all<00:00:31.090> seeing<00:00:31.509> their<00:00:31.750> name<00:00:31.930> you<00:00:32.439> know<00:00:32.560> anyways

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
all seeing their name you know anyways

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.479 
all seeing their name you know anyways
so<00:00:33.460> I<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:34.270> monster<00:00:34.540> has<00:00:35.230> big-time<00:00:35.920> potential

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
so I this monster has big-time potential

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.580 
so I this monster has big-time potential
written<00:00:36.850> all<00:00:37.060> over<00:00:37.390> it<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.989> think<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.440> this

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
written all over it I think that this

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.350 
written all over it I think that this
card<00:00:38.890> is<00:00:39.100> not<00:00:39.220> going<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.399> be<00:00:39.520> a<00:00:39.550> good<00:00:39.880> or<00:00:40.120> great

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
card is not going to be a good or great

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.060 
card is not going to be a good or great
option<00:00:40.899> in<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.110> side<00:00:41.290> deck<00:00:41.530> I<00:00:41.649> think<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:42.040> is

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
option in the side deck I think it is

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.549 
option in the side deck I think it is
going<00:00:42.399> to<00:00:42.579> be<00:00:42.610> an<00:00:42.790> amazing<00:00:43.210> option<00:00:43.899> I<00:00:44.050> think

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
going to be an amazing option I think

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.080 
going to be an amazing option I think
that<00:00:44.739> this<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:44.920> going<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.219> be<00:00:45.340> one<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.640> best

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
that this is going to be one of the best

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.600 
that this is going to be one of the best
side<00:00:46.809> deck<00:00:47.140> potential<00:00:47.980> cards<00:00:48.310> that<00:00:48.490> we've
