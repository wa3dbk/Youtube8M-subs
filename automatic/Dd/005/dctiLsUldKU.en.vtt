gibberish basically what it is is it's

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.130 
gibberish basically what it is is it's
just<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.150> words<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.720> are<00:02:21.780> scrambled

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
just it's just words that are scrambled

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.569 
just it's just words that are scrambled
up<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.319> letters<00:02:22.650> insider<00:02:22.950> scrambled<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.459> so

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
up the letters insider scrambled up so

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.250 
up the letters insider scrambled up so
you<00:02:23.640> have<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.819> figure<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.659> each<00:02:24.810> clue<00:02:25.079> is

hard<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.019> find<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.500> strongboxes<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.879> you<00:03:05.939> may

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
hard to find the strongboxes so you may

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.229 
hard to find the strongboxes so you may
have<00:03:06.599> deciding<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.349> need<00:03:07.500> help<00:03:07.709> after<00:03:07.920> all<00:03:08.239> so

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
have deciding you need help after all so

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.360 
have deciding you need help after all so
there<00:03:09.689> it<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.810> folks<00:03:10.049> let's<00:03:10.290> get<00:03:10.709> started<00:03:11.129> so

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
there it is folks let's get started so

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.069 
there it is folks let's get started so
the<00:03:11.519> first<00:03:11.670> key<00:03:11.879> is<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.269> key<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.569> power<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
the first key is the key of power and

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.199 
the first key is the key of power and
again<00:03:13.470> have<00:03:13.590> already<00:03:13.889> decoded<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.670> this

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
again have already decoded this this

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.259 
again have already decoded this this
page<00:03:15.480> what<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.930> says<00:03:16.139> is<00:03:16.489> beside<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.849> river

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
page what this says is beside the river

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.159 
page what this says is beside the river
that<00:03:18.599> flows<00:03:19.019> through<00:03:19.319> whiterun<00:03:20.569> so<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.930> read

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
that flows through whiterun so I read

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.629 
that flows through whiterun so I read
that<00:03:22.319> I<00:03:22.379> said<00:03:22.650> okay<00:03:23.129> so<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.430> probably

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
that I said okay so it's probably

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.610 
that I said okay so it's probably
talking<00:03:23.940> about<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.169> know<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.410> water

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
talking about the the you know the water

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.069 
talking about the the you know the water
the<00:03:25.889> little<00:03:26.099> river<00:03:26.250> things<00:03:27.000> are<00:03:27.299> around<00:03:27.569> right

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
the little river things are around right

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.659 
the little river things are around right
whiterun<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.949> I<00:03:28.980> went<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> top<00:03:29.639> of

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
whiterun so I went to the top of

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.789 
whiterun so I went to the top of
Whiterun<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.359> went<00:03:30.690> over<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.019> dragons<00:03:31.500> reach<00:03:31.650> I

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
Whiterun I went over to dragons reach I

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:32.930 
Whiterun I went over to dragons reach I
looked<00:03:32.010> around<00:03:32.129> you<00:03:32.400> see<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.579> checked<00:03:32.849> around

looked around you see I checked around
these<00:03:33.239> areas<00:03:33.480> looking<00:03:33.870> for<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.139> key<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.560> looked

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
these areas looking for the key I looked

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.039 
these areas looking for the key I looked
around<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.760> area<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.150> went<00:03:36.480> up<00:03:36.569> there<00:03:36.599> and

around this area I went up there and

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.990 
around this area I went up there and
eventually<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.980> did<00:03:38.190> remember<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.819> there's

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
eventually I did remember that there's

we<00:03:43.199> are<00:03:43.379> going<00:03:43.409> to<00:03:43.829> locate<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> first<00:03:44.669> key<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
we are going to locate the first key the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.300 
we are going to locate the first key the
key<00:03:45.449> of<00:03:45.629> power<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.319> let's<00:03:46.440> get<00:03:46.650> over<00:03:46.680> here<00:03:47.159> and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
key of power so let's get over here and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.640 
key of power so let's get over here and
i<00:03:47.790> will<00:03:48.000> pick<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.299> up<00:03:48.540> right<00:03:48.959> now<00:03:49.229> you<00:03:49.290> see

i will pick that up right now you see

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.830 
i will pick that up right now you see
there<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:50.159> is<00:03:50.190> over<00:03:50.549> here<00:03:50.849> each<00:03:51.209> key<00:03:51.599> is

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
there it is over here each key is

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
there it is over here each key is
resting<00:03:52.319> on<00:03:52.500> another<00:03:52.889> book<00:03:53.159> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.489> seven

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
resting on another book of the seven

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.309 
resting on another book of the seven
keys<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.389> don't<00:03:54.599> need<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.840> collect

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
keys now you don't need to collect

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.479 
keys now you don't need to collect
though<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.739> books<00:03:55.919> or<00:03:56.069> anything<00:03:56.220> they're

though the books or anything they're

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.849 
though the books or anything they're
just<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.699> same<00:03:56.940> as<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> initial<00:03:57.359> one<00:03:57.659> I<00:03:58.199> think

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
just the same as the initial one I think

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.229 
just the same as the initial one I think
they're<00:03:59.010> just<00:03:59.040> there<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.370> make<00:03:59.489> things<00:03:59.760> look<00:04:00.090> a

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
they're just there to make things look a

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.869 
they're just there to make things look a
little<00:04:00.449> bit<00:04:00.659> more<00:04:00.810> visible<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:02.310> after<00:04:02.699> that<00:04:02.819> we

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
little bit more visible so after that we

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.849 
little bit more visible so after that we
have<00:04:03.239> gotten<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> key<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.139> power<00:04:04.409> so<00:04:04.829> that

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
have gotten the key of power so that

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.229 
have gotten the key of power so that
marks<00:04:05.250> are<00:04:05.370> our<00:04:05.519> first<00:04:05.760> little<00:04:05.909> checkpoint

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
marks are our first little checkpoint

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.899 
marks are our first little checkpoint
