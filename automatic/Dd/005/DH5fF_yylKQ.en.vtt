00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
it's about an inch thick and then we're

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.590 
it's about an inch thick and then we're
going<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.549> split<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:00.879> into<00:01:01.059> three<00:01:01.390> sections

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
going to split that into three sections

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.869

gathering from each side you start off

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.050 
gathering from each side you start off
by<00:01:08.380> putting<00:01:08.560> just<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.950> normal<00:01:09.310> foot<00:01:09.609> brain<00:01:09.880> in

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
there and instead of putting this but

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.080 
there and instead of putting this but
part<00:01:13.509> over<00:01:13.869> you<00:01:14.680> drop<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.909> gather

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.050 
yeah it's called really nice you can see
we're<00:01:57.040> just<00:01:57.190> going<00:01:57.430> all<00:01:57.580> they<00:01:57.759> were<00:01:57.820> on<00:01:57.940> the

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
we're just going all they were on the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.430 
we're just going all they were on the
top<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.570> head<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.960> want<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.290> go

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
top of the head so you want it to go

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.469 
top of the head so you want it to go
around<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> top<00:02:00.009> because<00:02:00.790> if<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.210> have<00:02:01.360> it

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
around the top because if you have it

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.120 
around the top because if you have it
too<00:02:01.630> low<00:02:01.899> it's<00:02:02.259> not<00:02:02.410> you're<00:02:02.740> not<00:02:02.770> going<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.039> get

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
too low it's not you're not going to get

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.130 
too low it's not you're not going to get
the<00:02:03.280> more<00:02:03.429> dramatic<00:02:03.550> effect<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.869> want<00:02:05.020> to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
the more dramatic effect you want to

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.660 
the more dramatic effect you want to
come<00:02:05.259> drop<00:02:05.560> from<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.890> crowd<00:02:06.130> almost<00:02:06.490> down

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
come drop from the crowd almost down

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.249 
come drop from the crowd almost down
like<00:02:06.850> this<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.600> want<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> braid<00:02:08.019> to<00:02:08.170> go

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
like this so you want the braid to go

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.419 
like this so you want the braid to go
all<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.470> way<00:02:08.560> around<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.830> top<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> head

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
all the way around the top of the head

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.040 
all the way around the top of the head
almost<00:02:09.640> with<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.360> head<00:02:10.539> curves<00:02:10.810> off

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
almost with it the head curves off

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.290 
almost with it the head curves off
because<00:02:11.830> if<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.100> have<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.370> too<00:02:12.519> low<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.120> not

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
because if you have it too low it's not

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.309 
because if you have it too low it's not
you're<00:02:13.600> not<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.930> get<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.140> more

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
you're not going to get the more

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.320 
you're not going to get the more
dramatic<00:02:14.440> effect<00:02:15.160> right<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:15.970> now<00:02:16.090> we're<00:02:16.239> at

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
effect is this hyper placket this is a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.759 
effect is this hyper placket this is a
lot<00:02:29.590> more<00:02:29.739> softer<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.940> lot<00:02:31.120> more<00:02:31.769> loser

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
lot more softer it's a lot more loser

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:33.810 
lot more softer it's a lot more loser
the<00:02:32.920> other<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.310> one<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.459> we<00:02:33.579> did<00:02:33.730> in

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
the other one the one that we did in

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.670 
the other one the one that we did in
Dubai<00:02:34.090> was<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.329> lot<00:02:34.540> more<00:02:34.570> bolder<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.110> stronger
