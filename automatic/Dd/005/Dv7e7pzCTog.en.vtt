00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.270 

so<00:00:15.740> we've<00:00:15.889> completed<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.550> repair

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
so we've completed the repair

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.550 
so we've completed the repair
the<00:00:17.400> cluster<00:00:17.790> we<00:00:18.780> haven't<00:00:19.020> connected<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.440> our

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the cluster we haven't connected to our

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.880 
the cluster we haven't connected to our
test<00:00:19.770> harness<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.340> we'll<00:00:20.520> turn<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.790> power<00:00:20.940> on

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
test harness and we'll turn the power on

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.980 
test harness and we'll turn the power on
what<00:00:22.890> we're<00:00:23.010> looking<00:00:23.280> for<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.760> all<00:00:24.420> segments

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
what we're looking for is all segments

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.770 
what we're looking for is all segments
on<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.200> cluster<00:00:25.940> to<00:00:26.940> turn<00:00:27.120> on<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.630> first

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:27.780 
on the cluster to turn on for the first

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.580 
on the cluster to turn on for the first
two<00:00:27.960> seconds<00:00:28.350> during<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> lamp<00:00:28.920> test<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
two seconds during the lamp test and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.460 
two seconds during the lamp test and
then<00:00:32.390> gradually<00:00:33.390> they<00:00:33.690> turn<00:00:33.870> themselves<00:00:34.050> off

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
then gradually they turn themselves off

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.030 
then gradually they turn themselves off
and<00:00:35.330> display<00:00:36.330> the<00:00:36.900> static<00:00:37.290> display<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.739> see

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and display the static display you see

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.810 
and display the static display you see
here<00:00:39.080> some<00:00:40.080> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.290> numbers<00:00:41.270> like<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.510> one

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.970 

don't<00:00:47.820> display<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.540> seven<00:00:49.110> segments<00:00:49.620> they

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
don't display all seven segments they

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.189 
don't display all seven segments they
only<00:00:50.190> display<00:00:50.580> six<00:00:50.879> segments<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.570> that's

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
only display six segments and that's

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
only display six segments and that's
because<00:00:52.470> this<00:00:52.830> digit<00:00:53.220> only<00:00:53.519> needs<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> display

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
because this digit only needs to display

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.049 
because this digit only needs to display
a<00:00:54.540> one<00:00:55.320> or<00:00:55.589> a<00:00:55.650> two<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.960> also<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.350> case

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
a one or a two this is also the case

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:08.140 
a one or a two this is also the case
here<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.650> here

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.130 

next<00:01:09.150> we'll<00:01:09.300> test<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> function<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.050> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
next we'll test the function of the

next we'll test the function of the
