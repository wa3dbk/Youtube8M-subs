well<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.220> design<00:00:31.490> of<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.760> Hercules<00:00:31.939> arose

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
well the design of the Hercules arose

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.090 
well the design of the Hercules arose
out<00:00:32.660> of<00:00:32.720> experience<00:00:33.380> in<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.680> Korean<00:00:34.070> War

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
out of experience in the Korean War

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.549

turned<00:00:34.970> out<00:00:35.210> that<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.540> aircraft<00:00:35.930> being<00:00:36.260> used

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
turned out that the aircraft being used

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.600 
turned out that the aircraft being used
to<00:00:36.770> fly<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:38.050> troops<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:39.379> supplies<00:00:39.739> in<00:00:40.250> Korea

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.950 
to fly the troops and supplies in Korea
weren't<00:00:40.910> adequate<00:00:41.360> to<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.510> needs<00:00:41.809> of

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
weren't adequate to the needs of

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.460 
weren't adequate to the needs of

1951 the American government issued for
a<00:00:48.440> bigger<00:00:49.030> productive<00:00:50.030> aircraft<00:00:50.449> use<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.140> that

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
a bigger productive aircraft use in that

world first flight of the Hercules came

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.380 
world first flight of the Hercules came
quite<00:00:54.650> quickly<00:00:54.980> after<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.820> design<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.210> think

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
quite quickly after the design I think

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.660 
quite quickly after the design I think
been<00:00:56.720> about<00:00:56.930> two<00:00:57.230> years<00:00:57.470> from<00:00:57.800> acceptance<00:00:58.430> of

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
been about two years from acceptance of

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.509 
been about two years from acceptance of
the<00:00:59.000> specification<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.769> first<00:01:01.129> flight

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.389 

the<00:01:06.990> aircraft<00:01:07.289> was<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.560> successful<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.250> its

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
the aircraft was very successful in its

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.429 
the aircraft was very successful in its

modification<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.430> required<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.450> think

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
modification was required and I think

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
modification was required and I think

quickest ways of getting the aircraft

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.559 
quickest ways of getting the aircraft
needed<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> buy<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:32.789> aircraft<00:01:33.000> off<00:01:33.390> the

so that sort of biggles aspect of it

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.259 
so that sort of biggles aspect of it
disappeared<00:03:55.949> it<00:03:56.489> became<00:03:56.730> much<00:03:57.000> more
