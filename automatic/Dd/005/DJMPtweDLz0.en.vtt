little<00:01:49.170> hard<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> squeeze<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.159> that's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
little hard to squeeze and that's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.710 
little hard to squeeze and that's
something<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.880> noticed<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> lot

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
something that I noticed that not a lot

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.649 
something that I noticed that not a lot
of<00:01:51.780> shampoos<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.149> brands

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
of shampoos is that some of the brands

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
of shampoos is that some of the brands
will<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.530> their<00:01:55.710> shampoos<00:01:56.159> when

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460

with<00:01:58.920> super<00:01:59.430> hard<00:02:00.500> bottles<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.430> hard

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
of stuff I honestly I was just looking

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.839 
of stuff I honestly I was just looking
whoa

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
whoa

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.610 
whoa
something<00:03:28.599> I<00:03:28.659> will<00:03:28.810> say<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.199> it<00:03:29.440> adds

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
something I will say is that it adds

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.159 
something I will say is that it adds
volume<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.669> it<00:03:30.909> doesn't<00:03:31.239> repair<00:03:31.629> but<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.870> think

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
volume and it doesn't repair but I think

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.069 
volume and it doesn't repair but I think
it<00:03:32.319> prevents<00:03:32.739> damage<00:03:32.949> it<00:03:33.400> has<00:03:33.810> 350<00:03:34.810> milligrams

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
it prevents damage it has 350 milligrams

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.020 
it prevents damage it has 350 milligrams
which<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:36.069> me<00:03:36.959> milligrams<00:03:37.959> or<00:03:38.199> milliliters

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
which is me milligrams or milliliters

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.559 
which is me milligrams or milliliters
milliliters<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.629> he<00:03:40.840> has<00:03:41.019> 12<00:03:41.819> ounces<00:03:42.819> so<00:03:43.329> this

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
milliliters and he has 12 ounces so this

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.240 
milliliters and he has 12 ounces so this
