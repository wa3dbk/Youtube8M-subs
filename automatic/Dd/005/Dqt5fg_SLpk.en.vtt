 And , folks, good night, calm down, I'm 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.799
 here again making a video 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.630
 After a long time, it's no pleasure for anyone 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 Do not know me, Julius. 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.839
 It's okay, I came to do something a little bit today. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 different personnel should're mad at me 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.980
 No, I always come with something. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.270
 different but this time I got carried away 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.490
 playing this game I really liked the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.779
 game it's been a while already 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.430
 delaying posting a video I wanted 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.199
 see if that's what I was going to do 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.570
 as we are I entered the game 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.550
 to enter and stop and make a video there 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.340
 only this one is still here I 'm 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.149

 I'm from Clan use marketing has 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 There is this here in this game for those who do not 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.489
 knows you have three clans if you enter one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.289
 different club you can not enter the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.620
 my covenant is my guild 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.129
 society, whatever you want 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 to call 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.660
 I'm the max, okay, I'll explain some 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 basic things that some people have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.549
 asked me is my first server 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.570
 incredible as it may seem, it 's training until one 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.010
 little clear that helped me and also 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 some people left early then 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.020
 This has contributed to the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 position that I am today in the ranking of ok 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.299
 server is new does think in two 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.640
 weeks that they threw something 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.900
 So I 'll explain today about 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.340
 basic refinements 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.939
 there are people who still do not know how 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.710
 refine i will not do tutorial today 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.270
 teaching to start an account 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.579
 I'll do it for those who do not know. 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.119
 interest is to continue to follow the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.890
 channel 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.840
 but today I'm going to explain about 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.729
 basic refinements that had some 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.500
 people ask me my 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.220
 teachings are not yet fully 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.610
 It's right this is because I need silver 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.740
 What is this buck here to power? 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.750
 do the right refinement and something that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.009
 I need more money than silver 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.119
 with other things and ends up forgetting 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.060
 refinement 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.149
 but I'll explain anyway 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.540
 correct the basics in case you and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.269
 refine there are four classifications if 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.969
 here in the game of ninjas who are unfair 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:23.200
 along the South team 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:25.629
 gain judgment and graccho that I do not know if 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.349
 it exists in the design're in the game there 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.540
 which are is in case in court to be together 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.730
 they are known as the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.510
 assailants there stay in half guard there 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.260
 in this position here in the training are 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.170
 Those 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.569
 I'll stay here together the beginning. 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.129
 here the hooks that are 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.889
 support and killed guy in case here it is 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.230
 the avant-garde which is great other than 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:57.250
 could it be renata and such and others 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:01.599
 Finally I will explain how refining is the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.370
 the best attributes to fortify 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.540
 will enter here have this option here 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.250
 refine touch explaining then no 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.459
 are very sure but I'll explain the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.359
 The correct form is, for example, my 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:20.159
 first doll that ninjutsu is then 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:24.639
 basic basic ninjutsu refinement is the 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:28.000
 strength more agility of the item clothes that 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.040
 they are three refinements and you can 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.629
 put an additional there or even 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.329
 you set 2 and may vary depending on 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.579
 of your need the basics is the strength 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.349
 more agility and will help a lot 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.479
 force will increase your attack 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.040
 defense and the ability to 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.319
 speed to start by attacking the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.500
 first you can vary too 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.090
 critical and energy that is life is 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.500
 increase the life of your doll depending 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.780
 their need us is going to die 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.150
 very easy and such 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.849
 ok you refine for example force and 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.129
 agility is here if I do not have 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.010
 silver to stay showing more by 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.319
 example this button refine this standard 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.090
 here it will cost me 48 thousand dishes because 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.060
 these red clothes the other them 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.000
 cost a little cheaper is a 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.879
 little or much cheaper or click 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.739
 refine will appear here other options 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.250
 in the case of refinement may appear 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.800
 chakra critical block rate and I do not know 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.810
 a lot of thing you're refining 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.280
 until you find what you are looking for in 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.680
 in case you force 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.740
 reality when you find you will 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.690
 push replace that will be here 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.860
 if you are not meeting if you 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.230
 click here appeared another one that does not have 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.820
 nothing to see you will tighten ignore the 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.740
 option below will have ignore option 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.169
 ignores and continues until you find 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.820
 What you're looking for replaces you, okay? 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.220
 all you leave is in the case strength and 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.380
 agility may vary, I also leave the 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.630
 times the critical rate that helps 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.850
 this one is wrong blow rate I do not 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.530
 I would have to get is that as 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.610
 Spend a lot of money, you do not have to talk. 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.800
 left beauty CASS saci to be 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.290
 together the team together would also be in the 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.410
 assault is the same thing you go 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.030
 increase in the case of agility and strength and 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.370
 this clothes she has available 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.380
 of three attributes 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.419
 I left a blocking fee because it was 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.340
 Difficult to find the agility strength I have 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.770
 what to pack but is that story the Ka 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.070
 silver then I left it like this but the right one 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.110
 would this be the case here agility force 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.560
 and critical rate could also be 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:37.750
 agility, strength and energy, okay, it 's the 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:41.290
 same thing as ninjutsu giving support 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.530
 every support needs to let the touch that 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.710
 in case it will increase the special attack 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.710
 and the special defense that are the attacks 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.020
 special case will increase the 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.050
 power and such 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.039
 so you have to have all support tried 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.470
 chakra 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.880
 there will depend a little on the other that goes 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.870
 depending on agility is very good because 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.150
 he will attack first so it is good pro 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.030
 damage in the critical case would also be good 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.000
 It's because it has an attribute of its own 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.100
 his every special taxi he 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.860
 increases a critical rate 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.870
 only as it does not have that history of the 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.690
 so silver is a bit refined 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.390
 wrong, I have to do it, but it's 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:30.090
 chakra and agility the basics can 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:33.310
 put some other things over 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.610
 face and also support the same thing 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:40.040
 gaia vanguard at the forefront you will 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.560
 The basic thing is or dodge the lock 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.970
 I depend on your character there in 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.900
 front and the energy that is life in the 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.140
 OK 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.790
 also in strength because it forces 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.150
 increases defense attack as it stands there 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:59.300
 in front he will need to have defense're 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.340
 and life, but the main thing is 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.740
 example gaiga and it has a levy of iva 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.630
 high his main attack increases 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.590
 dodge or you will strengthen more 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.590
 the avoidance 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.530
 hence I advise dodging and 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.630
 energy and back here and I wrote 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.970
 I let lock too but it was was better 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.700
 let energy dodge 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.980
 if it was a renata case and the screen is 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.010
 better in the lock then you would leave 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.650
 blockade and energy understood 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.300
 also put the lock and force it on 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.620
 example understood why it will help 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.560
 also 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.630
 Okay if anything 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.180
 Good, I hope you have. 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.100
 understood if they did not understand chance of 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.420
 You joke asks below that 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.590
 I try to explain in the best way 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.320
 possible 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.940
 a big hug who wants to play and 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.710
 I had some questions about the game can 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.600
 ask me what I'm going to try 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:54.100
 respond in the best way 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.100
 already the staff good night
