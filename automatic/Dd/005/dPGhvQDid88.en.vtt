00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.530

I usually only put mascara on my lower

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.990 
I usually only put mascara on my lower
lashes<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.320> not<00:05:30.500> my<00:05:30.650> top<00:05:30.920> ones<00:05:31.220> because<00:05:31.880> I'm

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
lashes and not my top ones because I'm

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:48.750

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.480 

so<00:05:49.390> that's<00:05:49.570> what<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:49.840> looks<00:05:49.990> like<00:05:50.170> now<00:05:50.410> I<00:05:53.490> think

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
so that's what it looks like now I think

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.040 
so that's what it looks like now I think
it<00:05:54.580> looks<00:05:54.760> like<00:05:54.910> a<00:05:54.940> really<00:05:55.210> pretty<00:05:55.540> daytime

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
it looks like a really pretty daytime

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.440 
it looks like a really pretty daytime
look<00:05:56.290> but<00:05:56.590> if<00:05:57.370> you<00:05:57.490> guys<00:05:57.670> like<00:05:57.910> to<00:05:57.940> put<00:05:58.240> a<00:05:58.300> bit

look but if you guys like to put a bit
of<00:05:58.480> shadow<00:05:58.900> on<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.230> lower<00:05:59.590> lashes<00:06:00.010> which<00:06:00.910> is

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
of shadow on the lower lashes which is

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.770 
of shadow on the lower lashes which is
like<00:06:01.270> into<00:06:01.690> like<00:06:01.870> doing<00:06:02.320> then<00:06:03.280> you<00:06:03.970> can<00:06:04.540> take

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
like into like doing then you can take

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.270 
like into like doing then you can take
the<00:06:05.290> Maybelline<00:06:05.950> enchanted<00:06:06.820> forest<00:06:08.280> what

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
the Maybelline enchanted forest what

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:20.930 
the Maybelline enchanted forest what
again<00:06:12.990> taking<00:06:13.990> just<00:06:14.260> that<00:06:14.410> last<00:06:14.710> color<00:06:15.160> there

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:32.839 

and<00:06:21.940> just<00:06:22.180> lining<00:06:22.570> it

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:41.899 

I<00:06:38.449> find<00:06:39.449> that<00:06:39.569> this<00:06:40.529> makes<00:06:40.830> I<00:06:41.099> not<00:06:41.490> look<00:06:41.639> as

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
I find that this makes I not look as

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.059 
I find that this makes I not look as
slanted<00:06:42.689> so<00:06:43.169> it<00:06:43.289> doesn't<00:06:43.589> kind<00:06:43.740> of<00:06:43.860> look<00:06:44.039> like

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
slanted so it doesn't kind of look like

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.499 
slanted so it doesn't kind of look like
that<00:06:44.279> and<00:06:45.089> it<00:06:45.719> looks<00:06:45.959> more<00:06:47.300> horizontal<00:06:48.300> like

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
that and it looks more horizontal like

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.459 
that and it looks more horizontal like
that<00:06:49.039> so<00:06:50.039> I<00:06:50.729> quite<00:06:51.209> like<00:06:51.449> doing<00:06:51.839> that<00:06:52.020> whether

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
that so I quite like doing that whether

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:56.119 
that so I quite like doing that whether
it<00:06:52.649> stays<00:06:52.770> hard<00:06:53.159> more<00:06:53.339> night<00:06:54.559> okay<00:06:55.559> so<00:06:55.619> this<00:06:55.949> is

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.129 
it stays hard more night okay so this is

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:01.219
