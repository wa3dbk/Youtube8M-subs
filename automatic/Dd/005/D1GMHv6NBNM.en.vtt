also<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> he<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.579> ya

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
also is he going to be going for ya

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.760 
also is he going to be going for ya
going<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> ten<00:01:00.420> gateway<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.559> means

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
going for a ten gateway so that means

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
going for a ten gateway so that means
that<00:01:01.890> he<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.430> fact<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:03.000> getting<00:01:03.449> any

here the Gateway now being warped in and
we'll<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.110> used

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
we'll see how this is going to be used

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
very very early game bill taking a look

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.039 
very very early game bill taking a look
at<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.000> drones<00:02:00.329> right<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.689> we're<00:02:00.869> currently

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
at the drones right now we're currently

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.039 
at the drones right now we're currently
sitting<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.530> 14<00:02:02.100> drones<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:03.000> sorry<00:02:03.270> 14<00:02:03.689> probes

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
sitting on 14 drones or sorry 14 probes

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.550 
sitting on 14 drones or sorry 14 probes
14<00:02:04.530> workers<00:02:04.920> as<00:02:05.509> that<00:02:06.509> zealot<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:06.990> moves<00:02:07.320> out

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
14 workers as that zealot now moves out

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
14 workers as that zealot now moves out
so<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.950> single<00:02:08.340> zealot<00:02:08.700> moving<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.539> heading

I'm gonna call him to get us around on
all<00:03:00.260> these<00:03:00.530> units<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:00.920> these<00:03:01.070> zealots<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.550> a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
all these units and these zealots and a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.660 
all these units and these zealots and a
probe<00:03:02.030> can<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.660> very<00:03:02.960> very<00:03:03.230> short<00:03:03.650> life<00:03:04.520> as

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
probe can have a very very short life as

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.160 
probe can have a very very short life as
they<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:04.880> taken<00:03:05.120> down<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:05.660> those<00:03:05.870> Earthlings

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
they get taken down so those Earthlings

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.020 
they get taken down so those Earthlings
quickly<00:03:07.040> taking<00:03:07.340> down<00:03:07.460> those<00:03:07.580> units<00:03:07.850> they<00:03:07.910> can

quickly taking down those units they can

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.000 
quickly taking down those units they can

liquid nails gold definitely a little

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.309 
liquid nails gold definitely a little
bit<00:06:10.129> behind<00:06:10.279> in<00:06:10.789> terms<00:06:11.360> of<00:06:11.569> the<00:06:11.690> economic<00:06:11.810> play

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 
bit behind in terms of the economic play

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.959 
bit behind in terms of the economic play
we'll<00:06:12.500> see<00:06:12.650> if<00:06:12.830> he<00:06:13.009> will<00:06:13.219> be<00:06:13.279> able<00:06:13.400> to<00:06:13.639> win<00:06:13.849> this

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:13.969 
we'll see if he will be able to win this

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:15.730 
we'll see if he will be able to win this
game<00:06:14.060> with<00:06:14.360> tech<00:06:14.599> as<00:06:14.750> those<00:06:15.199> immortals<00:06:15.680> are

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
game with tech as those immortals are

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.680 
game with tech as those immortals are
going<00:06:15.889> to<00:06:15.979> be<00:06:16.069> fairly<00:06:16.370> strong<00:06:16.759> also<00:06:17.089> quadruple

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
going to be fairly strong also quadruple

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.709 
going to be fairly strong also quadruple
gateway<00:06:18.050> so<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.949> four<00:06:19.219> gateways<00:06:19.719> currently

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
gateway so the four gateways currently

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.050 
gateway so the four gateways currently
up<00:06:20.870> and<00:06:21.050> running<00:06:21.409> we'll<00:06:21.800> see<00:06:21.979> how<00:06:22.009> those<00:06:22.520> how

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
up and running we'll see how those how

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.490 
up and running we'll see how those how
that<00:06:23.270> cool<00:06:23.479> down<00:06:23.599> is<00:06:23.629> going<00:06:23.810> to<00:06:23.870> be<00:06:23.960> used<00:06:24.199> so<00:06:24.379> we

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
that cool down is going to be used so we

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.040 
that cool down is going to be used so we
have<00:06:24.650> what<00:06:24.860> for<00:06:25.190> three<00:06:26.060> centuries<00:06:26.300> a<00:06:26.569> couple

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
have what for three centuries a couple

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.499 
have what for three centuries a couple
immortals<00:06:27.500> more<00:06:27.800> gateways<00:06:28.339> as<00:06:28.819> more<00:06:29.210> zealots

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
immortals more gateways as more zealots

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.360 
immortals more gateways as more zealots
now<00:06:29.659> being<00:06:29.900> warped<00:06:30.169> in<00:06:30.349> a<00:06:30.529> single<00:06:30.830> stalker<00:06:31.129> as

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
now being warped in a single stalker as

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.760 
now being warped in a single stalker as
well<00:06:31.610> so<00:06:32.270> but<00:06:32.539> no<00:06:32.719> weapons<00:06:33.229> upgrade<00:06:33.589> yeah

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
well so but no weapons upgrade yeah

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.499 
well so but no weapons upgrade yeah
taking<00:06:34.039> a<00:06:34.099> look<00:06:34.250> at<00:06:34.310> the<00:06:34.399> unit<00:06:34.669> count<00:06:34.849> there<00:06:35.419> it

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
taking a look at the unit count there it

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:36.969 
taking a look at the unit count there it
is<00:06:35.539> serving<00:06:36.080> quickly<00:06:36.349> getting<00:06:36.529> taken<00:06:36.860> out

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979 
is serving quickly getting taken out

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.439 
is serving quickly getting taken out
we're<00:06:37.370> going<00:06:37.459> to<00:06:37.550> have<00:06:37.639> a<00:06:37.699> little<00:06:38.089> bit

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
we're going to have a little bit

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.239 
we're going to have a little bit
of<00:06:38.569> a<00:06:38.689> flank<00:06:39.080> here<00:06:39.349> that's<00:06:39.919> going<00:06:40.099> to<00:06:40.159> be

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 
of a flank here that's going to be

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.189 
of a flank here that's going to be
really<00:06:40.430> really<00:06:40.580> bad<00:06:40.969> positioning<00:06:41.659> you<00:06:42.050> will

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
really really bad positioning you will

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.869 
really really bad positioning you will
see<00:06:42.319> no<00:06:42.499> we<00:06:42.979> have<00:06:43.159> liquid<00:06:43.400> now<00:06:43.490> school<00:06:43.699> already

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:43.879 
see no we have liquid now school already

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.850 
see no we have liquid now school already
coming<00:06:44.180> up<00:06:44.419> and<00:06:44.599> quickly<00:06:45.259> seem<00:06:45.620> that<00:06:45.740> those

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
coming up and quickly seem that those

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.860 
coming up and quickly seem that those
butchers<00:06:46.069> are<00:06:46.309> there<00:06:46.490> what<00:06:47.180> did<00:06:47.479> he<00:06:47.509> shoot

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
butchers are there what did he shoot

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.079 
butchers are there what did he shoot
down<00:06:48.080> his<00:06:48.259> own<00:06:48.499> he<00:06:49.490> shot<00:06:49.699> down<00:06:49.759> his<00:06:50.059> own
