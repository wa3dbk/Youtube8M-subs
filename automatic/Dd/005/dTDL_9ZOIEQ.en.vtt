kind of struggling with penalties

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.450 
kind of struggling with penalties

haven't gone from anything to something
it'd<00:02:36.569> be<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> little<00:02:36.989> bit<00:02:37.080> too<00:02:37.200> easy<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.620> keep

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
it'd be a little bit too easy if I keep

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.410 
it'd be a little bit too easy if I keep
open<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.160> packs<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.640> I'm<00:02:38.700> building<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.209> teams

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
open in packs and I'm building the teams

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.970 
open in packs and I'm building the teams
of<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.930> know<00:02:40.019> top<00:02:40.260> players<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.800> so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
of like you know top players in it so

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.559 
of like you know top players in it so
that's<00:02:41.610> kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:41.940> where<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:42.209> going<00:02:42.420> with<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
that's kind of where I'm going with a

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.600 
that's kind of where I'm going with a
series<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.140> here<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.440> almost<00:02:43.709> almost<00:02:44.430> scored

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
series but here it almost almost scored

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.960 
series but here it almost almost scored
and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.970 
and
we<00:02:45.120> actually<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.560> replay<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.860> is

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
we actually have a replay and this is

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.340 
we actually have a replay and this is
where<00:02:47.160> sometimes<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.269> actual<00:02:48.600> system<00:02:49.050> messes

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
where sometimes the actual system messes

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.509 
where sometimes the actual system messes
up<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.769> time<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.160> actually<00:02:50.370> quite

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
up but this time it's actually quite

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.860 
up but this time it's actually quite
good<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:50.910> thought<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> looked<00:02:51.269> quite<00:02:51.390> quite

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
good and I thought it looked quite quite

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.120 
good and I thought it looked quite quite
cool<00:02:52.080> stuff<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.530> didn't<00:02:52.680> clear<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.950> so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
cool stuff what I didn't clear it so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.440 
cool stuff what I didn't clear it so
there's<00:02:53.310> no<00:02:53.430> goal<00:02:53.670> as<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.150> can<00:02:54.239> see<00:02:54.299> there

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
there's no goal as you can see there

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.780 
there's no goal as you can see there

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
got the ball done exactly the same thing

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.470 
got the ball done exactly the same thing
and<00:03:25.829> I<00:03:26.220> was<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.519> kneeled<00:03:26.730> down<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.209> game

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
and I was for kneeled down and this game

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.020 
and I was for kneeled down and this game
was<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.100> deceiving<00:03:29.100> because<00:03:29.250> at<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.000> end

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
was so deceiving because at the end

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.050 
was so deceiving because at the end
you'd<00:03:30.660> look<00:03:31.620> at<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.859> stats<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.609> default<00:03:32.910> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
you'd look at the stats you default that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.390 
you'd look at the stats you default that
the<00:03:33.299> school<00:03:33.630> line<00:03:33.959> would<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.230> been<00:03:34.350> equal<00:03:34.709> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the school line would have been equal it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.190 
the school line would have been equal it
was<00:03:35.519> actually<00:03:35.880> ridiculous<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:36.450> here<00:03:36.660> Musa

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
was actually ridiculous but here Musa

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.039 
was actually ridiculous but here Musa
and<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.560> dum<00:03:38.250> Bo<00:03:38.430> are<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.570> guys<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
struggle with the most if I come up

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.259 
struggle with the most if I come up
against<00:03:41.340> Ronaldo<00:03:41.760> Messi<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.120> they<00:03:42.209> do

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
against Ronaldo Messi and they do

against Ronaldo Messi and they do
something<00:03:42.570> good<00:03:42.660> against<00:03:42.870> me<00:03:43.019> I'm<00:03:43.079> like<00:03:43.230> yes

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850

little bit there for you we pretty much
had<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.900> same<00:03:55.140> shots<00:03:55.440> on-target<00:03:56.540> obviously

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
had the same shots on-target obviously

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.000 
had the same shots on-target obviously
you<00:03:57.810> know<00:03:57.930> he's<00:03:58.109> more<00:03:58.319> clinical<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.829> stuff

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
you know he's more clinical and stuff

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.849 
you know he's more clinical and stuff
and<00:03:59.720> yeah<00:04:00.720> obviously<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.170> deserve<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.739> lose

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
and yeah obviously I deserve to lose

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.380 
and yeah obviously I deserve to lose
that<00:04:01.980> game<00:04:02.130> toward<00:04:02.400> my<00:04:02.519> defense<00:04:02.850> was<00:04:03.030> not<00:04:03.060> good

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
that game toward my defense was not good

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.420 
that game toward my defense was not good
enough<00:04:03.569> but<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.410> very<00:04:04.560> very<00:04:04.829> frustrating

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
enough but it's very very frustrating

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.130 
enough but it's very very frustrating
that<00:04:05.519> game<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.760> first<00:04:05.940> game<00:04:06.359> I<00:04:06.690> used<00:04:06.989> my

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
that game the first game I used my

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.229 
that game the first game I used my
Bundesliga<00:04:07.680> team<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.130> believe<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:08.940> was

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
Bundesliga team I believe so I was

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.580 
Bundesliga team I believe so I was
thinking<00:04:09.540> maybe<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:09.900> my<00:04:09.989> Bundesliga<00:04:10.440> team

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
thinking maybe it's my Bundesliga team

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.110 
thinking maybe it's my Bundesliga team
maybe<00:04:10.950> it's<00:04:11.190> really<00:04:11.430> bad<00:04:11.549> but<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:11.940> me

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
maybe it's really bad but that's just me

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.110 
maybe it's really bad but that's just me
pointing<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.600> finger<00:04:12.870> at<00:04:12.900> something<00:04:13.319> else

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120

16 episode 17 have been recorded by me

16 episode 17 have been recorded by me
already<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:49.470> really<00:04:49.920> up<00:04:50.010> my<00:04:50.130> game<00:04:50.280> if<00:04:50.490> for

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
already and I really up my game if for

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.250 
already and I really up my game if for
the<00:04:51.060> first<00:04:51.090> time<00:04:51.510> in<00:04:51.600> a<00:04:51.660> couple<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.930> weeks<00:04:52.080> I

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
the first time in a couple of weeks I

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.960 
the first time in a couple of weeks I
felt<00:04:52.560> like<00:04:52.740> I've<00:04:53.070> actually<00:04:53.430> made<00:04:53.730> a

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
felt like I've actually made a

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.490 
felt like I've actually made a
difference<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.480> my<00:04:54.600> game<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.230> seems<00:04:55.410> like

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
difference to my game and it seems like

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.860 
difference to my game and it seems like
a<00:04:55.530> weird<00:04:55.710> thing<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.980> say<00:04:56.100> but<00:04:56.430> I've<00:04:56.880> been

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
a weird thing to say but I've been

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.690 
a weird thing to say but I've been
passing<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.530> lot<00:04:58.650> better<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.250> this<00:04:59.460> year<00:04:59.640> I

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
passing a lot better and this year I

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.070 
passing a lot better and this year I
thought<00:04:59.880> dribbling<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.450> sprinting<00:05:00.960> and

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
thought dribbling and sprinting and

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.840 
thought dribbling and sprinting and
speed<00:05:01.290> was<00:05:01.470> everything<00:05:01.830> which<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.550> kind<00:05:02.730> of

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
speed was everything which it kind of

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.660 
speed was everything which it kind of
still<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:03.360> but<00:05:03.960> passing<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.770> also<00:05:05.220> very<00:05:05.550> very

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
still is but passing is also very very

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.010 
still is but passing is also very very
important<00:05:06.300> you've<00:05:06.420> got<00:05:06.540> to<00:05:06.600> pass<00:05:06.780> quite

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
important you've got to pass quite

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.470 
important you've got to pass quite

seem<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.110> score<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.380> lot<00:05:19.470> more<00:05:19.680> goals<00:05:19.890> with

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
seem to score a lot more goals with

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.310 
seem to score a lot more goals with
member<00:05:20.520> bar<00:05:20.700> then<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.210> would<00:05:21.390> with<00:05:21.570> Emenike<00:05:22.080> and

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
member bar then I would with Emenike and

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.110 
member bar then I would with Emenike and
because<00:05:22.890> we<00:05:23.010> won<00:05:23.130> that<00:05:23.280> game<00:05:23.370> we<00:05:23.550> do<00:05:23.670> open<00:05:23.910> free

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
because we won that game we do open free

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.050 
because we won that game we do open free
times<00:05:24.510> 7.5<00:05:25.290> k-pax<00:05:26.010> which<00:05:26.190> takes<00:05:26.460> us<00:05:26.640> almost

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
times 7.5 k-pax which takes us almost

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.180 
times 7.5 k-pax which takes us almost
down<00:05:27.660> to<00:05:27.690> I<00:05:28.410> think<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:28.710> takes<00:05:28.830> us<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.040> one

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
down to I think it takes us to one

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.350 
down to I think it takes us to one
hundred<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.430> fifty<00:05:29.670> five<00:05:29.790> points<00:05:30.120> which<00:05:30.240> is

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360
