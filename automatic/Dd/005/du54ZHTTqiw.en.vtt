00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
rule of thumb bigger is always a little

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
rule of thumb bigger is always a little
bit<00:01:14.670> better<00:01:14.970> than<00:01:15.390> too<00:01:15.659> small<00:01:15.690> okay<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.799> those

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
