reversal<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.420> critical<00:00:57.829> just

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
reversal we think that's critical just

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.330 
reversal we think that's critical just
the<00:00:58.980> first<00:00:59.309> part<00:00:59.789> of<00:01:00.030> zone<00:01:00.660> motion<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.949> we're<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the first part of zone motion is we're a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.490 
the first part of zone motion is we're a
big<00:01:02.609> believer<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.149> trying<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> attack<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
big believer in trying to attack the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800 
big believer in trying to attack the
short<00:01:04.799> corner<00:01:05.100> area<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> people

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
short corner area like a lot of people

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.830 
short corner area like a lot of people
are<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> continuity<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
are so we have a continuity that's just

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.609 
are so we have a continuity that's just
a<00:01:09.960> base<00:01:10.229> movement<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:11.310> moves<00:01:11.580> our<00:01:11.790> 4<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.270> 5

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
a base movement that moves our 4 and 5

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.080 
a base movement that moves our 4 and 5
because<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> short<00:01:14.729> corner

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because we think that the short corner

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.280 
because we think that the short corner
area<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.110> about<00:01:16.229> Oh<00:01:16.680> 10<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> 12<00:01:17.909> feet

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
area which is about Oh 10 to 12 feet

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.960 
area which is about Oh 10 to 12 feet

lower<00:01:23.970> than<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> block<00:01:24.630> area<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> great

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
lower than the block area is a great

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
lower than the block area is a great
angle<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.000> step<00:01:27.390> through<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.780> score<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.470> also
