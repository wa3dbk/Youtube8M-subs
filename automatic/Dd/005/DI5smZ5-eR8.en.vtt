00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.839
 here's your gentlemen another unboxing a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.030
 I'll explain why now 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.070
 someone who saw my others 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.750
 video will be saying it's already done mambo 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.630
 xing than the Turkish kenan 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.640
 poor shit boxing so I though 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.550
 I wanted to waste a few words not so much for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.090
 this boxing but for what it looks like a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.960
 rma product and what a rma product is 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.399
 a regenerated product ie we say that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.020
 one user any person is gone 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.190
 in a computer store and has it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 asked and there are various forms of both legal 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
 that illegal let us talk about some good 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.289
 some forms I hear on this computer 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 a dual core pentium etc. and so on 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 seem valid a little bit makes me a little 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.000
 discount on another product you have 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.410
 you and me buy it discounted polish or 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.449
 some people instead give their own 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.370
 notice that it doesn't work to do it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.030
 repair some of these 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.950
 subsequently they resell it is the for 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.470
 fairness should should have 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.689
 written rma but private people am 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.220
 saying or other companies for some 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.330
 other reason they repair the hard disks e 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.700
 let's say they resell these hard 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.830
 disk is a digital western 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 let's say we open it I'll show you 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.369
 another thing that there are in the products 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.600
 of a 3 but not in all products 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.900
 you will find this north dr rma almost 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
 you can always find it in products instead 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.780
 let's say you buy them for the first one 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.159
 time let's say first but it was n't 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.400
 regenerated everything else is not 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.229
 you will find is we say that that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.030
 sachet where there are those species of 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.890
 salt balls of the saves milita in 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:56.450
 often in these products are found 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:59.360
 in fact they are now we are going to open 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.759
 now as usual in mine 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.819
 in my boxing I have to scream put the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.440
 gloves there will be what I repeat those 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.849
 when i do unboxing it comes here 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.220
 always in mind then that the comes 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.330
 picky nor on duty and says me kiki 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:23.250
 how many electrostatic cells tafaj h care 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.599
 here it is in western digital 320 giga 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.110
 a sack aa 16 16 may grow 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:35.129
 size is being viewed is 3.5 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.010
 an interface here it was one thing 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.250
 which seems strange to me that maybe it happened 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.700
 a small mistake on the site and for six 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.739
 gigabytes but this model does not suit me 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.080
 sorry the interruption was discharged 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.810
 the battery had a dead battery 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.730
 we are saying this model is there 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.040
 written by six gigabytes even though I did 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.390
 looks like three but does nothing is not 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.670
 this is the same problem 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:08.209
 rpm speeds are rpm 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.159
 7.200 a buffer says of 16 May a 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.360
 transfer reit transfer remains of 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.849
 transfer is 126 mega maximum like 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.500
 it says on the site we say nominal 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.940
 now let's talk about the temperatures of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.810
 operations are among the among the 0 60 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.120
 degrees 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.330
 so it automatically doesn't work anymore 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.610
 from minus 40 and over 70 degrees it consumes only 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.150
 66 matteo sings on stand by instead 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:46.680
 consumes only and exclusively 0 70 watts 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:50.849
 now in the end buy a material 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.849
 let's say rm has regenerated yes or no do it 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.140
 know you in your comments though 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.370
 network stuffings is good because there 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.709
 I must say the truth yes it is always true 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.610
 I hope you are seeing it especially 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.819
 from the sides we see that it was that it was 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.720
 used you see also I think for here to 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.450
 these blows let's say about welding 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.840
 forced I think it was also 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.940
 sent this just this component 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.150
 in a white room 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.910
 here I think it was sent 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.729
 even in a clean room definitely band 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.860
 for a recovery for a recovery 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.699
 important didactics were inside 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.590
 why send such a component 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.090
 in the white room I tell you the truth that it is 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.110
 even a friend more or less happened 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:48.300
 prices range from 500 to 700 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:51.030
 euro you say but you paid hard drive 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.620
 beach is like second hand 32 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:59.130
 new euro will cost 50 because 500 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.840
 euro now dc I'll explain the room 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.100
 white we say that as if they were the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.880
 camera of the photographers 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.210
 we say so with a particular light 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.940
 of particular machinery details 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.380
 try to recover inside the disks 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.639
 which is found in the internal disks 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.669
 magnets that are inside 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:20.669
 try to recover all the data 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.530
 this technique was let's say this 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.050
 technical this type of technology is 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.430
 also used by perhaps our own 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:33.240
 forces say police carabinieri 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:36.930
 finance and all the others we say 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.780
 find all the possible data that they are 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.840
 within one of ours 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.419
 hard disk and I repeat I think it is 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.030
 this was done for big points 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.250
 let's say let's say for 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.950
 this species as you are seeing of re 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.260
 threading and welding on plastic and 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.270
 iron and steel 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.120
 now I would like to know your opinion 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.800
 instead what do you think about buying a 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.900
 rma product 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:09.540
 I repeat it is not is not a product 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.980
 sold second hand but it is a product 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.070
 which we say was damaged 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.440
 had a problem was repaired by 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.660
 a company that does just that 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.910
 work and then resold that 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.710
 later we say as if it were a 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.290
 like new I don't know 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.970
 tell me what you think if it's good 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.260
 don't buy let's say rma products 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.250
 I thank you again for your time 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.720
 you have dedicated 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.640
 if you want to jump on others

 my two channels that you will find them both in 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.530
 description and is in the information in the 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.200
 channel
