00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello there was often such a fishing 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.290
 when you have to show it without directly 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.380
 happens due to the clasps and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.929
 habits scares fish careful when catching 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.750
 some kind of peaceful fish or crossbar 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.310
 ultralight gear 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.699
 it is just necessary to write without but 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.810
 directly fishing line braided cords now 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.550
 show one node which I use 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.359
 I don't usually know his name, but I think 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.369
 can someone come in handy here we take 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:39.000
 just the load for the year is displayed on 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:47.070
 this moment is wicker layer cuckoo 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:52.379
 loops once and ln 2 1 again this 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.309
 hole we got a loop here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.550
 such delaying it's up to the size 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.430
 such and diesel centimeter diameter 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.479
 vessels was further convenient to work 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:13.130
 now this remaining tip is wrapped 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:17.360
 around the main braid case this is 1 5 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.360
 maximum 6 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.579
 wrapped 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.649
 it turned out such a small pigtail 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.820
 now the tip that remained my coward 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.509
 in the loop that turned us before 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.330
 let's start 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.270
 one node now here composition 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:54.539
 gently tighten everything 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.289
 and semolina tied reliably here 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.840
 is the tip bitten off 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.720
 we cut off someone as convenient and catch fish 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.170
 Here is such a simple nodule 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.170
 reliable
