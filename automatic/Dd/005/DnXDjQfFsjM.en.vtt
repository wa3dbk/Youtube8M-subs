but anyways I guess the moral of my
check<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.370> right<00:03:18.519> now<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.700> while<00:03:18.970> I'm<00:03:19.060> doing

check in right now and while I'm doing
it<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:20.620> way<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.920> because<00:03:21.100> i<00:03:21.220> had<00:03:21.430> i<00:03:21.459> guess<00:03:21.760> a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
it this way is because i had i guess a

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.759 
it this way is because i had i guess a
lot<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.180> say<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.390> then<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:23.079> said<00:03:23.650> it's

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769
