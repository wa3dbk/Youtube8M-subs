basically keeping the summer in mind I

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.030 
basically keeping the summer in mind I
think<00:01:04.480> sometimes<00:01:04.900> like<00:01:05.530> when<00:01:05.710> they<00:01:05.890> have<00:01:06.010> a

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
think sometimes like when they have a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.410 
think sometimes like when they have a
fashion<00:01:06.310> story<00:01:06.990> did<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.950> gets<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.610> like<00:01:10.150> quirky

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
fashion story did it gets to like quirky

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.230 
fashion story did it gets to like quirky
or<00:01:10.720> too<00:01:11.110> edgy<00:01:11.530> which<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.950> enjoy<00:01:12.610> doing<00:01:12.670> as<00:01:13.030> well

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
or too edgy which I enjoy doing as well

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120 
or too edgy which I enjoy doing as well
but<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:13.570> prefer<00:01:13.960> doing<00:01:14.110> this<00:01:14.410> more<00:01:14.740> because<00:01:15.040> i

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
but I prefer doing this more because i

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.520 
but I prefer doing this more because i
think<00:01:15.190> it<00:01:15.460> it's<00:01:15.670> easier<00:01:16.420> for<00:01:16.750> for<00:01:17.229> an<00:01:17.350> audience

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
think it it's easier for for an audience

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
think it it's easier for for an audience
to<00:01:18.010> relate<00:01:18.310> when<00:01:18.790> i<00:01:18.820> do<00:01:18.940> something<00:01:19.330> like<00:01:19.450> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.750 

I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.799> always<00:01:26.040> interesting<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.520> pick
