00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
I tried to make this video a while ago

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.350 
I tried to make this video a while ago
and<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:01.860> just<00:00:02.220> couldn't<00:00:02.520> get<00:00:03.030> it<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.240> come

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
and I just couldn't get it to come

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.120 
and I just couldn't get it to come
together<00:00:03.540> but<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:03.959> just<00:00:04.319> watched<00:00:04.529> one<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:04.890> Sean

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
together but I just watched one of Sean

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.920 
together but I just watched one of Sean
underground<00:00:05.700> wellness<00:00:06.060> as<00:00:06.210> videos<00:00:06.540> about<00:00:06.870> how

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
underground wellness as videos about how

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.870 
underground wellness as videos about how
he<00:00:07.140> was<00:00:07.319> having<00:00:07.529> difficulty<00:00:07.980> we<00:00:08.130> could<00:00:08.280> go<00:00:08.429> and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
he was having difficulty we could go and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.669 
he was having difficulty we could go and
it<00:00:09.330> really<00:00:09.450> inspired<00:00:09.599> me<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.050> try<00:00:10.170> again<00:00:10.559> at

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
it really inspired me to try again at

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.169 
it really inspired me to try again at
this<00:00:10.769> video<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.519> guess<00:00:11.700> I'll<00:00:11.820> title<00:00:12.059> this

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
this video so I guess I'll title this

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.730 
this video so I guess I'll title this
video<00:00:12.420> something<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:12.990> how<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> succeed<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
video something like how to succeed and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.749 
video something like how to succeed and
I<00:00:13.799> know<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.009> sounds<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.370> an<00:00:14.519> audacious

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
I know that sounds like an audacious

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.189 
I know that sounds like an audacious
title<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.450> here's<00:00:15.630> why<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.839> think<00:00:15.900> I'm

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
title but here's why I think I'm

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.689 
title but here's why I think I'm
qualified<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:16.859> least<00:00:16.980> give<00:00:17.220> some<00:00:17.250> advice

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
qualified to at least give some advice

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.120 
qualified to at least give some advice
on<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.990> failed<00:00:19.410> at<00:00:19.619> more<00:00:19.830> things

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
on it because I failed at more things

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.439 
on it because I failed at more things
than<00:00:20.340> most<00:00:20.490> people<00:00:20.850> ever<00:00:20.939> will

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
than most people ever will

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
than most people ever will
the<00:00:22.260> thing<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> nobody<00:00:22.710> seems<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> recognize

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the thing that nobody seems to recognize

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000 
the thing that nobody seems to recognize
is<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.990> when<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.140> push<00:00:25.350> yourself<00:00:25.710> beyond

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
is that when you push yourself beyond

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
is that when you push yourself beyond
your<00:00:26.160> current<00:00:26.279> abilities<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.359> course<00:00:27.689> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
your current abilities of course you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.839 
your current abilities of course you
initially<00:00:28.380> fail<00:00:28.680> that's<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> only<00:00:29.640> way<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
initially fail that's the only way to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
initially fail that's the only way to
exceed<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:30.929> your<00:00:31.050> current<00:00:31.230> abilities<00:00:31.740> are

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
exceed what your current abilities are

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
exceed what your current abilities are
and<00:00:32.399> yet<00:00:32.610> everybody's<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.270> afraid<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.660> failure

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
and yet everybody's so afraid of failure

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.290 
and yet everybody's so afraid of failure
that<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:34.559> never<00:00:34.800> push<00:00:35.100> themselves<00:00:35.610> beyond

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that they never push themselves beyond

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000 
that they never push themselves beyond
what<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.600> currently<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> more

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
what they can currently do so the more

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.290 
what they can currently do so the more
you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.370> fail<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.910> long<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.210> don't

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you can fail as long as you don't

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.540 
you can fail as long as you don't
condition<00:00:39.809> yourself<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.200> failure<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.340> more

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
condition yourself to failure the more

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.860 
condition yourself to failure the more
you're<00:00:41.700> ultimately<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.329> succeed<00:00:42.570> at

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
you're ultimately gonna succeed at

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.090 
you're ultimately gonna succeed at

there these super successful people

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.400 
there these super successful people
generally<00:02:41.240> don't<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.600> time<00:02:41.900> for<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.230> but

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.350 
and lastly while I'm talking about books
in<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.280> opinion<00:02:58.700> when<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.880> how-to<00:02:59.090> or

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
in my opinion when a how-to or

self-improvement book becomes classic

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.220 
self-improvement book becomes classic
it's<00:03:01.940> generally<00:03:02.420> because<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.840> book<00:03:03.050> has

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
it's generally because that book has

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.990 
it's generally because that book has
better<00:03:03.470> advice<00:03:03.830> than<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.280> latest<00:03:04.610> book<00:03:04.880> of
