00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.599
 Hello everyone in this issue I want 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:12.210
 show and tell a little about that 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.059
 do the wings protect you and what are they from 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.670
 protect not a secret well I have many times 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.890
 said in the commercials that I love to ride 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.070
 in the mud if you can go 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.650
 on asphalt or near the dirt if 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.189
 not in a hurry and not in a suit then in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.230
 Basically I'm going for it to rags 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 cally ride on a bicycle in a suit I'm not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 I think this is bad shameful to me 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.420
 convenient and comfortable and most importantly useful for 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.270
 health 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.390
 but now it's not about that I already did 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.059
 release of quick release wing from skf for 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.570
 twenty-ninth wheel here and we is not 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.480
 protects from dirt as if I did not like 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.520
 quick release wings from sks draw 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.399
 attention as the wing is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.680
 in relation to the wheel at the separation point 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.670
 the twenty-ninth wheel is here 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 here therefore all the dirt flies by if 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 we look at the wing from the front as if 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.200
 parts not from front and front stole faces 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.180
 in that part of which face me like this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.080
 it will be correct to see just 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.290
 overdokhrena gryazev on pieces in layers 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.799
 falls off it says that the whole 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.140
 this dirt flies on you because it 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.210
 is on top of the shelter and this 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.470
 so really I put it here 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.860
 here is the wing 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.900
 lest I fly all in the face 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:45.000
 but we can look at the frame here 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.689
 then see that itâ€™s all in it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.060
 distance to mud c flies by 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.520
 because everything here is dirty we go on 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 Well , firstly because of the features 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 liner designs virtually none 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.399
 full-sized wing will not get on 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.770
 back wheel by the way this liner is still 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.489
 pretty nice exception here 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.880
 You can put in principle the full size 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.930
 q it will have to crawl out but 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.100
 but everything else seems to be right here 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.540
 all dirty is what's what 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:26.640
 seat tube that bottom tube up 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.550
 the only thing that is not dirty is the pump 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.800
 and bottle holder then only 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.620
 because I set at two hours ago 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.650
 and I rode yesterday, well, the rear is clear that 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.090
 all in the mud I drive with the trunk and yes 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:46.440
 how I got out without finding it ok 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.580
 removable wing for twenty ninth wheels 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:55.920
 I put a removable wing of twenty 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.590
 sixth wheel and fasten it with clamps 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.190
 to the trunk that is with him by dash them 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.000
 removed with the wing all the back 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.850
 i'm always clean because cola 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.190
 protects well in such an installation because 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.590
 that the separation point at twenty ninth 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:18.120
 wheels is somewhere here all 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.290
 gets here but with the front fender 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.420
 that's it with this shock blade &amp; the fog 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.060
 blade 2 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.220
 it does not protect against dirt 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.000
 you do not have on the twenty-ninth wheels 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.290
 Well, in general, the activation of 9 wheels will shock 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.790
 not the best choice 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.360
 I regret that I bought it so when 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.340
 finances let me get myself what 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.590
 Something else on trial for example the same 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.440
 topic once it does not protect need to try 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.280
 I haven't washed something new because 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.420
 what i had to say for today is all 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.810
 tell your friends like me 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.810
 Alexey Bai 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.470
