to go back and read it again and I found

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.690 
to go back and read it again and I found
just<00:00:27.200> like<00:00:27.260> I<00:00:27.560> read<00:00:27.740> China<00:00:28.010> studies<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:28.520> many

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
just like I read China studies so many

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.220 
just like I read China studies so many
different<00:00:29.060> times<00:00:29.240> that<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:29.570> learned<00:00:29.869> something

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
different times that I learned something

through the book I got a lot out of it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.620

of the book Campbell discusses a very

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.729 
of the book Campbell discusses a very
important<00:00:46.970> issue<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.629> that's<00:00:47.809> reductionism

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739

important issue and that's reductionism
he<00:00:49.070> has<00:00:49.190> talked<00:00:49.430> about<00:00:49.519> this<00:00:49.730> quite<00:00:49.910> a<00:00:50.000> bit

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
he has talked about this quite a bit

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.700 
he has talked about this quite a bit
over<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.420> years<00:00:50.510> but<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:51.019> very<00:00:51.140> important

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
over the years but it's very important

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.799 
over the years but it's very important
and<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.489> difference<00:00:52.820> between<00:00:52.879> reductionism

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
and the difference between reductionism

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.439 
and the difference between reductionism
and<00:00:54.019> what<00:00:54.199> he<00:00:54.289> calls<00:00:54.530> holism<00:00:55.070> with<00:00:55.519> a<00:00:55.550> w<00:00:55.940> holism

during his career as a biochemist he

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.370 
during his career as a biochemist he

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
taught this reductionist model of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.260 
taught this reductionist model of
nutrition<00:01:42.890> focusing<00:01:43.400> on<00:01:43.550> individual

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270

the<00:01:47.300> problem<00:01:47.690> with<00:01:47.810> this<00:01:47.960> approach<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.560> that

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the problem with this approach is that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.410 
the problem with this approach is that
it's<00:01:48.830> easy<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.250> conduct<00:01:49.700> studies<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:50.210> show

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's easy to conduct studies that show

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.450 
it's easy to conduct studies that show
almost<00:01:50.780> any<00:01:51.020> result<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.620> want<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.890> show<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.370> I

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
almost any result you want to show and I

foods<00:03:30.500> there<00:03:31.500> are<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.890> kinds<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.310> problems

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
foods there are all kinds of problems

with<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.060> approach<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.450> nutrition<00:03:33.959> one<00:03:34.859> is

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
with this approach to nutrition one is

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.979 
with this approach to nutrition one is
and<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.579> think<00:03:35.819> this<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.120> fascinating

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
and I think this is fascinating

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.509 
and I think this is fascinating
there<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.380> almost<00:03:37.530> no<00:03:37.709> relationship<00:03:38.489> between

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
there is almost no relationship between

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.699 
there is almost no relationship between
the<00:03:39.000> amount<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.480> nutrient<00:03:39.930> consumed<00:03:40.380> in<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
the amount of a nutrient consumed in the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.530 
the amount of a nutrient consumed in the
amount<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.280> nutrient<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.060> actually

amount of that nutrient that actually

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.809 
amount of that nutrient that actually
reaches<00:03:42.959> destinations<00:03:43.680> within<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.250> body<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
reaches destinations within the body the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.150 
reaches destinations within the body the
reason<00:03:45.569> is<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.019> body<00:03:46.230> decides<00:03:46.680> how<00:03:46.950> much

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
reason is that the body decides how much

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.770 
reason is that the body decides how much
of<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> nutrient<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.030> absorb<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.630> utilize

nutrient<00:04:24.980> of<00:04:25.100> time<00:04:25.250> just<00:04:25.520> doesn't<00:04:25.880> allow<00:04:26.240> for

nutrient of time just doesn't allow for
so<00:04:27.290> calcium<00:04:27.560> decreases<00:04:28.490> iron<00:04:28.910> absorption<00:04:29.030> but

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
so calcium decreases iron absorption but

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.290 
so calcium decreases iron absorption but
carotenoids<00:04:30.620> increase<00:04:31.100> iron<00:04:31.430> absorption<00:04:31.670> so

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
carotenoids increase iron absorption so

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.210 
carotenoids increase iron absorption so
how<00:04:32.450> these<00:04:32.720> nutrients<00:04:33.410> interact<00:04:33.860> with<00:04:34.040> one

how these nutrients interact with one

how these nutrients interact with one
another<00:04:34.250> becomes<00:04:34.820> very<00:04:35.060> important<00:04:35.660> last<00:04:36.620> but

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.870 
of knowing the nutrient content of foods
well<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.590> wasn't<00:04:51.950> needed<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.520> didn't<00:04:52.730> need<00:04:52.850> a

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
well it wasn't needed you didn't need a

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.850 
well it wasn't needed you didn't need a
mechanism<00:04:53.150> for<00:04:53.660> knowing<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.050> back<00:04:54.260> then<00:04:54.560> and

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
mechanism for knowing that back then and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.770 
mechanism for knowing that back then and
you<00:04:54.950> don't<00:04:55.130> really<00:04:55.250> need<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.550> now<00:04:56.000> because

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
you don't really need it now because

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.420 
you don't really need it now because
when<00:04:56.900> people<00:04:57.050> eat<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.530> right<00:04:57.740> foods<00:04:58.100> for
