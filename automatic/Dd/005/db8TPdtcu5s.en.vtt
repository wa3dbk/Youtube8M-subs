maintenance on the chain the first thing
we<00:00:46.760> need<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:46.940> do<00:00:47.149> is<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.569> check<00:00:47.780> if<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.289> chain

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
we need to do is to check if the chain

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.160 
we need to do is to check if the chain
is<00:00:48.769> okay<00:00:49.339> do<00:00:49.969> we<00:00:50.089> need<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.269> replace<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:50.899> chain

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
is okay do we need to replace this chain

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.079 
is okay do we need to replace this chain
or<00:00:51.199> can<00:00:51.469> we<00:00:51.559> just<00:00:51.769> do<00:00:51.890> maintenance<00:00:52.129> I'm<00:00:52.609> using

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
or can we just do maintenance I'm using

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.059 
or can we just do maintenance I'm using
an<00:00:53.269> easy<00:00:53.479> change<00:00:53.749> checker<00:00:54.079> here<00:00:54.379> put<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:54.829> into

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.069 
an easy change checker here put it into

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.680 
an easy change checker here put it into
a<00:00:55.100> roller<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:55.639> if<00:00:55.819> it's<00:00:55.969> six<00:00:56.149> on<00:00:56.389> a<00:00:56.420> roller

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
a roller and if it's six on a roller

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.869 
a roller and if it's six on a roller
like<00:00:56.929> so<00:00:57.199> at<00:00:57.350> an<00:00:57.469> angle<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.280> means<00:00:58.519> our<00:00:58.639> chain

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
like so at an angle that means our chain

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.299 
like so at an angle that means our chain
is<00:00:59.030> okay<00:00:59.329> I'm<00:01:00.229> going<00:01:00.409> to<00:01:00.499> check<00:01:00.679> another<00:01:00.949> spot

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
is okay I'm going to check another spot

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.259 
is okay I'm going to check another spot
on<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.549> chain<00:01:01.789> just<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.539> make<00:01:02.690> sure<00:01:03.879> same<00:01:04.879> it's

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
on the chain just to make sure same it's

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.880 
on the chain just to make sure same it's
sitting<00:01:05.630> on<00:01:05.720> an<00:01:05.840> angle<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.409> means<00:01:06.710> it's

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
sitting on an angle so that means it's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.370 
sitting on an angle so that means it's
okay<00:01:07.220> however<00:01:08.210> I'd<00:01:08.540> like<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.900> make<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.080> little

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
okay however I'd like to make a little

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.810 
okay however I'd like to make a little
bit<00:01:09.500> more<00:01:09.620> accurate<00:01:10.070> reading<00:01:10.400> using<00:01:10.730> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
bit more accurate reading using a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.600 
bit more accurate reading using a
digital<00:01:11.030> chain<00:01:11.480> checker<00:01:12.400> squeeze<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.580> arms

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
digital chain checker squeeze the arms

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.860 
digital chain checker squeeze the arms
together<00:01:14.140> press<00:01:15.140> 0<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.680> calibrate<00:01:16.870> while

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
together press 0 to calibrate while

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.270 
together press 0 to calibrate while
you're<00:01:18.050> still<00:01:18.320> holding<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.710> chain<00:01:19.040> checker

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
you're still holding the chain checker

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.280 
you're still holding the chain checker
together<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.300> can<00:01:20.450> insert<00:01:20.900> it<00:01:21.020> into<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
together you can insert it into the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.070 
together you can insert it into the
chain<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.460> then<00:01:22.510> carefully<00:01:23.510> let<00:01:23.900> go

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
chain like so and then carefully let go

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.780 
chain like so and then carefully let go
you<00:01:24.590> can<00:01:24.740> see<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.160> chain<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.430> way

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
you can see that this chain is way

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.880 
you can see that this chain is way
before<00:01:26.030> point<00:01:26.540> eight<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:27.110> we<00:01:27.320> can<00:01:27.500> perform

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
before point eight so we can perform

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.380 
before point eight so we can perform
maintenance<00:01:28.070> on<00:01:28.400> this<00:01:30.940> now<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.000> first<00:01:32.240> thing

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
maintenance on this now the first thing

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.760 
maintenance on this now the first thing
I<00:01:32.570> want<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.810> do<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.820> use<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.850> rag<00:01:35.150> here<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:35.770> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.990 
the rag what we want to do is get a good
grip<00:01:42.950> on<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.220> chain<00:01:45.580> while<00:01:46.580> you're<00:01:46.820> holding

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
grip on the chain while you're holding

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.600 
grip on the chain while you're holding
your<00:01:47.270> rear<00:01:47.480> derailleur<00:01:47.780> cage<00:01:48.220> get<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.250> really
