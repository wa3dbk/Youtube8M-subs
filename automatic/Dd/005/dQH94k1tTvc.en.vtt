pull<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.080> there's<00:01:04.080> two<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.530> these

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pull this out and there's two of these

on<00:01:04.920> each<00:01:04.949> pad<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.619> these

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
on each pad and you have one of these

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
on each pad and you have one of these
now<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.650> soft<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.240> have

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
now they have them soft then they have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780 
now they have them soft then they have
the<00:01:12.630> yellow<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.500> harder<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the yellow one that's harder and if you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
the yellow one that's harder and if you
put<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> yellow<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:17.390> well<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
put in the yellow one then well like it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.370 
put in the yellow one then well like it
has<00:01:19.500> less<00:01:19.860> flex<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:22.850> recommend<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:24.750> you're

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
has less flex so I recommend if you're

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
has less flex so I recommend if you're
just<00:01:25.650> buying<00:01:25.920> them<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.340> recommend<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> blue

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
just buying them I recommend the blue

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.260 
just buying them I recommend the blue
but<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.770> older<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
but as you get older and you like a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:49.530 
but as you get older and you like a
stiffer<00:01:30.990> pad<00:01:31.520> yellows<00:01:32.520> gonna<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:33.000> better

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.750 

and<00:01:50.540> another<00:01:50.840> good<00:01:51.110> thing<00:01:51.140> about<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.770> 190s<00:01:52.550> is

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
and another good thing about the 190s is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.560 
and another good thing about the 190s is
this<00:01:53.630> right<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.620> so<00:01:55.430> it's<00:01:56.000> really<00:01:56.480> thick<00:01:56.960> and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
this right here so it's really thick and

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.300 
this right here so it's really thick and
your<00:01:59.570> knee<00:01:59.780> goes<00:02:00.020> right<00:02:00.350> here<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:01.040> good

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
your knee goes right here and it's good

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.710 
your knee goes right here and it's good
for<00:02:01.810> water<00:02:02.810> flooding<00:02:03.650> cuz<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.460> heart<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:05.480> can

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
for water flooding cuz the heart you can

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.980 
for water flooding cuz the heart you can
drop<00:02:06.080> down<00:02:06.520> but<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.670> doesn't<00:02:08.240> bring<00:02:08.570> anything

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
drop down but it doesn't bring anything

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.930 
drop down but it doesn't bring anything
now<00:02:09.470> I'll<00:02:09.729> put<00:02:10.729> I'll<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:11.390> slide<00:02:12.260> them<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.940> and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
now I'll put I'll just slide them on and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.010 
now I'll put I'll just slide them on and
I<00:02:14.870> can<00:02:15.200> show<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:17.200> butterfly<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:19.040> butterfly

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
I can show you a butterfly a butterfly

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.550

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
has a very big it covers a lot so

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.710
