00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
the 1 gallon jug while the opening in

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.740 
the 1 gallon jug while the opening in
the<00:04:17.070> back<00:04:17.250> allows<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.820> solid<00:04:18.180> ways<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.510> fall

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
the back allows the solid ways to fall

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.690 
the back allows the solid ways to fall
directly<00:04:19.320> into<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.620> solid<00:04:19.980> wedge<00:04:20.160> collection

container

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.629 

so<00:04:26.659> basically<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.289> works<00:04:27.439> like<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.979> you

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
so basically it works like this you

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.170 
so basically it works like this you
raise<00:04:28.879> the<00:04:29.090> lid<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:30.500> set<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.250> ceiling<00:04:31.879> lid

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
raise the lid you set the ceiling lid

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.200 
raise the lid you set the ceiling lid
back<00:04:32.719> here<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.860> sit<00:04:34.099> down<00:04:34.340> you<00:04:34.879> do<00:04:35.060> your

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
back here you sit down you do your

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.990 
back here you sit down you do your
business<00:04:35.599> when<00:04:36.319> you're<00:04:36.469> done<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:37.520> return<00:04:37.879> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
business when you're done you return the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.929 
business when you're done you return the
sin<00:04:38.210> lid<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.930> its<00:04:39.050> place<00:04:39.319> you<00:04:40.250> close<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.909> lid

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
sin lid to its place you close the lid

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.580 
sin lid to its place you close the lid
and<00:04:42.189> you<00:04:43.189> insert<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.729> churn<00:04:43.969> handle<00:04:44.500> into<00:04:45.500> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
and you insert the churn handle into the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.020 
and you insert the churn handle into the
hole<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.189> then<00:04:47.560> turn<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.710> mixture
