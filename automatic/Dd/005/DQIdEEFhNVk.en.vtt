00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.660
 very people come to a free kick 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 this is a 62 gameplay stand 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.380
 Also on the release week because here I am 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.240
 i am not yet in prestige and i am 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.190
 only level 26 or 27 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 and yes I have here with the mp 7 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.490
 gambled with a muffler aspects 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 was slightly weighted 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.150
 agility and my kiss tricks were 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.539
 the drone stocks and the drone 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.080
 lightning so much for the gameplay what 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.560
 Today it's about a faq video 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 I will create something for me 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 was a few weeks ago from a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.200
 other youtube after a relative 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.610
 little youtuber asked i believe 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 is on youtube to knock their and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.690
 who asked me if I was not ready 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 would be an interview with him to do that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489
 means I just put my mine 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.430
 ask you were video on a field where 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.140
 I just tell you you should me 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.180
 everything possible now ask what you are me 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.250
 always wanted to ask and he will 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 then ask this on his channel 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.570
 read aloud and I will want it then 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.260
 not all of them but a part of it 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.970
 So in principle, as I and the duel 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.750
 from the wave of the barn there is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.119
 but unfortunately not anymore 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.950
 We also had this contact one 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.460
 time where we interviewed a few youtubers 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.320
 have eg phoenix he was attending a 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.600
 Expander I think I do not know 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.549
 So I can not do any more 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 maybe the channel has become 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.500
 I'll do it alone someday 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 Anyway, and yes, there is me 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.680
 Of course, that is still the case 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.450
 Never did a faq video do that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.900
 means I 've been around for a long time 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.670
 but really have a faq video 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.079
 I actually did what but anyway 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.149
 The standard is actually the make 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.259
 Left because there are in things the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.299
 if you wanted to already know there are many 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.820
 I create things that meanwhile 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.520
 I'm hot in the front or I'm hot 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.540
 ever show value on youtube it is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.290
 things that I have of course already 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.840
 answer 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.549
 but I think there is still yes 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.350
 we just ask here to criticize 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.240
 and therefore you can 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.740
 in this video here everything 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.790
 possible questions you have always asked 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.240
 wanted to ask 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:14.010
 please let me ask how must 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.010
 I really need you to look 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.870
 not to the question but you know what 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.640
 I mean on youtube there is one 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.069
 ask a lot and just leave it 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.569
 I do not do it 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.060
 so now I of course had 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.250
 talked pretty fast and said something 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.110
 and what is in this video now 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.720
 but I have only half of the videos 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.269
 funny funny scale belongs in 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.150
 background music yes i can maybe 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.910
 still talking about it 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.150
 yes, just a few of you a few 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.620
 few of you may have noticed 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.440
 that the nine or ten gta4 let's play 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.930
 does not fit that I have tasted so far 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.340
 there are more or are still there 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.280
 not listed that means who ever 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.959
 got a link or who is in the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.459
 So just browser if that's the one 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.269
 course not open in the last 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.700
 few months 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.630
 it will also continue to look 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.480
 but I do not have them either 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.060
 listed because I like them now 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.209
 a new upload pictures or first 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.549
 party already up by lp now 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.200
 wonders determines new job you have 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.140
 Anyway, make comments 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.810
 whether the let's play is on its own 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.480
 or should come to the 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.040
 previous channel and most said 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.630
 Just make that point 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.310
 here why a new channel like this 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.350
 that is done now that's all 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.190
 simply because I just noticed 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.400
 that with or catch diana I sang 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:55.359
 just every four to five days 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.430
 ten days a couple of dpa lsw tasted 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.049
 why did I do that, too 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.690
 definitely on this part ii should after 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.880
 as before mainly commentary it comes 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.680
 from June and attracts now and let's play 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.100
 I thought so but I hope so 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.680
 commentarist and 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.260
 it just does not make sense so seldom 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.670
 was to upload spexard because every let's 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.090
 play that makes you just experience one 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.810
 every 12 no more than three days what high what 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.940
 it simply does not make sense otherwise 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.520
 he goes is the liquid went so 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.820
 the ability of the flow between the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.810
 dane individual parts lost and 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.440
 at the same time I am but too much 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.290
 Upload 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.060
 then it is like that 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.100
 last channel and then go the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.200
 coming and but he got me on things 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.460
 subscribed to comments it also has 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.400
 makes no sense I understand it 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.200
 of course if he says well , sorry, sorry 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.270
 I do not want to subscribe to you right now 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.830
 this is not a problem as I said 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.480
 I mainly because of comments 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.980
 subscribed and if you only 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.320
 wanted to look commentary that's all 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.970
 nice and good but i have seen that 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.590
 let's play is not that many 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.120
 interested and that's why I have 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.950
 I prefer to remove where I only people 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.080
 They also have the same as those for 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.270
 the latter are interesting and on this 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.920
 here people are looking for 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.720
 I am already interested in comments 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.730
 of course, that the other channel 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.880
 then only a few hundred subscribers in 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.620
 will get a few months and not 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.590
 come to this 6000 so fast here 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.420
 but anyway I want you 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.830
 just say you will find the link in the 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.140
 video description that I give to 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.880
 it ends 30 6 as said writes the 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.510
 ask and we will hear first 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.510
 to create once again
