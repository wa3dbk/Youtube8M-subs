00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
off by bringing in our mortars which is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.560 
off by bringing in our mortars which is
one<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> our<00:01:00.960> most<00:01:01.199> important<00:01:01.949> defenses<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:03.239> my

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
one of our most important defenses in my

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
one of our most important defenses in my
mind<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> mortars<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.189> wizard<00:01:05.790> towers

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
mind the mortars and the wizard towers

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.810 
mind the mortars and the wizard towers
are<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.600> most<00:01:06.780> important<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.130> defenses

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
are the most important of the defenses

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
are the most important of the defenses
because<00:01:09.510> splash<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:11.100> blast<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.689> don't<00:01:13.170> really

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
because splash is a blast I don't really

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.350 
because splash is a blast I don't really
know<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:14.939> but

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
know that what I was going out there but

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.670 
know that what I was going out there but
as<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.659> our<00:01:15.869> mortars<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.350> covering

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
as you can see our mortars are covering

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.039 
as you can see our mortars are covering
the<00:01:16.830> entire<00:01:16.950> base<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> way

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the entire base right here all the way

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.499 
the entire base right here all the way
around<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.460> circles<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.240> whatnot

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
around it as it circles up and whatnot

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.320 
around it as it circles up and whatnot
so<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:22.110> should<00:01:22.500> work<00:01:23.040> fairly<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:24.180> us

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so this should work fairly well for us

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
so this should work fairly well for us
we're<00:01:24.840> gonna<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.080> ahead<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> bring<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.890> our

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
those are going to be back to sets of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
those are going to be back to sets of
walls<00:01:52.560> also<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.460> they<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:53.820> protected<00:01:54.479> from

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
walls also so they are protected from

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.780

anything<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:21.200> lavaloon<00:03:22.200> e'en<00:03:22.500> or<00:03:22.680> something

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
anything like lavaloon e'en or something

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.729 
anything like lavaloon e'en or something
like<00:03:23.069> that<00:03:23.130> if<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.700> have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:24.239> bunch<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:25.019> archers

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
like that if you have a bunch of archers

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.979 
like that if you have a bunch of archers
then<00:03:25.950> they<00:03:26.100> cause<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> bunch<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.329> damage

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
then they cause a bunch of damage

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.690 
then they cause a bunch of damage
because<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.500> new<00:03:28.620> DPS<00:03:28.980> boost<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.579> they

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
because of the new DPS boost that they

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.819 
because of the new DPS boost that they
have<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.900> want<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.139> have<00:03:31.290> those<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.709> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
right there we're going to throw two

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.780 
right there we're going to throw two
spring<00:04:06.419> traps<00:04:06.859> in<00:04:07.859> front<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.430> one<00:04:08.609> we<00:04:08.760> are

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
spring traps in front of that one we are

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.430 
spring traps in front of that one we are
using<00:04:09.030> our<00:04:09.269> traps<00:04:09.599> really<00:04:09.930> really<00:04:10.139> well<00:04:10.290> in

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
using our traps really really well in

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.740 
using our traps really really well in
this<00:04:10.560> base<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.950> think<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.239> going<00:04:12.419> to<00:04:12.569> be

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
this base I think that it is going to be

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.569 
this base I think that it is going to be
absolutely<00:04:13.440> amazing<00:04:13.919> where<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.400> throw

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
absolutely amazing where you can throw

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.300 
absolutely amazing where you can throw
in<00:04:14.730> those<00:04:14.880> other<00:04:15.269> bombs<00:04:15.690> right<00:04:16.019> there<00:04:16.380> bomb

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
in those other bombs right there bomb

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.219 
in those other bombs right there bomb
yeah<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> air<00:04:17.820> bomb<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.539> skeleton<00:04:18.989> trap

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
yeah the air bomb and the skeleton trap

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.449 
yeah the air bomb and the skeleton trap
and<00:04:19.470> then<00:04:19.919> we<00:04:20.039> are<00:04:20.130> going<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.459> throw<00:04:20.729> in

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
and then we are going to throw in

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.870 
and then we are going to throw in
one<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:21.940> these<00:04:22.150> as<00:04:22.900> well<00:04:23.470> owned<00:04:24.039> one<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.490> these

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
one of these as well owned one of these

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.420 
one of these as well owned one of these

up at the top we don't have any more

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.620 
up at the top we don't have any more
tests<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:28.960> so<00:04:29.080> we're<00:04:29.199> gonna<00:04:29.259> go<00:04:29.410> bomb<00:04:29.650> bomb<00:04:30.009> and

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
tests so so we're gonna go bomb bomb and

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.719 
tests so so we're gonna go bomb bomb and
a<00:04:31.630> mini<00:04:32.080> bomb<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.590> if<00:04:32.680> anybody<00:04:33.130> comes<00:04:33.520> in

a mini bomb and if anybody comes in

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:34.920 
a mini bomb and if anybody comes in
through<00:04:34.000> here<00:04:34.240> they<00:04:34.389> are<00:04:34.509> going<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:34.810> get

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
through here they are going to get

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.189 
through here they are going to get
annihilated<00:04:35.350> like<00:04:36.009> absolutely<00:04:37.050> destroyed<00:04:38.050> I
