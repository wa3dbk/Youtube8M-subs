00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
mcedit filter maker out there so I

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.640 
mcedit filter maker out there so I
thought<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.700> would<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:10.200> cool<00:01:10.439> if

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
thought and this would be really cool if

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.510 
thought and this would be really cool if
I<00:01:10.740> could<00:01:10.799> show<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.460> before<00:01:11.939> them<00:01:12.540> and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
here we have the overlords blood mail of
course<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.810> took<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.140> item<00:01:22.470> from<00:01:22.650> League<00:01:23.009> of

course I took this item from League of
Legends<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.850> gives<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.240> plus<00:01:24.740> 850

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
maximum health yeah maybe that's a bit

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
maximum health yeah maybe that's a bit
overpowered<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.930> standard<00:01:31.320> health

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
overpowered because the standard health

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.319 
overpowered because the standard health
is<00:01:31.939> 20m<00:01:33.470> every<00:01:34.470> health<00:01:35.009> large<00:01:35.310> counts<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.060> and

is 20m every health large counts one and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.770 
is 20m every health large counts one and
yes<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.680> would<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.040> lot<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.369> hearts<00:01:38.780> yeah

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
yes that would be a lot of hearts yeah

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.950 
yes that would be a lot of hearts yeah
but<00:01:40.400> here's<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> zooming<00:01:41.880> stick<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
but here's the zooming stick it just

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.770 
but here's the zooming stick it just
gives<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> minus<00:01:44.369> 100<00:01:44.820> thousand<00:01:45.270> percent

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
speed so you got the slowness effect

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.310 
speed so you got the slowness effect
which<00:01:50.299> decreases<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.420> prendre<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
which decreases your prendre you are a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.969 
which decreases your prendre you are a
field<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.710> view<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.630> seems<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
field of view so it seems this is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
use less zombie reinforcements to you

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.920 
use less zombie reinforcements to you
this<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.769> really<00:02:32.950> cool<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.510> yeah<00:02:34.510> now<00:02:34.750> I'll

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
this is really cool and yeah now I'll

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.500 
this is really cool and yeah now I'll
show<00:02:35.079> you<00:02:35.140> how<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.470> create<00:02:35.920> your<00:02:36.010> own<00:02:36.510> for

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
show you how to create your own for

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.819 
show you how to create your own for
example<00:02:38.459> we<00:02:39.459> want<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> do<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.950> opie<00:02:42.579> I'm

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
example we want to do the opie I'm

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.599 
example we want to do the opie I'm
running<00:02:44.829> gold<00:02:45.819> nugget<00:02:46.620> yeah<00:02:47.620> which<00:02:48.069> makes<00:02:48.370> you

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
running gold nugget yeah which makes you

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.699 
running gold nugget yeah which makes you
sprint<00:02:49.060> very<00:02:49.420> very<00:02:49.720> fast<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:53.319> should<00:02:53.530> do<00:02:53.680> a

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
sprint very very fast and it should do a

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.949 
sprint very very fast and it should do a
lot<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:53.980> damage<00:02:54.190> too<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.120> put<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.659> item

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
lot of damage too so you put the item

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.039 
lot of damage too so you put the item
you<00:02:56.079> want<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.290> modify<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.129> chest<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:58.049> then

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
you want to modify in a chest and then

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.240 
you want to modify in a chest and then
we<00:02:59.379> head<00:02:59.500> over<00:02:59.859> to<00:02:59.889> mcedit<00:03:01.859> okay<00:03:02.859> here<00:03:03.129> in

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
we head over to mcedit okay here in

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.179 
we head over to mcedit okay here in
mcedit<00:03:03.609> we<00:03:03.909> got<00:03:04.180> these<00:03:04.420> two<00:03:04.480> chests<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.379> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
left one was the empty one because I

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.899 
left one was the empty one because I
took<00:03:08.139> all<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.409> items<00:03:08.650> out<00:03:08.739> of<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.189> here<00:03:09.819> is

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the one with the gold nugget in it and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.780 
the one with the gold nugget in it and
we<00:03:13.420> click<00:03:13.629> on<00:03:13.780> filter<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.500> yeah<00:03:15.069> here's<00:03:15.639> the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
we click on filter and yeah here's the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.970 
we click on filter and yeah here's the

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
be added to the enmity data then let's

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.830 
be added to the enmity data then let's
take<00:03:31.239> speed<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.220> we<00:03:33.220> can<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.209> total<00:03:34.629> and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
take speed and we can have a total and

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.460 
take speed and we can have a total and
relative<00:03:36.419> amount<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:40.239> if<00:03:40.720> we<00:03:40.989> take<00:03:41.169> a

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
relative amount and if we take a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.569 
relative amount and if we take a
relative<00:03:42.750> here<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.900> would<00:03:44.049> be<00:03:44.199> plus<00:03:44.500> 10%<00:03:44.859> speed

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
relative here it would be plus 10% speed

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.670 
relative here it would be plus 10% speed
which<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:46.030> not<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.540> much<00:03:46.720> but<00:03:47.349> if<00:03:47.440> we<00:03:47.530> do<00:03:47.650> a

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
which is not that much but if we do a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.939 
which is not that much but if we do a
total<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.639> would<00:03:48.879> be<00:03:49.060> +1<00:03:49.750> speed<00:03:50.440> because

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
total this would be +1 speed because

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.149 
total this would be +1 speed because
it's<00:03:51.129> plus<00:03:51.510> 0.1<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:53.379> pattern<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.889> can't

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
it's plus 0.1 and in pattern you can't

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.309 
it's plus 0.1 and in pattern you can't
do<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.500> decimal<00:03:56.500> numbers<00:03:57.430> and<00:03:58.180> mcedit<00:03:58.930> that's

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
do the decimal numbers and mcedit that's

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.319 
do the decimal numbers and mcedit that's
not<00:03:59.500> possible

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
not possible

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.890 
not possible
so<00:04:01.329> yeah<00:04:02.400> m<00:04:03.599> let's<00:04:04.599> make<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.049> your<00:04:05.949> relative

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
so yeah m let's make it your relative

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.839 
so yeah m let's make it your relative
plus<00:04:08.430> 500<00:04:09.430> percent<00:04:10.000> speed<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:11.579> then<00:04:12.579> we<00:04:12.699> click

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
plus 500 percent speed and then we click

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.170 
plus 500 percent speed and then we click
on<00:04:12.970> filter<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.590> then<00:04:14.590> let's<00:04:15.310> give<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.030> some

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
on filter and then let's give it some

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.469 
on filter and then let's give it some
attack<00:04:16.810> damage<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.820> total<00:04:18.820> attack<00:04:19.269> damage

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
attack damage to total attack damage

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.280 
attack damage to total attack damage
plus<00:04:20.260> 50<00:04:20.709> no<00:04:20.829> that's<00:04:21.070> too<00:04:21.279> much

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
plus 50 no that's too much

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:29.270 
plus 50 no that's too much
let's<00:04:22.440> do<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:23.360> Plus<00:04:24.950> 8<00:04:25.950> S<00:04:27.350> Plus<00:04:28.350> 8<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.710> then<00:04:29.160> we

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
let's do it Plus 8 S Plus 8 and then we

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.760 
let's do it Plus 8 S Plus 8 and then we
click<00:04:29.460> on<00:04:29.610> filter<00:04:29.970> again<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.420> we<00:04:31.260> save<00:04:31.500> the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
click on filter again and we save the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.370 
click on filter again and we save the
whole<00:04:31.950> thing<00:04:32.220> here<00:04:32.970> using<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:34.110> Save<00:04:34.350> button

we'll go back again to my ok so here we
go<00:04:44.730> and<00:04:45.150> this<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.990> Golden<00:04:46.590> Nugget<00:04:46.770> of

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
go and this is the Golden Nugget of

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.120 
go and this is the Golden Nugget of
Awesomeness<00:04:48.120> yeah<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:48.720> can<00:04:49.110> run<00:04:49.290> faster<00:04:49.680> now<00:04:49.860> I

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
Awesomeness yeah I can run faster now I

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.670 
Awesomeness yeah I can run faster now I
actually<00:04:50.820> can't<00:04:51.330> sprint<00:04:51.750> when<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.260> have<00:04:52.470> this

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
actually can't sprint when I have this

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.680 
actually can't sprint when I have this
effect<00:04:53.780> but<00:04:54.780> I'm<00:04:55.080> very<00:04:55.320> fast<00:04:55.740> in<00:04:56.160> many<00:04:56.460> ways<00:04:56.690> so

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
effect but I'm very fast in many ways so

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.260 
effect but I'm very fast in many ways so
yeah<00:04:58.410> maybe<00:04:58.950> I'll<00:04:59.190> just<00:04:59.400> show<00:04:59.790> you<00:04:59.820> what<00:05:00.120> they

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
yeah maybe I'll just show you what they

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.360 
yeah maybe I'll just show you what they
do<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:01.610> yeah<00:05:02.610> let's<00:05:02.940> spawn<00:05:03.480> some<00:05:04.670> zombies

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
do and yeah let's spawn some zombies
