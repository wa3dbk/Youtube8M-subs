00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that you know as a back-up plan you know

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.000 
that you know as a back-up plan you know
I<00:01:01.140> figured<00:01:01.469> maybe<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:01.770> would<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.890> some

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I figured maybe there would be some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.450 
I figured maybe there would be some
stumps<00:01:02.430> where<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.820> throw<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.270> little

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
stumps where I could throw my little

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
stumps where I could throw my little
little<00:01:05.460> stick<00:01:05.670> Bayside<00:01:06.240> Academy<00:01:06.720> h2o<00:01:07.409> stick

little stick Bayside Academy h2o stick
bait<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.930> tried<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> few

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
bait you know so I tried that for a few

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.520 
bait you know so I tried that for a few
few<00:01:11.400> places<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> few<00:01:12.450> points<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.200> quickly

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
few places on a few points and I quickly

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
few places on a few points and I quickly
found<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.509> there<00:01:15.509> isn't<00:01:15.720> any<00:01:15.810> grass

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
found out that there isn't any grass

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
found out that there isn't any grass
that<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.350> found<00:01:16.710> that's<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.700> shallow<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that I found that's up shallow that the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.570 
that I found that's up shallow that the
type<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.259> stuff<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.650> looking<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.130> coontail

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
after I worked quite a few points from

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.219 
after I worked quite a few points from
where<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.250> launched<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> ramp<00:01:27.509> mid-leg<00:01:27.930> up

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
where we launched at the ramp mid-leg up

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
where we launched at the ramp mid-leg up
north<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> northwest<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:33.210> we

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
north to the northwest you know we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
north to the northwest you know we
worked<00:01:33.890> quite<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> few<00:01:35.100> points<00:01:35.310> between<00:01:35.549> here

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
worked quite a few points between here

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.410 
worked quite a few points between here
and<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.430> kind<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.549> fan<00:01:38.700> casted<00:01:39.150> some

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and there and I kind of fan casted some

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.140 
and there and I kind of fan casted some
here<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> flats<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.009> between<00:01:41.400> stops

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
here some of the flats in between stops

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.730 
here some of the flats in between stops
just<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:42.899> there's<00:01:43.079> any<00:01:43.229> grass<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
just see if there's any grass and I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.420 
just see if there's any grass and I
couldn't<00:01:44.430> find<00:01:44.549> any<00:01:44.729> grass<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.600> kind<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
couldn't find any grass so I kind of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.649 
couldn't find any grass so I kind of
switched<00:01:47.430> gears<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> decided<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> know

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
switched gears and decided you know

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.990 
switched gears and decided you know
maybe<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.110> need<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.979> next<00:01:50.250> thing<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:50.939> be

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
maybe I need to my next thing would be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.469 
maybe I need to my next thing would be

northeast side that I haven't fished and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.780 
northeast side that I haven't fished and
it<00:05:02.620> looks<00:05:02.800> like<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:02.980> pretty<00:05:03.220> good<00:05:03.370> little<00:05:03.520> arm

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790
