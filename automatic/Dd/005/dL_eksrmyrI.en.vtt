quite<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.460> lot<00:05:23.669> mm-hmm<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.419> this<00:05:25.290> took<00:05:25.470> is

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
quite a lot mm-hmm and this took is

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.090 
quite a lot mm-hmm and this took is
about<00:05:26.480> mmm<00:05:27.480> about<00:05:27.840> 40<00:05:28.230> minutes<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.680> do<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:28.830> it

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
about mmm about 40 minutes to do so it

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.100 
about mmm about 40 minutes to do so it
does<00:05:29.250> take<00:05:29.280> quite<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.640> well<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.090> I'm<00:05:30.419> presuming

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
does take quite a well and I'm presuming

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.470 
does take quite a well and I'm presuming
that<00:05:31.260> was<00:05:31.680> practice<00:05:32.130> or<00:05:32.280> get<00:05:32.460> quicker<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.970> mean

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
that was practice or get quicker I mean

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.920 
that was practice or get quicker I mean
so<00:05:34.110> this<00:05:34.290> is<00:05:34.320> now<00:05:34.590> gonna<00:05:35.630> lease<00:05:36.630> doesn't<00:05:36.750> know
