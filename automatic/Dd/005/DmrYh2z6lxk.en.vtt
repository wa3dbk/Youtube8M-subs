00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.300
 Hello everyone at the microphone Sergey Belousov 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
 he's water and you watch the video 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.170
 dedicated to the thirteenth gaminator 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 and games that fight to win it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.430
 now tell you about 8 and 16 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 applicants but before that I remind you 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.470
 The theme of the 13 dominator is great and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.510
 small and if you thought only 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.400
 size is sad because cd concept 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.199
 you can think of a lot of things in this 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.660
 plan developers participating in 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.790
 the competition just hit me well let's 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 let's go in order make it more convenient 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 drove the first project is called just 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 and concisely that the author smokes and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.980
 really only costs at first 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320
 run the game you think what 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.690
 why is this something with eyes 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.579
 flies left right and only by pressure 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.590
 a couple of seconds on the keys you realize that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.539
 your ward moves and with each 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.579
 step gran becomes less and you 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 opens more and more review, and has been 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.149
 you fly them white space 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 overcome the maze by passing it you 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.930
 moving on to another step of evolution 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.910
 where you eat everyone but then you pass 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.310
 all this is about the development of the last stage 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.819
 which by the way has a very unusual 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.819
 something to think about 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 further on the queue is the park handler project 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.750
 here the subject is big and small 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.369
 being played up with the help of pigs now 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.709
 I will explain that yes as the main character 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.599
 appears in the maze with pigs in it 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.220
 one wife runs a pig and a little 

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:33.209
 piglet you need to catch and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.369
 bring the portal 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.080
 from which the main character appeared in 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.149
 general this is a kind of pakman about 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.890
 simultaneously in two directions ie until 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.530
 you hunt for piglets run for you 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.539
 same on pig but everything would be very simple 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.849
 if those little pink creatures 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.450
 do not eat acorns that hang on the branches in 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.160
 the maze 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.959
 twist in three in a row small 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.239
 puny little pig turning into 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.670
 big pig and now for him would not 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.349
 hunter and mining especially note 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.750
 musical accompaniment of the project 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.750
 the author has tried his best 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.770
 if you are a tower fan 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.500
 defense games then the next video project 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.240
 you will definitely like listeriosis 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.100
 here we are offered to take under your 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.330
 control protective bacteria and help 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.330
 protagonist survive attack 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.890
 viruses but not so simple with every 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.140
 at once fighters from the enemy 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.430
 getting bigger and bigger in cases 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.350
 when you can not cope you can 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.670
 use some semblance 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.930
 superpowers such as coughing 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.000
 which dies the most part 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.310
 antagonists but also here have their 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.870
 features at the time of your battle 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.090
 inside the body the main character spends 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.590
 their typical everyday use and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.810
 superpowers can seriously him 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.520
 hurt let's say a date with a girl 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.020
 because not everyone liked for your 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.030
 interlocutor throw up right in the middle 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.380
 romantic moment from here by the way 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.750
 there are a couple more features of the game 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.750
 slightly non-linear plot and three endings 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.310
 further on my list is the project giants 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.350
 gnomes true i would have done more postscript 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.880
 also a little mouse because 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.770
 it is for him that we will play 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.760
 the essence of the gameplay comes down to what 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.739
 necessary using pocket 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.660
 pet giant eliminate 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.550
 dwarves who are eager to climb on 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.500
 him at first keep you on the defensive 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.690
 will be on your feet but further you 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.280
 come to other parts of the body how are you 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.250
 think what the mouse is attacking dwarfs 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.380
 never guess he drops them off 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.940
 the use of sound for which reason the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.140
 it takes a long time to accumulate by 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.489
 key up next 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.530
 the contestant will tell us about the big 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.930
 the adventure of the little hero guy 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.700
 who really wanted to find a friend with 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.489
 for this purpose, he decides to go planet 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.080
 god to ask for a favor but 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.549
 what comes of it i offer you 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.620
 learn your own project 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.239
 is a main platformer 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.340
 the hero just has to run forward and 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.640
 jump platform by the way not much 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.570
 ordinary which have different sizes 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.850
 disappearing which become invisible 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.100
 and prancing which appear in different 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.080
 parts of the crane are pleased that the developer 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.090
 diversified by jumping on two platforms 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.660
 mini-games both come under way 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.660
 merry night 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.880
 berlingo game that tells us about 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.950
 a small island and it exists its 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600
 quiet and peaceful life and principle to anyone 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.760
 does not interfere but in one day 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.010
 terrible storms attacked the island as well 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.240
 fatty began to grab it here and 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.680
 gameplay begins 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.380
 we play the role of guardian angel 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.419
 islands well or gods lumps more convenient 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.459
 who must lightning destroy the birds 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.120
 eager to flood the island but you have to be 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.160
 neater 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.440
 if you find yourself not feathered and 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.630
 let's say building on the island will cause 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.940
 it harm the main objective is not to give 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.560
 a special scale will fill up otherwise game over 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.750
 project is interesting by the way also 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.680
 styling so it's worth it for 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.680
 just run the game 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.890
 penultimate project of this video 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.290
 small therefore a lot of time on 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.240
 the story of him I will not spend the fly exactly 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.460
 so the participant of the competition called his game 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.350
 the name fully reflects the whole point 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.500
 we are offered to take control 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.600
 the fly is the same flying and annoying 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.400
 creature with wings that just 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.120
 you have to fly forward to dodge 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.950
 from fellow 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.500
 but you also need to be careful with the floor and 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.070
 the ceiling if your husband sits on them then 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.870
 his arrival to us right away with a newspaper 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.600
 finally the game is the hardest to pronounce 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.790
 name cheap case by grenzund 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.800
 but when they spoke the name of the game ahead 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.390
 to study the story of the protagonist 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.460
 come tax collectors who 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.160
 state can pay and up to and many 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.320
 on ! the main character about what he recently 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.630
 gave all that was assemblies reported 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.180
 we have changed the calculation formula and now 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.919
 your debt is huge angry 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.930
 the protagonist turns into a huge 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.820
 stone monster and goes destroy all 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.130
 in a row the main goal in this project 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.440
 is the city's treasury need to reach 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.690
 before her I pass the warriors of the archers to the cavalry and 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.520
 catapult naturally dimensions of the main 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.800
 hero does not allow the opponent to easily 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.140
 cause damage to him but that does not mean that 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.280
 he is immortal so the fun is fun 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.280
 health care is necessary 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.680
 that's all if you want to know about 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.420
 other contenders for victory in 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.790
 then you can watch a video from 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.100
 pro bu who told about the other 8 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.660
 projects 13 gaminator and that's it 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.580
 the microphone was Sergey Belousov 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.580
 he will thank you for your attention
