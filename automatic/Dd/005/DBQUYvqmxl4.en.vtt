website that use this technique we're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.390 
website that use this technique we're
probably<00:00:19.080> wondering<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.890> was<00:00:20.010> done<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
probably wondering how it was done and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.070 
probably wondering how it was done and
it's<00:00:20.939> really<00:00:21.300> actually<00:00:21.869> very<00:00:22.350> very<00:00:22.560> simple

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
you simply paint the pattern whether it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.140

give it a good twist to allow the the
the<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.869> little<00:02:10.170> screw<00:02:10.950> things<00:02:11.370> inside<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the the little screw things inside the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.100 
the the little screw things inside the
camp<00:02:12.390> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
camp to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.270 
camp to
titin<00:02:13.560> onto<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> plastic<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.060> then<00:02:16.280> our

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
titin onto the plastic and then our

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.910 
titin onto the plastic and then our
little<00:02:17.430> pin<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.910> our<00:02:18.900> little<00:02:19.110> pin<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.770> can

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
little pin go our little pin as you can

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.110 
little pin go our little pin as you can
see<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.220> fits<00:02:21.560> inside<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.990> tip<00:02:25.230> like<00:02:25.470> so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
see it just fits inside the tip like so

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.260 
see it just fits inside the tip like so
so<00:02:27.320> as<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.590> said<00:02:28.830> simply<00:02:29.220> paint<00:02:29.910> as<00:02:30.210> you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
so as I said simply paint as you

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.360 
so as I said simply paint as you
ordinarily<00:02:30.930> would<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.740> I<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.070> here

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
ordinarily would just like I have here

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.620

when you're squeezing this if you
squeeze<00:03:42.870> too<00:03:43.049> hard<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.769> get<00:03:43.980> large<00:03:44.390> thick

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
squeeze too hard you get large thick

squeeze too hard you get large thick
lines<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.230> if<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.530> gently<00:03:46.980> do<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.640> little

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
lines and if you gently do it a little

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.610 
lines and if you gently do it a little
bit<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.360> practice<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.959> you'll<00:03:49.080> get<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.320> nice
