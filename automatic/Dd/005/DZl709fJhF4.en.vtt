00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
ok the next thing is that there hasn't

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.289 
ok the next thing is that there hasn't
been<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.100> binder<00:02:02.460> update<00:02:02.670> since<00:02:02.880> November

been a binder update since November

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.920 
been a binder update since November
second<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:05.219> reason<00:02:05.579> for<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.360> v's<00:02:06.600> turn

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
second the reason for that it's v's turn

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.029 
second the reason for that it's v's turn
and<00:02:07.520> V&amp;M<00:02:08.520> are<00:02:08.729> getting<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.090> hidden<00:02:09.390> arsenal<00:02:09.599> box

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
or they're splitting one actually

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.520 
or they're splitting one actually
so<00:02:13.819> he<00:02:14.819> wants<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.270> wait<00:02:15.480> till<00:02:15.780> he<00:02:16.020> gets<00:02:16.230> hit<00:02:16.500> in
