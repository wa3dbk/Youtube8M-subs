 have lower levels of testosterone 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.700

 vÃ©lez 3 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.520
 consume more zinc than zinc in your diet 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.280
 which is very important for production 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.320
 natural testosterone because it prevents 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.619
 that testosterone becomes 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.450
 estrogen that is the female hormone the 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.759
 zinc that in itself converts the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.469
 estrogen in testosterone and also 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.539
 helps to produce more sperm 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.539
 healthy and a sperm count 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.640
 higher so really the levels 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.909
 Low zinc levels can cause 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.209
 low testosterone the meals that 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.479
 are rich in zinc include oysters a 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:50.080
 aphrodisiac natural liver seafood birds 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.080
 Nuts and seeds 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.050
 4 tries to be so stimulated 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.750
 sexually as possible if 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.610
 currently you are not feeling 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 sexually stimulated then you can 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.660
 dramatically raise your levels of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.850
 testosterone if you manage to feel 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.970
 sexually stimulated with greater 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.890
 often you need to start doing 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.570
 almost anything that is at your 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.960
 reach so you can have a 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.270
 erection also German scientists 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.490
 they found that by simply having 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.740
 an erection this will cause your 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.950
 circulating testosterone levels 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.020
 rise significantly 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.660
 5 do not drink alcohol or consume grapefruit 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.760
 even if they are only two drinks a day 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.070
 alcohol makes it harder than 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.959
 your liver unfolds the estrogen which 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.610
 in turn causes your levels of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.730
 estrogen increase and that too 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.130
 decrease your testosterone levels 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.260
 As a consequence of this it is possible that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.810
 you become less masculine doing that 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.640
