00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:34.880
 well ok I think it was really fun 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.440
 looks super easy to do and only today I 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.630
 I'm going to study for you a technique. 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.170
 We have a lot of people who 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.920
 ask me how this little French girl is? 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.600
 Mayor was like you 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.829
 Can you stay like that why you're doing this? 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.840
 I do not have coordination, I 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.879
 unfortunately or fortunately I have 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.440
 coordination to paint directly with the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.739
 There were a lot of people who did not 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.159
 they are until they finish little and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.110
 Well, it looks nice, I'll just pull you one. 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.490
 elastic this one is an elastic pink 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.840
 that I have these may have that 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.170
 normal paper 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.159
 Kiss is maybe even better than this one. 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.030
 O thick and actually I made people 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.939
 was 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 already the enamel ride yesterday causes and so 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.170
 without anything 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.479
 Yesterday and today I will make francesinha 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.390
 so who wants to do on the spot 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.270
 unfortunately you can not use it if these 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.520
 lines you can not wear the elastic because 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.799
 I think it will put it like this on the nail and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.390
 weibo raspÃ£o underneath will have to do 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.270
 do not compensate 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.090
 now who has the patience to wait 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.159
 dry at the same time the next day 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.140
 just do it and do it 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.780
 francesinha as better still 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.200
 people that the nail will not have anything there 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.930
 you so does paints white tip 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.140
 and then I pass brighter enamel by 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.509
 It's up, it's perfect, it 's us, it's better. 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.390
 even the best was the time to use 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.970
 so it's very easy for you to live more or 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 less to both of you want to leave 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.170
 your fingernail to paint you put that 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.750
 the elastic and sure that against it there 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.240
 You get your nail polish. 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.770
 I get it here, it does not get too many people. 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.660
 All this because there is still enough 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:33.990
 thing in the brush and I pass here leave 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:36.500
 well retinha and I happen here at the tip 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.500

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.080
 You see, look, I just happened in the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.030
 tip 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.970
 now I just carefully 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:14.580

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.580

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:26.940
 all the nails were also staid 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:40.839
 the extra super easy to do it only 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:44.259
 using the elastic is put on the nail in a 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:46.930
 safe place so it is with another 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.029
 finger paints very easy 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:57.029
 the only thing I can do and then to 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:57.029
 finish takes its extra brightness and passes 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.520
