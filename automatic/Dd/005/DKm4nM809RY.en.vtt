to the treble section the upper part of
the<00:00:14.730> piano<00:00:15.080> also<00:00:16.080> three<00:00:16.350> strings<00:00:16.800> per<00:00:17.039> note

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the piano also three strings per note

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.820 
the piano also three strings per note
that<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.700> to<00:00:17.970> say<00:00:18.180> three<00:00:18.930> strings<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.500> tuned

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that is to say three strings are tuned

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.330 
that is to say three strings are tuned
to<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> same<00:00:20.640> pitch<00:00:21.439> to<00:00:22.439> produce<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.920> sounds

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to the same pitch to produce the sounds

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.730 
to the same pitch to produce the sounds
happens<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> G<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:25.349> I<00:00:25.470> walk<00:00:25.710> through

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
happens to be a G so as I walk through

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.460 
happens to be a G so as I walk through
going<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.910> by<00:00:27.060> half<00:00:27.300> steps<00:00:33.200> here<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
going up by half steps here we have a

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.940 
going up by half steps here we have a
distinct<00:00:34.980> warble<00:00:35.400> in<00:00:35.490> the<00:00:35.580> note<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:37.590> take<00:00:37.800> our

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
distinct warble in the note we take our

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.700 
distinct warble in the note we take our
mute<00:00:38.330> set<00:00:39.330> it<00:00:39.420> against<00:00:39.720> one<00:00:40.080> of<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> either

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
mute set it against one of the either

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.160 
mute set it against one of the either
the<00:00:40.980> left<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.400> string<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the left or right string and we have the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.140 
the left or right string and we have the
left<00:00:46.380> stream<00:00:46.620> muted<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.940> hear<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
left stream muted out and we hear a

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.640 
left stream muted out and we hear a
pretty<00:00:48.420> good<00:00:48.600> horrible<00:00:48.990> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> right<00:00:49.320> string

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
pretty good horrible in the right string

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.610 
pretty good horrible in the right string
so<00:00:50.010> we're<00:00:50.130> going<00:00:50.310> to<00:00:51.050> put<00:00:52.050> our<00:00:52.140> tuning<00:00:52.500> hammer

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so we're going to put our tuning hammer

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.320 
so we're going to put our tuning hammer
on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> chorus<00:00:53.400> bus<00:00:53.720> corresponding<00:00:54.720> pin

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
on the chorus bus corresponding pin

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:05.780 
on the chorus bus corresponding pin
until<00:01:01.520> it<00:01:02.520> sound<00:01:02.790> equalizes<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.640> we

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
until it sound equalizes and there we

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.039 
until it sound equalizes and there we
are<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.539> listen<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.929> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
are now we're going to listen to the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.440 
are now we're going to listen to the
other<00:01:07.170> string<00:01:07.500> against<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> middle<00:01:08.179> and<00:01:09.179> it's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
other string against the middle and it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
other string against the middle and it's
even<00:01:09.750> worse<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.259> we're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.469> to<00:01:10.590> pull<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> up

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
even worse so we're going to pull it up

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.459 
even worse so we're going to pull it up
again<00:01:11.909> we're<00:01:12.119> pulling<00:01:12.479> towards<00:01:12.899> us<00:01:13.079> to<00:01:13.289> bring

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
again we're pulling towards us to bring

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:23.450 
again we're pulling towards us to bring
the<00:01:13.590> pitch<00:01:13.740> higher<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> there<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.429> have

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the pitch higher and there we have

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.899 
the pitch higher and there we have
another<00:01:23.789> warble<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> string<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:26.490> happens

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
another warble on the string it happens

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:37.309 
another warble on the string it happens
to<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.630> left<00:01:28.020> string<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.170> then<00:01:37.170> we

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
to be the left string and then we

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.249 
to be the left string and then we
equalize<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.859> so<00:01:38.700> any<00:01:38.999> any<00:01:39.270> note<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.899> does<00:01:40.079> not

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
equalize it so any any note the does not

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.039 
equalize it so any any note the does not
sound<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.679> to<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:40.979> ear<00:01:41.329> can<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.600> examined

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
sound good to your ear can be examined

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.569 
sound good to your ear can be examined
by<00:01:43.499> isolating<00:01:44.280> strings<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.569> a<00:01:45.600> mute<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
by isolating strings with a mute and

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.840 
by isolating strings with a mute and
listening<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.609> notes<00:01:48.179> against<00:01:48.569> each<00:01:48.689> other

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
listening to notes against each other

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.219 
listening to notes against each other
for<00:01:50.850> instance<00:01:51.090> 2<00:01:51.329> a's<00:01:51.479> against<00:01:51.899> each<00:01:52.020> other

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
for instance 2 a's against each other

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.260 
for instance 2 a's against each other
make<00:01:52.499> sure<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.889> in<00:01:52.979> tune<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:53.609> then<00:01:54.090> every

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
make sure it's in tune and then every

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.059 
make sure it's in tune and then every
week<00:01:54.450> checking<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.530> each<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.889> these<00:01:56.009> three

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
week checking that each of these three

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:06.520 
week checking that each of these three
strings<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.090> tune<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.719> itself
