00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
quite interesting one as the fight caves

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
quite interesting one as the fight caves
and<00:00:43.559> they've<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.250> made<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> small<00:00:44.730> little

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and they've just made a small little

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.270 
and they've just made a small little
nerve<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:46.140> let<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.590> back<00:00:47.250> in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
nerve that would let you go back in

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
nerve that would let you go back in
straight<00:00:47.879> away<00:00:47.910> after<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.450> leave<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> it's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
straight away after you leave and it's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.529 
straight away after you leave and it's
actually<00:00:49.860> broken<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.520> lot<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> fake<00:00:51.059> cake<00:00:51.270> bots

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
actually broken a lot of fake cake bots

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.910 
actually broken a lot of fake cake bots
so<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:51.960> apparently<00:00:52.410> there's<00:00:52.590> loads<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.800> fake

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
so I'm apparently there's loads of fake

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.080 
so I'm apparently there's loads of fake
cave<00:00:53.160> bar<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.640> standing<00:00:53.969> outside

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
cave bar it's just standing outside

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
cave bar it's just standing outside
clicking<00:00:54.629> try<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:56.219> not

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
clicking try to get in and it's not

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
clicking try to get in and it's not
working<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.539> let's<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> funny<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
working so I'm let's get a funny but I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
working so I'm let's get a funny but I
get<00:00:59.039> back<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> pool<00:00:59.550> there's<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.210> believe

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
get back to the pool there's I believe

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
get back to the pool there's I believe
nineteen<00:01:00.809> questions<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.800> they're<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.039> just

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
nineteen questions and they're all just

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.520 
nineteen questions and they're all just
really<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.719> useful<00:01:04.019> things<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really are just really useful things so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440 
really are just really useful things so
I'll<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.369> go<00:01:05.670> through<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:05.939> all<00:01:06.060> slowly<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
I'll just go through them all slowly so

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
I'll just go through them all slowly so
the<00:01:06.600> first<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.020> chat<00:01:07.560> box<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the first one is a chat box one and it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
the first one is a chat box one and it
just<00:01:08.670> lets<00:01:08.880> their<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> text<00:01:09.540> wrap<00:01:09.780> around

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
just lets their the text wrap around

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
just lets their the text wrap around
rather<00:01:10.500> than<00:01:10.880> being<00:01:11.880> cut<00:01:12.090> off<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.390> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
rather than being cut off because I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
rather than being cut off because I
noticed<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> old-school<00:01:13.470> window<00:01:13.860> it's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
noticed that the old-school window it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
noticed that the old-school window it's
a<00:01:14.400> little<00:01:14.580> bit<00:01:14.700> smaller<00:01:14.939> than<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.299> EOC

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a little bit smaller than the EOC

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.820 
a little bit smaller than the EOC
windows<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.200> you're<00:01:16.229> talking<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> player

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
windows when you're talking to a player

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
windows when you're talking to a player
in<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> EOC<00:01:17.299> if<00:01:18.299> you've<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.659> long<00:01:18.869> message

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
in the EOC if you've got a long message

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
in the EOC if you've got a long message
it'll<00:01:19.470> obviously<00:01:19.560> wrap<00:01:19.920> around<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.369> them<00:01:20.520> but

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it'll obviously wrap around for them but

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.310 
it'll obviously wrap around for them but
if<00:01:21.119> they're<00:01:21.240> taken<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> old

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
if they're taken to you on the old

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.660 
if they're taken to you on the old
school<00:01:22.619> server<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.189> their<00:01:23.310> messages

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
school server a lot of their messages

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
school server a lot of their messages
will<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.909> cut<00:01:24.090> off<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.259> won't

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
will get cut off and you know they won't

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
remember that that gets cut off at your

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.850 
remember that that gets cut off at your
screen<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:28.229> second<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
screen and the second one is just a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
screen and the second one is just a
security<00:01:29.189> issue<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.180> bank<00:01:30.390> pin

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
security issue with the the bank pin

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
security issue with the the bank pin
which<00:01:30.750> i<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.170> officer<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> good<00:01:32.100> choice

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
which i think is officer a good choice

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.429 
which i think is officer a good choice
and<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.570> everything<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:34.140> actually

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and I think everything has actually

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
and I think everything has actually
reached<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.829> cut<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.250> 75<00:01:35.790> percent<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.360> I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
reached the cut off of 75 percent so I

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.640 
reached the cut off of 75 percent so I
think<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:37.020> updates<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.530> go

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
think all of these updates will go

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800 
think all of these updates will go
through<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.479> know<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.720> right

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
through but that you know that's right

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.210 
through but that you know that's right
enough<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:40.290> they're<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.920> useful

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
enough then they're all really useful

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
enough then they're all really useful
stuff<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.700> there's<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> couple<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> clan<00:01:42.720> chat

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960

the<00:03:26.879> animation<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.389> mining<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.780> give<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.139> a

really<00:03:28.409> weird<00:03:28.680> long<00:03:29.609> slow<00:03:30.239> innovation<00:03:30.900> so

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
really weird long slow innovation so

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.089 
really weird long slow innovation so
they're<00:03:31.139> going<00:03:31.259> to<00:03:31.319> be<00:03:31.409> changing<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.919> with

they're going to be changing that with

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.890 
they're going to be changing that with
the<00:03:32.220> older<00:03:32.549> one<00:03:32.729> and<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:33.540> yeah<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.780> think

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
the older one and that yeah I think

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.559 
the older one and that yeah I think
that's<00:03:34.169> a<00:03:34.290> pretty<00:03:34.439> nice<00:03:34.680> update<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:36.000> question
