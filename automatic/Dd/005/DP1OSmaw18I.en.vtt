00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.559
 hi everyone is welcome on the 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.209
 nonsense to heat l today I 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.460
 offers a recipe for a burger 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.320
 fried chickens with homemade rose sauce 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.259
 you will see how delicious it is 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.970
 party we start at too much 7 while preparing 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.040
 the pink sauce so you're going to put a 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.590
 egg yolk in a small bowl on there 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.180
 then add some mustard and there you 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.010
 emulsify so either with a 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.230
 little fork a little little whip 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.149
 does it matter how well you mix this sauce 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.920
 then we will add oil 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.540
 vegetable so here I took two oil 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.429
 of sunflower but you can use 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.460
 if you want it for example from 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.920
 grape seed oil continues 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.079
 by adding some catch up you mix 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.679
 new is added salt and 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.659
 pepper 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.640
 and to finish a few drops of 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.079
 tabasco so if you like that these are 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.569
 a little bit higher you add one 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.859
 little more so you put back langer 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:01.479
 one last time this little sauce and 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.879
 then we will take care of the burger 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.260
 you are going to have the hamburger bread 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.750
 you grill both slices 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.210
 then on the bottom edge we go 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.790
 add our famous pink sauce 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.090
 a small slice of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.790
 cheddar and then add some 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.530
 salad leaves the fried chicken then 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.659
 that's it I just made 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.399
 chicken strips I rolled them in 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.960
 breadcrumbs and did cook in 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.110
 a little bit of oil so the principle of 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.270
 no gets so then you place your 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.719
 pieces of fried chicken added 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.820
 then slices of tomatoes on there 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.060
 add a slice of cheese again 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.600
 and then we finish with the sauce and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.219
 the bread so the top of the burger here 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.560
 so cros is over it was really 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.210
 super good there are the raw vegetables that are 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.430
 very fresh the chicken that is 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.500
 crisp and the pink source that is 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.329
 really delicious really needs

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.479
