00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.010
 we purposely simulated a closed one 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.270
 the door will lock the regular lock 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.170
 otherwise the blockers do not advance 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.079
 passes open door control when 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.550
 arming of the standard system 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:35.680
 blockers are extended when removing 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.200
 standard systems if the label is in 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.770
 action area blockers instantly 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.770
 cleaned up 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.470
 when arming from regular 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.910
 remote lock locks hood 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.820
 as well as upper door locks 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.250
 the indicator shows the status of the locks 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.970
 hood bottom indicator shows 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.390
 state 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.260
 pins after arming 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.240
 indicators after 15 seconds go out 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.240
 specifically so as not to attract attention 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.289
 when disarming 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.360
 from the regular key happens instantly and 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.380
 cognizing the label which is located 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.110
 car owner if the label is in range 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.540
 4 automatically open on the display 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.239
 you can see that the pins have opened the hood locks 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.030
 will open after the ignition is turned on and 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.300
 input personal pin code on the buttons 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.300
 steering wheel 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:38.830
 after entering the code if the cat is correct hood 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:42.130
 also unlocked try 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.620
 forcibly push the blocker into 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.390
 Intelligent security mode 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.390
 the controller will immediately remove it back 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.690
 if in guard mode try 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.200
 push the lock intellectual 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.280
 the system turns on the alarm and retracts 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.280
 back lock 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.550
 in case when disarming 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.680
 the bollard did not open the first time 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.300
 for example in winter after washing in return 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.940
 the part got into something water and spire 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.430
 a little prize we shoot save 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.680
 hand obsessed blocker that is any 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.980
 case he is trying to build up with us 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:46.570
 open that is the moment 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:48.490
 blocker opened discharge case 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.390
 the main battery then the owner has 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.710
 opportunity to speak open the car 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.200
 using emergency module 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.650
 activated jam module by pressing 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:05.290
 regular boot opening button 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:09.190
 12 get involved in the emergency module 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.390
 serves as a central brake light emergency 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:17.980
 the module is activated and we will be personal 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.580
 pin code default 1 2 3 4 1 digit 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.060
 accepted 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.060
 one 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:31.430
 one-two-three one-two-three four 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.680
 if the PIN code is entered incorrectly indicator 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.139
 light up constantly after that 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.240
 it is necessary to execute one command to the sea 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.780
 emergency opens four drivers and 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.539
 hood locks all command fulfilled 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.910
 you can freely settlement attempt 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:55.940
 pin code blocking device 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:57.949
 an hour if both are discharged 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.409
 battery car owner has 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.960
 opportunity to get out from under the bumper 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.750
 special wire so -called loop 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.169
 and energize the emergency module 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.759
 outside the car 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.889
 the loop is made in the form of two wires 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:16.550
 same color to the car owner 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.360
 nothing messed up the food is not served 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.360
 respecting polarity
