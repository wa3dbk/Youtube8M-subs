wide version and they've got a couple

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.839 
wide version and they've got a couple
different<00:00:20.380> varieties<00:00:20.739> one<00:00:21.069> that's<00:00:21.279> 1080

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
different varieties one that's 1080

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.609 
different varieties one that's 1080
pixels<00:00:22.239> in<00:00:22.659> vertical<00:00:23.050> height<00:00:23.199> and<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:23.499> other

pixels in vertical height and the other

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.040 
pixels in vertical height and the other
one<00:00:23.769> that's<00:00:23.859> 1440<00:00:24.640> and<00:00:24.789> this<00:00:25.390> one's<00:00:25.599> using<00:00:25.899> the

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
one that's 1440 and this one's using the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.279 
one that's 1440 and this one's using the
LG<00:00:26.409> IPS<00:00:26.829> panel<00:00:27.249> that<00:00:27.399> is<00:00:27.519> 1080<00:00:28.210> vertically<00:00:29.079> so

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
LG IPS panel that is 1080 vertically so

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.559 
LG IPS panel that is 1080 vertically so
it's<00:00:29.439> 2560<00:00:30.189> by<00:00:30.429> 1080<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.119> that<00:00:31.269> does<00:00:31.539> require

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:31.569 
it's 2560 by 1080 and that does require

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.650 
it's 2560 by 1080 and that does require
a<00:00:32.110> dual<00:00:32.529> link<00:00:32.770> DVI<00:00:33.190> connector<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:34.000> in<00:00:34.510> fact

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
a dual link DVI connector and in fact

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.300 
a dual link DVI connector and in fact
that's<00:00:34.900> the<00:00:34.990> only<00:00:35.080> connector<00:00:35.920> that<00:00:36.040> you<00:00:36.130> have

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
that's the only connector that you have

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.560 
that's the only connector that you have
on<00:00:36.460> this<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:36.730> you're<00:00:36.880> basically<00:00:37.240> plug<00:00:37.450> it

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
on this so you're basically plug it

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.060 
on this so you're basically plug it
straight<00:00:37.660> into<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:37.990> panel<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.650> sometimes

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
straight into the panel that sometimes

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.710 
straight into the panel that sometimes
can<00:00:39.250> cut<00:00:39.400> down<00:00:39.520> on<00:00:39.700> a<00:00:39.730> little<00:00:40.240> bit<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:40.510> lag

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
can cut down on a little bit of the lag

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.210 
can cut down on a little bit of the lag
let's<00:00:41.200> go<00:00:41.290> over<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.590> specs<00:00:41.920> and<00:00:41.980> then<00:00:42.130> I'll

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
let's go over the specs and then I'll

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.350 
let's go over the specs and then I'll
tell<00:00:42.310> you<00:00:42.400> what<00:00:42.490> I<00:00:42.550> think<00:00:42.730> about<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:43.030> so<00:00:43.180> of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
tell you what I think about it so of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.240 
tell you what I think about it so of
course<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.660> is<00:00:43.720> an<00:00:43.900> IPS<00:00:44.350> display<00:00:44.380> giving<00:00:45.070> you

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
course this is an IPS display giving you

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.290 
course this is an IPS display giving you
really<00:00:45.370> good<00:00:45.460> viewing<00:00:45.790> angles<00:00:46.180> they

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
really good viewing angles they

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.180 
really good viewing angles they
advertise<00:00:46.630> 178<00:00:47.500> and<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.740> looks<00:00:47.890> good<00:00:48.040> from

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
advertise 178 and it looks good from

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.370 
advertise 178 and it looks good from
just<00:00:48.400> about<00:00:48.550> all<00:00:48.790> angles<00:00:49.330> I<00:00:49.540> also<00:00:49.990> noticed

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
just about all angles I also noticed

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.410 
just about all angles I also noticed
that<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.680> backlight<00:00:51.130> bleed<00:00:51.340> was<00:00:51.700> minimal<00:00:52.240> in

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
that the backlight bleed was minimal in

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.030 
that the backlight bleed was minimal in
fact<00:00:52.630> better<00:00:52.870> than<00:00:52.990> some<00:00:53.350> of<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.560> 16<00:00:53.860> by<00:00:54.010> 9

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
fact better than some of the 16 by 9

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.700 
fact better than some of the 16 by 9

milliseconds<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.550> I<00:00:57.880> did<00:00:58.060> find<00:00:58.270> this<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.480> be

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.960 
milliseconds and I did find this to be
pretty<00:00:58.810> adequate<00:00:59.290> for<00:00:59.590> games<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.190> size<00:01:00.760> of

just<00:01:17.979> about<00:01:18.159> any<00:01:18.369> major<00:01:18.780> name-brand<00:01:19.780> bezel

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
just about any major name-brand bezel

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.499 
just about any major name-brand bezel
that<00:01:20.499> I've<00:01:20.679> felt<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.189> also<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.789> sides<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
that I've felt and also the sides of the

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.349 
that I've felt and also the sides of the
bezel<00:01:22.689> are<00:01:22.990> almost<00:01:23.649> non-existent<00:01:24.009> there<00:01:24.909> it's

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
bezel are almost non-existent there it's

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.879 
bezel are almost non-existent there it's
just<00:01:25.689> like<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.929> edge<00:01:26.079> of<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.319> panel<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.710> what

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:26.889 
just like the edge of the panel is what

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.069 
just like the edge of the panel is what
you<00:01:27.009> get<00:01:27.249> now<00:01:27.819> the<00:01:27.939> I<00:01:28.299> guess<00:01:28.479> vertical<00:01:28.899> size

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
you get now the I guess vertical size

adding<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.120> soon<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.660> here<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:23.060> know

slightly but as of now this version is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.130 
slightly but as of now this version is
not<00:02:28.520> visa<00:02:28.760> compatible<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:29.780> that's<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.019> big

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
not visa compatible so if that's a big

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.870 
not visa compatible so if that's a big
deal<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:31.250> know<00:02:31.340> take<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.700> into
