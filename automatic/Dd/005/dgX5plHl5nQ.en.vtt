00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.650
 video to teach them especially to 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.480
 women who do not know how to turn on a 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.099
 automobile with charger in small house 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.259
 I have two women and I am often followed 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.029
 They are talking to as you do to learn 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:25.180
 the car with the charger when not 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.180
 they light is very simple very easy 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.370
 it gets what is the positive the cable 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.150
 red with red battery red with the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.150
 charger red 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.200
 then the black that is 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.860
 negative of the charger with the black 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.860
 negative battery 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.269
 once it is already connected 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:01:00.670
 charger has a button that says here 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:03.250
 to charge or shutdown or be that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.540
 is to begin with to be able to light 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 the car then puts the position of 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.930
 be and then already fauno and turn on the car 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.910
 once the car is already on it 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:35.020
 it turns off the negative one and already 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.020
 then the positive 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.810
 and that's how simple it turns on fast 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.509
 automobile with charger 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.500
 he puts himself in the position of being for 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.610
 I can learn it 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.390
 it's off this is to charge when 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.390
 they will charge a battery 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.740
 in this position you have to put the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.930
 charger in being when you want not 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.230
 quickly learn a car that has the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.800
 battery discharged and the cable is put 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.290
 red with red battery cable 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.220
 black with the black battery 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.140
 negative positive positive 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.030

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.310
