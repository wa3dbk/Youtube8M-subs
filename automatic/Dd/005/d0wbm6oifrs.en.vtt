because<00:02:07.759> i<00:02:08.599> find<00:02:09.050> my<00:02:09.920> brushes<00:02:10.220> more<00:02:10.670> efficient

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
because i find my brushes more efficient

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.509 
because i find my brushes more efficient
to<00:02:11.450> create<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.200> look<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:12.769> i<00:02:12.800> hope<00:02:13.190> she<00:02:13.400> will

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
to create this look so i hope she will

to create this look so i hope she will
like<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.849> load<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:15.170> mini-review<00:02:15.680> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
like this load and this mini-review and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.400 
like this load and this mini-review and
the<00:02:16.550> let's<00:02:17.000> begin<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.760> already<00:02:20.450> moisturize

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the let's begin so I already moisturize

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.380 
the let's begin so I already moisturize
my<00:02:21.620> skin<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.099> now<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:22.549> applying<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:23.239> little

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
my skin and now I'm applying a little

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.210 
my skin and now I'm applying a little
bit<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.750> foundation<00:02:23.930> because<00:02:24.620> as<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.010> can<00:02:25.069> see

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
bit of foundation because as you can see

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.270 
bit of foundation because as you can see
if<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.760> some<00:02:26.000> witnesses<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:27.080> some<00:02:27.860> people

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
if I have some witnesses and some people

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.300 
if I have some witnesses and some people
so<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.970> has<00:02:29.209> me<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.870> even<00:02:30.200> out<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.590> skin<00:02:31.010> tone

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
so it has me to even out the skin tone

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.559 
so it has me to even out the skin tone
and<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:33.500> think<00:02:33.860> this<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.069> really<00:02:34.670> important

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
and I think this is really important

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.449 
and I think this is really important
especially<00:02:35.720> for<00:02:36.170> me<00:02:36.440> because<00:02:36.739> i<00:02:36.860> have<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:37.099> many

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.979 
especially for me because i have so many
freckles<00:02:38.140> then<00:02:39.140> when<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.799> everywhere
