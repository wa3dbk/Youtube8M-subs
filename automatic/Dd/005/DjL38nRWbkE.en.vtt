00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
in a wider sense of breaking down

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.660 
in a wider sense of breaking down
barriers<00:00:38.809> between<00:00:39.350> what<00:00:39.829> people's<00:00:40.190> views<00:00:40.460> of

they're about and how little they can do
and<00:00:45.019> there's<00:00:45.170> actually<00:00:45.440> broken<00:00:45.769> that<00:00:45.890> down

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and there's actually broken that down

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.360 
and there's actually broken that down
and<00:00:46.280> people<00:00:46.610> seeing<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:47.000> actually<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:49.129> vast

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
and people seeing that actually the vast

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.979
