 available 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.200
 The PC Games hardware editors now have a complete PC based on this CPU 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.669
 Conti goutiert 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.960
 So that the PC has a very good value for money

 Concrete performance in comparison to the older Intel processors 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 same beat can be increased by up to 20 percent 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.180

 the igloo Krüger II Kl Alpenföhn Großglockner performs like the 530 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.970
 Watt power supply of the loyalty keeps doing good and above all quiet

 Work from a distance of only 50 centimeters we measure just 0 com 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.220
 at new sound respectively 28 the kind in demanding 3d-play 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.620
 If the value rises to 1, there are seven sonatas, especially at the VW 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.050
 announced 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.240
 also the used Samsung hard disk from the f2 series is very quiet 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.790
 and that only works with 5400 revolutions per minute 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.730
 the capacity is 1000 free again 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.480
 of course with the most important thing in this pc is the government has the 69 50

 graphic card 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.670
 operated with 2048 MB of memory 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.300
 even at memory was not saved used 2 currently 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.690
 are then 30 modules 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.320
 with 2 gigabytes each 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 at the motherboard we have a Gigabyte motherboard with Hartz IV 7 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.390
 Express chip set decided 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 If necessary, that is also supported 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.430
 the houses by the at the front and back ensure a good
