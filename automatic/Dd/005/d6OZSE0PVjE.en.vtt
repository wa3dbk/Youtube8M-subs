episode<00:00:02.760> 12<00:00:03.090> now<00:00:03.330> this<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.780> me<00:00:03.929> felt<00:00:04.170> like<00:00:04.410> the

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
episode 12 now this to me felt like the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.639 
episode 12 now this to me felt like the
slowest<00:00:05.250> episode<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.180> entire<00:00:06.569> series<00:00:07.230> so

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
slowest episode of the entire series so

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.640 
slowest episode of the entire series so
far<00:00:07.680> wasn't<00:00:08.370> overly<00:00:08.960> unbearably<00:00:09.960> slow<00:00:10.260> but<00:00:10.530> as

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
far wasn't overly unbearably slow but as

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.870 
far wasn't overly unbearably slow but as
compared<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> all<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.190> other<00:00:11.309> episode<00:00:11.700> it

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
compared to all the other episode it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
compared to all the other episode it
felt<00:00:12.540> slow<00:00:13.080> now<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.160> went<00:00:14.820> back<00:00:15.030> into<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> manga

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
felt slow now I went back into the manga

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.720 
felt slow now I went back into the manga
because<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.410> didn't<00:00:16.710> even<00:00:16.890> remember<00:00:17.100> some<00:00:17.699> of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
because I didn't even remember some of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.400 
because I didn't even remember some of
the<00:00:17.850> stuff<00:00:18.090> even<00:00:18.359> happening<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.230> manga

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the stuff even happening in the manga

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.890 
the stuff even happening in the manga
and<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.640> happened<00:00:21.090> there<00:00:21.539> was<00:00:21.689> no

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and it all happened there was no

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
and it all happened there was no
straight<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> filler<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.980> episode<00:00:23.250> but

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
straight a filler in this episode but

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.519 
straight a filler in this episode but
some<00:00:25.160> parts<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.599> manga<00:00:27.599> were<00:00:27.840> were<00:00:28.230> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
some parts of the manga were were just

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.089 
some parts of the manga were were just
really<00:00:29.449> expanded<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:31.140> episode<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
really expanded in this episode like the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
really expanded in this episode like the
scene<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.669> Aaron<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.239> his<00:00:33.360> house<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.899> his

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
scene with Aaron in his house with his

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
scene with Aaron in his house with his
mom<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.410> dad<00:00:34.590> Mikasa<00:00:35.070> they<00:00:35.880> showed<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
mom and dad Mikasa they showed that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
mom and dad Mikasa they showed that
throughout<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.899> entire<00:00:37.140> episode<00:00:37.649> way<00:00:38.100> more

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
throughout this entire episode way more

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.220 
throughout this entire episode way more
than<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.210> manga<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
than it was in the manga I think that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.090 
than it was in the manga I think that
slowed<00:00:40.980> down<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.579> overall<00:00:41.940> feel<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.660> whole

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
slowed down the overall feel the whole

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.529 
slowed down the overall feel the whole
episode<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.430> continuously<00:00:45.030> showing<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
episode just continuously showing that I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.869 
episode just continuously showing that I
don't<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.110> bad<00:00:46.469> necessarily<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
don't think it was bad necessarily it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
don't think it was bad necessarily it
was<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.239> made<00:00:48.539> everything<00:00:48.809> feel<00:00:49.200> kind<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
was just made everything feel kind of

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
was just made everything feel kind of
slow<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.329> another<00:00:51.329> thing<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.750> made<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> feel

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
slow and another thing that made it feel

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
slow and another thing that made it feel
kind<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.350> slow<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> ending<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.340> pretty

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
insane and man that was definitely the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.610 
insane and man that was definitely the
most<00:03:51.150> intense<00:03:51.570> partly<00:03:51.870> episode<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.290> did<00:03:52.530> not

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
most intense partly episode that did not

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.080 
most intense partly episode that did not
feel<00:03:52.860> slow<00:03:53.130> at<00:03:53.280> all<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.700> felt<00:03:53.940> awesome

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
feel slow at all that felt awesome

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.820 
feel slow at all that felt awesome
especially<00:03:54.600> at<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.020> when<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.350> Titans<00:03:55.710> were

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
especially at it when the Titans were

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.590 
especially at it when the Titans were
attacking<00:03:56.190> as<00:03:56.490> well<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.910> didn't<00:03:57.150> feel<00:03:57.240> slow

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
attacking as well that didn't feel slow

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.080 
attacking as well that didn't feel slow
just<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.470> Aaron<00:03:58.890> parts<00:03:59.280> kind<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.700> felt<00:03:59.910> slow

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
just the Aaron parts kind of felt slow

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.610 
just the Aaron parts kind of felt slow
but<00:04:00.240> everything<00:04:00.570> else<00:04:00.720> was<00:04:00.840> really<00:04:01.080> on<00:04:01.350> point

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
but everything else was really on point

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.000 
but everything else was really on point
and<00:04:02.660> now<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:04.050> just<00:04:04.200> was<00:04:04.500> great<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.800> think

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
and now it was just was great I think

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
and now it was just was great I think
the<00:04:05.130> elite<00:04:05.430> team<00:04:05.840> their<00:04:06.840> whole<00:04:08.030> conversation

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
the elite team their whole conversation

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.390 
the elite team their whole conversation
and<00:04:09.270> sort<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.570> debates<00:04:09.960> was<00:04:10.380> okay<00:04:10.950> i<00:04:11.190> think

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
and sort of debates was okay i think

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.610 
and sort of debates was okay i think
wasn't<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.360> best<00:04:12.510> dialogue<00:04:12.780> we've<00:04:13.140> seen<00:04:13.410> it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
wasn't the best dialogue we've seen it

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.740 
wasn't the best dialogue we've seen it
wasn't<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.520> most<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:15.000> know<00:04:15.120> intense<00:04:15.510> it

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
wasn't the most you know intense it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.450 
wasn't the most you know intense it
wasn't<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.020> most<00:04:16.200> really<00:04:16.530> anything<00:04:17.010> was<00:04:17.280> just

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
wasn't the most really anything was just

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.010 
wasn't the most really anything was just
it<00:04:17.580> was<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:17.730> kind<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.150> was<00:04:18.600> pretty<00:04:18.810> good

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
it was just kind of it was pretty good

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.860 
it was just kind of it was pretty good
but<00:04:19.350> nothing<00:04:19.650> too<00:04:19.980> special<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.580> did<00:04:21.359> enjoy<00:04:21.720> it

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
but nothing too special I did enjoy it

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.420 
but nothing too special I did enjoy it
though<00:04:22.080> seeing<00:04:22.410> more<00:04:22.680> with<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.919> personalized

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
though seeing more with the personalized

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.850 
though seeing more with the personalized
the<00:04:23.610> care

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
the care

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.439 
the care
it<00:04:24.159> was<00:04:24.280> really<00:04:24.400> cool<00:04:24.639> when<00:04:24.939> they<00:04:25.090> decide<00:04:25.419> to

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
it was really cool when they decide to

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.070 
it was really cool when they decide to
protect<00:04:26.110> Aaron<00:04:26.439> because<00:04:26.939> of<00:04:27.939> the<00:04:28.539> possibility

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
protect Aaron because of the possibility

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.369 
protect Aaron because of the possibility
he<00:04:29.530> holds<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:30.099> how<00:04:30.400> he<00:04:30.460> could<00:04:30.879> be<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.120> key<00:04:31.449> to

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
he holds and how he could be a key to

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:33.839 
he holds and how he could be a key to
saving<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.979> human<00:04:33.009> race<00:04:33.340> because<00:04:33.729> they

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
saving the human race because they

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.490 
saving the human race because they
really<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.210> nothing<00:04:34.389> else<00:04:34.719> and<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.379> was

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
really have nothing else and that was

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.839 
really have nothing else and that was
pretty<00:04:35.680> cool<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.919> see<00:04:36.009> but<00:04:36.280> overall<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.699> think

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
pretty cool to see but overall I think

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.969 
pretty cool to see but overall I think
that<00:04:37.240> might<00:04:37.389> dragged<00:04:37.990> on<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.169> bit<00:04:38.289> too<00:04:38.560> long<00:04:38.740> as

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
that might dragged on a bit too long as

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.309 
that might dragged on a bit too long as
well<00:04:39.159> and<00:04:40.650> yeah<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.370> overall<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:43.810> episode<00:04:44.289> I

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
well and yeah so overall this episode I

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.309 
well and yeah so overall this episode I
