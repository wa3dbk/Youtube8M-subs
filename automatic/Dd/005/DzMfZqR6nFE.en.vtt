00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.339
 Israeli shar elga welcome this 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.139
 new video here on my channel are 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.990
 corbucci and we are on minecraft cloths o 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.759
 then the latest episodes can be found on 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.840
 sbucci channel because we have had 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.189
 some small problems of 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.990
 publication with timetables and so on 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.480
 so instead of finding just one of them 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
 find two then in the case below 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.180
 are the links to go and watch the videos 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.340
 that you missed 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.289
 we found ourselves in this cave in 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.880
 how we had gone in search of a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.059
 village that we obviously don't have 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 found but saw that the night was long 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.460
 bad and also quite bitchy 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 we decided to throw ourselves in and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.129
 to dig like we know how to do 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:53.370
 light because the holes of the red not by chance 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.020
 so watch over that there are problems 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.780
 we have to go to the urologist buci 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.820
 still not worth it took me a year 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.930
 to explain I thought about it over time and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 for this take a place with that me 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.580
 there is no more space split split piles 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.110
 last March finding bottle 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.509
 that thanks to me have been captured and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.000
 I might actually accidentally not 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.240
 having seen them and they were only 4 diamonds 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.579
 in short we say that I saw for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.259
 perfect me then i still have here 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.860
 iron aspect was iron yes 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.479
 always always takes a good bruise me 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.540
 I still have to make armor in all this 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.479
 but where the hell did we come from? 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 I don't remember how we both have to go up 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.329
 from the golden sun type to do this 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.100
 ugly you know the social and barefoot 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.409
 a much more brutal, however, that 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.569
 whatever 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.039
 this part the episode to do it another 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:04.219
 the real part because there is no way that in 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:06.170
 this beautiful and debt collectors we finish of 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:10.459
 shooting this mega caver has never 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.200
 but there is another idea but it is dying but 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.470
 there is gold so wait for it 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.150
 I learn that he knows how to live these cistus 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.510
 some materials 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.989
 yes yes lapis lazuli rap of the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.579
 still record useful, however, we can 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.890
 make two bus watches so full of believe 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:34.220
 still today, to know that in the episode 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.530
 we will have finished one on the hole channel 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.640
 colony of probable creeper watch 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.310
 with those big eyes 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.569
 yes yes you remember it with you you remember 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.329
 what looked like an owl is true 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.250
 look at it and depressed accounts but there is a 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.920
 point and where we arrived 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.090
 but where did we get there? 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:00.019
 we are helped from there yes yes but now there 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.090
 come back quiet then I do 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.549
 so now this reason decides right 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.340
 towards the skeleton or left towards one 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.769
 light this connects us to the points 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.829
 then right towards death 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.900
 ok come with you i trust yours 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.579

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.660
 bucine never heard in the bible 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.090
 then there is a chapter called the 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.069
 boogie judgment then I wait and you 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.310
 I give the hand almost hobbs poses because sas 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:38.120

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.419
 less problems for us pur fact pour 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.419
 femme 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.870

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:54.019

 but because it is beautiful, perhaps it is not there 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:28.710
 they act like central and from those castles 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:32.550
