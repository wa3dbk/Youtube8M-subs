00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
this survived at the door and this is

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.699 
this survived at the door and this is
the<00:03:34.510> poster<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:34.959> we<00:03:35.170> were<00:03:35.230> supposed<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.590> call

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709

me<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.920> collector's<00:03:36.310> edition<00:03:36.700> my<00:03:37.480> for<00:03:37.690> would

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
me the collector's edition my for would

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.479 
me the collector's edition my for would
come<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.049> later<00:03:38.320> date<00:03:38.590> but<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:38.920> not<00:03:39.100> dark<00:03:39.310> now

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489
