00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone with you ivan in this video i 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.500
 first time to your music 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.429
 more precisely I will impose because with the music 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.519
 more fun than listening to my slurred voice 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.550
 so consider some viewers Well 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.890
 let's start in this video I will give you 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.789
 I want to show how to get free 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.680
 energy in minecraft with mod industrial 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 craft 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.289
 for example you killed someone from 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:37.440
 This player has dropped 5 geothermal 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:41.160
 5 generator to know and what 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.420
 do with these generators well no one 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.829
 know minecraft wiki climb all there 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.860
 will find the answer to all the video I do not understand 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.770
 and this thing is very good to me. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.870
 I strongly liked that energy can 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:04.640
 farm very much for example here and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.640
 all set to put set IMF 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.170
 so here you are all set 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.150
 there is no energy near there is no 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.150
 panels slightly wrong set 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.310
 in to so it will be here that's all set yes 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.800
 now i will take a voltmeter to measure 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:44.910
 what voltage will be and so fill 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:50.650
 our generators are ventral generators 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.840
 such capsules of glorious fame here we all 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.280
 filled up everything like generators let's 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.280
 let's see how the energy will be psigenerator 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.690
 Just see how it is 90 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:14.170
 Ampere as this is called not remember 90 8 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.670
 amp gives these five simple 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.500
 generators that feeds on live 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.840
 as you can see already look what came out 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 energy 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 come in who's 30 seconds is this 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.560
 cool way for newbies he you 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.510
 very suitable 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.540
 because 5 generators they are nothing 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.660
 very light craft is painted and as you can see 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.470
 in a minute 100,000 energies already 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.900
 it was a very good way 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.540
 that it is very useful for beginners in the game 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.770
 Well, I wanted to show you this 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.090
 small way how easy it is to farm 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.310
 energy thank you all put huskies 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.310
 subscribed channel to all bye
