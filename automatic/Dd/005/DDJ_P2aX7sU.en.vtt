ridiculous
well<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> guess<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.960> thought<00:00:25.170> behind<00:00:25.470> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
well I guess the the thought behind it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.950 
well I guess the the thought behind it
is<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.190> it's<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.030> like<00:00:27.210> peppermint<00:00:27.540> in<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
is that it's got like peppermint in it

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.260 
is that it's got like peppermint in it
so<00:00:28.500> something<00:00:28.920> happens<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.760> eyelids

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
so something happens with your eyelids

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.209 
so something happens with your eyelids
and<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.780> starts<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.140> tingle<00:00:31.440> you<00:00:31.680> get<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and when it starts to tingle you get the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.080 
and when it starts to tingle you get the
sensation<00:00:32.400> that<00:00:32.790> you're<00:00:33.090> drunk<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.140> stoned<00:00:35.090> no
