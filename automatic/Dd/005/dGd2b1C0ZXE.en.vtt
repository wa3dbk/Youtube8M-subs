 I am currently in the skype conversation 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.789

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 just behind in the responses and michael 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.929
 jai would you like to add something 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.649
 you know me 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.149
 video I have to say yes I know myself 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.530
 even now something else goes cells 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.450
 yes hey I've already said everything 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 so just leave behind in the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.179
 responses what you want what want to see what 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.689
 you want to see 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:48.479
 and that's it and it was a very fast one 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.279
 update video so post comment now 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.359
 I leave here another 10 seconds runner me 

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.950
 can type right here while we still 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.659
 see what goes on dicks 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.329
 it can just be anything people do 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.529
 just say minecraft or as you say 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.579
 just the four of us can sit on 

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:02.069
 Currently, four of us in game 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.299
 portal so I catch a red michael from 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.529
 times such a channel and so we can 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.219
 just minecraft do you think of 

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.259
 want to see 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.190
 maybe their assembly or something from call or 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.050
 duty because we probably have 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.560
 all are called playstation ball by michael 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.790
 on that simply fails and it is possible 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.350
 also completely different types of games 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.370
 his wok sauces might be so on 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.580
 At the moment we just don't know anymore 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.080
 we can handle this channel 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.820
 we have 3,000 subscribers and want to 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.260
 just make something fun out of it 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.490
 let me know in the comments and then i go 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.070
 have him exclude because I think so 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.710
 you could have typed immediately 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.510
 exactly, but yes' it just looks 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.000
 not like 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.230
 yes and a gap between us and arjan and erik 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.280
 it's for all for a good 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.330
 pronounced 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.520
 it is for the conscious choice of theirs 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.290
 been to second year at no portal 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.550
 leave have you 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.810
 channel 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.220
 being neurological is but seems 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.380
 maybe just think there for more 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.060
 time and that is why we go on and on 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.980
 yes it was then it was 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.300
 guys already thank you for looking and me 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.180
