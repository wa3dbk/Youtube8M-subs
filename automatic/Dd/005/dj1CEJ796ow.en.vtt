beautiful crunchy rhythm sound you know
and<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.069> is<00:02:37.129> you<00:02:37.849> can't<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.510> sound<00:02:38.780> with

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
and this is you can't get the sound with

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.990 
and this is you can't get the sound with
anything<00:02:39.470> else<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:40.730> great

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
anything else is this this is the great

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.759 
anything else is this this is the great
combination<00:02:41.629> of<00:02:41.780> p90s

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
combination of p90s

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.099 
combination of p90s
and<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:43.879> it's<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.299> single<00:02:44.569> coil<00:02:44.720> pickup

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
and so it's it's a single coil pickup

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.680 
and so it's it's a single coil pickup
but<00:02:45.230> still<00:02:45.829> has<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> lot<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.190> power<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.480> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
but still has a lot of power so it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.500 
but still has a lot of power so it
drives<00:02:48.260> damp<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.790> retains<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.329> lot<00:02:50.359> of

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
drives damp but it retains a lot of

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.370 
drives damp but it retains a lot of
clarity<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.829> it's<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.400> very<00:02:52.700> very<00:02:53.380> lively

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
clarity and it's a very very lively

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:12.160 
clarity and it's a very very lively
bluesy<00:02:55.220> instrument

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.530
