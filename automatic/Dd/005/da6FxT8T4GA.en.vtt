00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello friends are you watching the channel 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 apple inc is not and today we will talk like 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 free up memory reeling unnecessary 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.379
 files or some very heavy file and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.570
 file system on poppy that is on mac 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.930
 which we have ssd disks are some 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.910
 New MacBooks starting probably in 2012 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.189
 years about which ssd drives were used 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.439
 or aimaks in which ssd 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.510
 they have a file system divided into 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.899
 categories of audio video photo program 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.200
 some other archives in macbooks 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.010
 or aimax with flash drive ssd here 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.260
 this is different 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 for some reason, all users are facing 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.550
 with the error that she is very much 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.379
 taking the user's place is simply not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.570
 can understand what it is another why 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.309
 I personally take so much too 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.320
 I ran into this problem I have another 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 It took 300 gigabytes that is was 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.449
 totally unjustified that is my audio 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.489
 video of this photo program I need them 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.989
 all remained I tried to delete something 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 it was clearly removed from this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 Categories from the category of photo video audio 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.100
 but from another but not removed 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.479
 could understand what is something else but 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.340
 I climbed and actually want you 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.650
 tell what it is and how it is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.600
 Does she need you to clean this bitch 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.860
 you will solve my problem you now 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.170
 tell and show 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.210
 actually another is as you already understood 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.659
 any floors that do not fall under our 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.060
 these are the criteria but most of all 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.180
 it weighs with us as a rule for me personally 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.159
 backups weigh and to see these 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.470
 here are the folders you need to spotlight and write 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 backups and you will have i think a lot 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.700
 folders with side I just have it all already 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.280
 I cleaned it with me 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.130
 300 left 138 gigabytes proper 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 I have the most backups 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.219
 understood how to braid 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 I have removed all the walls of the same but fayna 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.630
 Acad takes me exactly 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.659
 backup folders I'm telling now why 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.319
 actually cad file backups are implemented 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.130
 a little bit 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.259
 and so to speak I do not know foolishly because 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 that they protect us not just some 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.920
 file that I named saved if we 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.259
 simply remove our project Acad Fine 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.629
 we can network how would you recover yes 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.349
 in theory it would be logical and convenient 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.209
 practical 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.830
 but caught a reptile do a little by 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.130
 to another at least the version itself 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.890
 last while it saves files 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.860
 backup I will save this file 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.930
 absolutely all steps of our entire tree is 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.599
 have we can go back a step on 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.880
 step back step back and so and kicks and up 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.560
 the very foundation of the project that is it 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.079
 saves all these changes here 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.400
 so the file fbk very much all 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.420
 proper command buttons and 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.670
 arrow up we can climb 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 up the tree of all folders and we can 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.060
 see what for example this folder would 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.400
 we really have to dig k 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.109
 project 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.660
 Here, for example, press to see the project me 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.840
 mine krat 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.210
 there is just a splash empty space in 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.370
 which I insert the video and the ending is all 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.920
 our music that we always 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.720
 the beginning of the video plays and actually everything here 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.580
 this is our whole project due to the fact that he 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.980
 saves all our changes that 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.570
 there have ever been videos that 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.000
 recorded using this template 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.350
 originally made project weighs 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.230
 Now let's see click on 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.630
 properties and look so good at 55 gigabytes 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.760
 that's what you think 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.450
 beginning end and little music 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.240
 Does it hang 55 emblem of course not 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.630
 therefore it is personally inconvenient for me and 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.920
 the memory is so littered with this unnecessary 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.710
 stages here these minutes in 7 rollout 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.810
 there are several ways to save 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.520
 you can either archive it all and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.350
 squeeze the place that is, it does not remove you 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.580
 on you have if you ever need 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.220
 will be back twenty-five steps 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.350
 back you just unzip it and that's it 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.450
 It is good or in my case, I had 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.400
 all just print I take and delete because 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.110
 I do not need it because to me these template 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.230
 the pattern is saved and just take and 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.560
 delete these here all backups that u 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.790
 I have here and all I need it 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.700
 actually here so you can free 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.459
 a lot of space from the program file cad 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.120
 which takes him a decent spends 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.620
 its absolutely not rational 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.970
 I actually had a cad file 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.370
 most but there were others 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.720
 programs that stored backups 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.280
 let's say this is the program of motion fix 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.859
 which review we had on the channel she 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.490
 also makes backup &amp; backup and entries 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.830
 which were made from it and there too 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.360
 about 5 gigabytes per regular program 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.150
 that is, I absolutely do not need these 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.070
 backups and take and delete and here it is 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.110
 other initially understand what it is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.140
 how to get to it how to erase it 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.460
 quite difficult so the solution is 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.470
 or use some programs 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.210
 who themselves in automatic mode is 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.010
 make them clean up your cache 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.440
 anything else there will be put in order 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.030
 gis defragments there almost this 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.620
 will be put in order but they will not remove you 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.840
 these are the files here because 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.280
 any program you download 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.110
 you think that this file you need it 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.600
 does not remove, that is, the only thing here 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.400
 mind and you yourself can get to see 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.100
 and you need to think new or not and 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.770
 remove so here most in 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.600
 ssd disks on poppy this is the last 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.699
 MacBooks we have a code backup 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.560
 so here it is another it is rude 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.510
 saying all we washed was she 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.600
 stored here there and stored in 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.699
 these folders under backup can you 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.270
 check on macbook i think you need it 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.580
 will help 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.530
 you clean yourself liba download 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.690
 program she clean the cache 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.610
 but again on not remove these here 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.160
 very heavy files she just delete 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.020
 gigabyte five ten from today 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.790
 the fact that there are some temporary files 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.250
 they are there by the way very little on the poppy 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.410
 since it is not windows and then they kind of 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.080
 themselves close how many are deleted this 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.400
 particles after but all in theory here you are these 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.220
 programs do not have much space 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.919
 released on manually like this 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.900
 got looked need not need 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.660
 get through spotlight choose 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.490
 folder and using the top commands you can here 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.990
 so here follow upstairs upstairs and 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.479
 generally go out in the most 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.820
 up that is get our drive is valid 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.050
 mac access libraries 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.660
 program users 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.680
 here it is all with the help of ordinary 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.870
 strela under my files will be like this 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.060
 here either give help teams commands 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.010
 up here you can 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.340
 we need to clean up what files 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.650
 we weigh most and take and here 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.760
 so here it will be good enough 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.200
 extensively so free up memory on poppy and 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.330
 use and get a disk with 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.430
 free space for some new 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.919
 game installation files but so on 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.900
 we actually talked to you I think 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.860
 it helped and then you try it yourself 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.810
 MacBooks 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.180
 the solution to this problem if you have something not 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.130
 It turns out or you can not delete the file 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.530
 or him you do not understand what kind of file 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.320
 then write in the comments write me on 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.539
 mail in the group in a personal message 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.460
 VKontakte I am happy to answer you everywhere 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:54.770
 tell and try to fix 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.250
 specifically your mistake personally I have it 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.930
 It was here with a backup and for today everything is with 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.849
 you were apple infinite subscribe 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.969
 on the channel and be sure to like while 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:03.969
 until
