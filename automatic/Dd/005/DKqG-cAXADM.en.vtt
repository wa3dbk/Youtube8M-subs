don't have golden syrup you can use
molasses<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:49.690> then<00:02:50.690> we're<00:02:51.050> gonna<00:02:51.170> mix<00:02:51.470> this

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
molasses and then we're gonna mix this

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.620 
molasses and then we're gonna mix this
until<00:02:52.580> everything<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:53.480> totally<00:02:53.780> combined

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.210 

occasionally<00:02:59.630> stopping<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.500> UM<00:03:00.650> scrape<00:03:01.010> down

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
occasionally stopping to UM scrape down

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:17.289

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.740 
the sides of the bowl then add the flour
all<00:03:17.900> at<00:03:18.110> once<00:03:18.410> use<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.310> spatula<00:03:19.670> first<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.510> mix

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
all at once use the spatula first to mix

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.930 
all at once use the spatula first to mix
just<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.290> avoid<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.709> flour<00:03:22.130> from<00:03:22.340> flying

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
just to avoid the flour from flying

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.830 
just to avoid the flour from flying
everywhere

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
everywhere

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.820 
everywhere
then<00:03:24.709> for<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> final<00:03:26.180> mix<00:03:26.360> use<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.260> electric

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
then for a final mix use the electric

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:45.240 
then for a final mix use the electric
beater

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.550 

at<00:03:46.250> this<00:03:46.579> point<00:03:46.969> we<00:03:47.420> will<00:03:47.599> likely<00:03:47.870> need<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
at this point we will likely need the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.059 
at this point we will likely need the
dough<00:03:48.799> until<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:50.450> comes<00:03:50.719> together<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.620> form

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
dough until it comes together and form

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.119 
dough until it comes together and form
into<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.730> ball<00:03:55.629> just<00:03:56.629> like<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:57.170> let<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.650> sit

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
into a ball just like this let it sit

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.069 
into a ball just like this let it sit
for<00:03:58.159> about<00:03:58.579> 15<00:03:59.090> minutes<00:03:59.359> then<00:03:59.780> start

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
for about 15 minutes then start

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.410 
for about 15 minutes then start
preheating<00:04:00.290> your<00:04:00.620> oven<00:04:00.739> at<00:04:01.189> 180<00:04:01.909> degrees
