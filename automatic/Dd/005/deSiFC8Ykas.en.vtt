 tied laces and this is very serious today 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.670
 I bring you as every Sunday a 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.090
 today's guide is dye guide is how 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.860
 get the dyes as a character to 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.929
 all the possible teeth is to say the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.830
 random colors that we can find 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.100
 in minecraft 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.800
 so let's start first of all 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.099
 everything is to know that the sheep can be 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.290
 of these colors if two followed by you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.730
 the ringworm until agreement but always 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.340
 they will be white light gray gray black 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.290
 browns a little weird and very very weird is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.880
 find a pink sheep 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.600
 but you can find it 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.020
 well you know that you to the ear with these 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.030
 you can shear them 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 and you see brushing three blocks worth 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 but we also know or if not 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.370
 you know he taught them today that you with the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.350
 customer that you have to arrive 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.350
 and dyed sheep and when we mix them 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.350
 we will get 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.540
 that's it 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.110
 also here you see one orange and so on 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.480
 and then when they have someone to do 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.240
 nothing will make it color 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.670
 what sheared links is to say if this 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.580
 It was blue, its new wool will be born 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.410
 of blue color again 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.740
 We keep this here, this is 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.000
 important is worth it and let's start divided by 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.670
 three zones zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 in the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.790
 zone 1 is where we will find the dyes 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.980
 primary is the area is 2 is for 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.200
 have the secondary dyes that are 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.050
 do from the primary and the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.150
 3 hands is dyes that are made from 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.150
 from zone 2 of secondary teeth 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.250
 ok let's start the flora of color 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.160
 yellow or also known as tooth 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.070
 of lion we will be able to find in 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.070
 the meadows forests and others and only with 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.380
 breaking it we put it in the bucket and it goes 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.980
 to give the yellow dye 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.890
 the rose with the red flower that equal but 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.440
 against also the prairies in the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.540
 fields and so on if we put it in the bucket 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.740
 of kraft the link to a color dye 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.720
 Red 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.610
 the brown color that we can also 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.700
 get the brown wool from 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.440
 brown sheep if we go to the jungle 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.980
 let's see how these fruits come out 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.040
 of the tree that are called coca wine 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.159
 nothing if we break it will give us the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.040
 seed this seed is the dye and color 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.920
 brown vale 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.140
 the dark blue dye comes out from 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.719
 break the blue pencil and we can 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.670
 find in the mines that is a 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.590
 Poquillo is a little weirder than the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.799
 rest is worth it but not as rare as the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.799
 Diamond 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.780
 we can find the green dye 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.540
 from the cactus that are usually born in 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.790
 the deserts or in some places with 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.129
 sand 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.109
 and nothing if we cook the cactus 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.810
 a coal or any other element 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.950
 that can burn we will get the dye of 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.890
 green color 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.140
 the dark black we can get it from 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.269
 the squid the color black and the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.250
 black sheep give us were colored 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.170
 black 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.800
 now we can a moment the difficulty 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.320
 in easy 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.320
 and we are going to place a skeleton 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.690
 by sending us a skeleton 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.570
 is going to give a bone 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.680
 if we create the bone we will 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.310
 give a white tint it will 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.310
 remove this 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.519
 very well very rarely can we find 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.860
 the pink tint that is from the 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.310
 roses sheep of yes agreements in the 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.319
 primary dyes 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.930
 from these clients we will be able to 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.730
 have the following 100 clients in 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.850
 these cases we left the red dye and the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.010
 yellow we will get the orange tint 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.209
 that at the same time we can dye it 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.700
 wool and other things the evo dye and 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.500
 artificial games is also worth the guide 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.930
 what I did last week was fires 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.610
 artificial and hence for it to be 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.080
 can get the dye will be able to 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.100
 mix the colors of the fires 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.670
 artificial 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:39.970
 the green dye and the lapis lazuli will 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.970
 give color cia that is blue rarillo 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.689
 the red dye and the blue pencil and the dye 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.360
 purple 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.279
 the white and black dye that are in 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.920
 the squid is going to give us the gray tint 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:59.040
 that also leaves the crisis soy 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.360
 The white dye and lapis lazuli will go 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.360
 give the color blue sky vale 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.750
 the dye to white and the red dye is going 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.030
 to give the rose 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.409
 and the white dye and the usual green dye 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:17.080
 the green this reactive green lime 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.969
 and well this would be the secondary top and 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.580
 with colors from this area we will be able to 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.159
 take out other new colors 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.930
 what would be of zone 3 the purple that 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.180
 we have taken out there in the background and the rose 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.910
 that we find here in the background we are going to have 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.930
 the magenta color 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.229
 let's make the magneto dye 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.960
 with white that comes out in the course is the 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.970
 white tint and the gray tint we are going to take out 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.610
 a light gray that we can also 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.090
 take out of joining two white teeth and 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.970
 one beige black this would be in the area 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.900
 secondary but put here because it's the 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.810
 same color 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.880
 and well this has been all from 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.520
 the dyes that you can get wool 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.880
