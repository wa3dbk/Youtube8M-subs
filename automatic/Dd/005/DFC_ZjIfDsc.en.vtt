anyway<00:02:24.480> at<00:02:25.140> some<00:02:25.200> point<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> game<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.570> don't

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
anyway at some point of the game I don't

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.880 
anyway at some point of the game I don't
know<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> close<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.320> good<00:02:31.500> really

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
know so close it's just a good really

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
know so close it's just a good really
it's<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.540> amazingly<00:02:33.540> overpowered<00:02:34.050> or

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200

it's not like amazingly overpowered or
anything<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.950> I'll<00:02:35.190> probably<00:02:35.370> say<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> most

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
anything but I'll probably say the most

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.420 
anything but I'll probably say the most
overpowered<00:02:36.270> thing<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:38.010> snipe<00:02:38.250> and

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
overpowered thing is the snipe and

after<00:03:09.720> time<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.230> all<00:03:11.130> saw<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.400> stayed<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
after time I all saw it stayed on the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.790 
after time I all saw it stayed on the
same<00:03:12.209> spot<00:03:12.360> until<00:03:12.780> someone<00:03:13.170> killed<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.590> I

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
same spot until someone killed you I

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.850 
same spot until someone killed you I
think<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.520> takes<00:03:14.550> like<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.290> really<00:03:16.740> really

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
think it takes like it is really really

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.080 
think it takes like it is really really
