I mean it was almost an hour deal and a
lot<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.359> people<00:04:17.600> have<00:04:17.870> mentioned<00:04:18.430> that

the ammunition for the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.450 
the ammunition for the
selves<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:28.670> case<00:04:29.180> though<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:30.050> think<00:04:31.010> the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
selves and this case though I think the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.940 
selves and this case though I think the
people<00:04:32.180> at<00:04:32.450> Walmart<00:04:32.960> just<00:04:33.200> didn't<00:04:33.500> have<00:04:33.680> any

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
people at Walmart just didn't have any

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.210 
people at Walmart just didn't have any
clue<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.850> mean<00:04:35.300> mr.<00:04:36.170> Troy<00:04:36.350> hunters<00:04:36.800> mentioned

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
clue I mean mr. Troy hunters mentioned

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.060 
clue I mean mr. Troy hunters mentioned
that<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.550> some<00:04:37.910> just<00:04:38.810> don't<00:04:39.050> have<00:04:39.380> any<00:04:39.620> clue

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
that to some just don't have any clue

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.970 
that to some just don't have any clue
because<00:04:40.640> they're<00:04:41.180> not<00:04:41.360> really<00:04:41.600> into<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:42.140> and<00:04:42.650> I

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
because they're not really into it and I

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.790 
because they're not really into it and I
think<00:04:43.040> that's<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.580> case<00:04:43.880> here<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.450> then<00:04:44.800> the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
think that's the case here and then the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.480 
think that's the case here and then the
long<00:04:46.520> delay<00:04:47.060> was<00:04:47.420> because<00:04:48.370> nobody<00:04:49.370> really

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
long delay was because nobody really

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.270 
long delay was because nobody really
