00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
exported those files and you see it's

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.490 
exported those files and you see it's
created<00:00:14.430> all<00:00:15.430> the<00:00:15.969> folders<00:00:16.539> for<00:00:16.960> each<00:00:17.020> of<00:00:17.320> the

even<00:00:28.120> though<00:00:28.270> I<00:00:28.300> had<00:00:28.480> all<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.780> options

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
even though I had all the options

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.870 
even though I had all the options
selected<00:00:29.530> it<00:00:29.680> won't<00:00:29.830> create<00:00:30.100> the<00:00:30.370> files<00:00:30.640> that

the deltas that are in here and it also

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.020 
the deltas that are in here and it also

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
created the Delta injection files and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.260 
created the Delta injection files and
remove<00:00:52.600> files<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.489> morphs<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.030> had

remove files for the morphs that I had
select<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:55.840> then<00:00:55.870> if<00:00:56.290> I<00:00:56.410> navigate<00:00:56.860> down<00:00:57.100> to

the libraries ville if I go inside here
oppose<00:01:00.370> folder<00:01:00.760> so<00:01:01.329> I've<00:01:01.600> got<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:03.190> inject

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
oppose folder so I've got the the inject

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.609 
oppose folder so I've got the the inject
all<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:04.540> removal<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.310> then<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.790> individual

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
all the removal and then the individual

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.399 
all the removal and then the individual
morphs<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:09.100> removes<00:01:09.459> and<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:10.389> injection<00:01:11.259> it

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
morphs the removes and the injection it

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.800 
morphs the removes and the injection it
looks<00:01:11.590> like<00:01:11.649> we<00:01:11.979> might<00:01:12.159> have<00:01:12.399> oh<00:01:12.759> that's<00:01:13.209> okay

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
looks like we might have oh that's okay

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.809 
looks like we might have oh that's okay
that's<00:01:14.200> because<00:01:14.619> I<00:01:14.649> did<00:01:15.039> not<00:01:15.069> hide<00:01:15.520> these

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
that's because I did not hide these

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:19.830 
that's because I did not hide these
properties<00:01:16.709> in<00:01:17.709> the<00:01:18.670> figure<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.389> way<00:01:19.539> these

xpx water hope that you'll find it
useful<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
useful and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.800 
useful and
we'll<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.160> generate<00:02:17.150> all<00:02:17.420> these<00:02:17.570> files

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
we'll have to generate all these files

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.630 
we'll have to generate all these files
by<00:02:18.080> hand<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.190> quite<00:02:19.550> tedious<00:02:19.760> thanks
