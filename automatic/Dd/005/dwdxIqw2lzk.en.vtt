00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hi, I'm Milanese, and today you're going 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.290
 to show how they can have a smile 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.149
 white and cute 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.070
 if you are interested in the subject and are 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.750
 interested that is until the end of the 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.549
 video because I'm going to make a raffle 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.070
 so that some of you can earn a 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.990
 whitening kit equal to what I 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.009
 I did good first I tell them that 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.810
 when you are going to do a 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.419
 whitening then they can not live 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.329
 tell the doctor or when they go to 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.180
 buy a product is to say that they can 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.680
 have white teeth the same as it is 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.550
 Apparent no 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.280
 this works what 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.160
 the peroxide and the hydrogen and all those 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 chemicals that whitening brings 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.989
 to remove the stains that your 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.149
 that is, they are going to get the color 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.930
 natural that you had when you were born with 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.420
 your teeth 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 then yes if the natural color 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 of your teeth is very very white 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.809
 then your final teeth stay super 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.809
 super white but if you naturally 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 they have some teeth that are a little 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.140
 more yellow or vicious or something like that 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.270
 whitening will remove stains 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.940
 that we have above your color of the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.830
 teeth but your result is not going to be 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.539
 totally white but they will stay 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.149
 of the color that your teeth are 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.759
 naturally this was the product that I 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.070
 I used to whiten my teeth is from 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.940
 a company called greater william 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.789
 and I 'm going to tell you all about this 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.460
 this whitening one of the best 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.670
 things they have is that they send you 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.040
 these escape appointments with this 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.340
 plasticine with which you yourself go 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.320
 take out the mold of your clients and you go to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.200
 will send them to those they will 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.360
 they will make their own capita 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850
 showing how you have to do 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.479
 the process to create your badges 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.220
 then they take the blue part and the part 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.800
 white that are the two parts of the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.909
 plasticine that by mixing them well very very 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.789
 very well they go down to locate in the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.670
 blue tray that they bring and apart from that 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.649
 I also tell them that they bring you to me 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.810
 he brought four little flags so that I 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.250
 I would give them to me and see which ones fit better 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.890
 in my mouth 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.380
 so 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.020
 and make the mixture put it in the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.520
 tray as I am showing you and 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.010
 you fit it in your mouth back and 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.870
 when 60 seconds have passed and the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.940
 plasticine vegetables with the shape of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.610
 your teeth and look at me as I 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.500
 they were mine and obviously also 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.030
 they have to repeat the same process to 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.030
 your lower teeth 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.960
 once they have this ready they go to 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.630
 put the same years envelope that they 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.370
 they bring them inside the box and they go 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.500
 to mail that address that 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.330
 is there in this direction and they are going to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 make your badges and have to 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.100
 wait for them to come back 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.750
 jay and mine arrived 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.090
 the liquid has to be put in 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.460
 little amounts so that when you 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.550
 put it on your teeth do not get out 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.890
 the gums 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.920
 you have to have clean teeth and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.290
 also with dental floss then with a 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.990
 Wipe it dry very well so you do not 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.570
 have nothing of saliva in them and already 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.570
 you can locate the badge in your teeth 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.280
 1 to 3 continuous hours 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.750
 A) Yes 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.260
 the silvering of the statement as such 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.670
 that they will put it first in their mouth and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.090
 after the whitening is removed 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.770
 they are going to apply this which is a gel for 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.130
 Remove the sensitivity of the teeth 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.890
 First and most important is that you the 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.440
 look for a teeth whitening you have 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.750
 what to think about what is best 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.910
 for you or for your body 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.830
 only what is it going to look like 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:14.110
 cuter because you can not go make yourself 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.940
 hurt for some physical things are you this 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.010
 This is the one you apply in the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.090
 trays that they send you to do 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.880
 then when you put on when you put the 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.220
 gel in the trays in your head and 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.250
 it is to your measure that you put it on the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.100
 mouth like this on a tray goes to 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.820
 prevent your saliva from combining with the 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.850
 gel that that's bad because you're going to 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.550
 end up ingesting these chemicals and it's 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.310
 bad for the stomach for your body and 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.150
 this is going to avoid it totally how many 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.640
 Sometimes I have to use the gel 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.850
 that depends on how stained you are 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.730
 the teeth and what your age is 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.960
 person who is 50 years old naturally 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.150
 will have much more teeth 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.700
 bleached than a 15 year old 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.630
 determine the approach and as already 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.330
 I ended up only once as each 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.700
 every two months to cooked when I 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.180
 think I need it again and 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.580
 I make a single one application of 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.500
 the gels of new my teeth by 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.940
 last also have to have in 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.160
 account that the days that you go to 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.060
 think whitening have to 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.550
 sacrifice some things like they do not go to 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.120
 take coca cola from a glass like that if 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.770
 they can take it back but if not 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.920
 they can try to always take those 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.050
 things with cigarettes like a dark tea a 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.260
 cocacola things that you know that 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.870
 stain your teeth like the smoking wine 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.910
 all that kind of stuff but during the 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.860
 whitening I think that this is already 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.660
 basically everything you have to know 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.300
 for whitening 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.430
 then we can proceed to the draw that 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.830
 I will do for you what I am going to 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.830
 give you the raffle is a box like 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.899
 is a box like this that has the 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.389
 trays for you to take out your 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:09.679
 own molds with plasticine 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.330
 then in the box comes an envelope like 

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:13.099
 is where you send him for the 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.649
 mail to this address that is here 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.989
 written to that of the company they 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:21.229
 they make their badges and they send them 

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:25.910
 return to your home and you will have the 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:28.310
 whitening tubes and tubes 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.720
 the sensitivity of the teeth the only 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.580
 what they have to do to participate in 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.320
