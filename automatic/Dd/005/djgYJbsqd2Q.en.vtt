like<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.460> yellow<00:02:04.610> cause<00:02:04.940> it's<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.120> little<00:02:05.360> bit

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
like the yellow cause it's a little bit

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.050 
like the yellow cause it's a little bit
realistic<00:02:06.140> although<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:07.220> know<00:02:07.370> in<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.820> sense

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
realistic although you know in a sense

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.660 
realistic although you know in a sense
there's<00:02:08.869> nothing<00:02:09.290> you<00:02:09.680> could<00:02:09.860> really<00:02:10.100> do<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
there's nothing you could really do to
