00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hello to all and skull to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.400
 a new life of others the age in 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.330
 line on watchdog multi mode there 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.130
 we find ourselves this time at 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.080
 downtown chicago the party was 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.490
 very badly started the game makes me 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.590
 was starting right next to my 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 opponent and I think he was fine 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 aware of my presence because at 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.480
 hardly had time to launch the hac that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.770
 turned around to put in play but 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.890
 that you'll see right now 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 attention we now appear next 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.539
 university with a nice summer sun 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.880
 what idyllic setting is not it then 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.529
 as you will be able to see it here 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.239
 I appear I start him at the dock and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 direct to westerns 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.570
 he puts me in play I hate being told 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.920
 do that since that's how I'm going 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.210
 you too teeth I'm kidding way I 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.559
 would have troll is still in this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.440
 moment I'm doing this to propose you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.789
 fun videos we managed to escape 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.410
 it's so much better because it was there 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.760
 really very badly barred if he had 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 better aim he would certainly have killed me 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.059
 we're going to kick him off the booth then 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 why the cost of the kiosk because 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.180
 it's a couple you talked about in the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.410
 video tutorial and I will prove to you that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 it works 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 confidential music layar from magnetic to 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.350
 a music very very rhythmic it's 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 awesome for online hacking gets going 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 in the mood then go on there the mid 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.250
 short completely opposite 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 I gave some clues for 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.610
 strengthen a little bit the trolling I'm going 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.220
 take my big machine guns and I 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.490
 I'll shoot you a little bit in the feet 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.740
 attention friend I'm here no you react 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.799
 not too bad for you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.060
 frankly usually I do not even pull 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.680
 not on the opponents I'm waiting 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.390
 patiently but then I said to myself 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.070
 the fun we're going to shoot it's okay 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.600
 do a little farted the sinkers it's done 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.049
 like I'm here I'm here but you know 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.460
 no where I am I am here however the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.200
 guy was still not very very smart 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.280
 I'm just shooting him there's even 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 a moment when I'm going to send him a 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.600
 grenade so here is now I'm here 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.890
 basij tomb of grenades but the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.790
 winner has nothing to do they get married 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.000
 completely opposite 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.409
 too bad for him always is he that 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.700
 it's still very good to shoot 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.290
 on your opponents when you do 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 always liked because he farts 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.930
 literally the sinkers 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.360
 there is nothing worse than being shot 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.680
 on while you are looking for your 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.270
 adversary because you really have 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.070
 the impression that is very close to you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.509
 that you can not see it and suddenly 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.939
 he loses as I told you in 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.159
 another video in productivity and that's 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.720

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.160

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.230

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.750

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.260

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.420

 you never think you're a victim of the coup 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.470
 the kiosk or any other shot 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.260
 similar where we turn around an object 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.019
 you threw eggs and close to 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.340
 level of one or two of the phases of 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.750
 the object in question like that it's 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.489
 the opponent continues to turn around 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.069
 thinking he's doing his clever thing he's going to 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.599
 blow up or you climb 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.739

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.450
 diving on all four sides at the same 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.069
 time he can not escape you 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.290
