filters because what we're trying to do

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.410 
filters because what we're trying to do
is<00:00:34.980> filter<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.100> incoming<00:00:36.490> air<00:00:36.850> they<00:00:37.300> are

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
is filter the incoming air they are

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.319 
is filter the incoming air they are
coming<00:00:37.720> into<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.050> garden<00:00:38.579> dust<00:00:39.579> and<00:00:39.880> mold<00:00:40.120> and

coming into the garden dust and mold and

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.540 
coming into the garden dust and mold and
particles<00:00:40.840> at<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.560> same<00:00:41.800> time<00:00:42.040> we<00:00:42.190> really

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
particles at the same time we really

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.890 
particles at the same time we really
don't<00:00:42.670> want<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:42.970> restrict<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.420> airflow<00:00:43.600> too

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
don't want to restrict the airflow too

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.900 
don't want to restrict the airflow too
much<00:00:44.260> because<00:00:44.470> that<00:00:44.650> air<00:00:45.130> is<00:00:45.250> coming<00:00:45.430> in<00:00:45.730> to

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
much because that air is coming in to

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.020 
much because that air is coming in to
bring<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.270> fresh<00:00:46.540> co2<00:00:46.990> and<00:00:47.430> cool<00:00:48.430> room

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
bring in fresh co2 and cool room

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.740 
bring in fresh co2 and cool room
typically<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:50.590> we<00:00:50.920> did<00:00:51.160> was<00:00:51.610> researched<00:00:52.510> all

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
typically so we did was researched all

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.990 
typically so we did was researched all
those<00:00:52.990> products<00:00:53.470> when<00:00:54.370> we<00:00:54.550> were<00:00:54.640> dissatisfied

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
those products when we were dissatisfied

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.290 
those products when we were dissatisfied
we<00:00:55.900> kept<00:00:56.710> looking<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.850> were<00:00:57.910> fortunate

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
we kept looking and we were fortunate

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.190 
we kept looking and we were fortunate
enough<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:58.480> find<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:59.340> carbon<00:01:00.340> fabric<00:01:00.790> felt<00:01:01.200> that

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
enough to find a carbon fabric felt that

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.020 
enough to find a carbon fabric felt that
actually<00:01:02.800> has<00:01:02.950> bigger<00:01:03.220> holes<00:01:03.550> than<00:01:03.910> the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
actually has bigger holes than the

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.120 
actually has bigger holes than the
molecules<00:01:04.449> were<00:01:04.809> trying<00:01:05.049> to<00:01:05.110> catch<00:01:05.290> which

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
molecules were trying to catch which

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.890 
molecules were trying to catch which
sounds<00:01:06.430> kind<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.670> funny<00:01:06.939> except<00:01:07.689> that<00:01:07.780> it's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
sounds kind of funny except that it's

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.560 
sounds kind of funny except that it's
carbon<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:09.130> it's<00:01:09.610> going<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:09.850> get<00:01:10.000> sticky

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
carbon so it's going to get sticky

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.850 
carbon so it's going to get sticky
we're<00:01:10.750> gonna<00:01:10.840> catch<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.380> it's<00:01:11.530> gonna<00:01:11.619> stay

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
we're gonna catch it and it's gonna stay

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.179 
we're gonna catch it and it's gonna stay
stuck<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.450> fabric<00:01:14.259> we're<00:01:14.439> using<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.979> about

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
stuck the fabric we're using is about

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.310 
stuck the fabric we're using is about
three<00:01:15.460> millimeters<00:01:15.640> thick<00:01:16.210> so<00:01:16.840> there's<00:01:17.109> going

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
three millimeters thick so there's going

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.529 
three millimeters thick so there's going
to<00:01:17.409> be<00:01:17.499> a<00:01:17.829> baffling<00:01:18.310> effect<00:01:18.700> as<00:01:18.939> things<00:01:19.299> come

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
to be a baffling effect as things come

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:20.730 
to be a baffling effect as things come
in<00:01:19.689> they<00:01:19.810> got<00:01:19.929> to<00:01:20.020> go<00:01:20.109> like<00:01:20.289> this<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.619> get

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
in they got to go like this to get

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.469 
in they got to go like this to get
through<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.369> that's<00:01:21.939> when<00:01:22.240> they're<00:01:22.390> gonna

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
through and that's when they're gonna

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.349 
through and that's when they're gonna
catch<00:01:22.810> on<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.259> some<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.369> naked<00:01:25.030> carbon

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
catch on to some of the naked carbon

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.230 
catch on to some of the naked carbon
fibers<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:25.990> stay<00:01:26.590> stuck<00:01:26.920> in<00:01:27.069> there<00:01:27.249> now<00:01:28.030> what

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
fibers and stay stuck in there now what

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.679 
fibers and stay stuck in there now what
we<00:01:28.359> did<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.569> this<00:01:28.990> is<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:30.179> pleated<00:01:31.179> fabric

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
we did is this is a a pleated fabric

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.959 
we did is this is a a pleated fabric
carbon<00:01:32.259> felt<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.999> polyester<00:01:34.450> pre-filter

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
carbon felt with a polyester pre-filter

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.690 
carbon felt with a polyester pre-filter
we<00:01:36.969> have<00:01:37.289> made<00:01:38.289> it<00:01:38.409> out<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.799> recycled<00:01:39.490> paper

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
we have made it out of a recycled paper

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.270 
we have made it out of a recycled paper
incidentally<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:40.600> this<00:01:40.719> filter<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.560> about<00:01:41.799> 85%

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
incidentally so this filter is about 85%

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.679 
incidentally so this filter is about 85%
recycled<00:01:43.179> and<00:01:43.389> almost<00:01:43.990> 100%<00:01:44.319> recyclable

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
recycled and almost 100% recyclable

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.179 
recycled and almost 100% recyclable
lightweight<00:01:46.689> was<00:01:47.319> a<00:01:47.350> real<00:01:47.619> big<00:01:47.829> thing<00:01:48.009> and

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
lightweight was a real big thing and

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.629 
lightweight was a real big thing and
also<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.759> low<00:01:49.030> low<00:01:49.240> cost<00:01:50.069> 6-inch<00:01:51.069> filter<00:01:51.459> like

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:51.639 
also a low low cost 6-inch filter like

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:54.209 
also a low low cost 6-inch filter like
this<00:01:51.939> is<00:01:52.209> about<00:01:52.359> $80<00:01:52.959> but<00:01:53.799> let<00:01:53.920> me<00:01:54.009> show<00:01:54.159> you

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
this is about $80 but let me show you

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.429 
this is about $80 but let me show you
really<00:01:55.149> what<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.509> got<00:01:55.659> going<00:01:55.959> over<00:01:56.049> here<00:01:56.380> and

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
really what we got going over here and

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.550 
really what we got going over here and
how<00:01:56.709> to<00:01:56.740> use<00:01:57.039> it<00:01:57.359> first<00:01:58.359> of<00:01:58.569> all<00:01:58.659> we're<00:01:59.170> very

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
how to use it first of all we're very

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.319 
how to use it first of all we're very
interested<00:01:59.889> in<00:02:00.189> filtering<00:02:00.579> intake<00:02:01.030> air

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the prefilter on your carbon starts

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.330 
the prefilter on your carbon starts
turning<00:02:11.820> gray<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.600> then<00:02:12.720> black<00:02:13.050> all<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:14.130> that

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
turning gray and then black all of that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.700 
turning gray and then black all of that
it's<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.510> room<00:02:15.750> where<00:02:15.960> your<00:02:16.080> plants<00:02:16.380> are

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710

it's in the room where your plants are
the<00:02:17.370> clean<00:02:17.700> air<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.540> you're<00:02:18.690> blowing<00:02:19.050> out

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the clean air is what you're blowing out

the clean air is what you're blowing out
the<00:02:19.320> window<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:20.820> looked<00:02:21.150> at<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the window so we looked at that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.620 
the window so we looked at that
of<00:02:22.590> course<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:22.950> test<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.910> dust<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.420> was

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
of course we test it the dust that was

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.350 
of course we test it the dust that was
in<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> pre-filter<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:26.670> full<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:26.970> mold

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360

which means it's circulating around the
plants<00:02:33.780> what<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.500> we<00:02:34.590> do

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
plants what do we do

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.040

let's<00:02:35.520> first<00:02:35.880> prevent<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.390> from<00:02:36.420> getting<00:02:36.630> into

let's first prevent it from getting into

let's first prevent it from getting into
the<00:02:37.260> room<00:02:37.530> clean<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.490> room<00:02:38.700> completely<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.570> I

the room clean the room completely and I

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.810 
the room clean the room completely and I
would<00:02:40.200> even<00:02:40.410> recommend<00:02:40.710> using<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.250> second<00:02:41.670> one

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
would even recommend using a second one

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.480 
would even recommend using a second one
of<00:02:41.910> these<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.840> filter<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.860> circulate

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
of these just to filter and circulate

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you will discover if you start doing

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.390 
you will discover if you start doing
this<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.320> can<00:02:49.470> take<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.800> filtered<00:02:50.190> air

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
this is if you can take the filtered air

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.880 
this is if you can take the filtered air
and<00:02:50.700> deliver<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:52.110> into<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.500> plants<00:02:52.800> in

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
and deliver it right into the plants in

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.740 
and deliver it right into the plants in
the<00:02:52.950> canopy<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.580> how<00:02:54.120> much<00:02:54.300> better<00:02:54.510> those

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the canopy is how much better those

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.300 
the canopy is how much better those

of<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.700> filter<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.120> what<00:03:00.420> makes<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.750> thing

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
of the filter and what makes this thing

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.650 
of the filter and what makes this thing
work<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.290> well<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.850> big<00:03:03.030> stuff<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.570> going

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
work so well the big stuff is all going

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.730 
work so well the big stuff is all going
to<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.810> caught<00:03:04.020> by<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.230> carbon<00:03:04.470> pre-filter

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
to get caught by the carbon pre-filter

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.670 
to get caught by the carbon pre-filter
or<00:03:05.580> by<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.850> polyester<00:03:06.390> pre-filter<00:03:06.960> this<00:03:07.500> is

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
or by the polyester pre-filter this is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.900 
or by the polyester pre-filter this is
washable<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.430> take<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.670> off<00:03:08.760> and

going to get all the small stuff and
we've<00:03:13.470> got<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> huge<00:03:13.920> surface<00:03:14.280> area<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.820> here

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
we've got a huge surface area on here

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.330 
we've got a huge surface area on here
this<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> six<00:03:16.740> inch<00:03:16.890> filter<00:03:17.570> rated<00:03:18.570> at<00:03:19.340> 270

this is a six inch filter rated at 270

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.560 
this is a six inch filter rated at 270
CFM<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.570> this<00:03:21.750> would<00:03:21.930> be<00:03:22.140> good<00:03:22.590> for<00:03:22.860> your<00:03:23.070> small

CFM so this would be good for your small
six-inch<00:03:24.570> bans<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:25.440> also<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> taller<00:03:26.280> one

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
six-inch bans we also have a taller one

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.650 
six-inch bans we also have a taller one
which<00:03:26.880> would<00:03:27.000> be<00:03:27.060> good<00:03:27.240> for<00:03:27.330> your<00:03:27.480> bigger

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
6-inch bans we will always produce two

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.990 
6-inch bans we will always produce two
filters<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.590> every<00:03:31.800> size<00:03:32.010> group<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.820> we<00:03:32.910> have

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.780 
two four inches to six inches to eight
etc<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.690> smaller<00:03:37.020> one<00:03:37.230> typically<00:03:37.800> good<00:03:38.460> for

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
etc the smaller one typically good for

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.360 
etc the smaller one typically good for
your<00:03:38.970> smaller<00:03:39.390> fans<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.200> class<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.830> the

your smaller fans for that class and the
bigger<00:03:41.550> ones<00:03:41.820> for<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.120> high<00:03:42.300> CFM<00:03:43.050> fans<00:03:43.350> of

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
bigger ones for the high CFM fans of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.270 
bigger ones for the high CFM fans of
that<00:03:43.590> class<00:03:44.150> or<00:03:45.230> why<00:03:46.230> not<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.680> double<00:03:46.860> up<00:03:47.130> and

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
that class or why not just double up and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.070 
that class or why not just double up and
always<00:03:47.910> get<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> bigger<00:03:48.390> filter<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:49.050> each

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
always get the bigger filter for each

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.980 
always get the bigger filter for each
each<00:03:49.650> class<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.450> 8<00:03:51.600> inch<00:03:51.630> you

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
each class so this is the 8 inch you

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.880 
each class so this is the 8 inch you
might<00:03:52.020> just<00:03:52.290> buy<00:03:52.470> 6<00:03:52.800> by<00:03:52.920> 12<00:03:53.220> inch<00:03:53.400> instead<00:03:54.890> this

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
might just buy 6 by 12 inch instead this
