00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
could do with dry ice but probably

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.020 
could do with dry ice but probably
shouldn't<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.069> first<00:00:08.309> experiment<00:00:08.760> I'm

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
shouldn't for this first experiment I'm

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.310 
shouldn't for this first experiment I'm
using<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.360> bottle<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.840> fuel<00:00:10.080> line

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
using this bottle of fuel line

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.589 
using this bottle of fuel line
antifreeze<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.460> 99%<00:00:12.120> isopropyl

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
antifreeze because it's 99% isopropyl

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.110 
antifreeze because it's 99% isopropyl
alcohol<00:00:13.110> like<00:00:14.099> other<00:00:14.280> alcohols<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.910> stuff

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
alcohol like other alcohols this stuff

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.910 
alcohol like other alcohols this stuff
has<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.450> get<00:00:15.570> tremendously<00:00:16.139> cold<00:00:16.500> before

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
has to get tremendously cold before

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.859 
has to get tremendously cold before
it'll<00:00:17.039> freeze<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.060> mix<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.390> some<00:00:18.420> chunks

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it'll freeze so if we mix in some chunks

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
it'll freeze so if we mix in some chunks
of<00:00:18.990> dry<00:00:19.170> ice<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> ice<00:00:20.400> boils

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
of dry ice you can see the ice boils

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.490 
of dry ice you can see the ice boils
violently<00:00:21.359> until<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> temperature<00:00:22.230> cools

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
violently until the temperature cools

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.279 
violently until the temperature cools
down<00:00:22.619> around<00:00:23.010> minus<00:00:23.460> 109<00:00:24.119> Fahrenheit<00:00:24.660> now

down around minus 109 Fahrenheit now

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.259 
down around minus 109 Fahrenheit now
we've<00:00:25.439> got<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> makeshift<00:00:26.039> cryogenic<00:00:26.789> napalm

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
we've got a makeshift cryogenic napalm

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.029 
we've got a makeshift cryogenic napalm
so<00:00:27.689> let's<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.080> happens<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.529> drop<00:00:28.859> in

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
so let's see what happens if we drop in

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.669 
so let's see what happens if we drop in
a<00:00:29.099> gummy<00:00:29.369> worm<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:30.330> sub-zero<00:00:30.869> slurry<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.470> so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
a gummy worm this sub-zero slurry is so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.530 
a gummy worm this sub-zero slurry is so
cold<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.579> flash<00:00:32.820> freezes<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> worm

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
cold that it flash freezes the worm

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.870 
cold that it flash freezes the worm
completely<00:00:34.170> solid<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.739> under<00:00:34.920> 20<00:00:35.190> seconds<00:00:35.760> in

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
completely solid in under 20 seconds in

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.910 
completely solid in under 20 seconds in
fact<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.840> hard<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.710> try

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
fact it's so hard now that if we try

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.470 
fact it's so hard now that if we try
hitting<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> hammer<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.090> whole<00:00:39.210> thing

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
hitting with a hammer the whole thing

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
hitting with a hammer the whole thing
shatters<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> was<00:00:40.440> made<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.770> glass<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
shatters like it was made of glass the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
shatters like it was made of glass the
sudden<00:00:42.120> transformation<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.960> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
sudden transformation really is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
sudden transformation really is
incredible<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.010> might<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
incredible and you might just have to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
incredible and you might just have to
break<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.300> believe<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:46.100> did<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
break one to believe it did you know you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.790 
break one to believe it did you know you
can<00:00:47.579> use<00:00:47.730> dry<00:00:48.000> ice<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.300> make<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> popsicle<00:00:49.079> start

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
can use dry ice to make a popsicle start

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.590 
can use dry ice to make a popsicle start
by<00:00:49.920> making<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.309> groove<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:50.850> indentation<00:00:51.149> in

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
by making a groove or an indentation in

a slab of dry ice about half an inch

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.400 
a slab of dry ice about half an inch
deep<00:00:53.550> now<00:00:54.149> try<00:00:54.390> balancing<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.899> popsicle<00:00:55.379> stick

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
deep now try balancing a popsicle stick

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
deep now try balancing a popsicle stick
in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.800> center<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> groove<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:56.879> fill<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in the center of the groove then fill it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
in the center of the groove then fill it
up<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.539> favorite<00:00:57.870> drink<00:00:58.289> you'll<00:00:58.920> see

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
up with your favorite drink you'll see

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.770 
up with your favorite drink you'll see
that<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> instant<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.969> touches<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> dry<00:01:00.629> ice

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that the instant it touches the dry ice

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
that the instant it touches the dry ice
it'll<00:01:01.170> fog<00:01:01.500> over<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> misty<00:01:02.370> white<00:01:02.520> vapor

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it'll fog over with a misty white vapor

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
it'll fog over with a misty white vapor
now<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.019> driest<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.559> only<00:01:04.710> freezing<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
now because driest is only freezing the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
now because driest is only freezing the
liquid<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> bottom<00:01:05.729> side<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.600> gonna

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
liquid on the bottom side it's gonna

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
liquid on the bottom side it's gonna
take<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> few<00:01:07.080> minutes<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> cold<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
take a few minutes for the cold to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
take a few minutes for the cold to
penetrate<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:08.970> through<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
penetrate all the way through so just

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.899 
penetrate all the way through so just
sit<00:01:10.229> back<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.740> enjoy<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> magic<00:01:11.280> happening

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
sit back and enjoy the magic happening

now<00:01:30.090> check<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.290> dry<00:01:31.500> ice

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
now check this out we know that dry ice

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
now check this out we know that dry ice
is<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> solid<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> sublimates<00:01:33.030> straight<00:01:33.360> into

is a solid the sublimates straight into

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300 
is a solid the sublimates straight into
a<00:01:33.570> gas<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.710> could<00:01:34.829> turn<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.100> into

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
a gas but what if we could turn it into

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.960 
a gas but what if we could turn it into
a<00:01:35.460> liquid

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
a liquid

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
a liquid

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
if dry ice can be liquefied does it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.630 
if dry ice can be liquefied does it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
can see it in its liquid state if we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.830 
can see it in its liquid state if we

around 75 pounds per square inch an

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
around 75 pounds per square inch an
amazing<00:01:57.149> thing<00:01:57.360> begins<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.810> happen<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.590> ice

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
amazing thing begins to happen the ice

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
amazing thing begins to happen the ice
starts<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> melt<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.210> see

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
starts to melt and we can actually see

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
starts to melt and we can actually see
what<00:02:00.960> liquid<00:02:01.259> carbon<00:02:01.500> dioxide<00:02:01.619> looks<00:02:02.250> like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
what liquid carbon dioxide looks like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.069 
what liquid carbon dioxide looks like
now<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.479> need<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.750> watch<00:02:03.899> this

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
now we really need to watch this

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.569 
now we really need to watch this
carefully<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.040> soon<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> ice

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
carefully because as soon as the ice

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.700 
carefully because as soon as the ice
melts<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.270> pressure<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.810> quickly<00:02:07.200> rise<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
melts the pressure can quickly rise to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.770 
melts the pressure can quickly rise to
well<00:02:07.890> over<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> thousand<00:02:08.700> psi<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> blow<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
well over a thousand psi and blow the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.050 
well over a thousand psi and blow the
container<00:02:10.170> before<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.160> one<00:02:11.340> explodes<00:02:11.790> let's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
container before this one explodes let's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.640 
container before this one explodes let's
watch<00:02:12.300> what<00:02:12.510> happens<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> fluid<00:02:13.410> if<00:02:13.530> we

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
watch what happens to the fluid if we

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.230 
watch what happens to the fluid if we
carefully

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
carefully

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.690 
carefully
the<00:02:14.480> pressure<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.350> cap<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.250> liquid<00:02:16.580> is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
the pressure in the cap the liquid is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.880 
the pressure in the cap the liquid is
instantly<00:02:17.210> transformed<00:02:17.930> into<00:02:18.080> dry<00:02:18.410> ice<00:02:18.560> snow

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
instantly transformed into dry ice snow

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.410 
instantly transformed into dry ice snow
and<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.340> can<00:02:19.490> see<00:02:19.670> all<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.970> fluid<00:02:20.300> is

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
and you can see all the fluid is

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.420 
and you can see all the fluid is
suddenly<00:02:20.750> disappeared<00:02:21.260> now<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.010> show<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.280> why

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
suddenly disappeared now to show you why

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.430 
suddenly disappeared now to show you why
this<00:02:22.490> demonstration<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.540> risky<00:02:24.020> let's<00:02:24.260> put

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
this demonstration is so risky let's put

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.840 
this demonstration is so risky let's put
one<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.650> these<00:02:24.740> containers<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.400> cup<00:02:25.610> filled

one of these containers in a cup filled
with<00:02:25.970> warm<00:02:26.240> water<00:02:26.480> didn't<00:02:27.080> get<00:02:27.200> really<00:02:27.590> really

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
with warm water didn't get really really

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.370 
with warm water didn't get really really
far<00:02:28.070> away<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.210> see<00:02:29.390> exactly<00:02:29.690> how<00:02:29.990> clear

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
far away you can see exactly how clear

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.770 
far away you can see exactly how clear
and<00:02:30.410> beautiful<00:02:30.740> liquid<00:02:31.340> dry<00:02:31.730> ice<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.600> at

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
the same time exactly how powerful it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.270 
the same time exactly how powerful it
can<00:02:35.360> be<00:02:35.510> as<00:02:35.630> well<00:02:35.840> hopefully<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.980> gives<00:02:37.130> an

can be as well hopefully this gives an

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.650 
can be as well hopefully this gives an
idea<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.820> why<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.060> should<00:02:38.300> only<00:02:38.450> be

idea of why this should only be

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.720 
idea of why this should only be

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
quickly as you can if you do it right

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.590 
quickly as you can if you do it right
it's<00:02:51.440> gonna<00:02:51.560> look<00:02:51.650> really<00:02:52.250> really<00:02:52.550> cool<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
it's gonna look really really cool the

white smoke is safe to breathe because

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.860 
white smoke is safe to breathe because
it's<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.520> water<00:02:55.730> vapor<00:02:55.820> mixed<00:02:56.390> with<00:02:56.480> carbon

watch what happens when we light the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.950 
watch what happens when we light the
magnesium<00:03:25.340> with<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.670> blowtorch<00:03:26.150> drop<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.840> down

slab of dry ice it creates a vicious

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.620 
slab of dry ice it creates a vicious
reaction<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.790> burns<00:03:32.000> brighter<00:03:32.300> than<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
reaction that burns brighter than the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.420 
reaction that burns brighter than the
Sun<00:03:32.870> which<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.590> see<00:03:33.740> is<00:03:33.860> enough<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.250> light

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
Sun which you can see is enough to light

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.950 
Sun which you can see is enough to light
up<00:03:34.550> my<00:03:34.580> yard<00:03:34.880> in<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.330> middle<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> night

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
up my yard in the middle of the night

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.500 
up my yard in the middle of the night
now<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.770> crazy<00:03:37.070> thing<00:03:37.280> about<00:03:37.460> this<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.150> carbon

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
now the crazy thing about this is carbon

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.570 
now the crazy thing about this is carbon
dioxide<00:03:38.540> usually<00:03:39.320> puts<00:03:39.560> out<00:03:39.710> fires<00:03:40.040> because

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
dioxide usually puts out fires because

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.670 
dioxide usually puts out fires because
it<00:03:40.700> starves<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.150> fire<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.540> oxygen<00:03:42.050> but<00:03:42.530> in

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
it starves the fire of oxygen but in

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.620 
it starves the fire of oxygen but in
this<00:03:42.800> reaction<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.520> magnesium<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:44.390> hungry

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
this reaction the magnesium is so hungry

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.630 
this reaction the magnesium is so hungry
for<00:03:44.960> it<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.470> rips<00:03:45.680> oxygen<00:03:46.190> right<00:03:46.370> out<00:03:46.430> of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
for it that it rips oxygen right out of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.060 
for it that it rips oxygen right out of
the<00:03:46.730> frozen<00:03:47.090> co2<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.900> leaves<00:03:48.200> behind<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.860> pile

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
the frozen co2 and leaves behind a pile

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.370 
the frozen co2 and leaves behind a pile
of<00:03:49.100> black<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:49.730> white<00:03:49.790> ash<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.870> remains<00:03:51.200> are

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
of black and white ash the remains are

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.080 
of black and white ash the remains are
mostly<00:03:51.650> magnesium<00:03:52.310> oxide<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.970> magnesium

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
mostly magnesium oxide and magnesium

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.690 
mostly magnesium oxide and magnesium
nitride<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.500> black<00:03:54.710> ash<00:03:54.950> contains<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.580> lot

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
nitride but the black ash contains a lot

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.490 
nitride but the black ash contains a lot
of<00:03:55.730> elemental<00:03:56.360> carbon<00:03:56.630> which<00:03:57.230> interestingly

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
of elemental carbon which interestingly

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.800 
of elemental carbon which interestingly
enough<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.550> same<00:03:58.790> stuff<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.420> use<00:03:59.570> for

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
enough is the same stuff you use for

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.230 
enough is the same stuff you use for
grilling<00:04:00.170> well<00:04:01.130> there<00:04:01.310> are<00:04:01.400> 5<00:04:01.580> crazy<00:04:01.610> and

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
grilling well there are 5 crazy and

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.240 
grilling well there are 5 crazy and
dangerous<00:04:02.390> experiments<00:04:03.380> you<00:04:03.500> could<00:04:03.740> do<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.920> dry

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
dangerous experiments you could do a dry

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.850 
dangerous experiments you could do a dry
ice<00:04:04.430> but<00:04:04.880> really<00:04:05.180> probably<00:04:05.630> shouldn't<00:04:05.990> that's

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
ice but really probably shouldn't that's

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.830 
ice but really probably shouldn't that's
it<00:04:07.070> for<00:04:07.250> now<00:04:07.370> if<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.760> like<00:04:08.030> these<00:04:08.210> projects

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
it for now if you like these projects

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.750 
it for now if you like these projects
perhaps<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.290> like<00:04:09.440> some<00:04:09.650> others<00:04:09.980> check<00:04:10.610> them

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760

out at the king of random calm I get

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.210 
out at the king of random calm I get
asked<00:04:14.750> all<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.900> time<00:04:14.990> where<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.590> get<00:04:15.740> dry<00:04:16.010> ice

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
asked all the time where to get dry ice

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.070 
asked all the time where to get dry ice
so<00:04:16.580> I'm<00:04:16.670> going<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.850> tell<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.239> if<00:04:17.480> you're<00:04:17.810> over

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
so I'm going to tell you if you're over

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.930 
so I'm going to tell you if you're over
18<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.680> could<00:04:18.830> be<00:04:18.920> as<00:04:19.040> easy<00:04:19.190> as<00:04:19.400> your<00:04:19.580> local

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
18 it could be as easy as your local

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.940 
18 it could be as easy as your local
