fast this is just going to go ahead and
run<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.130> setup<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:02.239> should<00:03:02.480> immediately

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
run the setup and you should immediately

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.540 
run the setup and you should immediately
set<00:03:03.380> up<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.650> be<00:03:03.739> good<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.980> go<00:03:04.100> as<00:03:04.160> soon<00:03:04.310> as<00:03:04.430> it's

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
set up and be good to go as soon as it's

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.790 
set up and be good to go as soon as it's
done<00:03:04.700> installing<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.870> all<00:03:06.260> in<00:03:06.380> all<00:03:06.470> I'd<00:03:06.769> say

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
these drivers are fairly easy to get

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.210 
these drivers are fairly easy to get
your<00:03:08.360> hands<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.320> controller<00:03:09.680> itself<00:03:09.890> I

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
your hands on the controller itself I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.620 
your hands on the controller itself I
really<00:03:10.430> love<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.700> feel<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:10.940> personal<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.600> just

fits my hands really well and so yeah
let's<00:03:15.530> see<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:15.769> it's<00:03:15.920> going<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.519> start<00:03:16.730> working

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
let's see if it's going to start working

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.390 
let's see if it's going to start working
so

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.360 

come<00:03:21.909> on

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.339 

still<00:03:26.060> not<00:03:26.180> getting<00:03:26.480> anything<00:03:26.690> just<00:03:26.989> yet

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
still not getting anything just yet

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.220 
still not getting anything just yet
there<00:03:28.250> goes<00:03:28.459> okay<00:03:28.849> so<00:03:28.910> now<00:03:29.180> we're<00:03:29.390> now<00:03:30.050> are

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
there goes okay so now we're now are

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.290 
there goes okay so now we're now are
enabled<00:03:30.590> right<00:03:30.890> away<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:31.879> are<00:03:31.970> good<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.209> go

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
so we didn't have to reset anything

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.250 
so we didn't have to reset anything
we're<00:03:34.519> set<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.629> start<00:03:35.810> playing<00:03:35.900> some

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
controller views maybe only we were

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.259 
controller views maybe only we were
motivated<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:10.190> actually<00:04:10.670> jump<00:04:10.940> in<00:04:11.090> there<00:04:11.239> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269
