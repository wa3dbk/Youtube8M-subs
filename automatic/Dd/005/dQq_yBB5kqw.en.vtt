00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.480
 very good morning guys thank you for 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.850
 accompany us this morning as we are 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.309
 so close to the festivities of this 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.740
 time of year where everything is food 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.690
 family union joy and that's why we're going to 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.400
 prepare today this rich snack that 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.710
 surely you can prepare it 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.599
 very easily at home and enjoy it 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:41.020
 later with the people who most want 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:43.510
 we go with the ingredients because today they 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.789
 I will teach how to prepare some rolls of 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.399
 cream cheese that inside will have a 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.370
 little pÃ¢tÃ© and crispy cover 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.649
 with walnut for this we will use for 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.320
 the handling of cream cheese because it is 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.449
 be a bit complicated soon because 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.090
 it is a cheese that has a high content 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.350
 of fat we are going to use a paper 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.409
 waxed like the one I'm using 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.990
 today it can be aluminum foil or a bowl 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.700
 plastic that you cut leave it to 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.560
 this size because here we go 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.140
 later to roll then this 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.939
 will help us a lot tips for this 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.579
 recipe let's put a little bit of 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.890
 vegetable oil very little in the 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.409
 surface that we are going to work for 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.140
 help us also that later you can 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.479
 make the roll easier 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.000
 well this is the surface pretty much 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.700
 here we are going to occupy 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.610
 a cream cheese a small packet of cheese 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.610
 cream 190 grams and let's get wet 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.970
 hands slightly to start 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.729
 crush it or with a spoon likewise 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.729
 to crush the cheese a bit 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.059
 [Music] 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.580
 ah 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.630
 Y 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.429
 here 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.870
 [Music] 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.690
 well here we have it ready 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.239
 if you have these gadgets for 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.180
 pastry or with a little knife and then 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.450
 they want to finish crushing to give 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.299
 a much more even consistency and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.420
 especially in the corner parts 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.400
 line it up again as I told them with 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.379
 a little water is much easier 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.140
 that this slip here we have it 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.319
 ready let's occupy for this filling 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.909
 of the cream cheese a paper the pate that 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.549
 you can buy in the store 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.730
 self-service that you can prepare 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.260
 at home here I'm going to use this 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.980
 bit of part and we're going to put it 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.340
 here at the center we are going to crush also 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.340
 a little 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.989
 so that it reaches the edges and what 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.599
 important another tip to prepare this 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.980
 rollito is that we put it in an extreme 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.349
 we're not going to put it in the middle we're going to 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.659
 put it a little more in one of the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.230
 extremes so that when we give 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:23.230
 turn is much easier here is already 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.420
 and now let's turn it over simply 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.750
 we throw 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.060
 we help each other with our hands I do not know is 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.080
 How easy with the oil that we put on it and 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.080
 we take another turn 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.739
 let's give it the form 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.500
 perfectly and once you have 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.810
 let's have ready we're just going to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.850
 throw it all 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:54.020
 paste the corners very well 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.570
 we seal it perfectly and we go to 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.560
 refrigerator about an hour 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.080
 so this is again shared 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.270
 very well then after about 12 hours 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.980
 about cooling that 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.510
 well I left it is already a long time 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.370
 before but you can prepare it and 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.470
 have it in refrigeration a couple of hours 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.200
 nothing else we have our 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.750
 rollito and we're just going to take the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.930
 paper that we put is like you 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.790
 they look very firm so we can 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.320
 work it without major problem and what 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.570
 let's do is we're going to give you a 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.330
 presentation here I have a base of 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.070
 very chopped nuts and just what 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.030
 Let's roll 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.790
 by the nut 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.840
 we are going to paste very well it can also be 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.630
 with holly venues like a little bit of 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.230
 peanut parsley very finely chopped 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.730
 something that gives color this already comes to 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.310
 I like you here, we give you the 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.640
 technique the idea and you at home like 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.260
 they always give him his personal touch 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.290
 here look how pretty we got our 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.840
 rollito that easy and with what little 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.300
 ingredients we can do here no longer 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.370
 the list is ready and the dish is ready 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.930
 presentation dish with these 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.790
 cookies and let's make a cut this 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.880
 I previously prepared yet 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.730
 cut it you 're going to see how nice 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.220
 we are inside, in this case I 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.810
 I put a few pieces of ham but good 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.150
 you at home can also 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.040
 fill the rest of a vegetable 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.800
 any 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.660
 chilito pepper finally here 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.480

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.030
