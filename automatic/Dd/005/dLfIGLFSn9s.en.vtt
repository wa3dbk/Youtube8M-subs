00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
going running about what's killing

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.550 
going running about what's killing
gaming<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:39.860> I'm<00:02:40.040> yeah<00:02:40.910> he<00:02:41.209> said<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.200> was<00:02:42.320> hard

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
gaming but I'm yeah he said it was hard

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.960 
gaming but I'm yeah he said it was hard
people<00:02:42.980> have<00:02:43.070> said<00:02:43.250> about<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:43.790> they

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
people have said about it so they

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.220 
people have said about it so they
probably<00:02:44.180> thought<00:02:44.600> about<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.900> was<00:02:44.989> like<00:02:45.110> you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
probably thought about it was like you

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.370 
probably thought about it was like you
know<00:02:45.320> what<00:02:46.300> let's<00:02:47.300> just<00:02:47.390> push<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.930> game<00:02:48.110> back

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
know what let's just push this game back

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.990 
know what let's just push this game back
and<00:02:48.680> let's<00:02:48.860> make<00:02:49.070> sure<00:02:49.280> everything<00:02:49.760> works

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and let's make sure everything works

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.390 
and let's make sure everything works
properly<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:51.200> they're<00:02:51.620> probably<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.220> little

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
properly so they're probably a little

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.920 
properly so they're probably a little
upset<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.030> game<00:02:53.180> they<00:02:53.480> couldn't<00:02:53.720> get<00:02:53.810> it

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
upset that the game they couldn't get it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.390 
upset that the game they couldn't get it
at<00:02:54.019> 60<00:02:54.350> frames<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.620> second<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.040> what<00:02:55.220> they're

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
at 60 frames a second so what they're

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.190 
at 60 frames a second so what they're
going<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.670> probably<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.450> do<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.870> what<00:02:57.170> to

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
going to probably have to do and what to

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.229 
going to probably have to do and what to
do<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.680> get<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.010> at<00:02:58.160> 60<00:02:58.519> frames<00:02:58.550> per<00:02:58.790> second<00:02:59.120> is

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
do to get it at 60 frames per second is
