00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
in a woodsy setting like this it's not

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.039 
in a woodsy setting like this it's not
uncommon<00:00:02.760> on<00:00:02.970> bad<00:00:03.240> weather<00:00:03.480> days<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.899> have<00:00:04.020> a

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
uncommon on bad weather days to have a

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.170 
uncommon on bad weather days to have a
few<00:00:04.290> trees<00:00:04.560> go<00:00:04.799> down<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.250> take<00:00:05.759> out<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.000> power

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
few trees go down and take out the power

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.450 
few trees go down and take out the power
lines<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:07.080> sets<00:00:07.440> up<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.740> scenario<00:00:07.919> for

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
lines and that sets up a scenario for

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.640 
lines and that sets up a scenario for
some<00:00:09.150> really<00:00:09.570> bad<00:00:09.719> conditions<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.530> instance

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
some really bad conditions for instance

could freeze all your pipes all of your
food<00:00:14.820> gets<00:00:15.030> spoiled<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.450> refrigerator<00:00:15.990> and

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
food gets spoiled the refrigerator and

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.990 
food gets spoiled the refrigerator and
of<00:00:16.199> course<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.619> no<00:00:16.800> security<00:00:17.640> system

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
of course you have no security system

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.760 
of course you have no security system
when<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.210> power<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.539> down<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.050> why<00:00:19.260> we're

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
when the power is down so why we're

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.279 
when the power is down so why we're
gonna<00:00:19.830> remedy<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.310> situation<00:00:21.050> that's<00:00:22.050> where

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
gonna remedy that situation that's where

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.019 
gonna remedy that situation that's where
an<00:00:22.350> automatic<00:00:22.830> home<00:00:23.039> backup<00:00:23.430> generator<00:00:23.850> can

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
an automatic home backup generator can

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.240 
an automatic home backup generator can
be<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> great<00:00:24.449> idea<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.080> unit<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.039> will

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
be a great idea a unit like this will

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.009 
be a great idea a unit like this will
run<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.519> propane<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.150> we've<00:00:27.330> got<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.840> or

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
run on propane like we've got here or

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.450 
run on propane like we've got here or
natural<00:00:28.500> gas<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.859> that's<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.130> you've<00:00:29.250> got

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
natural gas so that's what you've got

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.550 
natural gas so that's what you've got
there's<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> few<00:00:30.510> electrical<00:00:30.929> connections<00:00:31.410> as

regular power again the electronics in
the<00:01:11.490> unit<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.180> sense<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> utility

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the unit will sense when the utility

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.679 
the unit will sense when the utility
power<00:01:13.439> returns<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.369> will<00:01:14.610> turn<00:01:14.850> off<00:01:15.030> transfer

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
power returns it will turn off transfer

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960 
power returns it will turn off transfer
power<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.740> utility<00:01:17.280> power<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> it'll

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
power back to utility power and it'll

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.340 
power back to utility power and it'll
wait<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> next<00:01:18.479> power<00:01:18.600> outage<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
wait for the next power outage and the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.539 
wait for the next power outage and the
setup<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.400> pretty

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
setup of these is really pretty

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.980 
setup of these is really pretty
straightforward<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
straightforward it is it's not a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
straightforward it is it's not a
do-it-yourself<00:01:22.200> project<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.520> need<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
do-it-yourself project you do need to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.469

will<00:02:42.840> turn<00:02:42.900> those<00:02:43.290> off<00:02:43.560> it'll<00:02:43.920> wait<00:02:44.130> until

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
will turn those off it'll wait until

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.860 
will turn those off it'll wait until
powers<00:02:44.790> available<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:45.570> it'll<00:02:45.720> turn

powers available and then it'll turn

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.990 
powers available and then it'll turn
them<00:02:46.080> back<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.260> again<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.340> way<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.580> can

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
them back on again so that way you can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.120 
them back on again so that way you can
backup<00:02:48.300> all<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.080> appliances<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:50.010> your

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
home with a smaller generator and then

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.240 
home with a smaller generator and then
of<00:02:51.990> course<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.200> can<00:02:52.320> also<00:02:52.440> use<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.710> portable

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
of course you can also use a portable

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.590 
of course you can also use a portable
generator<00:02:53.280> but<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.060> won't<00:02:54.210> turn<00:02:54.420> on

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
generator but then that won't turn on

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.270 
generator but then that won't turn on
automatically<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.590> that's<00:02:55.860> correct<00:02:56.130> a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
automatically for you that's correct a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.890 
automatically for you that's correct a
portable<00:02:56.670> generator<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.300> always<00:02:57.630> an<00:02:57.720> option

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
portable generator is always an option

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.080 
portable generator is always an option
many<00:02:58.620> people<00:02:58.950> will<00:02:59.130> use<00:02:59.400> them<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.940> an

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
many people will use them in an

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.580 
many people will use them in an
emergency<00:03:00.510> when<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.870> power's<00:03:01.200> out<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.530> they
