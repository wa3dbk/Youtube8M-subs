00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
you have to use blink Pro what you do is

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.930 
you have to use blink Pro what you do is
you<00:04:41.270> slap<00:04:41.570> on<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.840> Kimbo<00:04:42.290> and<00:04:42.590> FMJ<00:04:43.310> with<00:04:43.730> the

you slap on a Kimbo and FMJ with the

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.630 
you slap on a Kimbo and FMJ with the
models<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.560> reverts<00:04:45.860> back<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.220> how<00:04:46.490> it

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
models and it reverts back to how it

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.770 
models and it reverts back to how it
used<00:04:46.670> to<00:04:46.970> be<00:04:47.030> so<00:04:47.420> instead<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.840> having<00:04:48.770> a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
used to be so instead of having a

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.870 
used to be so instead of having a
short-range<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:51.170> have<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.880> long-range

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
short-range you have the long-range

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.520 
short-range you have the long-range
again<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:56.030> reason<00:04:56.420> for<00:04:56.600> this<00:04:56.750> sniper<00:04:57.170> class

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
again the reason for this sniper class

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.760 
again the reason for this sniper class
is<00:04:57.710> not<00:04:57.830> using<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.900> intervention<00:05:00.620> is

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
is not using that the intervention is

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.410 
is not using that the intervention is
it's<00:05:01.130> because<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:02.650> think<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.430> in<00:05:05.210> my<00:05:05.390> opinion

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
it's because I think the in my opinion

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.160 
it's because I think the in my opinion
the<00:05:07.210> Infinity<00:05:08.210> Ward<00:05:08.390> did<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> horrible<00:05:08.900> job

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
the Infinity Ward did a horrible job

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.650 
the Infinity Ward did a horrible job
with<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.250> sniper<00:05:10.520> rifles<00:05:11.030> as<00:05:11.120> far<00:05:11.330> as<00:05:11.390> power

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
with the sniper rifles as far as power

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.990 
with the sniper rifles as far as power
goes<00:05:12.280> because<00:05:13.280> I<00:05:14.770> get<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.190> many<00:05:16.340> hit<00:05:16.610> markers

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
goes because I get so many hit markers

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.970 
goes because I get so many hit markers
with<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.240> intervention<00:05:17.930> it's<00:05:18.200> ridiculous

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
with the intervention it's ridiculous

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.120 
with the intervention it's ridiculous
I<00:05:19.010> hate<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:19.900> this<00:05:20.900> seems<00:05:21.140> like<00:05:21.260> almost<00:05:21.830> have<00:05:21.980> to

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
I hate it this seems like almost have to

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.380 
I hate it this seems like almost have to
get<00:05:22.250> somebody<00:05:22.610> in<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.850> back<00:05:23.000> of<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.240> head

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
get somebody in the back of the head

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.060 
get somebody in the back of the head
every<00:05:23.660> time<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.990> bring<00:05:24.170> it<00:05:24.290> down<00:05:24.410> one<00:05:24.830> shot

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
every time to bring it down one shot

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.760 
every time to bring it down one shot
every<00:05:25.910> other<00:05:26.120> time<00:05:26.450> it<00:05:26.720> seems<00:05:27.020> like<00:05:27.350> it's<00:05:27.650> just

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
every other time it seems like it's just

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.860 
every other time it seems like it's just
a<00:05:28.250> 50/50<00:05:28.850> chance<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.390> it's<00:05:29.510> going<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.690> bring

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
a 50/50 chance and it's going to bring

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.640 
a 50/50 chance and it's going to bring
them<00:05:29.990> down<00:05:30.020> so<00:05:31.010> I<00:05:31.370> used<00:05:32.260> wa2000<00:05:33.260> without

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
them down so I used wa2000 without

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.970 
them down so I used wa2000 without
stopping<00:05:34.100> power<00:05:34.280> with<00:05:34.820> FM<00:05:35.270> Jail<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:36.080> I

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
stopping power with FM Jail and I

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.600 
stopping power with FM Jail and I
usually<00:05:37.280> get<00:05:37.850> one<00:05:38.180> shot<00:05:38.510> kills<00:05:38.900> because<00:05:39.860> you

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
usually get one shot kills because you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.690 
usually get one shot kills because you
know<00:05:41.170> it's<00:05:42.170> a<00:05:42.350> lot<00:05:42.500> easier<00:05:42.890> to<00:05:43.130> hit<00:05:43.280> somebody

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
know it's a lot easier to hit somebody

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.280 
know it's a lot easier to hit somebody
in<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.180> upper<00:05:44.780> chest

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
in the upper chest

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.650 
in the upper chest
you<00:05:45.560> got<00:05:45.710> semi-automatic<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:47.240> doesn't<00:05:47.540> have

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
you got semi-automatic that doesn't have

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.240 
you got semi-automatic that doesn't have
a<00:05:47.690> bunch<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:47.960> recoil<00:05:48.380> rather<00:05:48.770> than<00:05:49.070> the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
a bunch of recoil rather than the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.810 
a bunch of recoil rather than the
bolt-action<00:05:49.840> now<00:05:50.840> as<00:05:51.080> far<00:05:51.290> as<00:05:51.460> having<00:05:52.460> fun

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
bolt-action now as far as having fun

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.860 
bolt-action now as far as having fun
with<00:05:53.120> it<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:54.770> intervention<00:05:55.100> is<00:05:55.370> more<00:05:55.610> fun

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
with it the intervention is more fun

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.790 
with it the intervention is more fun
because<00:05:56.870> it's<00:05:57.020> the<00:05:57.140> book<00:05:57.290> it's<00:05:57.650> only

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
because it's the book it's only

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.210 
because it's the book it's only
bolt-action<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:58.790> it<00:05:59.690> looks<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.170> looks<00:06:00.230> pretty

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
bolt-action and it looks it looks pretty

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.580 
bolt-action and it looks it looks pretty
sweet<00:06:01.430> my<00:06:02.030> opinion<00:06:02.450> it's<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.840> but<00:06:03.200> the

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
sweet my opinion it's the but the

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.940 
sweet my opinion it's the but the
best-looking<00:06:04.100> gun<00:06:04.250> in<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.460> game<00:06:05.020> and<00:06:06.020> but

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950
