00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
interesting topic because you may have

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.860 
interesting topic because you may have
different<00:00:11.639> sized<00:00:11.820> riders<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.599> may<00:00:12.719> have

different sized riders you may have

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.480 
different sized riders you may have
different<00:00:13.200> sizes<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.530> horses<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.070> you're

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
different sizes of horses that you're

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.189 
different sizes of horses that you're
going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.730> using<00:00:14.969> your<00:00:15.059> saddle<00:00:15.450> for<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.139> you

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
going to be using your saddle for so you

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.620 
going to be using your saddle for so you
may<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> few<00:00:17.250> several<00:00:18.180> saddles

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
may have to have a few several saddles

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.689 
may have to have a few several saddles
if<00:00:18.810> you've<00:00:19.170> got<00:00:19.350> different<00:00:19.560> size<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.250> riders

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
if you've got different size of riders

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.090 
if you've got different size of riders
because<00:00:21.320> saddles<00:00:22.320> come<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.619> different<00:00:22.769> sizes

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
because saddles come in different sizes

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340 
because saddles come in different sizes
and<00:00:23.519> shapes<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> fit<00:00:24.330> both<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> rider

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
two things that you need to consider the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.690 
two things that you need to consider the
first<00:04:06.380> is<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.739> look<00:04:07.100> at<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.280> front<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
first is you look at the front of the

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.790 
first is you look at the front of the
saddle<00:04:07.970> different<00:04:08.840> saddles<00:04:09.050> have<00:04:09.380> different

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
saddle different saddles have different

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.460 
saddle different saddles have different
widths<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.760> their<00:04:10.940> bars<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.600> trees<00:04:11.900> the

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
widths to their bars and the trees the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.470 
widths to their bars and the trees the
tree<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.010> main<00:04:13.190> frame<00:04:13.550> of<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.850> syle<00:04:14.090> here

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
tree is the main frame of the syle here

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.539 
tree is the main frame of the syle here
it<00:04:14.840> may<00:04:15.080> be<00:04:15.140> made<00:04:15.410> out<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.680> wood<00:04:15.920> covered<00:04:16.430> with

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
it may be made out of wood covered with

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.970 
it may be made out of wood covered with
leather<00:04:16.790> or<00:04:16.940> rawhide<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:18.020> may<00:04:18.290> be<00:04:18.350> more<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.799> a

fiberglass<00:04:19.640> or<00:04:19.880> synthetic<00:04:20.419> product<00:04:20.840> but<00:04:21.770> you

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
fiberglass or synthetic product but you

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.950 
fiberglass or synthetic product but you
need<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.160> have<00:04:22.310> a<00:04:22.340> tree<00:04:22.760> so<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.390> front<00:04:23.690> bars

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
need to have a tree so the front bars

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.250 
need to have a tree so the front bars
are<00:04:24.460> parallel<00:04:25.460> and

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260
