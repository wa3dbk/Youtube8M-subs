guns<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.290> both<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.620> people's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
guns I think in both in people's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.150 
guns I think in both in people's
opinions<00:00:38.989> red<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> very<00:00:40.649> good<00:00:40.739> color

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
opinions red is just a very good color

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
opinions red is just a very good color
you<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.610> especially<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> more

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you know especially if it's a more

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.229 
you know especially if it's a more
dominant<00:00:43.230> color<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.910> looks<00:00:45.090> very

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
dominant color so I think it looks very

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
dominant color so I think it looks very
good<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.750> blue<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.440> complements<00:00:47.100> it

do have a pretty decent mobility in
articulation<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.620> maybe<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:50.280> kind

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
articulation I just think maybe it kind

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.270 
articulation I just think maybe it kind
of<00:02:50.880> hinders<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.510> little<00:02:51.900> bit<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:53.130> its

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
of hinders a little bit because of its

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.190 
of hinders a little bit because of its
bulkiness<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.420> that's<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.960> bad

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
bulkiness but that's not really a bad

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.740 
bulkiness but that's not really a bad
thing<00:02:55.230> because<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.520> know<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.880> don't<00:02:57.570> mom

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
thing because I do you know I don't mom

thing because I do you know I don't mom
I<00:02:57.900> don't<00:02:57.990> mind<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> bulkiness<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.100> model

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
I don't mind the bulkiness of the model

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.930 
I don't mind the bulkiness of the model
itself<00:02:59.930> now<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.960> do<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.340> core<00:03:02.580> fire<00:03:02.790> is

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
