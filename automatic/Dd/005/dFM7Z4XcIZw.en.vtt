00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.200 

okay<00:00:14.890> the<00:00:15.040> first<00:00:15.250> exercise<00:00:15.730> in<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.000> core

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.210 
okay the first exercise in the core

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.240 
okay the first exercise in the core
circuit<00:00:16.630> is<00:00:16.810> 90-degree<00:00:17.470> twists<00:00:17.920> here<00:00:18.130> you're

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
circuit is 90-degree twists here you're

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.160 
circuit is 90-degree twists here you're
going<00:00:18.340> to<00:00:18.400> grab<00:00:18.640> a<00:00:18.670> plate<00:00:19.060> you<00:00:19.300> can<00:00:19.750> do<00:00:19.810> twenty

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
going to grab a plate you can do twenty

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.500 
going to grab a plate you can do twenty
fives<00:00:20.410> forty<00:00:21.070> fives<00:00:21.310> tens<00:00:21.730> whatever<00:00:22.270> works

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
fives forty fives tens whatever works

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.810 
fives forty fives tens whatever works
best<00:00:22.630> for<00:00:22.869> you<00:00:23.170> and<00:00:23.460> you're<00:00:24.460> just<00:00:24.580> going<00:00:24.730> to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
best for you and you're just going to

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.790 
best for you and you're just going to
explode<00:00:25.270> to<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.480> side<00:00:25.810> coming<00:00:26.260> back<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.680> the

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
explode to the side coming back to the

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.380 
explode to the side coming back to the
front<00:00:27.040> and<00:00:27.190> then<00:00:27.400> stopping<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:28.029> weight<00:00:28.210> and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
front and then stopping the weight and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.210 
front and then stopping the weight and
then<00:00:28.510> exploding<00:00:29.410> back<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.710> other<00:00:29.830> direction

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
then exploding back the other direction

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.610 
then exploding back the other direction
so<00:00:30.400> each<00:00:30.820> direction<00:00:31.510> you're<00:00:31.960> making<00:00:32.290> a<00:00:32.379> very

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.620 
so each direction you're making a very

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.110 
so each direction you're making a very
explosive<00:00:33.070> movement<00:00:33.730> you're<00:00:33.820> going<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:34.030> have

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
explosive movement you're going to have

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.030 
explosive movement you're going to have
to<00:00:34.270> stop<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.600> weight<00:00:34.989> and<00:00:35.200> then<00:00:35.320> explode<00:00:35.800> back

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
to stop the weight and then explode back

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.650 
to stop the weight and then explode back
the<00:00:36.220> opposite<00:00:36.580> direction<00:00:36.879> this<00:00:37.090> is<00:00:37.150> different

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
the opposite direction this is different

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.900 
the opposite direction this is different
than<00:00:37.780> 180<00:00:38.770> degree<00:00:39.070> twist<00:00:39.309> where<00:00:39.550> you're<00:00:39.640> going

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
than 180 degree twist where you're going

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.250 
than 180 degree twist where you're going
all<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.210> way<00:00:40.239> from<00:00:40.510> one<00:00:40.720> side<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.170> other

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
all the way from one side to the other

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.170 
all the way from one side to the other
side<00:00:41.620> you're<00:00:41.860> stopping<00:00:42.190> directly<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:42.940> front

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
side you're stopping directly in front

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.420 
side you're stopping directly in front
of<00:00:43.270> you<00:00:43.390> here<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.410> your<00:00:44.559> core<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:45.040> actually

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
of you here so your core is actually

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.030 
of you here so your core is actually
going<00:00:45.520> to<00:00:45.610> remain<00:00:45.879> engaged<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.600> entire<00:00:46.629> time

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
going to remain engaged the entire time

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.250 
going to remain engaged the entire time
make<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.070> very<00:00:48.460> very<00:00:48.730> explosive<00:00:49.629> movement<00:00:50.110> both

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
make a very very explosive movement both

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.290 
make a very very explosive movement both
directions<00:00:50.650> it's<00:00:51.400> extremely<00:00:51.879> challenging

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
directions it's extremely challenging

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.939 
directions it's extremely challenging

pretty<00:01:35.569> shaky<00:01:36.080> I'm<00:01:36.619> probably<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:36.950> little<00:01:37.069> bit

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
pretty shaky I'm probably a little bit

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.609 
pretty shaky I'm probably a little bit
better<00:01:37.340> job<00:01:37.610> than<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.080> coming<00:01:39.080> up<00:01:39.200> nice<00:01:39.350> and

better job than that coming up nice and

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.109 
better job than that coming up nice and
slow<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:39.860> want<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.250> be<00:01:40.310> under<00:01:40.580> control<00:01:40.610> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
slow you want to be under control and

just make this a very slow controlled

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.609 
just make this a very slow controlled
movement<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:43.789> hold<00:01:44.090> oh<00:01:44.390> yeah<00:01:45.319> look<00:01:45.560> at

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
movement and then hold oh yeah look at

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.090 
movement and then hold oh yeah look at
that<00:01:45.770> form<00:01:46.100> look<00:01:46.700> at<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:46.909> form

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
that form look at that form

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.200 
that form look at that form
want<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.159> have<00:01:49.250> a<00:01:49.280> straight<00:01:49.700> line<00:01:49.940> coming

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
want to have a straight line coming

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.010 
want to have a straight line coming
across<00:01:51.700> through<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.789> leg<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.420> back<00:01:53.690> in<00:01:53.899> the

across through the leg the back in the
arm

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
arm

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.600 
arm
now<00:01:55.580> if<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:56.289> single<00:01:57.289> arm<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.770> leg<00:01:58.039> becomes

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
now if the single arm and leg becomes

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.430 
now if the single arm and leg becomes
too<00:01:58.789> challenging<00:01:59.270> for<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.630> off<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.229> ground

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
too challenging for you off the ground

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.260 
too challenging for you off the ground
you<00:02:00.830> can<00:02:00.860> move<00:02:01.130> your<00:02:01.310> forearms<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.090> just

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
you can move your forearms and just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.850 
you can move your forearms and just
bring<00:02:02.479> one<00:02:02.690> leg<00:02:02.720> up<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.229> then<00:02:03.380> holding<00:02:03.740> that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
bring one leg up and then holding that
