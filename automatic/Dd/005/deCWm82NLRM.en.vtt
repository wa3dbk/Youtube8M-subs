welcome<00:00:04.470> so<00:00:04.830> what<00:00:05.069> I'm<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.370> do<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.640> show

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
welcome so what I'm going to do is show

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.420 
welcome so what I'm going to do is show
you<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.120> divide<00:00:06.660> these<00:00:07.140> our<00:00:07.500> polynomial

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430 
you how to divide these our polynomial

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.490 
you how to divide these our polynomial
by<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.879> monomial<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.900> what<00:00:10.049> we<00:00:10.139> have<00:00:10.289> here

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
by this monomial and what we have here

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.250 
by this monomial and what we have here
is<00:00:10.650> 4<00:00:10.980> X<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.430> the<00:00:11.520> 4th<00:00:11.760> plus<00:00:11.820> 8x<00:00:12.480> cubed<00:00:12.779> plus<00:00:13.049> X

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
is 4 X to the 4th plus 8x cubed plus X

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.970 
is 4 X to the 4th plus 8x cubed plus X
minus<00:00:14.100> 3<00:00:14.369> divided<00:00:14.789> by<00:00:15.080> 2x<00:00:16.080> now<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> lot<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.740> times

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
minus 3 divided by 2x now a lot of times

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590 
minus 3 divided by 2x now a lot of times
we'll<00:00:17.100> see<00:00:17.280> maybe<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.820> book<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.300> maybe<00:00:18.510> an

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
we'll see maybe in a book or maybe an

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.030 
we'll see maybe in a book or maybe an
example<00:00:18.990> we'll<00:00:19.110> put<00:00:19.320> parentheses<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.860> there

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
example we'll put parentheses on there

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.380 
example we'll put parentheses on there
and<00:00:20.280> that's<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.820> make<00:00:20.970> sure<00:00:21.120> that<00:00:21.270> we

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
and that's just to make sure that we

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.700 
and that's just to make sure that we
understand<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.930> we're<00:00:22.050> dividing<00:00:22.530> this

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
understand that we're dividing this

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.980 
understand that we're dividing this
whole<00:00:22.980> polynomial<00:00:23.340> by<00:00:24.120> our<00:00:24.270> monomial<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
whole polynomial by our monomial so to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.440 
whole polynomial by our monomial so to
apply<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:26.310> division<00:00:26.550> algorithm<00:00:27.030> for

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
apply the division algorithm for

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.120 
apply the division algorithm for
division<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.260> polynomial<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:28.860> we're<00:00:28.950> going<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
division of polynomial so we're going to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.240 
division of polynomial so we're going to
want<00:00:29.280> to<00:00:29.369> write<00:00:29.610> it<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.030> this<00:00:30.720> format<00:00:31.170> oh<00:00:37.220> ok<00:00:38.220> I

want to write it in this format oh ok I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.560 
want to write it in this format oh ok I
forgot<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.700> last<00:00:38.880> thing<00:00:39.060> when<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> this

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
if you notice if I'm taking this pawn

I<00:00:43.380> have<00:00:43.530> X<00:00:43.739> 1/4<00:00:44.100> x<00:00:44.399> EQ<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.540> an<00:00:45.690> x

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I have X 1/4 x EQ but I don't have an x

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.030 
I have X 1/4 x EQ but I don't have an x
squared<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.829> learning

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
squared and when you're first learning

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.530 
squared and when you're first learning
long<00:00:47.340> division<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:48.059> probably<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> be

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
long division it's probably going to be

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.870 
long division it's probably going to be
very<00:00:48.630> very<00:00:49.050> helpful<00:00:49.380> for<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.130> to<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
very very helpful for you to for you to

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.319 
very very helpful for you to for you to
in<00:00:51.559> include<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.860> 0x<00:00:53.850> squared

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
in include a 0x squared

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.330 
in include a 0x squared
now<00:00:54.420> remember<00:00:54.840> 0x<00:00:55.260> squared<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.649> still<00:00:55.739> 0<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
now remember 0x squared is still 0 and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.530 
now remember 0x squared is still 0 and
you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:56.969> why<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> doesn't

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
you can see that that's why it doesn't

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.630 
you can see that that's why it doesn't
show<00:00:57.630> up<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.200> this<00:00:58.380> is<00:00:58.530> gonna<00:00:58.620> help<00:00:58.980> us<00:00:59.160> just

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
show up but this is gonna help us just

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.100 
show up but this is gonna help us just
as<00:00:59.730> far<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.030> our<00:01:00.180> place<00:01:00.420> value<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:00.960> we're

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
as far as our place value when we're

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.999 
as far as our place value when we're
first<00:01:01.320> learning<00:01:01.790> long<00:01:02.790> division<00:01:03.890> all<00:01:04.890> right

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
first learning long division all right

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.139 
first learning long division all right
so<00:01:05.189> there's<00:01:05.369> everything<00:01:05.789> that<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.969> have<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
so there's everything that I have and

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.969 
so there's everything that I have and
I'll<00:01:06.450> even<00:01:06.630> use<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.229> different<00:01:07.590> color<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I'll even use a different color to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
I'll even use a different color to
represent<00:01:08.490> my<00:01:08.639> quotient<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.020> remember<00:01:10.259> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
represent my quotient so remember the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.209 
represent my quotient so remember the
first<00:01:10.499> thing<00:01:10.619> we're<00:01:10.740> gonna<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.039> going<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
first thing we're gonna do is going to

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.800 
first thing we're gonna do is going to
take<00:01:11.399> our<00:01:11.520> first<00:01:11.700> term<00:01:11.909> another<00:01:12.209> divisor<00:01:12.509> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
take our first term another divisor and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
take our first term another divisor and
divide<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> first<00:01:14.069> term<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> our

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
divide it into the first term of our

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.709 
divide it into the first term of our
dividend<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.259> 2x<00:01:16.499> divides<00:01:17.069> into<00:01:17.279> 4<00:01:17.579> X<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:18.359> X<00:01:18.539> to

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
dividend so 2x divides into 4 X for X to

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.949 
dividend so 2x divides into 4 X for X to
the<00:01:18.810> fourth<00:01:19.100> 2x<00:01:20.100> cubed<00:01:20.639> times<00:01:21.209> then<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
the fourth 2x cubed times then we

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.139 
the fourth 2x cubed times then we
multiply<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.529> two<00:01:22.829> x<00:01:23.009> cubed<00:01:23.340> times<00:01:23.579> 2x<00:01:23.969> is

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
multiply these two x cubed times 2x is

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.719 
multiply these two x cubed times 2x is
going<00:01:24.359> to<00:01:24.450> leave<00:01:24.569> us<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.889> 4<00:01:25.889> X<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.459> fourth

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
going to leave us with 4 X to the fourth

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.279 
going to leave us with 4 X to the fourth
and<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.029> course<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.420> want<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.899> because<00:01:28.079> we

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
and of course we want that because we

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.910 
and of course we want that because we
want<00:01:28.529> to<00:01:28.619> subtract<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:30.149> 0<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.649> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
want to subtract this out to 0 so that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.949 
want to subtract this out to 0 so that
goes<00:01:32.429> head<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> becomes<00:01:33.179> a<00:01:33.299> 0<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.569> one

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
goes head and becomes a 0 now one

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.660 
goes head and becomes a 0 now one
important<00:01:34.380> thing<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:34.770> gonna<00:01:34.920> use

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
important thing that I'm gonna use

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
important thing that I'm gonna use
different<00:01:36.090> color<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.689> make<00:01:37.289> sure<00:01:37.469> when

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
different color with is make sure when

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.539 
different color with is make sure when
you're<00:01:37.709> subtracting<00:01:37.920> you're<00:01:38.369> subtracting

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you're subtracting you're subtracting

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.519 
you're subtracting you're subtracting
the<00:01:38.999> whole<00:01:39.029> row<00:01:39.599> this<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.109> can<00:01:40.229> become<00:01:40.499> very

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:40.529 
the whole row this is it can become very

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:43.690 
the whole row this is it can become very
very<00:01:41.099> important<00:01:41.639> once<00:01:42.029> we<00:01:42.240> start<00:01:42.749> dividing<00:01:43.170> by

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
very important once we start dividing by

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.159 
very important once we start dividing by
binomials<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.819> trinomials<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.020> really

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:46.169 
binomials and trinomials so it's really

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:47.330 
binomials and trinomials so it's really
important<00:01:46.469> that<00:01:46.529> we're<00:01:46.649> subtracting<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
important that we're subtracting the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.749 
important that we're subtracting the
whole<00:01:47.669> row<00:01:48.469> all<00:01:49.469> right<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:49.919> we<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.159> 0<00:01:50.429> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
whole row all right so then we have 0 so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.830 
whole row all right so then we have 0 so
now<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:50.969> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> bring<00:01:51.329> down<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> next

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
now I'm going to bring down the next

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.190 
now I'm going to bring down the next
term<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.289> is<00:01:52.439> 8x<00:01:53.009> cubed<00:01:53.520> 2x<00:01:54.270> divides<00:01:54.929> into<00:01:55.109> 8

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
term which is 8x cubed 2x divides into 8

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.209 
term which is 8x cubed 2x divides into 8
X<00:01:55.619> cubed<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.189> positive<00:01:56.880> 4x<00:01:57.539> squared<00:01:58.289> times<00:01:58.560> then

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
X cubed a positive 4x squared times then

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.219 
X cubed a positive 4x squared times then
I<00:01:59.249> take<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.789> part<00:02:00.419> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.569> quotient<00:02:00.749> and<00:02:01.079> I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
I take this part of the quotient and I

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.499 
I take this part of the quotient and I
multiply<00:02:01.499> it<00:02:01.709> by<00:02:01.889> the<00:02:01.950> my<00:02:02.249> divisor<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:03.209> give<00:02:03.389> me

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
multiply it by the my divisor to give me

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.640 
multiply it by the my divisor to give me
8<00:02:03.719> X<00:02:04.079> cubed<00:02:04.529> again<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.880> subtract

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
8 X cubed again I subtract

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.640 
8 X cubed again I subtract
the<00:02:08.430> whole<00:02:08.640> term<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.350> therefore<00:02:10.350> that<00:02:10.410> gives

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
the whole term and therefore that gives

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.280 
the whole term and therefore that gives
me<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.920> zero<00:02:11.630> then<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.660> bring<00:02:12.930> down<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.170> next

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
me with zero then I bring down the next

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
me with zero then I bring down the next
term<00:02:13.650> which<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.130> zero<00:02:14.490> x<00:02:14.790> squared<00:02:15.170> now<00:02:16.310> 2x

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
term which is a zero x squared now 2x

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.830 
term which is a zero x squared now 2x
does<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.880> divide<00:02:18.300> into<00:02:18.600> zero<00:02:19.470> x<00:02:19.710> squared<00:02:20.100> so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
does not divide into zero x squared so

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.380 
does not divide into zero x squared so
but<00:02:21.950> 2<00:02:22.950> does<00:02:23.100> not<00:02:23.130> divide<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.640> zero<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> ax

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
but 2 does not divide in zero and the ax

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.210 
but 2 does not divide in zero and the ax
though<00:02:24.750> does<00:02:24.960> divide<00:02:25.260> into<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.620> x<00:02:25.800> squared<00:02:26.100> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
though does divide into the x squared so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.890 
though does divide into the x squared so
you<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.460> say<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:27.000> place<00:02:27.240> value<00:02:27.750> is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you can say that this place value is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.050 
you can say that this place value is
going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.710> positive<00:02:29.040> zero<00:02:29.520> X<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:29.910> we're

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
going to be a positive zero X so we're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.540 
going to be a positive zero X so we're
not<00:02:30.210> going<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.540> include<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:31.260> linear<00:02:31.980> term<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
not going to include a linear term and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.070 
not going to include a linear term and
part<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.090> our<00:02:33.180> divisor<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:33.690> we'll<00:02:33.840> put<00:02:34.020> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
part of our divisor but we'll put it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.750 
part of our divisor but we'll put it
with<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> zero<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> place

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
with the zero just so we have the place

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.860 
with the zero just so we have the place
value<00:02:36.210> in<00:02:36.390> our<00:02:36.690> descending<00:02:37.260> order<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.660> zero<00:02:39.660> x

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
value in our descending order so zero x

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.790 
value in our descending order so zero x
times<00:02:40.140> 2<00:02:40.350> X's<00:02:40.710> become<00:02:41.010> zero<00:02:41.450> x<00:02:42.450> squared<00:02:42.960> which

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
times 2 X's become zero x squared which

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.910 
times 2 X's become zero x squared which
of<00:02:43.980> course<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.460> zero<00:02:44.910> then<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.990> bring<00:02:46.380> down<00:02:46.590> my

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
of course is zero then I bring down my

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.820 
of course is zero then I bring down my
next<00:02:47.670> term<00:02:51.230> zero<00:02:52.230> x<00:02:52.410> times<00:02:52.710> 0<00:02:53.550> 8<00:02:54.150> x<00:02:54.390> squared

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
next term zero x times 0 8 x squared

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.630 
next term zero x times 0 8 x squared
just<00:02:55.830> want<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.100> make<00:02:56.220> sure<00:02:56.250> plus<00:02:56.820> x<00:02:58.190> o0<00:02:59.190> x

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
going to bring down the next term which

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.080 
going to bring down the next term which
is<00:03:06.690> an<00:03:06.900> x<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.920> thought<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.520> wrote<00:03:08.790> something<00:03:09.000> down

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
is an x I thought I wrote something down

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.180 
is an x I thought I wrote something down
wrong<00:03:09.210> with<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.570> problem<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.320> 2x<00:03:10.590> divides

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
wrong with the problem so 2x divides

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.050 
wrong with the problem so 2x divides
into<00:03:11.430> ax<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:12.060> positive<00:03:13.010> one<00:03:14.010> half<00:03:14.250> times<00:03:14.670> and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
into ax a positive one half times and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.910 
into ax a positive one half times and
then<00:03:15.600> 1/2<00:03:16.050> times<00:03:16.500> 2x<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.370> going<00:03:17.550> to<00:03:17.760> equal<00:03:18.920> it's

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
then 1/2 times 2x is going to equal it's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.210 
then 1/2 times 2x is going to equal it's
going<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.160> equal<00:03:20.400> X<00:03:20.670> again<00:03:21.239> we<00:03:21.540> subtract<00:03:22.220> that

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
going to equal X again we subtract that

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.550 
going to equal X again we subtract that
whole<00:03:23.520> row<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.050> therefore<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.140> leaves<00:03:25.380> us

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
whole row and therefore that leaves us

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.290 
whole row and therefore that leaves us
with<00:03:26.060> 0<00:03:27.060> then<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.200> bring<00:03:28.410> down<00:03:28.470> our<00:03:28.680> final<00:03:29.300> term

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
with 0 then we bring down our final term

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.080 
with 0 then we bring down our final term
which<00:03:30.570> is<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> negative<00:03:31.080> 3<00:03:31.440> now<00:03:31.890> notice<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.610> 2x

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
which is a negative 3 now notice this 2x

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.330 
which is a negative 3 now notice this 2x
this<00:03:33.690> has<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> variable<00:03:34.560> factor<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.190> it

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
this has a variable factor with it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.560 
this has a variable factor with it
that's<00:03:35.520> not<00:03:35.700> going<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.940> divide<00:03:36.239> into<00:03:36.420> a

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
that's not going to divide into a

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.050 
that's not going to divide into a
constant<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.470> therefore<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.040> negative<00:03:38.520> 3<00:03:38.760> is

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
constant so therefore this negative 3 is

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.030 
constant so therefore this negative 3 is
going<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.300> be<00:03:39.480> what<00:03:39.660> we<00:03:39.750> call<00:03:39.780> our<00:03:40.230> remainder

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
going to be what we call our remainder

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.979 
going to be what we call our remainder
so<00:03:41.970> that's<00:03:42.150> going<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.360> be<00:03:42.510> our<00:03:42.630> remaining

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
so that's going to be our remaining

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.640 
so that's going to be our remaining
value<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.500> our<00:03:44.060> our<00:03:45.060> term<00:03:45.390> 2x<00:03:45.690> does<00:03:46.080> not<00:03:46.260> divide

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
value so our our term 2x does not divide

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.820 
value so our our term 2x does not divide
evenly<00:03:46.890> into<00:03:47.489> our<00:03:48.330> polynomial<00:03:49.140> therefore

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
evenly into our polynomial therefore

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.949 
evenly into our polynomial therefore
when<00:03:50.010> right<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.310> our<00:03:50.400> answer<00:03:50.820> our<00:03:51.090> quotient<00:03:51.750> we

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
when right in our answer our quotient we

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.300 
when right in our answer our quotient we
can<00:03:52.140> write<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.500> as<00:03:53.030> 2x<00:03:54.030> cubed<00:03:54.660> plus<00:03:55.290> 4x<00:03:55.739> squared

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
can write it as 2x cubed plus 4x squared

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.880 
can write it as 2x cubed plus 4x squared
we<00:03:56.880> do<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.180> need<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.540> write<00:03:57.720> our<00:03:57.930> 0<00:03:58.260> X<00:03:58.500> term

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
we do not need to write our 0 X term

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.790 
we do not need to write our 0 X term
plus<00:03:59.880> 1/2<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.870> then<00:04:01.019> rather<00:04:01.260> than<00:04:01.590> writing

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
plus 1/2 and then rather than writing

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.370 
plus 1/2 and then rather than writing
like<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.070> remainder<00:04:02.519> our<00:04:03.060> negative<00:04:03.600> 3<00:04:03.870> we're

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
like a remainder our negative 3 we're

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.690 
like a remainder our negative 3 we're
gonna<00:04:04.500> write<00:04:04.800> our<00:04:05.010> remainder<00:04:07.130> divided<00:04:08.130> by<00:04:08.400> our

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
gonna write our remainder divided by our

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.180 
gonna write our remainder divided by our
divisor<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.450> I'm<00:04:09.720> saying<00:04:09.989> minus<00:04:10.530> 3<00:04:10.890> because

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
divisor and I'm saying minus 3 because

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.740 
divisor and I'm saying minus 3 because
that's<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.459> negative<00:04:11.820> 3<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.090> our<00:04:12.239> remainder<00:04:12.510> so

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
that's a negative 3 as our remainder so

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.770 
that's a negative 3 as our remainder so
it's<00:04:12.870> minus<00:04:13.230> 3<00:04:13.530> divided<00:04:14.370> by<00:04:14.400> our<00:04:14.760> divisor<00:04:15.420> so

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
it's minus 3 divided by our divisor so

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.699 
it's minus 3 divided by our divisor so
there<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.350> go<00:04:16.440> ladies<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.739> gentlemen<00:04:17.070> that

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
there you go ladies and gentlemen that

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.400 
there you go ladies and gentlemen that
is<00:04:17.799> how<00:04:18.069> you<00:04:18.130> divide<00:04:18.789> a<00:04:19.180> polynomial<00:04:19.720> by<00:04:20.169> a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
is how you divide a polynomial by a

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.330 
is how you divide a polynomial by a
monomial<00:04:21.330> thanks
