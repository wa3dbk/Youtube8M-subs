can<00:06:01.150> make<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.389> as<00:06:01.479> tight<00:06:01.750> as<00:06:01.930> you<00:06:01.960> want

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
can make it as tight as you want

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.790 
can make it as tight as you want
mmm<00:06:03.039> nose<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:05.110> don't<00:06:05.259> want<00:06:05.410> to<00:06:05.470> make<00:06:05.650> it

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
mmm nose you don't want to make it

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.890 
mmm nose you don't want to make it
really<00:06:06.099> tight<00:06:06.310> I'm<00:06:07.120> serious<00:06:07.509> it's<00:06:07.660> really

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
really tight I'm serious it's really

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.529 
really tight I'm serious it's really
tight<00:06:08.110> no<00:06:08.440> it<00:06:08.770> seemed<00:06:09.190> pretty<00:06:09.460> big<00:06:09.910> in<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.270> box

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
tight no it seemed pretty big in the box

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.379 
tight no it seemed pretty big in the box
and<00:06:10.810> I<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.169> don't<00:06:11.560> think<00:06:11.830> I'll<00:06:11.979> fit<00:06:12.340> on<00:06:12.460> me<00:06:12.669> but

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
and I I don't think I'll fit on me but

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.180 
and I I don't think I'll fit on me but
it<00:06:13.599> actually<00:06:13.840> does<00:06:14.380> because<00:06:14.949> um

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
it actually does because um

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.490 
it actually does because um
once<00:06:18.190> you<00:06:18.370> see<00:06:18.639> it<00:06:18.880> when<00:06:19.570> you<00:06:19.720> take<00:06:19.930> it<00:06:20.139> out<00:06:20.229> it

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
once you see it when you take it out it

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.219 
once you see it when you take it out it
looks<00:06:20.650> small<00:06:21.210> but<00:06:22.210> when<00:06:22.750> you<00:06:22.870> put<00:06:23.020> it<00:06:23.110> back<00:06:23.139> in

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
looks small but when you put it back in

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.700 
looks small but when you put it back in
it<00:06:23.620> looks<00:06:23.800> huge<00:06:24.099> and<00:06:24.690> same<00:06:25.690> thing<00:06:25.720> on<00:06:26.020> line<00:06:26.289> and

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
it looks huge and same thing on line and

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.330 
it looks huge and same thing on line and
um<00:06:27.360> it's<00:06:28.360> small<00:06:29.169> right<00:06:29.380> here<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:29.979> it's<00:06:30.130> kind

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
um it's small right here and it's kind

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.770 
um it's small right here and it's kind
of<00:06:30.400> no<00:06:30.970> it's<00:06:31.330> out<00:06:31.630> small<00:06:32.400> and<00:06:33.400> well<00:06:34.240> I<00:06:34.449> thought

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
of no it's out small and well I thought

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.230 
of no it's out small and well I thought
it'd<00:06:34.930> be<00:06:34.960> big<00:06:35.320> see<00:06:36.930> see<00:06:37.930> it<00:06:38.020> kind<00:06:38.199> of<00:06:38.229> looks<00:06:38.380> big

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
it'd be big see see it kind of looks big

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.560 
it'd be big see see it kind of looks big
it's<00:06:40.240> longer<00:06:40.449> than<00:06:40.630> a<00:06:40.810> movie<00:06:41.380> alright<00:06:42.099> fling

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.450 

yeah<00:06:46.570> did<00:06:46.870> that<00:06:46.900> that<00:06:47.680> was<00:06:47.889> someone<00:06:48.250> it<00:06:48.310> does

if you get it online they turn it on
when<00:07:00.610> they're<00:07:00.880> shipping<00:07:01.180> so<00:07:01.780> once<00:07:02.409> you<00:07:02.590> get<00:07:02.800> it

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:04.659 
you have to UM put a new battery in

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:06.570 
you have to UM put a new battery in
there<00:07:04.840> that's<00:07:05.169> what<00:07:05.320> I<00:07:05.440> said<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:06.070> first<00:07:06.099> thing

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
there that's what I said the first thing

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.540 
there that's what I said the first thing
that<00:07:06.610> they<00:07:07.270> said<00:07:07.539> on<00:07:08.080> instruction<00:07:08.800> manual<00:07:09.159> and

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
that they said on instruction manual and

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.120 
that they said on instruction manual and
um<00:07:11.340> you<00:07:12.340> know<00:07:12.490> the<00:07:13.180> stuff<00:07:13.449> and<00:07:13.720> sockets<00:07:14.590> open

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
um you know the stuff and sockets open

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.600 
um you know the stuff and sockets open
you<00:07:15.729> know<00:07:15.880> that<00:07:16.810> stuff<00:07:17.020> in<00:07:17.169> the<00:07:17.289> movie<00:07:17.610> except

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
you know that stuff in the movie except

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.980 
you know that stuff in the movie except
they<00:07:18.880> don't<00:07:18.970> have<00:07:19.090> this<00:07:19.360> on<00:07:19.539> the<00:07:19.659> movie

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
they don't have this on the movie

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.399 
they don't have this on the movie
because<00:07:20.880> they<00:07:21.880> use<00:07:22.060> factors<00:07:22.750> like<00:07:23.169> the

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409 
because they use factors like the

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:26.100 
because they use factors like the
computers<00:07:24.280> to<00:07:24.729> make<00:07:24.880> it<00:07:25.090> sounds<00:07:25.570> I<00:07:25.659> thought<00:07:25.900> I

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
computers to make it sounds I thought I

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.170 
computers to make it sounds I thought I
think<00:07:26.530> because<00:07:27.370> they<00:07:27.520> don't<00:07:27.729> have<00:07:27.880> that<00:07:28.060> on

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180 
think because they don't have that on

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.740 
think because they don't have that on
the<00:07:28.330> movie<00:07:28.630> to<00:07:28.720> make<00:07:28.870> sounds<00:07:29.409> you<00:07:30.370> know<00:07:30.690> so<00:07:31.690> it

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
the movie to make sounds you know so it

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.089 
the movie to make sounds you know so it
doesn't<00:07:32.199> seem<00:07:32.440> human

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:33.099 
doesn't seem human

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.420 
doesn't seem human
you<00:07:33.639> know<00:07:33.789> this<00:07:34.389> stuff<00:07:34.690> but<00:07:34.960> it<00:07:35.740> actually<00:07:36.250> does

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.430 
you know this stuff but it actually does

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.420 
you know this stuff but it actually does
fit<00:07:36.789> because<00:07:37.180> you<00:07:37.840> can<00:07:38.020> make<00:07:38.199> it<00:07:38.440> it<00:07:38.620> should

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430 
fit because you can make it it should

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.560 
fit because you can make it it should
like<00:07:39.789> it<00:07:40.029> could<00:07:40.210> be<00:07:40.240> really<00:07:40.840> tight<00:07:41.340> cuz<00:07:42.570> whip

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:43.570 
like it could be really tight cuz whip

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.519 
like it could be really tight cuz whip
it<00:07:43.779> tight

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:45.529 
it tight

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:48.579 
it tight
I'm<00:07:46.039> not<00:07:46.369> big<00:07:46.699> enough<00:07:46.729> I<00:07:47.269> can't<00:07:47.779> do<00:07:48.049> the<00:07:48.319> first

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:48.589 
I'm not big enough I can't do the first

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:51.159 
I'm not big enough I can't do the first
one<00:07:48.829> in<00:07:49.009> the<00:07:49.189> first<00:07:49.429> hole<00:07:50.389> and<00:07:50.779> it<00:07:50.869> could<00:07:51.049> be

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:51.169 
one in the first hole and it could be

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.229 
one in the first hole and it could be
like<00:07:51.319> that<00:07:51.559> because<00:07:51.889> lots<00:07:52.519> of<00:07:52.639> rubies<00:07:53.089> like

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:53.239 
like that because lots of rubies like

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.289 
like that because lots of rubies like
that

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:55.299 
that

00:07:55.299 --> 00:07:57.099 
that
rubies<00:07:56.299> like<00:07:56.509> this

00:07:57.099 --> 00:07:57.109 
rubies like this

00:07:57.109 --> 00:08:01.689 
rubies like this
i<00:07:57.139> watch<00:07:57.829> it's<00:07:58.549> kind<00:07:59.089> of<00:07:59.179> flipping<00:07:59.599> off<00:08:00.519> and<00:08:01.519> so

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:01.699 
i watch it's kind of flipping off and so

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:04.329 
i watch it's kind of flipping off and so
you<00:08:01.819> want<00:08:02.029> to<00:08:02.089> make<00:08:02.239> it<00:08:02.389> one<00:08:02.599> tighter<00:08:03.039> yet<00:08:04.039> if

00:08:04.329 --> 00:08:04.339 
you want to make it one tighter yet if

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:11.669 
you want to make it one tighter yet if
you<00:08:04.639> mind<00:08:05.479> sighs<00:08:07.539> you<00:08:08.539> know<00:08:08.659> you<00:08:09.529> know<00:08:10.239> nope

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:11.679 
you mind sighs you know you know nope

00:08:11.679 --> 00:08:15.789 
you mind sighs you know you know nope
it's<00:08:12.679> pretty<00:08:13.519> nice
