00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.709 

19<00:04:29.949> big<00:04:30.949> promise

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:33.719 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.639 

American<00:04:34.729> couples<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.939> go<00:04:36.110> in<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.289> second

American couples to go in the second

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:41.450 
American couples to go in the second
however<00:04:37.799> in<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.129> second<00:04:38.489> group<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.789> poor

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.629 

probably<00:04:42.060> being<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.300> leader

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.439 

and<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.479> can<00:04:47.689> always<00:04:48.729> work<00:04:49.729> well<00:04:49.969> if<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.240> pick

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
and it can always work well if you pick

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.300 
and it can always work well if you pick
the<00:04:50.569> soundtrack<00:04:51.349> to<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:52.639> film<00:04:53.270> because<00:04:53.840> the

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
the soundtrack to a film because the

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.860 
the soundtrack to a film because the
orchestration<00:04:55.310> of<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.610> music<00:04:56.150> or<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.360> musical

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
orchestration of the music or a musical

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.600 
orchestration of the music or a musical
all<00:04:57.319> can<00:04:57.560> work<00:04:57.710> together<00:04:57.949> so<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:58.460> was

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
all can work together so this was

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.939 
all can work together so this was
singing<00:04:58.969> in<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.150> rain<00:04:59.240> it's<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.259> first<00:05:00.560> lift

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
singing in the rain it's the first lift

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.110 
singing in the rain it's the first lift
I<00:05:01.189> think<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.979> it's<00:05:04.129> a<00:05:04.189> curved<00:05:04.460> lift<00:05:04.819> it's<00:05:05.000> not<00:05:05.090> a

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
I think so it's a curved lift it's not a

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.429 
I think so it's a curved lift it's not a
curve<00:05:05.360> ease<00:05:05.509> on<00:05:05.629> the<00:05:05.659> one<00:05:05.960> foot<00:05:06.229> going

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
curve ease on the one foot going

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.249 
curve ease on the one foot going
backwards<00:05:07.569> difficult<00:05:08.569> to<00:05:08.719> be<00:05:08.840> on<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.110> one

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
backwards difficult to be on the one

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.839 
backwards difficult to be on the one
foot<00:05:09.500> harder<00:05:10.009> going<00:05:10.219> forwards<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:10.639> more

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
foot harder going forwards is more

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.600 
foot harder going forwards is more
dangerous<00:05:11.860> this<00:05:12.860> is<00:05:13.039> one<00:05:13.159> of<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.340> step

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
dangerous this is one of the step

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.040 
dangerous this is one of the step
sequences<00:05:14.120> you're<00:05:14.270> allowed<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.659> leave<00:05:14.840> go

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
sequences you're allowed to leave go

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.899 
sequences you're allowed to leave go
just<00:05:15.610> for<00:05:16.610> one<00:05:17.150> whole<00:05:18.080> bar<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:19.009> the<00:05:19.460> music<00:05:19.759> one

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
just for one whole bar of the music one

just for one whole bar of the music one
well<00:05:20.240> one<00:05:20.509> set<00:05:21.169> of<00:05:21.379> beats<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:22.069> the<00:05:22.099> music<00:05:22.279> but

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
well one set of beats of the music but

well one set of beats of the music but
other<00:05:22.819> than<00:05:23.000> that<00:05:23.090> you<00:05:23.539> need<00:05:23.779> to<00:05:23.960> keep<00:05:24.110> hold

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
other than that you need to keep hold

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.189 
other than that you need to keep hold
harder<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.759> skating<00:05:26.060> down<00:05:26.389> hold<00:05:26.750> than<00:05:26.960> to<00:05:27.110> be

harder to skating down hold than to be
apart<00:05:27.529> like<00:05:27.710> this<00:05:28.389> we<00:05:29.389> need<00:05:29.539> to<00:05:29.659> be<00:05:29.779> fair

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
apart like this we need to be fair

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.890 
apart like this we need to be fair
twizzles<00:05:30.400> very<00:05:31.400> good<00:05:34.029> but<00:05:35.029> a<00:05:35.060> driving<00:05:35.539> routine

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
twizzles very good but a driving routine

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.510 
twizzles very good but a driving routine
there<00:05:36.110> wasn't<00:05:36.319> much<00:05:36.469> of<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.680> gap<00:05:36.919> in<00:05:37.189> it<00:05:37.279> it's

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
there wasn't much of a gap in it it's

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.129 
there wasn't much of a gap in it it's
three<00:05:37.729> minutes<00:05:37.849> thirty<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:38.629> you<00:05:38.719> can<00:05:38.990> keep

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
three minutes thirty so you can keep

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.920 
three minutes thirty so you can keep
pushing<00:05:39.620> right<00:05:39.800> through<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:40.340> end<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.930> hips
