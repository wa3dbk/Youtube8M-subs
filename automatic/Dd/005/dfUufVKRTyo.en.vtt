up that's a major engine yeah I think
that<00:04:09.830> would<00:04:09.920> be<00:04:09.980> really<00:04:10.100> cool<00:04:10.459> because<00:04:10.670> he's

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
that would be really cool because he's

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.699 
that would be really cool because he's
not<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.180> obvious<00:04:11.360> pick<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.930> be<00:04:12.050> like<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.560> one

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
not the obvious pick to be like the one

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.680 
not the obvious pick to be like the one
you<00:04:12.800> see<00:04:12.950> all<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.160> time<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.489> Ross<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:14.120> the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
you see all the time the Ross of the

that<00:04:16.850> has<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.000> slight<00:04:17.510> edge<00:04:17.540> that's<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.169> little

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
that has a slight edge that's a little

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.849 
that has a slight edge that's a little
bit<00:04:19.250> more<00:04:19.640> that<00:04:20.480> would<00:04:20.660> be<00:04:20.750> so<00:04:20.900> cool<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.320> and

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
bit more that would be so cool and and

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.460 
bit more that would be so cool and and
and<00:04:22.160> as<00:04:22.370> eek<00:04:22.640> what<00:04:23.480> might<00:04:23.750> be<00:04:23.870> perfect<00:04:24.200> because

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
and as eek what might be perfect because

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.250 
and as eek what might be perfect because
obviously<00:04:24.860> it's<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.610> geek<00:04:25.820> show<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:27.110> have

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
age of physics maybe she can use that to

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.040 
age of physics maybe she can use that to
her<00:05:43.289> advantage<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:44.129> kill<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.610> man<00:05:45.569> twice<00:05:45.840> as

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
her advantage to kill a man twice as

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.900 
her advantage to kill a man twice as
strong<00:05:46.199> but<00:05:46.319> there<00:05:46.560> was<00:05:46.680> a<00:05:46.889> severe<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.729> we

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
strong but there was a severe and we

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.850 
strong but there was a severe and we
don't<00:05:48.000> know<00:05:48.240> he's<00:05:48.479> got<00:05:48.660> any<00:05:48.840> superpowers<00:05:49.530> you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
don't know he's got any superpowers you

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.529 
don't know he's got any superpowers you
could<00:05:50.009> just<00:05:50.039> be<00:05:50.250> normal<00:05:50.430> genius<00:05:50.940> kid<00:05:51.120> it's

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
could just be normal genius kid it's

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.119 
could just be normal genius kid it's
called<00:05:51.690> hero<00:05:51.960> so<00:05:52.319> I'm<00:05:52.379> expecting<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.979> he's

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
called hero so I'm expecting that he's

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.529

going<00:05:53.280> to<00:05:53.370> be<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.460> hero<00:05:53.699> something<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:54.419> they've

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
going to be a hero something and they've

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.839 
going to be a hero something and they've
already<00:05:54.750> outlined<00:05:55.259> that<00:05:55.440> its<00:05:55.620> genetic<00:05:55.849> so

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
already outlined that its genetic so

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.790 
already outlined that its genetic so
this<00:05:57.539> could<00:05:57.629> be<00:05:57.690> like<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:57.990> edible<00:05:58.440> family

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
this could be like the edible family

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.020 
this could be like the edible family

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
ground as soon as he looked he fell okay

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.820 
ground as soon as he looked he fell okay
maybe<00:06:26.190> can<00:06:26.729> break<00:06:27.659> the<00:06:27.810> law<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:27.990> physics<00:06:28.229> maybe

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
maybe can break the law of physics maybe

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.309 
maybe can break the law of physics maybe
the<00:06:28.949> second<00:06:29.220> brother<00:06:29.340> was<00:06:29.550> still<00:06:29.610> doing<00:06:30.000> it

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 
the second brother was still doing it

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.469 
the second brother was still doing it
you<00:06:31.319> know<00:06:31.440> like<00:06:31.710> you<00:06:31.889> know<00:06:32.130> I<00:06:32.430> think<00:06:32.729> blemish

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
you know like you know I think blemish

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.540 
you know like you know I think blemish
ain't<00:06:33.719> not<00:06:33.990> only<00:06:34.440> himself<00:06:34.620> but<00:06:34.979> other<00:06:35.250> things

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
ain't not only himself but other things

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.730 
ain't not only himself but other things
keep<00:06:36.180> it<00:06:36.360> simple<00:06:36.599> I<00:06:36.900> think<00:06:37.110> they<00:06:37.229> both<00:06:37.409> why

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
keep it simple I think they both why

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.649 
keep it simple I think they both why
didn't<00:06:38.370> want<00:06:38.550> him<00:06:38.669> to<00:06:38.729> chip<00:06:38.969> it<00:06:39.090> too<00:06:39.210> and<00:06:39.419> I

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
didn't want him to chip it too and I

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.119 
didn't want him to chip it too and I
think<00:06:39.840> they're<00:06:39.930> telepathic<00:06:40.349> I<00:06:40.650> tell<00:06:40.919> Mike

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
think they're telepathic I tell Mike

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.040 
think they're telepathic I tell Mike
with<00:06:41.280> each<00:06:41.400> other<00:06:41.639> and<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.449> think<00:06:42.479> their<00:06:42.870> mom

the whole story of the dad I could see

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:51.980 
the whole story of the dad I could see
like<00:06:50.280> maybe<00:06:50.550> if<00:06:50.849> he<00:06:51.120> thought<00:06:51.449> he<00:06:51.780> had<00:06:51.930> a

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
like maybe if he thought he had a

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.339 
like maybe if he thought he had a
superpower<00:06:52.759> similar<00:06:53.759> to<00:06:54.360> flying<00:06:54.690> that<00:06:55.169> he

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349 
superpower similar to flying that he

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.260 
superpower similar to flying that he
might<00:06:55.560> ill<00:06:55.770> himself<00:06:56.159> trying<00:06:56.639> to<00:06:56.880> prove<00:06:57.120> it

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
might ill himself trying to prove it

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.140
