00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
round or certainly using circular

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.649 
round or certainly using circular
needles<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:11.659> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
needles like this one here and these so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.249 
needles like this one here and these so
basically<00:01:13.170> what<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.259> dump

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
basically what you do is you have dump

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.270 
basically what you do is you have dump
our<00:01:16.530> circular<00:01:17.310> needles<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.619> between<00:01:19.619> 16

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
our circular needles that are between 16

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.690 
our circular needles that are between 16
and<00:01:20.430> 24<00:01:21.000> inches<00:01:21.500> depending<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.189> big<00:01:23.520> your

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and 24 inches depending on how big your

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.990 
and 24 inches depending on how big your
cowl<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.710> probably<00:01:25.979> use<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> 16

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
cowl is this one I probably use a 16

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840 
cowl is this one I probably use a 16
inch<00:01:27.240> needle<00:01:27.720> long<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> bigger<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.549> I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
inch needle long but the bigger one I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.050 
inch needle long but the bigger one I
would<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.509> used<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.229> 24<00:01:32.840> inch<00:01:33.840> needle<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
would have used a 24 inch needle so you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.780 
would have used a 24 inch needle so you
cast<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.750> your<00:01:36.930> stitches<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:38.520> it's

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
cast on your stitches and then it's

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.240 
cast on your stitches and then it's
really<00:01:39.240> important<00:01:39.990> when<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> enjoying<00:01:40.770> in

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
really important when you enjoying in

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.359 
really important when you enjoying in
the<00:01:41.820> round<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.079> make<00:01:43.259> sure<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:44.189> your

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the round that you make sure that your

the round that you make sure that your
work<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:44.850> twisted<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:47.070> here

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
work is not twisted so you can see here

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.350 
work is not twisted so you can see here
that<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:48.030> work<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.450> twisting<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.500> need<00:01:49.710> to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
that my work is twisting so you need to

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.260 
that my work is twisting so you need to
string<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.600> out<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.040> stitches<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.939> going

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
string it out so the stitches are going

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.560 
string it out so the stitches are going
in<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.020> direction<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:56.000> then<00:01:57.000> holding<00:01:57.390> your

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
yarn that you're going to use and you're

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.859 
yarn that you're going to use and you're

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
right

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
right
you<00:02:03.869> simply<00:02:04.320> knit<00:02:04.680> into<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.100> first<00:02:05.549> stitch

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you simply knit into the first stitch

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.130 
you simply knit into the first stitch
and<00:02:07.069> that<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.340> how<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.610> close<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.780> cowl<00:02:10.410> up

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
on going in the same direction if

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.300 
on going in the same direction if
they're<00:02:30.510> not<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:31.140> you've<00:02:31.380> got<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> twisting

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
will have a turn in it and actually this

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.100 
will have a turn in it and actually this
is<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> good<00:02:41.430> option<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.300> choose<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.930> do

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
is a good option if you choose to do

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.610 
is a good option if you choose to do

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
this but if you want it to be just a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.940 
this but if you want it to be just a
straight<00:02:46.680> cut<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.960> then<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.170> need<00:02:49.440> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
straight cut like this then you need to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.050 
straight cut like this then you need to

make sure that is not twisting so those

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.460 
make sure that is not twisting so those
are<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> two<00:02:54.840> ways<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.470> make<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:56.750> knit<00:02:57.750> cowl

one is to knit it flat and sew it or

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.140 
one is to knit it flat and sew it or
draft<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.130> together<00:03:02.550> or<00:03:03.620> two<00:03:04.620> enjoying<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.640> in

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150

the<00:03:06.300> round<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:07.200> my<00:03:07.620> purple<00:03:08.040> one

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340
