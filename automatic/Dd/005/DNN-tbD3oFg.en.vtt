 My name is Carrie Moran, an ordinary person, and here is a "complete coverage" of PPG 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 As you know, as a world leader in automotive finishes, PPG "innovates to add value to surfaces", but it does not stop there. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.620
 It's always aiming for you to have all the latest information on new products and innovative applications, 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.760
 as well as the latest and the best tips and tricks in the field. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
 Ready to do the work? Let's start. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.880
 In the hands of a custom painter, a smooth, matte finish can turn your vehicle into a beautiful work of art. 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.220
 But it's not just about customization anymore: 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.200
 More and more manufacturers are applying matte finishes on their cars 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.960
 and this is reflected in a new trend in body repair. 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.460
 A good matte finish is smooth and not very bright, as you can see on this impressive Dodge Charger. 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 The man who painted this exquisite car, Chris Springer, 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.640
 is an application specialist responsible for the marketing of PPG refinishing products and he is here today. 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.140
 He will answer some of our questions and show us how to spray a remarkable matte finish. 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.600
 Carrie: Welcome to Full Coverage, Chris. Chris: Thank you for inviting me. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.520
 So, you painted this wonderful old Dodge Charger ... 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.800
 You have to be a painter not badly qualified to achieve a matte finish as great, is not it? 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.100
 It is true. The matte finishes are rather ruthless, 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.120
 but if a painter has been properly trained and given some application advice, his finishes can look really great and unique. 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.300
 Sounds good, but could you give us some of these tips? 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.200
 Of course. The application process is not different from that of a colorless (or varnish) high gloss. 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.820
 A sealant and a basecoat color are sprayed, 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.080
 then, instead of spraying the high gloss colorless as would normally be done, 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.460
 one of PPG's premium colorless matte color is used. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 So how do you do it? 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.940
 Once the color has been applied, a first coat of colorless, moderately wet must be sprayed. 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.520
 This layer should be allowed to dry to a uniform matte appearance before applying a second coat. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.260
 But what happens if it does not dry completely? 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.960
 Areas that are not fully matted can create shiny and irregular mottles in the final coating. 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.000
 The second layer must be a completely wet layer. 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.280
 It should be allowed to dry for 5 to 10 minutes, then apply a thin layer to help ensure a uniform finish. 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 This final layer should be allowed to dry until a uniformly matte appearance is achieved before curing by oven drying. 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 It can not really be so simple? 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.600
 It is. The process is not so different. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.860
 It can be improved a little by giving painters techniques and application tips. 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.780
 One of them, and probably the most important, is preparation and cleanliness. 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.700
 The paint booth, the car and the painter himself should be as clean as possible. 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.260
 Dust and dirt that interfere with the paint job during the spraying of the colorless can not be polished, 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.000
 because it would increase the brightness of the colorless. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Are there other techniques? 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.320
 Uniform application is essential when spraying a matte finish. 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.860
 For the first two layers, hold the gun about 6 "or 8" from the panel, 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.200
 straight at 90 Â°, and it will be ensured that the passes overlap regularly on 70 to 80%. 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.720
 For the final layer, hold the gun between 12 and 18 inches from the panel, 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.800
 while making overlapping passes of 70 to 80%. 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.380
 Now, are there any recommendations as to which gun to use? 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.840
 Good question. 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.200
 Personally, I prefer to use a VOC compliant gun with a 1.2 to 1.3 mm nozzle. 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.420
 These guns tend to spray a little more product, 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.380
 which allows the painter to move faster around the car. 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.840
 You can also use an HVLP gun. In this case, I would choose a nozzle from 1.3 to 1.4 mm. 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.580
 Thank you for being with us, Chris. 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.560
 Thank you. 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.220
