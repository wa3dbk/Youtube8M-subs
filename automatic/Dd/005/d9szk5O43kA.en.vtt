00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.220
 so dear friends, hello 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.770
 continue to test the dotska 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.300
 will we have to take part in the test today 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.890
 pace like milner 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.320
 and does it work us well and for that in general 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.730
 then he works in general you test 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.730
 first this skill 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:46.020
 flies with this as we see it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:50.700
 still flies neutrals that is all he 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.969
 rolls out of work gel 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.219
 now try posen sting now 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 we all started in general okay three things 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.960
 Enough anyway if it works though 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.659
 would have to stop with one if posen 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.979
 sting makes you work 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.430
 moller then at least one point should 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.200
 to fly but we are here home just 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.990
 the same elder sting and as we see 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.990
 it does not work so now we put a snake 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.970
 here she knows and maybe only one 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.610
 whether the unit will drink us lightning or 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.940
 still will beat the snake 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:43.869
 from beats a snake but if he hits a snake 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:46.030
 it will just bounce off but 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.360
 because it bounces that is for all 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:55.210
 that the snake is sang its immune 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.850
 can not break through the magic and thereby 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.649
 it turns out that she just beats but 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.450
 while still jumping over itself 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.690
 snake home if applied to become even 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.899
 more then we have there and should not live 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:14.290
 so here 's another thing like when i 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.570
 commented on the professional game to me 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.430
 caught one moment where i'm a little bit 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:28.330
 I was surprised and now I will explain why so 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:35.410
 then we are leaving court style 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:38.709
 and went and what we see is getting 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.840
 generally at any distance you understand 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.900
 any distance flies over the head 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.880
 it hurts so much 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.620
 very painful that is of course dependency 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.830
 on how many times they say it will not work 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.840
 but the bottom line is that this lightning works 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.049
 not only that at any distance to 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.660
 be you on base anywhere plus she 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.500
 being transferred to adjacent units 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.250
 to enemy 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.290
 and how if for example what 2 on 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.750
 loft ultanul everything there then 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.610
 left the teleport and some into these 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.299
 mine was also able to make myself gone with 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.200
 teleport 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.209
 she opponent this world hangs then let's say 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.980
 you will be struck by lightning for example 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.750
 will kill but can simply transfer to 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.780
 your teammates kill him there about 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.510
 this situation was I was perplexed 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.910
 how long the hell did this happen 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.989
 dude based on this uncle at all on 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.340
 other side of the card 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.730
 he killed him 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.379
 There are no global files and I thought 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.590
 many know about it of course 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.440
 but someone does not know about it and in general 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.110
 I think this movie is quite enough 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.440
 to cognitive but still 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.560
 some info 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.690
 you got well and as always i check 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.590
 leave comments in the comments 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.310
 your suggestions for what you can 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.959
 run that can be shown and I read 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.420
 previous comments I see that very 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.400
 many likes to similar people 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.260
 like but there are people who relate 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.810
 to these videos from the category in this video 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.120
 little information or something 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.950
 lazy no I'm lazy guys 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.600
 just comes to mind 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.400
 I want to show this to her 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.410
 share with I can not do them at all 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.560
 second these videos and therefore if suddenly 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.910
 you don't like all the videos are determined 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.590
 that is, the future of all commercials 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.750
 determined by likes and dislikes if 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.280
 you suddenly I like angry 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.139
 comments do not have to leave 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.020
 you can simply pull the dizlayk and so is this 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.460
 video will no longer appear similar video 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.380
