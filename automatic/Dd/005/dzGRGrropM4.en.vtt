factor<00:00:11.250> computers<00:00:12.920> I'd<00:00:13.920> be<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> good<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.280> to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
factor computers I'd be a good one to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.490 
factor computers I'd be a good one to
take<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> look<00:00:14.730> at<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.599> Acer<00:00:16.170> ax

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
take a look at you know it's the Acer ax

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.280 
take a look at you know it's the Acer ax
3200<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:18.000> smokin<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:18.930> machine<00:00:19.140> it's

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
3200 and it's smokin little machine it's

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
3200 and it's smokin little machine it's
got<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.590> phenom<00:00:20.009> triple<00:00:20.610> core<00:00:20.869> 8650<00:00:22.160> chip<00:00:23.160> on

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
got a phenom triple core 8650 chip on

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.460 
got a phenom triple core 8650 chip on
board<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> does<00:00:23.940> have<00:00:24.090> 4<00:00:24.390> gigs<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.810> ddr2<00:00:25.289> RAM

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
board it does have 4 gigs of ddr2 RAM

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.109 
board it does have 4 gigs of ddr2 RAM
and<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.369> does<00:00:26.520> have<00:00:26.640> Vista<00:00:26.850> Home<00:00:27.090> Premium

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and it does have Vista Home Premium

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.090 
and it does have Vista Home Premium
64-bit<00:00:27.600> so<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.680> gonna<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.859> able<00:00:28.920> take

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
64-bit so it's gonna be able take

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.590 
64-bit so it's gonna be able take
advantage<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.970> RAM<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.420> throw

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
advantage of all the RAM you can throw

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.570 
advantage of all the RAM you can throw
at<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.779> basically<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.289> has<00:00:31.439> 750<00:00:32.010> gigabyte<00:00:32.220> hard

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
at it basically it has 750 gigabyte hard

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.180 
at it basically it has 750 gigabyte hard
drive<00:00:32.699> has<00:00:33.330> a<00:00:33.480> DVD<00:00:33.750> RW<00:00:33.960> Drive<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.800> does<00:00:35.010> do

labelflash<00:00:35.580> means<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:35.970> can<00:00:36.090> flip<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.330> thing

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
labelflash means you can flip that thing

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.410 
labelflash means you can flip that thing
over<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> burn<00:00:37.500> images<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.970> labels<00:00:39.269> directly

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
over and burn images and labels directly

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.250

get on the internet wirelessly from this

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.640 
get on the internet wirelessly from this
computer<00:00:48.900> which<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.559> those

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
computer which is that one of those

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.719 
computer which is that one of those
things<00:00:49.769> that<00:00:49.799> throws<00:00:50.010> people<00:00:50.129> off<00:00:50.339> a<00:00:50.400> lot<00:00:50.610> when

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
things that throws people off a lot when

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:51.920 
things that throws people off a lot when
you<00:00:50.790> get<00:00:50.909> a<00:00:50.940> desktop<00:00:51.210> computer<00:00:51.720> you<00:00:51.750> know

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you get a desktop computer you know

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.299 
you get a desktop computer you know
because<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.769> of<00:00:52.890> assume<00:00:53.129> it's

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
because you just kind of assume it's

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.979 
because you just kind of assume it's
gonna<00:00:53.400> have<00:00:53.610> wireless<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.150> it<00:00:54.269> most<00:00:54.629> desktop

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
gonna have wireless in it most desktop

don't have Wireless built in it's kind

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.039 
don't have Wireless built in it's kind
of<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.729> funny<00:00:56.909> thing<00:00:56.970> but<00:00:57.330> they<00:00:57.449> don't<00:00:57.479> this<00:00:57.900> one

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
of a funny thing but they don't this one

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.859 
of a funny thing but they don't this one
does<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.979> does<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.369> GeForce<00:00:59.820> 8200<00:01:00.449> graphics

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
does it does have GeForce 8200 graphics

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.560 
does it does have GeForce 8200 graphics
it's<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.769> is<00:01:01.799> a<00:01:01.920> built-in<00:01:02.640> graphics<00:01:02.909> chipset

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it's a it is a built-in graphics chipset

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's a it is a built-in graphics chipset
but<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.440> hybrid<00:01:05.070> SLI<00:01:05.549> compatible<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.720> if

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but it is hybrid SLI compatible so if

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.550 
but it is hybrid SLI compatible so if
you<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.560> able<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.950> find<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.990> card<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.229> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
you are able to find a card that is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.910 
you are able to find a card that is
