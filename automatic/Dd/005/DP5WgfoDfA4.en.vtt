here guys this is the 460 round is made

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.640 
here guys this is the 460 round is made
by<00:00:11.010> Hornaday<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:12.179> their<00:00:12.389> 200<00:00:12.870> green<00:00:13.049> FTX

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
by Hornaday it's their 200 green FTX

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.070 
by Hornaday it's their 200 green FTX
bullet<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.099> has<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> polymer<00:00:14.730> insert<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
bullet it has the polymer insert the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.660 
bullet it has the polymer insert the
idea<00:00:16.379> behind<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.740> whole<00:00:16.949> projectile<00:00:17.460> that

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
idea behind this whole projectile that

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
idea behind this whole projectile that
it<00:00:17.789> hits<00:00:17.970> hard<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.449> dissipates<00:00:19.050> energy<00:00:19.199> really

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it hits hard it dissipates energy really

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.550 
it hits hard it dissipates energy really
quick<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.730> listed<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.240> 2,200<00:00:21.930> feet<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.109> second

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
quick they listed at 2,200 feet a second

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.290 
quick they listed at 2,200 feet a second
I've<00:00:22.859> got<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.220> think<00:00:23.400> it's<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> 12<00:00:23.880> inch<00:00:24.090> gun

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
I've got to think it's a 12 inch gun

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
I've got to think it's a 12 inch gun
over<00:00:24.570> there<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.050> might<00:00:25.199> even<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.590> even

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
over there so it might even be even

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.200 
over there so it might even be even
hotter<00:00:25.980> than<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> 12<00:00:26.880> inch<00:00:27.060> I've

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
hotter than that out of a 12 inch I've

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.480 
hotter than that out of a 12 inch I've
never<00:00:27.420> chronograph<00:00:27.930> tit<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.920> my<00:00:29.070> previous

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
never chronograph tit but my previous

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.859 
never chronograph tit but my previous
experience<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.810> pretty

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
experience with this is it's pretty

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.380 
experience with this is it's pretty
wicked<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.949> stays<00:00:32.279> within<00:00:32.489> 10<00:00:32.880> inches<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
wicked it stays within 10 inches of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
wicked it stays within 10 inches of
point<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.989> aim<00:00:34.140> point<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.590> impact<00:00:34.860> out<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> 250

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
point of aim point of impact out to 250

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
point of aim point of impact out to 250
yards<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.110> revolver<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.860> shoots

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
yards out of that revolver so it shoots

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.580 
yards out of that revolver so it shoots
extremely<00:00:38.579> flat<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.420> extremely<00:00:40.050> hard<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
extremely flat it's extremely hard for a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
extremely flat it's extremely hard for a
handgun<00:00:41.000> I'm<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.149> mistaken<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.809> about

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
handgun I'm not mistaken it's about

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
handgun I'm not mistaken it's about
three<00:00:43.260> times<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> energy<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> 44<00:00:44.579> Magnum<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149

usual<00:02:33.290> we<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.650> our<00:02:33.829> dispersion<00:02:34.250> radii<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
usual we have our dispersion radii and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.630 
usual we have our dispersion radii and
I'm<00:02:35.780> looking<00:02:36.049> right<00:02:36.200> here<00:02:36.470> guys<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.489> we're

going to walk it off we at least 25
yards<00:02:39.709> from<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.040> point<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.400> point<00:02:40.819> of<00:02:40.879> point

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
yards from that point of point of point

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.440 
yards from that point of point of point
of<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.840> target<00:02:42.829> so<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.610> one<00:02:43.849> piece<00:02:44.060> here

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
of the target so that's one piece here

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.390 
of the target so that's one piece here
pretty<00:02:45.349> good<00:02:45.560> size<00:02:45.769> let's<00:02:45.950> go<00:02:46.040> ahead<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.280> walk

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
pretty good size let's go ahead and walk

stories<00:03:01.069> 25<00:03:01.549> yards<00:03:01.970> turned<00:03:02.209> into<00:03:02.329> 18<00:03:02.750> but

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
stories 25 yards turned into 18 but

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.619 
stories 25 yards turned into 18 but
anyway<00:03:03.739> we're<00:03:04.280> good<00:03:04.459> 18<00:03:04.909> yards<00:03:05.299> from<00:03:05.480> the

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
anyway we're good 18 yards from the

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.690 
anyway we're good 18 yards from the
front<00:03:05.989> from<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.379> point<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.799> shot<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.579> you

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
front from the point of the shot and you

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.979 
front from the point of the shot and you
can<00:03:07.849> see<00:03:08.000> from<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.299> liquid<00:03:08.629> here<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:08.900> the

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
can see from the liquid here on the

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.039 
can see from the liquid here on the
steel<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:10.159> hitted<00:03:10.909> almost<00:03:11.150> exactly<00:03:11.629> Center

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
steel that hitted almost exactly Center

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.020 
steel that hitted almost exactly Center
guys<00:03:12.230> perfect<00:03:12.650> shot<00:03:13.010> had<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> good<00:03:13.519> expansion

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
guys perfect shot had a good expansion

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.509 
guys perfect shot had a good expansion
coming<00:03:14.299> out<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.739> out<00:03:15.739> of<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:15.920> cabbage<00:03:16.310> and

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
coming out of the out of the cabbage and

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.610 
coming out of the out of the cabbage and
you<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:16.909> see<00:03:17.060> there's<00:03:17.269> this<00:03:17.450> dispersion<00:03:17.870> on

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
you can see there's this dispersion on

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.890 
you can see there's this dispersion on
either<00:03:19.010> side<00:03:19.340> about<00:03:19.609> 18<00:03:20.000> yards<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.540> one<00:03:20.750> head

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
either side about 18 yards so one head

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.750 
either side about 18 yards so one head
of<00:03:21.019> cabbage<00:03:21.349> covers<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> lot<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:21.950> territory<00:03:22.069> if

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
of cabbage covers a lot of territory if

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.070 
of cabbage covers a lot of territory if
you<00:03:23.090> slice<00:03:23.359> it<00:03:23.569> right

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.500 

so<00:03:28.010> when<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.460> up<00:03:28.580> on<00:03:28.730> target<00:03:29.150> alright<00:03:29.360> let's

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
so when you up on target alright let's
