00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
is exactly like the original great lash

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.619 
is exactly like the original great lash
and<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.460> start<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.850> by<00:00:44.969> saying<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and I will also start out by saying that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.410 
and I will also start out by saying that
I<00:00:45.840> tried<00:00:46.410> original<00:00:47.039> great<00:00:47.219> lash<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.910> couple

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I tried original great lash a couple

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
I tried original great lash a couple
times<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.680> don't<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.250> why<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> tried<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
times and I don't know why I tried it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.340 
times and I don't know why I tried it
twice<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.510> knew<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> didn't<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
twice because I knew I didn't like the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.020 
twice because I knew I didn't like the
first<00:00:52.590> time<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.129> guess<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> second

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
first time and guess what the second

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
first time and guess what the second
time<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> still<00:00:54.719> didn't<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
time I still didn't like it it has a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.540 
time I still didn't like it it has a
much<00:00:56.550> smaller<00:00:56.789> brush<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.340> didn't

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
much smaller brush and it I just didn't

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
much smaller brush and it I just didn't
think<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> was<00:00:59.940> buildable<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.079> thought

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
think it was buildable at all I thought

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.310 
think it was buildable at all I thought
the<00:01:01.469> formula<00:01:01.890> was<00:01:02.070> too<00:01:02.309> wet<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.320> just

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the formula was too wet and just

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
the formula was too wet and just
couldn't<00:01:04.920> give<00:01:05.010> me<00:01:05.129> volume<00:01:05.400> made<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:06.030> look

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
couldn't give me volume made me look

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.810 
couldn't give me volume made me look
like<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.330> had<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.689> five<00:01:07.020> eyelashes<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
like I had like five eyelashes and so

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.210 
like I had like five eyelashes and so
now<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.330> saw<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.350> was<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> bigger<00:01:10.890> brush

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
now I saw that this was a bigger brush

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.039 
now I saw that this was a bigger brush
and<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.610> thought<00:01:11.760> maybe<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.360> brush<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and I thought maybe the brush was the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.149 
and I thought maybe the brush was the
problem<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> got<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.479> big

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
problem so I got this and look how big

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
problem so I got this and look how big
look<00:01:17.159> how<00:01:17.310> big<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> brush<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
look how big that brush is there you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.760 
look how big that brush is there you
know<00:01:19.409> that's<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.950> rivaling<00:01:21.020> Diorshow<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
know that's like rivaling Diorshow you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.710 
know that's like rivaling Diorshow you
know<00:01:22.920> that's<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.369> pretty<00:01:23.700> pretty<00:01:24.180> big<00:01:24.390> brush

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
know that's a pretty pretty big brush

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
know that's a pretty pretty big brush
and<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> kind<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.220> really

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
and it's not the kind that really

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.819 
and it's not the kind that really
spirals<00:01:27.150> around<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.780> although<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.350> does<00:01:28.530> maybe

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
spirals around it although it does maybe

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.410 
spirals around it although it does maybe
look<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.700> hold<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.270> but

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
look like that as I hold it there but

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.149 
look like that as I hold it there but
it's<00:01:30.540> more<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.380> bristles<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.040> are

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it's more like the bristles kind of are

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.969 
it's more like the bristles kind of are
just<00:01:32.630> spiking<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.380> might<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
just spiking well it might be kind of a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
just spiking well it might be kind of a
tight<00:01:35.189> spiral<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.000> they're<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:36.390> of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
tight spiral but they're just kind of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
tight spiral but they're just kind of
spiking<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.079> from<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> brush<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.920> not

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
spiking out from the brush you know not

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.950 
spiking out from the brush you know not
a<00:01:38.159> rubber<00:01:38.430> brush<00:01:38.729> mascara<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.479> anything<00:01:39.689> like

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
a rubber brush mascara or anything like

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.620 
a rubber brush mascara or anything like
that<00:01:40.020> meant<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> build<00:01:41.220> volume<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.479> how

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that meant to build volume I do like how

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840 
that meant to build volume I do like how
its<00:01:42.810> tapered<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> tip<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.399> always<00:01:44.640> makes

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
its tapered at the tip that always makes

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.460 
its tapered at the tip that always makes
it<00:01:44.939> easier<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.750> towards<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> smaller

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it easier to get in towards the smaller

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.789 
it easier to get in towards the smaller
lashes<00:01:47.009> but<00:01:47.130> overall<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.909> look<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.799> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
lashes but overall you look at this this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.370 
lashes but overall you look at this this
isn't<00:01:50.130> very<00:01:50.250> long<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
isn't very long from here to here and so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.230 
isn't very long from here to here and so
that<00:01:52.590> does<00:01:52.829> make<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.220> harder<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.790> some<00:01:53.970> people

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that does make it harder for some people

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
that does make it harder for some people
you<00:01:54.420> know<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> little

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you know like I like to have a little

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.700 
you know like I like to have a little
longer<00:01:56.219> wand<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.240> way<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.750> don't<00:01:58.500> know<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
longer wand that way I don't know I just

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
longer wand that way I don't know I just
feel<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.670> less<00:01:59.909> likely<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.299> bump<00:02:00.630> into

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
feel like I'm less likely to bump into

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.450 
feel like I'm less likely to bump into
something<00:02:01.290> especially<00:02:01.860> when<00:02:01.950> I'm<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.280> for

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
something especially when I'm going for

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.310 
something especially when I'm going for
this<00:02:02.549> eye<00:02:02.820> over<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:05.149> yeah<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> used<00:02:07.110> this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
this eye over here but yeah I used this

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.960 
this eye over here but yeah I used this
and<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.619> think<00:02:07.680> okay<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.459> gonna<00:02:08.580> really

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and I think okay this is gonna really

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.139 
and I think okay this is gonna really
you<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.450> give<00:02:09.629> me<00:02:09.660> some

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
you know give me some

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.199 
you know give me some
volume<00:02:10.739> honestly<00:02:11.739> it's<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.159> formula<00:02:12.879> that's

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
volume honestly it's the formula that's

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.940 
volume honestly it's the formula that's
a<00:02:13.299> problem<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:13.989> mascara<00:02:14.500> as<00:02:14.739> well

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
a problem with this mascara as well

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.000 
a problem with this mascara as well
because<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.519> brush<00:02:15.879> did<00:02:16.480> not<00:02:16.829> affect<00:02:17.829> things

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
because this brush did not affect things

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.490 
because this brush did not affect things
for<00:02:18.400> me<00:02:18.519> I<00:02:18.700> am<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.450> interested<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.319> hear<00:02:20.439> what

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.080 
for me I am so interested to hear what
you<00:02:20.590> guys<00:02:20.769> have<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.099> say<00:02:21.250> if<00:02:21.370> you've<00:02:21.519> tried<00:02:21.849> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you guys have to say if you've tried the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.839 
you guys have to say if you've tried the
original<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.620> let<00:02:24.519> me<00:02:24.549> know<00:02:24.730> if

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849

this worked better for you because it

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.920

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
did not hardly do anything more for me

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.410 
did not hardly do anything more for me
at<00:02:29.019> all<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.920> put<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.310> very<00:02:30.640> carefully<00:02:31.209> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
at all if I put it on very carefully and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.099 
at all if I put it on very carefully and
very<00:02:31.900> very<00:02:32.260> slowly<00:02:32.859> one<00:02:33.760> coat<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.480> would<00:02:34.930> get

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
very very slowly one coat I would get

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.759 
very very slowly one coat I would get
nice<00:02:35.349> separation<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:36.670> decent<00:02:37.049> amount<00:02:38.049> of

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
nice separation and a decent amount of

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.380 
nice separation and a decent amount of
volume<00:02:39.159> in<00:02:39.310> terms<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.670> looking<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.150> had

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
volume in terms of looking like I had

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.059 
volume in terms of looking like I had
more<00:02:40.569> lashes<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.290> they<00:02:41.439> did<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.709> seem

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
more lashes but they did not seem

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.330 
more lashes but they did not seem
thicker<00:02:42.370> at<00:02:42.609> all<00:02:42.900> they<00:02:43.900> did<00:02:44.079> not<00:02:44.170> seem<00:02:44.560> much

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
thicker at all they did not seem much

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.849 
thicker at all they did not seem much
longer<00:02:46.000> when<00:02:46.659> you<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.049> for<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.260> next<00:02:47.530> coat

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
longer when you go in for that next coat

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.379 
longer when you go in for that next coat
and<00:02:48.040> they<00:02:48.129> say<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.459> is<00:02:48.609> buildable<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.329> I

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
and they say this is buildable and I

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:56.009 
and they say this is buildable and I
believe<00:02:49.690> they<00:02:49.870> say<00:02:53.700> continue<00:02:54.700> building<00:02:55.180> to

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
believe they say continue building to

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.660 
believe they say continue building to
rebuilding<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:56.769> coats<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.220> reach<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.579> your

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
rebuilding with coats to reach to your

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.399 
rebuilding with coats to reach to your
desired<00:02:58.030> look<00:02:58.239> do<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.689> let<00:02:58.989> dry<00:02:59.230> between

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
desired look do not let dry between

really disappointing her on that because

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.849 
really disappointing her on that because
you<00:03:18.519> know<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.419> think<00:03:19.780> like<00:03:20.049> okay<00:03:20.349> here's<00:03:20.680> one

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
you know you think like okay here's one

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.430 
you know you think like okay here's one
coat<00:03:21.129> two<00:03:21.370> coats<00:03:21.609> it's<00:03:21.730> gonna<00:03:21.819> make<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.090> better

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
coat two coats it's gonna make it better

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.869 
coat two coats it's gonna make it better
and<00:03:23.440> then<00:03:23.650> if<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.949> I<00:03:24.250> thought<00:03:24.579> well<00:03:24.730> maybe

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
and then if you I thought well maybe

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.909 
and then if you I thought well maybe
I'll<00:03:25.030> let<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.180> dry<00:03:25.510> then<00:03:25.930> between<00:03:26.319> coats<00:03:26.590> and

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
I'll let it dry then between coats and

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.710 
I'll let it dry then between coats and
then<00:03:27.190> you're<00:03:27.790> really<00:03:28.120> not<00:03:28.239> making<00:03:28.419> any

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
then you're really not making any

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.409 
then you're really not making any
difference<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.430> I'm<00:03:30.430> running<00:03:30.730> into<00:03:30.879> basically

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
difference so I'm running into basically

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.390 
difference so I'm running into basically
the<00:03:31.540> same<00:03:31.750> issues<00:03:32.109> I<00:03:32.260> had<00:03:32.470> with<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.919> original

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
the same issues I had with the original

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.879 
the same issues I had with the original
I<00:03:33.489> feel<00:03:33.669> like<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.879> formula<00:03:34.329> is<00:03:34.419> very<00:03:34.480> wet<00:03:35.139> with

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
I feel like the formula is very wet with

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.069 
I feel like the formula is very wet with
this<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:36.819> feel<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.299> that's<00:03:37.480> what<00:03:37.810> makes

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
this and I feel like that's what makes

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.020 
this and I feel like that's what makes
you<00:03:38.290> know<00:03:38.409> one<00:03:38.650> coat<00:03:38.889> maybe<00:03:39.069> look<00:03:39.370> okay<00:03:39.790> and

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you know one coat maybe look okay and

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.819 
you know one coat maybe look okay and
then<00:03:40.449> they<00:03:40.569> claim<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:40.959> available<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.620> put

then they claim it's available you put
your<00:03:41.949> second<00:03:42.310> coat<00:03:42.459> on<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.849> they<00:03:42.940> all<00:03:43.090> kind<00:03:43.479> of

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
your second coat on and they all kind of

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.979 
your second coat on and they all kind of
you<00:03:43.870> know<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:45.099> not<00:03:45.310> good<00:03:45.579> so<00:03:45.819> what<00:03:46.629> I've<00:03:46.750> done

this and you actually thought it was

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.560 
this and you actually thought it was
better<00:05:00.040> than<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.250> original<00:05:00.400> or<00:05:01.120> maybe<00:05:01.419> you

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
better than the original or maybe you

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.050 
better than the original or maybe you
like<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.900> original<00:05:02.380> better<00:05:03.160> than<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.700> I

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
like the original better than this I

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.719 
like the original better than this I
don't<00:05:04.840> know<00:05:05.020> maybe<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.410> mean<00:05:05.830> maybe<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.490> would

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
don't know maybe I mean maybe you would

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.370 
don't know maybe I mean maybe you would
it<00:05:06.970> because<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:07.389> little<00:05:07.540> brush<00:05:07.900> gives<00:05:08.260> you<00:05:08.350> a

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
it because that little brush gives you a

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.020 
it because that little brush gives you a
little<00:05:08.590> more<00:05:08.710> control<00:05:09.250> maybe<00:05:09.669> people<00:05:09.910> like

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
little more control maybe people like

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.840 
little more control maybe people like
that<00:05:10.450> but<00:05:10.810> anyway<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:11.979> just<00:05:12.190> my<00:05:12.340> opinion
