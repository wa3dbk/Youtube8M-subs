00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello everyone and welcome to loeb a 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.130
 steevy spades me it's vladimir and I 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.389
 will introduce you to love in class for 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.389
 have pictures that have too much class 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.330
 today we will see how 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 switch from automatic mode to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:33.930
 opening up there now when we 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 talk about openness have referred to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 the size of the lens diaphragm or 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.559
 holds the most stylish the diaphragm and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 a mechanical device inside 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.190
 of the goal that he lets pass more 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.989
 or less light by modulating the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 diameter of a trunk now as well 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.350
 plus the diaphragm and open 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 the light signal that goes into 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.489
 the goal and conversely plus it allows 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.489
 - subsidiary light 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.180
 to quantify the opening game will speak 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.760
 of this top to describe loose eps 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 numbers the more the number is small and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.690
 the bigger the opening is the bigger the name 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.690
 is big plus the opening is small 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 so an opening of f18 corresponds to 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 a large diaphragm aperture and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
 for a small opening 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 we can adjust his camera on a 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 opening of f 22a and big but 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.479
 concretely what is the word for? 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 opening the opening of the diaphragm 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.930
 influences the depth of field while 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.340
 simply depth of the short the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.440
 depth of field corresponds to the area 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.640
 which will be sharp on your posts there 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:49.679
 I'm going to take a picture with a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.060
 shallow depth of field and there I go 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:59.600
 to take another one with a big 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.600
 depth of field not 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.490
 so if you want to have a back 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.680
 plan blur it will adjust your 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.080
 device on a large opening 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.240
 this will highlight your 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.510
 subject by isolating it from the rest of his 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.510
 environment 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.490
 and if instead you want to have the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.140
 maximum of things net 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:32.300
 you will have to set the opening on a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.500
 high number like f-16 like that could 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.470
 take pictures of group and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.550
 attention landscapes in situation of 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.320
 low light 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.370
 if you close the aperture too you 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.230
 may not have enough light 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.880
 to have a sharp picture this is due to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.500
 the shutter speed of the camera 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.100
 but we 'll see that in a next 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.630
 episode 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.370
 in the meantime you can train 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.200
 with chisel aperture priority mode 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.240
 depending on the subject you want 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.920
 photograph try for example from 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.960
 to make a portrait with a larger 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.330
 possible opening and a landscape with 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.130
 a small opening 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.280
 do not forget the photo it's not for 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.280
 him 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.420
 as I'm planted on tech so before 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 the end of the text 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:25.600
 who knows each other and do not forget the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.700
 fault on the 16th I still have no one slaughtered 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.570
 by amso clips is rich it's up to 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.350
 to say that's the goal 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.430
 mayaki fric you will need to adjust your 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.150
 second shutter speed device 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.150
 high
