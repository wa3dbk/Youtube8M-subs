00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.710 

or<00:01:33.260> you<00:01:34.260> can<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.620> do<00:01:34.830> this<00:01:36.650> as<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.480> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
or you can just do this as you can see a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.320 
or you can just do this as you can see a
bright<00:01:40.020> light<00:01:40.080> is<00:01:40.440> produced<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.730> might<00:01:41.940> think

bright light is produced you might think

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.240 
bright light is produced you might think
that<00:01:42.570> when<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.170> crack<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.410> glow<00:01:43.680> stick<00:01:43.710> you're

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that when you crack a glow stick you're

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.460 
that when you crack a glow stick you're
turning<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.760> switch<00:01:44.850> inside<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.660> that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
turning on a switch inside or that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.040 
turning on a switch inside or that
there's<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.950> battery<00:01:47.160> inside<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.780> glow

glow stick will stop glowing this is why

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.370 
glow stick will stop glowing this is why
when<00:02:47.820> glow<00:02:47.970> sticks<00:02:48.239> are<00:02:48.390> made<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.050> different

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
when glow sticks are made the different

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.460 
when glow sticks are made the different
chemicals<00:02:49.860> are<00:02:50.130> kept<00:02:50.400> separate<00:02:51.470> because

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
chemicals are kept separate because

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.280 
chemicals are kept separate because
they're<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.920> lightweight<00:02:53.459> inexpensive

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
they're so lightweight inexpensive

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
they're so lightweight inexpensive
waterproof<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.530> produce<00:02:55.980> little<00:02:56.340> heat<00:02:56.550> glow

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120

right I was really cool oh I mix it back
in<00:03:52.920> mixed<00:03:53.790> around<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.090> little<00:03:54.180> bit<00:03:54.590> that's<00:03:55.590> like

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
in mixed around a little bit that's like

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.250 
in mixed around a little bit that's like
a<00:03:55.829> nice<00:03:56.010> orange<00:03:56.310> color<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:56.909> this<00:03:57.629> is<00:03:57.780> exactly

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
a nice orange color so this is exactly

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.050 
a nice orange color so this is exactly
what<00:03:58.440> happens<00:03:58.769> inside<00:03:59.040> your<00:03:59.220> glow<00:03:59.340> stick<00:03:59.640> know

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
what happens inside your glow stick know

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.399 
what happens inside your glow stick know
when<00:04:00.360> you're<00:04:00.450> cracking<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.780> glow<00:04:00.959> stick

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
when you're cracking a glow stick

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.050 
when you're cracking a glow stick
you're<00:04:01.560> basically<00:04:02.430> mixing<00:04:02.760> these<00:04:02.940> two

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
you're basically mixing these two

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.110 
you're basically mixing these two
chemicals<00:04:03.239> together<00:04:04.400> okay<00:04:05.400> one<00:04:05.730> more<00:04:05.909> fun

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
chemicals together okay one more fun

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.940 
chemicals together okay one more fun
fact<00:04:06.150> did<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.079> know<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.349> can<00:04:07.500> make<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> glow

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
fact did you know you can make a glow

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.550 
fact did you know you can make a glow
stick<00:04:07.980> glow<00:04:08.579> brighter<00:04:08.879> or<00:04:09.150> dimmer<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:10.230> can<00:04:10.410> do

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
stick glow brighter or dimmer you can do

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.559 
stick glow brighter or dimmer you can do
this<00:04:10.739> by<00:04:10.890> changing<00:04:11.310> its<00:04:11.430> temperature<00:04:11.790> which

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
this by changing its temperature which

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.270 
this by changing its temperature which
will<00:04:12.780> speed<00:04:13.019> up<00:04:13.200> or<00:04:13.349> slow<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.769> reaction

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
will speed up or slow the reaction

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.629 
will speed up or slow the reaction
inside<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.879> glow<00:04:15.060> stick<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.680> if<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.430> put<00:04:17.609> a

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
inside of the glow stick so if you put a

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.759 
inside of the glow stick so if you put a
glow<00:04:17.880> stick<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:18.239> hot<00:04:18.449> water<00:04:18.630> it'll<00:04:19.350> get<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> lot

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
glow stick in hot water it'll get a lot

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.680 
glow stick in hot water it'll get a lot
brighter<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.549> lasts<00:04:20.789> for<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> shorter<00:04:21.449> amount

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
brighter but lasts for a shorter amount

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.409 
brighter but lasts for a shorter amount
of<00:04:21.750> time<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.949> the<00:04:23.070> cold<00:04:23.310> water<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:24.060> will<00:04:24.300> be

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
of time and in the cold water it will be

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.110 
of time and in the cold water it will be
dimmer<00:04:24.660> but<00:04:25.110> lasts<00:04:25.320> longer<00:04:25.740> here<00:04:26.520> I'll<00:04:26.760> show

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
dimmer but lasts longer here I'll show

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.909 
dimmer but lasts longer here I'll show
you<00:04:27.150> what<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.389> mean<00:04:27.630> let's<00:04:27.900> put<00:04:28.560> some<00:04:28.740> glow

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
you what I mean let's put some glow

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.860 
you what I mean let's put some glow
sticks<00:04:29.160> in<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.550> see<00:04:29.970> how<00:04:30.120> they<00:04:30.270> look<00:04:30.449> after<00:04:30.630> a

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
sticks in and see how they look after a

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.660 
sticks in and see how they look after a
few<00:04:31.139> minutes

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.920 

let<00:04:36.670> me<00:04:36.760> dim<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.030> lights<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.510> can<00:04:37.660> see<00:04:37.840> it

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
let me dim the lights you can see it

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.770 
let me dim the lights you can see it
better<00:04:38.280> as<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.640> see<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.270> one<00:04:40.420> in<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.600> hot

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
better as you can see the one in the hot

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.690 
better as you can see the one in the hot
water<00:04:40.990> gets<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.680> lot<00:04:41.830> brighter<00:04:42.100> than<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.520> one

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
water gets a lot brighter than the one

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.630 
water gets a lot brighter than the one
in<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:42.880> cold<00:04:43.120> water<00:04:43.830> today<00:04:44.830> we<00:04:45.070> learn<00:04:45.250> that

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
in the cold water today we learn that

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.460 
in the cold water today we learn that
when<00:04:45.820> we<00:04:45.910> combine<00:04:46.210> two<00:04:46.450> chemicals<00:04:47.020> they<00:04:47.350> can

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
when we combine two chemicals they can

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.170 
when we combine two chemicals they can
produce<00:04:47.650> light<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.910> called

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
produce light this is called

00:04:49.180 --> 00:05:04.930 
produce light this is called
chemiluminescence

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.970 

Oh
