00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that it is because the float on the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.440 
that it is because the float on the
magnet<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> float<00:00:47.309> inside<00:00:48.149> this

magnet that's on the float inside this

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.760 
magnet that's on the float inside this
tank<00:00:48.809> has<00:00:49.739> come<00:00:50.070> loose<00:00:50.309> now<00:00:51.440> I've<00:00:52.440> already

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
tank has come loose now I've already

taken this tank off and I've already
taken<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> parts<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.489> you'll<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
taken the parts out and you'll see in

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.500 
taken the parts out and you'll see in
there<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.379> shaft<00:00:59.340> sticking<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.000> well<00:01:00.239> on

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
there see that shaft sticking up well on

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.939 
there see that shaft sticking up well on
that<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:02.090> float<00:01:03.199> with<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> magnet<00:01:04.680> attached

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that is a float with a magnet attached

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.070 
that is a float with a magnet attached
to<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> retainer<00:01:06.210> clip<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to it and then a retainer clip at the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
to it and then a retainer clip at the
top<00:01:07.260> now<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.280> read<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> internet<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
top now you read on the internet and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.600 
top now you read on the internet and
probably<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.020> already<00:01:10.170> read<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.830> you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
probably have already read that you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.690 
probably have already read that you
cannot<00:01:12.000> repair<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.130> fact<00:01:14.490> there's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
cannot repair this that in fact there's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.359 
cannot repair this that in fact there's
a<00:01:14.760> video<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> guy<00:01:16.950> cut<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
a video on there that where a guy cut it

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
a video on there that where a guy cut it
open<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.330> gives<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.229> look

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
open and it gives you a very good look

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
open and it gives you a very good look
that's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.799> good<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.790> exactly

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that's a good video so you can exactly

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's a good video so you can exactly
see<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> inside<00:01:22.560> but

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
see what it's like on the inside but

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160 
see what it's like on the inside but
anyway<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> consensus<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> Internet<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
anyway the consensus on the Internet is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.219 
anyway the consensus on the Internet is
you<00:01:25.740> can't<00:01:26.040> repair<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.700> yourself<00:01:27.180> well<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you can't repair this yourself well I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.490 
you can't repair this yourself well I
don't<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:29.729> true<00:01:29.880> or<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.500> because

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
don't know if that's true or not because

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.210 
don't know if that's true or not because
what<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> did<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.900> see<00:01:33.900> I've<00:01:34.170> removed<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
what I did was I see I've removed the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.359 
what I did was I see I've removed the
parts<00:01:35.549> from<00:01:36.180> inside<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.189> here's<00:01:38.189> what

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
parts from inside there and here's what

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.039 
parts from inside there and here's what
we've<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:39.079> we've<00:01:40.079> got<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.869> see

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.420 
we've got we've got this as you can see
the<00:01:43.229> magnet<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.210> float<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:47.070> little

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the magnet this is the float this little

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
the magnet this is the float this little
magnetic<00:01:47.880> ring<00:01:49.579> here<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:53.310> goes<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:55.939> is<00:01:57.469> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
magnetic ring here that goes on is it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.100 
magnetic ring here that goes on is it
here<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> bottom<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.750> goes

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
here to the bottom of that this goes

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.609 
here to the bottom of that this goes
down<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.700> over<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> shaft<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.930> then

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
down like that over the shaft and then

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.130 
down like that over the shaft and then
it's<00:02:05.159> retained<00:02:05.700> kept<00:02:06.360> from<00:02:06.509> coming<00:02:06.810> off<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
it's retained kept from coming off the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.490 
it's retained kept from coming off the
shaft<00:02:07.409> by<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.429> clip<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:09.259> now<00:02:10.259> what

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
shaft by this little clip here now what

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
shaft by this little clip here now what
I<00:02:10.530> did<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:12.020> went<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.110> there<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.440> reached

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I did was I went in there and I reached

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920 
I did was I went in there and I reached
there<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> small<00:02:14.790> screwdriver<00:02:15.270> like<00:02:15.690> this

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
there with a small screwdriver like this

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.839 
there with a small screwdriver like this
fairly<00:02:16.260> long<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> six-inch<00:02:17.370> screwdriver

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
fairly long when a six-inch screwdriver

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.600 
fairly long when a six-inch screwdriver
but<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.450> small<00:02:18.810> tip<00:02:19.200> flat<00:02:19.920> tip<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.400> there

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
but it's a small tip flat tip on there

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.690 
but it's a small tip flat tip on there
and<00:02:20.819> if<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.450> get<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.989> there<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:23.459> can

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and if you get it in there and you can

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.610 
and if you get it in there and you can
just<00:02:23.940> catch<00:02:24.569> one<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.870> those<00:02:24.989> things<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.500> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
just catch one of those things and you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.309 
just catch one of those things and you
twist<00:02:26.010> your<00:02:26.190> screwdriver<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.630> flip<00:02:28.110> that

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
twist your screwdriver you can flip that

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.000 
twist your screwdriver you can flip that
little<00:02:28.709> retainer<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.230> come<00:02:31.470> over<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.860> this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
little retainer up and come over on this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.199 
little retainer up and come over on this
side<00:02:32.069> catch<00:02:32.850> another<00:02:33.180> one<00:02:33.770> flip<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.209> you

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
side catch another one flip it up you

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.240 
side catch another one flip it up you
can<00:02:36.420> move<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> around<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:38.010> at<00:02:38.220> it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
can move it around so you can get at it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.610 
can move it around so you can get at it
get<00:02:38.760> another<00:02:39.060> one<00:02:39.480> or<00:02:39.510> two<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.110> those<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.470> there

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
get another one or two of those up there

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.320 
get another one or two of those up there
eventually<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.340> flip<00:02:41.760> those<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
eventually you just flip those up a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.570 
eventually you just flip those up a
little<00:02:42.360> bit<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.680> will<00:02:44.220> release<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
little bit and that will release the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.490 
little bit and that will release the
thing<00:02:44.940> then<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.780> take<00:02:45.959> your<00:02:47.840> thing<00:02:48.840> turn<00:02:49.410> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
thing then just take your thing turn it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.360 
thing then just take your thing turn it
upside<00:02:49.800> down<00:02:49.830> everything<00:02:50.760> will<00:02:50.910> fall<00:02:51.120> out<00:02:51.150> so

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
upside down everything will fall out so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.830 
upside down everything will fall out so
what<00:02:53.370> what<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.090> do<00:02:54.239> next

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
what what to do next

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.259 
what what to do next
let's<00:02:55.470> say<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.610> what<00:02:56.790> we<00:02:56.940> need<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
let's say that we can so what we need to

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.820 
let's say that we can so what we need to
do<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.870> need<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.110> get<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.130> back<00:02:59.790> on<00:02:59.850> here

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
do is we need to get this back on here

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.470 
do is we need to get this back on here
these<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:02.040> both<00:03:02.190> smooth<00:03:02.519> services<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.330> is

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
these are both smooth services this is

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.340 
these are both smooth services this is
just<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.780> little<00:03:03.930> stamped<00:03:04.680> magnetic<00:03:05.370> ring<00:03:06.350> that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
just a little stamped magnetic ring that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.590 
just a little stamped magnetic ring that
goes<00:03:07.590> on<00:03:07.890> here<00:03:08.750> now<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:10.019> I'm<00:03:10.200> going<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.440> try

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
goes on here now what I'm going to try

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.870 
goes on here now what I'm going to try
and<00:03:13.190> as<00:03:14.190> I'm<00:03:14.430> going<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:15.080> use<00:03:16.080> some<00:03:16.519> RTV<00:03:17.519> red

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
and as I'm going to use some RTV red

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.470 
and as I'm going to use some RTV red
high<00:03:18.150> temp<00:03:18.480> RTV<00:03:19.019> silicone<00:03:19.910> instant<00:03:20.910> gasket

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
high temp RTV silicone instant gasket

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.990 
high temp RTV silicone instant gasket
sealer<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.920> pretty<00:03:23.190> tough<00:03:23.430> stuff<00:03:23.730> but

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
sealer this is pretty tough stuff but

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.630 
sealer this is pretty tough stuff but
most<00:03:24.209> importantly<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.109> back<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:26.070> says

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
most importantly on the back it says

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.960 
most importantly on the back it says
it's<00:03:27.180> resistant<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.959> oil<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.680> gas<00:03:29.010> which<00:03:29.790> is

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
it's resistant to oil and gas which is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.310 
it's resistant to oil and gas which is
what<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.269> want<00:03:30.450> because<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.959> thing<00:03:31.140> is<00:03:31.200> going

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
what we want because this thing is going

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.390 
what we want because this thing is going
to<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.500> floating<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.160> your<00:03:32.310> outboard<00:03:32.670> oil<00:03:33.090> so

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
to be floating in your outboard oil so

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.920 
to be floating in your outboard oil so
this<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:35.670> story<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.150> I'm<00:03:36.239> sticking<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.750> it

going to put this on there I'm going to
let<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.079> set<00:03:46.350> up<00:03:46.500> real<00:03:46.739> good<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.100> then<00:03:47.690> when<00:03:48.690> I

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
let it set up real good and then when I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.560 
let it set up real good and then when I
come<00:03:48.959> back<00:03:49.140> we'll<00:03:50.150> put<00:03:51.150> her<00:03:51.239> back<00:03:51.390> together

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
come back we'll put her back together

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
okay so this is after I've put a thin

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.809 
okay so this is after I've put a thin
layer<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.420> RTV<00:03:58.260> red<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.430> there<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.290> press<00:04:01.290> the

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
layer of RTV red on there and press the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.949 
layer of RTV red on there and press the
magnet<00:04:02.819> back<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.299> there<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.569> we're<00:04:03.720> going<00:04:03.900> to

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
magnet back in there and we're going to

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.650 
magnet back in there and we're going to
let<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.109> set<00:04:04.530> up<00:04:04.590> real<00:04:05.010> good<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.730> notice

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
let that set up real good and notice

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.470 
let that set up real good and notice
it's<00:04:06.870> cleaned<00:04:07.410> up<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.890> inside<00:04:08.280> there<00:04:08.670> well

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it's cleaned up on the inside there well

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.870 
it's cleaned up on the inside there well
enough<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.319> that<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.709> RTV<00:04:11.340> silicone

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
enough so on that the RTV silicone

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.770 
enough so on that the RTV silicone
doesn't<00:04:12.420> want<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.840> stick<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.290> shaft<00:04:13.680> and

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
doesn't want to stick to the shaft and

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.479 
doesn't want to stick to the shaft and
we'll<00:04:15.780> see<00:04:15.959> if<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.139> works<00:04:16.320> okay<00:04:16.560> well<00:04:17.220> actually

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
we'll see if it works okay well actually

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.330 
we'll see if it works okay well actually
I've<00:04:17.910> got<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.510> back<00:04:18.690> together<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.440> let<00:04:20.250> me

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
I've got it back together and let me

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.969

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.460 
only have two hands and let me show you
what<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.229> did<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.740> took<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.639> float<00:04:29.440> with<00:04:30.440> the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
what I did I took the float with the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.469 
what I did I took the float with the
magnet<00:04:30.979> now<00:04:31.190> attached<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.850> bottom<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.300> it

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
magnet now attached to the bottom of it

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.870 
magnet now attached to the bottom of it
and<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:32.750> threaded<00:04:33.320> it<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:34.250> know<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:34.610> slip

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
and I threaded it you know just slip

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.750 
and I threaded it you know just slip
this<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.720> long<00:04:36.199> dowel<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:37.160> there<00:04:37.850> with<00:04:38.419> the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
this this long dowel in there with the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.730 
this this long dowel in there with the
magnet<00:04:40.760> pointing<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.330> way<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.930> then

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
magnet pointing that way and then

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.909 
magnet pointing that way and then
holding<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:43.520> up<00:04:43.910> here<00:04:44.630> out<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.080> way<00:04:45.229> and

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
holding that up here out of the way and

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.250 
holding that up here out of the way and
you<00:04:46.370> get<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.639> down<00:04:46.790> here<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.240> just<00:04:47.510> put<00:04:47.780> that

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.350 

get<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:51.500> down<00:04:51.860> there<00:04:52.100> on<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.550> end<00:04:52.729> of<00:04:53.120> the

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
get that down there on the end of the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.890 
get that down there on the end of the
shaft<00:04:53.570> then<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:54.560> let<00:04:54.800> go<00:04:54.830> this<00:04:55.699> of<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.630> float

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
shaft then you let go this of the float

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.750 
shaft then you let go this of the float
and<00:04:57.199> it'll<00:04:57.740> get<00:04:57.889> down<00:04:58.039> there<00:04:58.220> it'll<00:04:58.490> slip

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
and it'll get down there it'll slip

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.230 
and it'll get down there it'll slip
right<00:04:59.030> on<00:04:59.180> that<00:04:59.389> shaft<00:04:59.979> then<00:05:00.979> you<00:05:01.820> take<00:05:02.060> that

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
right on that shaft then you take that

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.150 
right on that shaft then you take that
retainer<00:05:02.690> thing<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.289> you<00:05:03.440> put<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:03.770> on<00:05:03.949> the

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
retainer thing and you put it on the

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.230 
retainer thing and you put it on the
same<00:05:04.400> way<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:05.990> with<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:07.240> concave

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
same way and that is with the concave

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.070 
same way and that is with the concave
side<00:05:08.560> down<00:05:09.910> put<00:05:10.910> it<00:05:11.000> on<00:05:11.150> there<00:05:11.419> let<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:11.840> slip

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
side down put it on there let it slip

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.960 
side down put it on there let it slip
down<00:05:12.320> there<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.740> while<00:05:12.979> you're<00:05:13.160> holding<00:05:13.490> that

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
down there and while you're holding that

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.230 
down there and while you're holding that
on<00:05:14.270> there<00:05:15.280> let's<00:05:16.280> see<00:05:16.520> if<00:05:16.610> we<00:05:16.729> can<00:05:16.880> do<00:05:17.030> that

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
on there let's see if we can do that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.689 
on there let's see if we can do that
while<00:05:17.780> you're<00:05:17.930> holding<00:05:18.139> that<00:05:18.470> on<00:05:18.680> there<00:05:18.919> what

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
while you're holding that on there what

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.640 
while you're holding that on there what
I<00:05:19.729> did<00:05:20.090> was<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.330> had<00:05:20.479> a<00:05:20.690> pair<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.020> real<00:05:21.350> long

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
I did was I had a pair of real long

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.379 
I did was I had a pair of real long
needlenose<00:05:22.490> pliers

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
needlenose pliers

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.150 
needlenose pliers
so<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.539> could<00:05:23.840> spread<00:05:24.169> that<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.560> get<00:05:24.740> on<00:05:24.860> either

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
so I could spread that and get on either

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.589 
so I could spread that and get on either
side<00:05:25.669> of<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.949> washer<00:05:28.160> or<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.120> retainer<00:05:29.479> clip

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
side of the washer or the retainer clip

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.080 
side of the washer or the retainer clip
and<00:05:30.169> get<00:05:30.800> down<00:05:31.010> there<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:31.340> start<00:05:31.669> pushing<00:05:31.880> it

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
and get down there and start pushing it

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.750 
and get down there and start pushing it
down<00:05:32.210> till<00:05:32.599> it<00:05:32.750> catches<00:05:33.340> once<00:05:34.340> it<00:05:34.520> catches

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
down till it catches once it catches

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.430 
down till it catches once it catches
then<00:05:35.660> you<00:05:35.900> can<00:05:36.139> just<00:05:36.919> go<00:05:37.099> with<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:38.139> this<00:05:39.139> stick

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
then you can just go with a this stick

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.950 
then you can just go with a this stick
on<00:05:39.650> one<00:05:39.860> side<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.940> flat<00:05:40.970> braid<00:05:41.389> screw<00:05:41.780> so

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
on one side and a flat braid screw so

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.900 
on one side and a flat braid screw so
you<00:05:41.990> can<00:05:42.200> use<00:05:42.380> both<00:05:42.590> hands<00:05:42.979> and<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.430> just<00:05:43.460> work

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
you can use both hands and you just work

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.879 
you can use both hands and you just work
that<00:05:44.090> down<00:05:44.389> and<00:05:44.690> that<00:05:44.930> will<00:05:45.110> come<00:05:45.320> down<00:05:45.470> a<00:05:45.500> rest

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
that down and that will come down a rest

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.460 
that down and that will come down a rest
on<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.130> flange<00:05:46.550> down<00:05:47.120> there<00:05:47.389> and<00:05:48.080> once<00:05:48.260> you've

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
on a flange down there and once you've

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.360 
on a flange down there and once you've
got<00:05:48.680> that<00:05:48.860> done<00:05:52.360> tip<00:05:53.360> that<00:05:53.570> up<00:05:53.720> and<00:05:54.099> the<00:05:55.099> float

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
got that done tip that up and the float

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.950 
got that done tip that up and the float
goes<00:05:55.610> up<00:05:55.789> and<00:05:55.970> down<00:05:56.410> just<00:05:57.410> just<00:05:58.039> fine<00:05:58.720> how<00:05:59.720> long

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
goes up and down just just fine how long

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.640 
goes up and down just just fine how long
it'll<00:06:00.169> last

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
it'll last

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.610 
it'll last
