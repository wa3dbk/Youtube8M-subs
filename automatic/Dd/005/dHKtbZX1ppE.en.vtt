00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
which after the bounce comes to the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
which after the bounce comes to the
shoulder<00:00:16.920> height<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> head<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.390> even

is new to the pitch let me show you how

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
is new to the pitch let me show you how
a<00:00:27.300> bowler<00:00:27.750> would<00:00:28.619> actually<00:00:29.010> put<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> bouncer

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
a bowler would actually put a bouncer

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.540 
a bowler would actually put a bouncer
and<00:00:30.060> how<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.449> comes<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.590> pitch<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and how it comes on the pitch now to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.270 
and how it comes on the pitch now to
hold<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.059> ball<00:00:33.440> you<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:34.590> either<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
hold a ball you would either have the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.270 
hold a ball you would either have the
index<00:00:35.640> finger<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.800> between<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> two

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
index finger here on between the two

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.959 
index finger here on between the two
ends<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.989> here<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> middle<00:00:41.670> finger

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
ends or here with the middle finger

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.200 
ends or here with the middle finger
right<00:00:42.450> besides<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:44.129> thumb<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
right besides it and the thumb here so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.619 
right besides it and the thumb here so
this<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> typical<00:00:45.750> stance<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
this is a typical stance or just one to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.100 
this is a typical stance or just one to
hold<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> ball<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:50.100> after<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> ball<00:00:51.110> there

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
hold the ball now after the ball there

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.510 
hold the ball now after the ball there
will<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> good<00:00:52.739> run<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.160> there<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
will be a good run up there is a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.529 
will be a good run up there is a
fastball<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.410> ball<00:00:55.969> comes<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.360> bowler

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
fastball and the ball comes the bowler

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
fastball and the ball comes the bowler
bowls<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> ball<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.980> ball<00:00:59.280> would

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
bowls the ball now this ball would

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.990 
bowls the ball now this ball would
typically<00:01:00.530> land<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.640> half<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
typically land up at about half the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.260 
typically land up at about half the
pitch<00:01:03.359> length<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> where<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.790> would

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
pitch length so this is where it would

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.450 
pitch length so this is where it would
land<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.220> about

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
land up and you see that this is about

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
land up and you see that this is about
10<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.060> 12<00:01:09.330> feet<00:01:09.420> from<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> stamps<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.890> half

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
10 to 12 feet from the stamps about half

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.870 
10 to 12 feet from the stamps about half
the<00:01:11.549> pitch<00:01:12.210> length<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> after<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.369> comes<00:01:14.610> here

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the pitch length so after it comes here

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
the pitch length so after it comes here
after<00:01:15.150> Glanz<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.560> ball<00:01:16.770> Rises<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
after Glanz up here this ball Rises and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.390 
after Glanz up here this ball Rises and
rises<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.170> good<00:01:19.409> height<00:01:19.650> now<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
rises to a very good height now as you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.880 
rises to a very good height now as you
would<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.939> batsman<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.890> closest

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
would see the batsman is here closest

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.670 
would see the batsman is here closest
arms<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.880> ball<00:01:24.090> typically<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.409> at

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
arms and this ball typically would be at

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.070 
arms and this ball typically would be at
least<00:01:25.799> shoulder<00:01:26.250> height<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.810> will<00:01:27.930> go

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
least shoulder height or it will go

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.800 
least shoulder height or it will go
above<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:29.220> basically<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.119> batsman<00:01:30.600> would

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
above so basically the batsman would

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.710 
above so basically the batsman would
either<00:01:30.990> duck<00:01:31.409> down<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.670> avoid<00:01:33.030> being<00:01:33.329> hit<00:01:33.420> by

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
either duck down to avoid being hit by

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
either duck down to avoid being hit by
the<00:01:33.780> ball<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> how<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> ball<00:01:36.030> comes

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the ball so this is how the ball comes

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.270 
the ball so this is how the ball comes
like<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.799> ball<00:01:38.040> is

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
like and then you see this ball is

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.670 
like and then you see this ball is
generally<00:01:39.150> at<00:01:39.360> either<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.049> shoulder<00:01:40.470> or

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
generally at either the shoulder or

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.499 
generally at either the shoulder or
above<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> shoulder<00:01:41.490> height<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.180> ball<00:01:42.210> may

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
above the shoulder height this ball may

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
above the shoulder height this ball may
even<00:01:42.840> go<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.140> much<00:01:43.350> higher<00:01:43.579> going<00:01:44.579> above<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
even go up much higher going above the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.990 
even go up much higher going above the
batsman's<00:01:45.479> head<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.520> somewhere<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.729> inch

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
batsman's head or somewhere in this inch

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.899 
batsman's head or somewhere in this inch
now<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.750> area<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.399> said<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
now this area is the one that I said is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
now this area is the one that I said is
very<00:01:51.000> lethal<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.899> break<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.579> batsman

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
very lethal and can break the batsman

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.020 
very lethal and can break the batsman
small<00:01:54.409> let's<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.979> ball<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.759> look

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
small let's see how this ball would look

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.380 
small let's see how this ball would look
like<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.450> real<00:01:57.659> time

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140 

that's<00:02:04.390> how<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.810> looks<00:02:05.049> like
