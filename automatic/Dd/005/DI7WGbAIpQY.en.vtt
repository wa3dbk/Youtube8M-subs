flour but Roux is fat and starch fat and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.460 
flour but Roux is fat and starch fat and
starch<00:03:16.790> better<00:03:17.180> said<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.019> could<00:03:18.290> use

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
starch better said so you could use

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.130 
starch better said so you could use
bacon<00:03:18.860> fat<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.280> could<00:03:19.700> use<00:03:19.940> olive<00:03:20.840> oil<00:03:21.019> you

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
bacon fat you could use olive oil you

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.740 
bacon fat you could use olive oil you
could<00:03:21.440> use<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:21.680> about<00:03:22.010> any<00:03:22.370> kind<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.750> fat

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
could use just about any kind of fat

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.660 
could use just about any kind of fat
renderable<00:03:24.500> fat<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.160> would<00:03:25.280> like<00:03:25.459> and

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
renderable fat that you would like and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.710 
renderable fat that you would like and
again<00:03:26.330> starches<00:03:27.880> starches<00:03:28.880> absorb<00:03:29.330> liquid

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
again starches starches absorb liquid

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.310 
again starches starches absorb liquid
and<00:03:29.870> swell<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.680> gelatinization<00:03:32.320> the

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
and swell this is gelatinization the

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.680 
and swell this is gelatinization the
thing<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:34.070> starch<00:03:34.430> granules<00:03:35.090> must<00:03:35.420> be

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
thing is that starch granules must be

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.040 
thing is that starch granules must be
separated<00:03:37.000> here's<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.180> thing<00:03:38.390> starches<00:03:38.900> are

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
separated here's the thing starches are

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.580 
separated here's the thing starches are
sticky<00:03:39.380> right<00:03:40.480> think<00:03:41.480> about<00:03:41.690> rice<00:03:41.960> think

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
sticky right think about rice think

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.320 
sticky right think about rice think
about<00:03:42.800> potatoes<00:03:43.370> you're<00:03:43.610> cutting<00:03:44.150> potatoes

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
about potatoes you're cutting potatoes

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.400 
about potatoes you're cutting potatoes
and<00:03:44.900> how<00:03:44.990> stick

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
and how stick

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.050 
and how stick
your<00:03:45.590> knife<00:03:45.740> get<00:03:45.950> starches<00:03:46.430> are<00:03:46.580> very<00:03:46.730> sticky

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
your knife get starches are very sticky

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.510 
your knife get starches are very sticky
so<00:03:47.570> if<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.750> drop<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.140> bunch<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.590> flour<00:03:48.860> you<00:03:49.220> drop

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
so if you drop a bunch of flour you drop

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.730 
so if you drop a bunch of flour you drop
a<00:03:49.550> bunch<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.940> starch<00:03:50.210> into<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> hot<00:03:50.780> liquid<00:03:51.080> more

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
a bunch of starch into a hot liquid more

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.610 
a bunch of starch into a hot liquid more
than<00:03:51.950> 150<00:03:52.730> degrees<00:03:53.060> what<00:03:53.570> happens<00:03:53.960> the<00:03:54.320> starch

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
than 150 degrees what happens the starch

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.420 
than 150 degrees what happens the starch
is<00:03:54.770> gelatin<00:03:55.310> eyes<00:03:55.430> on<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.910> outside<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:58.250> get<00:03:58.400> a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
is gelatin eyes on the outside you get a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.660 
is gelatin eyes on the outside you get a
starch<00:03:58.820> bomb<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.540> all<00:04:00.290> this<00:04:00.710> get<00:04:01.130> sticky

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
starch bomb and all this get sticky

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.030 
starch bomb and all this get sticky
around<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.300> outside<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.080> all<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.470> starches

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
around the outside and all the starches

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.560 
around the outside and all the starches
stick<00:04:04.280> together<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:04.850> what<00:04:05.000> do<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.120> got<00:04:05.300> you

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
stick together so what do you got you

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.960 
stick together so what do you got you
got<00:04:05.870> grandma's<00:04:06.260> lumps<00:04:06.770> that's<00:04:07.460> how<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:07.760> get

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
got grandma's lumps that's how you get

lumps<00:04:08.390> in<00:04:08.540> your<00:04:08.690> sauces<00:04:09.140> because<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.770> starch

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
lumps in your sauces because the starch

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.520 
lumps in your sauces because the starch

absorbs liquid and swells that's how you

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.590 
absorbs liquid and swells that's how you
get<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.660> nice<00:05:08.870> velvety<00:05:09.260> sauce<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:10.220> liaison<00:05:11.090> it's

get a nice velvety sauce a liaison it's

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.780 
get a nice velvety sauce a liaison it's
the<00:05:11.930> same<00:05:12.140> thing<00:05:12.380> with<00:05:12.470> the<00:05:12.590> cornstarch<00:05:13.250> we

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
the same thing with the cornstarch we

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.720 
the same thing with the cornstarch we
always<00:05:14.000> use<00:05:14.150> cornstarch<00:05:14.810> in<00:05:15.110> a<00:05:15.230> slurry<00:05:15.730> so

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
always use cornstarch in a slurry so

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:23.490 
always use cornstarch in a slurry so
instead<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.240> this<00:05:17.720> what<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.680> get

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.560 

you<00:05:24.100> get<00:05:24.280> something<00:05:24.610> more<00:05:24.790> like<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.420> get

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
you get something more like that you get

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.470 
you get something more like that you get
this<00:05:25.720> long<00:05:26.050> chain<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.620> starch<00:05:27.280> molecules<00:05:27.940> so

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
this long chain of starch molecules so

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.960 
this long chain of starch molecules so
along<00:05:28.840> comes<00:05:29.140> the<00:05:29.290> liquid<00:05:29.440> pop-pop<00:05:30.310> absorb

as they swell as they absorb liquid and
that's<00:05:42.220> what<00:05:42.400> gives<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:42.670> a<00:05:42.700> nice<00:05:42.910> velvety

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
that's what gives you a nice velvety

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
sauce rather than plop so the important

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.750 
sauce rather than plop so the important
point<00:05:46.540> is<00:05:46.750> here<00:05:47.200> starch<00:05:47.620> cannot<00:05:48.040> be<00:05:48.190> added<00:05:48.670> to

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
point is here starch cannot be added to

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.480 
point is here starch cannot be added to
cold<00:05:49.000> liquid<00:05:49.420> starch<00:05:50.020> needs<00:05:50.320> a<00:05:50.440> fat<00:05:50.740> or<00:05:50.980> liquid

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
cold liquid starch needs a fat or liquid

out this raw starchy taste this is the
most<00:06:39.410> probably<00:06:39.950> the<00:06:40.130> most<00:06:40.160> important<00:06:40.790> step<00:06:41.000> in

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
most probably the most important step in

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.730 
most probably the most important step in
making<00:06:41.270> roux<00:06:41.690> and<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:42.350> biggest<00:06:42.680> mistake

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
making roux and the biggest mistake

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.950 
making roux and the biggest mistake
people<00:06:43.070> make<00:06:43.550> they<00:06:43.820> combine<00:06:44.270> the<00:06:44.570> butter<00:06:44.750> and

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
people make they combine the butter and

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.570 
people make they combine the butter and
the<00:06:45.050> flour<00:06:45.080> and<00:06:45.530> once<00:06:46.040> they<00:06:46.220> get<00:06:46.370> a<00:06:46.430> little

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
the flour and once they get a little

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.970 
the flour and once they get a little
paste<00:06:46.880> hey<00:06:47.210> they're<00:06:47.419> done<00:06:47.600> but<00:06:48.320> the<00:06:48.410> resulting

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
paste hey they're done but the resulting

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.280 
paste hey they're done but the resulting
sauce<00:06:49.220> tastes<00:06:49.669> like<00:06:49.820> wallpaper<00:06:50.030> paste<00:06:50.419> the

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
sauce tastes like wallpaper paste the

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.800 
sauce tastes like wallpaper paste the
resulting<00:06:52.040> sauce<00:06:52.250> is<00:06:52.460> so<00:06:52.639> flowery<00:06:53.240> and<00:06:53.570> so

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
resulting sauce is so flowery and so

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.110 
resulting sauce is so flowery and so
pasty<00:06:54.380> because<00:06:55.040> you<00:06:55.130> didn't<00:06:55.430> cook<00:06:55.669> out<00:06:55.880> this

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
pasty because you didn't cook out this

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.940 
pasty because you didn't cook out this
raw<00:06:56.389> starchy<00:06:57.020> taste<00:06:57.320> and<00:06:57.590> what<00:06:57.740> we're<00:06:57.919> doing

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
raw starchy taste and what we're doing

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:07.110 
raw starchy taste and what we're doing
is<00:06:58.430> cooking<00:06:58.820> out<00:06:59.210> the<00:06:59.450> proteins<00:07:04.300> in<00:07:05.590> the<00:07:06.590> flour

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
is cooking out the proteins in the flour

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.310 
is cooking out the proteins in the flour
another<00:07:08.120> reason<00:07:08.510> why<00:07:08.630> we<00:07:08.810> try<00:07:09.020> and<00:07:09.169> use<00:07:09.290> a

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
another reason why we try and use a

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.379 
another reason why we try and use a
flour<00:07:09.620> that<00:07:09.919> has<00:07:09.979> less<00:07:10.370> protein<00:07:10.729> we<00:07:11.180> don't

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
flour that has less protein we don't

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.840 
flour that has less protein we don't
want<00:07:11.540> to<00:07:11.630> develop<00:07:11.840> gluten<00:07:12.320> in<00:07:12.650> a<00:07:12.740> sauce<00:07:12.950> but<00:07:13.340> we

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
want to develop gluten in a sauce but we

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.760 
want to develop gluten in a sauce but we
also<00:07:14.000> want<00:07:14.330> to<00:07:14.389> cook<00:07:14.660> all<00:07:14.930> the<00:07:15.080> proteins<00:07:15.530> out

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
also want to cook all the proteins out

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.560 
also want to cook all the proteins out
so<00:07:16.070> why<00:07:16.250> start<00:07:16.610> with<00:07:16.850> a<00:07:16.880> really<00:07:17.150> high<00:07:17.270> protein

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
so why start with a really high protein

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.450 
so why start with a really high protein
flour<00:07:17.990> and<00:07:18.410> have<00:07:18.740> to<00:07:18.860> do<00:07:18.950> all<00:07:19.100> that<00:07:19.250> cooking

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
flour and have to do all that cooking

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.210 
flour and have to do all that cooking
start<00:07:19.910> with<00:07:20.030> a<00:07:20.060> lower<00:07:20.330> protein<00:07:20.690> flour<00:07:21.110> we<00:07:21.979> cook

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.220 
start with a lower protein flour we cook

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.690 
start with a lower protein flour we cook
out<00:07:22.370> all<00:07:22.550> the<00:07:22.640> proteins<00:07:23.090> and<00:07:24.310> you'll<00:07:25.310> see<00:07:25.520> this

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
out all the proteins and you'll see this

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.640 
out all the proteins and you'll see this
when<00:07:25.880> we<00:07:26.000> start<00:07:26.240> to<00:07:26.330> do<00:07:26.450> it<00:07:26.570> today<00:07:26.720> you'll<00:07:27.470> see

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
when we start to do it today you'll see

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.469 
when we start to do it today you'll see
it<00:07:27.740> start<00:07:28.010> to<00:07:28.130> bubble<00:07:28.310> you'll<00:07:28.789> see<00:07:29.030> it<00:07:29.120> go<00:07:29.300> from

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 
it start to bubble you'll see it go from

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:31.390 
it start to bubble you'll see it go from
a<00:07:29.600> yellow<00:07:29.840> color<00:07:30.260> to<00:07:30.380> a<00:07:30.560> white<00:07:30.830> color<00:07:31.160> and

you'll start to smell this very nutty

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.740 
you'll start to smell this very nutty
smell<00:07:33.830> as<00:07:34.280> soon<00:07:34.640> as<00:07:34.760> you<00:07:34.850> smell<00:07:35.030> the<00:07:35.390> nutty

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
smell of the flour that's when we know

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.340 
smell of the flour that's when we know
our<00:07:37.789> proteins<00:07:38.360> are<00:07:38.570> being<00:07:38.660> cooked<00:07:38.960> out<00:07:39.110> that's

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.350 
our proteins are being cooked out that's

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.960 
our proteins are being cooked out that's
where<00:07:39.530> you<00:07:39.620> get<00:07:39.710> a<00:07:39.770> sauce<00:07:40.070> that<00:07:40.550> tastes<00:07:40.910> like
