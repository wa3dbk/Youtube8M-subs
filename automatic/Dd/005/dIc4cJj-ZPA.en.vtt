00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.059 
and before you get started I'm going to
suggest<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.909> more<00:02:19.120> thing<00:02:19.359> which<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.439> to<00:02:20.680> crack

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
suggest one more thing which is to crack

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.690 
suggest one more thing which is to crack
a<00:02:21.099> few<00:02:21.549> choice<00:02:21.849> windows<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:24.489> your

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
a few choice windows in the in your

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.789 
a few choice windows in the in your
house<00:02:24.909> just<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.870> allow<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.439> negative

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
house just to allow for the negative

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.099 
house just to allow for the negative
energy<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.489> move<00:02:27.790> out<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.689> positive

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
energy to move out and the positive

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.839 
energy to move out and the positive
energy<00:02:29.409> from<00:02:29.530> nature<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.159> come<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.519> and

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
energy from nature to come in and

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.539 
energy from nature to come in and
replace<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.510> during<00:02:32.260> your<00:02:32.469> serum<00:02:32.889> I<00:02:33.069> use<00:02:33.310> an

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
replace that during your serum I use an

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.679 
replace that during your serum I use an
abalone<00:02:34.180> shell<00:02:34.269> as<00:02:34.750> my<00:02:35.139> heat<00:02:35.560> proof<00:02:35.829> Bowl<00:02:36.689> you

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
abalone shell as my heat proof Bowl you

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.449 
abalone shell as my heat proof Bowl you
can<00:02:37.870> find<00:02:38.139> these<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.379> health<00:02:38.709> food<00:02:38.889> stores<00:02:38.950> and

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
can find these in health food stores and

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.220 
can find these in health food stores and
online<00:02:39.609> as<00:02:40.060> well<00:02:42.689> basically<00:02:43.689> what<00:02:44.079> I'm<00:02:44.139> going

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
online as well basically what I'm going

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.089 
online as well basically what I'm going
to<00:02:44.319> do<00:02:44.849> open<00:02:45.849> up<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.480> stage<00:02:46.719> about<00:02:47.049> earlier

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:03:02.630 

and<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:52.720> want<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.400> write<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.549> like<00:02:54.760> this

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.400 

I<00:03:02.760> did<00:03:03.330> burn<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.140> moment<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:07.170> then

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
I did burn for just a moment and then

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.040 
I did burn for just a moment and then
let<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.890> flame<00:03:08.190> go<00:03:08.430> out<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.540> now<00:03:09.720> you've<00:03:09.930> got

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
let the flame go out and now you've got

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.260 
let the flame go out and now you've got
a<00:03:10.110> net<00:03:10.410> flow<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.950> smoke<00:03:11.310> okay<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.880> then<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
a net flow of smoke okay and then as the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.410 
a net flow of smoke okay and then as the
smoke<00:03:12.569> starts<00:03:13.050> building<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:15.150> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
smoke starts building up I like to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.270 
smoke starts building up I like to
purify<00:03:16.290> myself<00:03:16.530> first

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
purify myself first

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.580 
purify myself first
so<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> take<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.209> sage<00:03:18.420> bundle<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.170> gently

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so I take the sage bundle and I gently

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.280 
so I take the sage bundle and I gently
move<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.520> around<00:03:20.700> my<00:03:21.120> body<00:03:21.240> over<00:03:21.570> my<00:03:21.840> head<00:03:22.050> all

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
move it around my body over my head all

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.910 
move it around my body over my head all
the<00:03:22.320> way<00:03:22.709> around<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:24.530> visualize<00:03:25.530> any

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the way around and visualize any

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.830 
the way around and visualize any
negative<00:03:26.400> energy<00:03:26.730> that's<00:03:26.910> accumulated<00:03:27.660> on<00:03:27.690> my

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
negative energy that's accumulated on my

body<00:03:28.160> moving<00:03:29.160> out<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.420> replaced<00:03:30.570> by

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
body moving out and be replaced by

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.710 
body moving out and be replaced by
positive<00:03:31.650> energy<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.340> may<00:03:33.239> want<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.510> say<00:03:33.690> a

the<00:06:11.529> smoke<00:06:11.949> from<00:06:12.159> flowing<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:12.870> if<00:06:13.870> you<00:06:14.020> don't

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
the smoke from flowing and if you don't

the smoke from flowing and if you don't
mind<00:06:14.409> the<00:06:14.529> smoke<00:06:14.770> you<00:06:15.069> can<00:06:15.250> also<00:06:15.400> just<00:06:16.060> allow

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
mind the smoke you can also just allow

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.140 
mind the smoke you can also just allow
to<00:06:16.419> burn<00:06:16.779> out<00:06:17.259> and<00:06:17.620> it<00:06:18.430> won't<00:06:18.610> burn<00:06:18.789> for<00:06:19.000> very

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
to burn out and it won't burn for very

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.100 
to burn out and it won't burn for very
long<00:06:19.330> maybe<00:06:19.479> 5-10<00:06:20.259> minutes<00:06:20.560> back<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:22.810> that

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
long maybe 5-10 minutes back and that

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.260 
long maybe 5-10 minutes back and that
just<00:06:23.289> kind<00:06:23.469> of<00:06:23.560> lets<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:24.039> kids<00:06:24.310> the<00:06:24.759> process

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
just kind of lets it kids the process

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:32.909 
just kind of lets it kids the process
continue<00:06:26.050> I<00:06:28.680> think<00:06:29.680> that<00:06:30.009> even<00:06:30.669> though<00:06:31.710> it's<00:06:32.710> a

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
continue I think that even though it's a

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.790 
continue I think that even though it's a
very<00:06:33.310> very<00:06:33.610> simple<00:06:34.270> ceremony<00:06:34.599> you<00:06:35.379> can<00:06:35.560> do<00:06:35.710> it

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
very very simple ceremony you can do it

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.420 
very very simple ceremony you can do it
in<00:06:35.949> probably<00:06:36.550> five<00:06:36.789> minutes<00:06:38.069> it's<00:06:39.069> so

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
in probably five minutes it's so

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.700 
in probably five minutes it's so
powerful<00:06:39.729> it's<00:06:40.719> so<00:06:40.930> powerful<00:06:41.199> with<00:06:41.469> this<00:06:41.590> it

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
powerful it's so powerful with this it

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.700 
powerful it's so powerful with this it
