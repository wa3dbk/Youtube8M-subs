something or prohibit something shows a
shallowness<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.689> ought

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
shallowness that I think that we ought

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.700 
shallowness that I think that we ought

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that I find particular bad but it is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.370 
that I find particular bad but it is
pervasive<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.939> much<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:51.780> about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
pervasive in so much of what we do about

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.469 
pervasive in so much of what we do about

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
chopped it into two pieces we have

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.499 
chopped it into two pieces we have
political<00:01:58.920> speech<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.640> course<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
chopping freedom in half

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.809 
chopping freedom in half
and<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.930> leads<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.560> two<00:02:14.040> more<00:02:14.250> problems

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819

and that just leads to two more problems
but<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:15.930> pro<00:02:16.680> will<00:02:16.950> lead<00:02:17.220> to

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
but this this is pro will lead to

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.289 
but this this is pro will lead to
prohibition<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.019> won't<00:02:19.409> work<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:20.299> this

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
prohibition and it won't work and this

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.330
