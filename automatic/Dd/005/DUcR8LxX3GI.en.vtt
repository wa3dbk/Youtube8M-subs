you guys with a new hero guide video and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.860 
you guys with a new hero guide video and
this<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.490> going<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.730> be<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.060> Viet<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
this is going to be the Viet of the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.520 
this is going to be the Viet of the
video<00:00:07.470> for<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.859> hero<00:00:08.069> tiny<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.510> today<00:00:10.380> I'm

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
video for the hero tiny so today I'm

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.740 
video for the hero tiny so today I'm
going<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.800> first<00:00:11.010> talk<00:00:11.130> about<00:00:11.420> whether<00:00:12.420> or<00:00:12.630> not

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
going to first talk about whether or not

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.470 
going to first talk about whether or not
you<00:00:12.960> should<00:00:12.990> max<00:00:13.349> Avalanche<00:00:14.130> or<00:00:14.519> toss<00:00:15.000> first

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
you should max Avalanche or toss first

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.500 
you should max Avalanche or toss first
when<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.500> hit<00:00:16.740> level<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.310> seven<00:00:17.670> now<00:00:18.150> I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
when you hit level of seven now I

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.050 
when you hit level of seven now I
usually<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.560> build<00:00:19.920> where<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.490> max

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
usually like to build where I max

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.870 
usually like to build where I max
avalanche<00:00:21.630> first<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.199> then<00:00:22.619> later<00:00:22.890> go<00:00:23.250> into

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
avalanche first and then later go into

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.290 
avalanche first and then later go into
toss<00:00:24.119> although<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.130> usually<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.640> ultimate

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
toss although I usually get the ultimate

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
toss although I usually get the ultimate
what<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> actually<00:00:28.050> always<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> ultimate

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
what I actually always get the ultimate

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.359 
what I actually always get the ultimate
grow<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:29.970> level<00:00:30.570> six<00:00:30.810> now<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.769> inspired<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
grow at level six now I was inspired to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.670 
grow at level six now I was inspired to
do<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.790> video<00:00:33.090> when<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> first<00:00:34.170> started

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
do this video when I first started

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.630 
do this video when I first started
playing<00:00:36.260> whisper<00:00:37.260> tiny<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> maxing

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
playing whisper tiny and maxing

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
playing whisper tiny and maxing
Avalanche<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.570> some<00:00:39.870> players<00:00:40.140> have

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
Avalanche first up some players have

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860 
Avalanche first up some players have
gone<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.520> told<00:00:41.760> me<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.300> should<00:00:42.600> max

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
gone on and told me that I should max

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
gone on and told me that I should max
toss<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.070> ultimate<00:00:44.250> ability<00:00:44.820> gives

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
toss because the ultimate ability gives

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.110 
toss because the ultimate ability gives
a<00:00:45.480> bonus<00:00:45.899> damage<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> skill<00:00:46.890> set<00:00:47.100> toss<00:00:47.340> but

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
a bonus damage to the skill set toss but

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
a bonus damage to the skill set toss but
what's<00:00:48.660> missing<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> mechanic<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
what's missing here is a mechanic a

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
what's missing here is a mechanic a
mechanic<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.489> game<00:00:50.520> where<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.539> throw

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
mechanic in the game where if you throw

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.650 
mechanic in the game where if you throw
out<00:00:51.870> avalanche<00:00:52.620> very<00:00:53.370> avalanche<00:00:54.120> first<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
out avalanche very avalanche first and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
out avalanche very avalanche first and
then<00:00:54.780> toss<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.620> unit<00:00:56.250> immediately<00:00:56.850> who's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
then toss the unit immediately who's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
then toss the unit immediately who's
under<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> effects<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> avalanche<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
under the effects of avalanche you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
under the effects of avalanche you
actually<00:00:59.760> get<00:00:59.940> hit<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.300> second<00:01:00.809> time<00:01:00.989> by

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
actually get hit a second time by

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
actually get hit a second time by
Avalanche<00:01:01.620> meaning<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.090> max

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
Avalanche meaning that if you max

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.170 
Avalanche meaning that if you max
Avalanche<00:01:03.899> first<00:01:04.290> you're<00:01:04.799> doing<00:01:05.189> 300<00:01:06.060> damage

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
Avalanche first you're doing 300 damage

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.310 
Avalanche first you're doing 300 damage
twice<00:01:06.600> plus<00:01:07.170> 150<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.689> maxing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
twice plus 150 and if you are maxing

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.210 
twice plus 150 and if you are maxing
toss<00:01:10.560> first<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.549> you're<00:01:11.700> doing<00:01:11.970> 300<00:01:12.659> plus

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
toss first then you're doing 300 plus

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.300 
toss first then you're doing 300 plus
180<00:01:14.220> damage<00:01:14.670> twice<00:01:15.650> now<00:01:16.650> without<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
180 damage twice now without the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
180 damage twice now without the
ultimate<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:18.060> very<00:01:18.330> straightforward<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
ultimate it's very straightforward that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
ultimate it's very straightforward that
doing<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.740> avalanche<00:01:20.280> would<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
doing so avalanche would be the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.630 
doing so avalanche would be the
preferred<00:01:21.240> skill<00:01:21.600> however<00:01:22.439> grow<00:01:23.250> gives<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
preferred skill however grow gives a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
preferred skill however grow gives a
bonus<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.229> mathematics<00:01:25.860> become<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> bit

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
bonus so the mathematics become a bit

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
bonus so the mathematics become a bit
wonky<00:01:26.729> I'll<00:01:27.210> first<00:01:27.570> demonstrate<00:01:27.770> avalanche

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
wonky I'll first demonstrate avalanche

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.710 
wonky I'll first demonstrate avalanche
and<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> immediately<00:01:29.579> passing<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and it immediately passing so that a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.499 
and it immediately passing so that a
unit<00:01:31.079> will<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.320> hit<00:01:31.530> twice<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
unit will get hit twice here is the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
unit will get hit twice here is the
level<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.020> avalanche<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.710> level<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:35.070> toss

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
level for avalanche at level two toss

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.969 
level for avalanche at level two toss
and<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.810> level<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.229> avalanche<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and here is the level two avalanche and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.300 
and here is the level two avalanche and
level<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.759> toss<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:40.500> believe

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
level for toss and I believe

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
level for toss and I believe
demonstration<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.030> best<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.930> takes

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
demonstration is best because it takes

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.950 
demonstration is best because it takes
away<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.119> things<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.540> magic

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
away you know things like magic

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.190 
away you know things like magic
resistance<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> end<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.930> very

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
resistance and in the end you get a very

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.450 
resistance and in the end you get a very
clear<00:01:49.590> cut<00:01:49.860> picture

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
clear cut picture

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
clear cut picture
so<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:53.640> one<00:01:53.880> combination<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
so that's one combination and the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.600 
so that's one combination and the
lifestealer<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.860> brought<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.250> somewhere

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
lifestealer is brought to somewhere

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.680 
lifestealer is brought to somewhere
around<00:01:56.759> 100<00:01:57.710> 1500<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.180> here<00:02:00.180> level<00:02:00.420> 2

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
around 100 1500 and here level 2

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.920 
around 100 1500 and here level 2
avalanche<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.409> level<00:02:01.860> 4<00:02:02.040> toss<00:02:03.860> so<00:02:05.119> 1600<00:02:06.119> uh<00:02:06.210> if

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
avalanche and level 4 toss so 1600 uh if

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
obvious reasons because avalanche does

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.140 
obvious reasons because avalanche does

through<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.459> we're<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.269> talking<00:03:18.540> about

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
through now if we're not talking about

the<00:03:19.560> cooldown<00:03:19.950> we're<00:03:20.310> toss<00:03:20.549> has<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> shorter

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
the cooldown we're toss has a shorter

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.960 
the cooldown we're toss has a shorter
cooldown<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.870> Avalanche<00:03:22.380> then<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.040> think<00:03:23.489> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
cooldown the Avalanche then I think the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.720 
cooldown the Avalanche then I think the
most<00:03:24.180> ideal<00:03:24.420> way<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:25.200> play<00:03:25.650> tiny<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.459> max

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
most ideal way to play tiny is to max

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.539 
most ideal way to play tiny is to max
your<00:03:27.269> avalanche<00:03:27.989> first<00:03:28.290> because<00:03:29.010> many<00:03:29.220> times

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
your avalanche first because many times

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.520 
your avalanche first because many times
you're<00:03:29.850> going<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.239> rotating<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.989> gank<00:03:31.290> and

you're going to be rotating to gank and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.650 
you're going to be rotating to gank and
you<00:03:32.400> want<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.730> throw<00:03:32.940> make<00:03:33.120> sure<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.510> you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
have the utmost burst damage and meaning

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.509 
have the utmost burst damage and meaning

maximum damage possible and that will

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.699 
maximum damage possible and that will
come<00:03:42.180> with<00:03:42.630> maxing<00:03:43.079> avalanche

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709
