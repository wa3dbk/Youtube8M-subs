00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and the funny thing about it is that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.240 
and the funny thing about it is that
when<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.660> give<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.260> bounce<00:01:07.100> at<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
when you give it a little bounce at the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.750 
when you give it a little bounce at the
end

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
yeah that's why the stand uber stand the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030 
yeah that's why the stand uber stand the
weight<00:01:12.150> balance<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:13.020> off<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.740> very

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
they're down a roll the crane stand if

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
they're down a roll the crane stand if
you<00:01:37.140> put<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.710> laptop<00:01:37.979> parallel<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you put the laptop parallel to the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.109 
you put the laptop parallel to the
ground<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.799> bit<00:01:40.950> over<00:01:41.579> about

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
ground it's it's a little bit over about

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.139 
ground it's it's a little bit over about
I'd<00:01:42.420> say<00:01:42.990> half<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.500> inch<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:44.040> than<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> foot

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
I'd say half an inch more than a foot

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.460 
I'd say half an inch more than a foot
off<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.960> ground

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
off the ground

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
off the ground
and<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> clearance

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and it's actually really the clearance

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.109 
and it's actually really the clearance
is<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:49.280> significantly<00:01:50.280> larger<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
is actually significantly larger the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
is actually significantly larger the
cool<00:01:51.299> thing<00:01:51.450> about<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> crane<00:01:51.960> stamp<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.470> that
