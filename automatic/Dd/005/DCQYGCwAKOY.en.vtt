cloning<00:00:07.859> experiment<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:09.050> adhere<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.800> is

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
cloning experiment I adhere so it is

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.700 
cloning experiment I adhere so it is
exactly<00:00:11.099> five<00:00:11.880> days<00:00:12.240> after<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.929> did<00:00:13.590> the

exactly five days after I did the
initial<00:00:13.950> video<00:00:14.849> which<00:00:15.240> was<00:00:15.450> September<00:00:16.260> 10th

this is September 14th and I'm starting
to<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.560> some<00:00:19.770> roots<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.189> these<00:00:20.369> plants<00:00:20.850> so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
to see some roots on these plants so

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.300 
to see some roots on these plants so
five<00:00:21.420> days<00:00:21.740> afterwards<00:00:22.740> I'm<00:00:22.859> starting<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.130> see

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
five days afterwards I'm starting to see

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.410 
five days afterwards I'm starting to see
roots<00:00:24.109> amazingly<00:00:25.580> though<00:00:26.580> all<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.210> roots

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
roots amazingly though all the roots

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.919 
roots amazingly though all the roots
that<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.630> see<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.680> plant<00:00:29.070> without

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
that I see are on the plant without

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.410 
that I see are on the plant without
hormone<00:00:31.040> now<00:00:32.040> let<00:00:32.279> me<00:00:32.369> zoom<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.210> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
hormone now let me zoom in here so you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000 
hormone now let me zoom in here so you
can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> roots<00:00:34.079> starting<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> peek

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
can see the roots starting to peek

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.620 
can see the roots starting to peek
through<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.480> bit

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
through here you can see a little bit

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
there I have one two here with roots

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.479 
there I have one two here with roots
this<00:00:40.890> guy<00:00:41.540> does<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:42.930> any<00:00:43.530> visible<00:00:43.920> yet<00:00:44.190> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
this guy does not have any visible yet I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.959 
this guy does not have any visible yet I
have<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:46.260> more<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.710> guy<00:00:46.890> has<00:00:47.160> roots<00:00:47.579> very

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
have one more this guy has roots very

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.889 
have one more this guy has roots very
clearly<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:49.789> this<00:00:50.789> one<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.719> well

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.060 
and this guy I think it had one or two I
just<00:00:55.140> peeked<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> second<00:00:56.579> ago<00:00:57.949> in<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
just peeked at it a second ago in the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.770 
just peeked at it a second ago in the
back<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.550> these<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.390> ones<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
back here these are the the ones in the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
back here are the ones that had a hole

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.460 
back here are the ones that had a hole
that<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.210> treated<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.629> hormone<00:01:04.019> before

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that were treated with hormone before

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.590 
that were treated with hormone before
being<00:01:04.769> planted<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:08.150> any<00:01:09.150> roots

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
being planted and I do not see any roots

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
being planted and I do not see any roots
on<00:01:09.840> these<00:01:09.990> guys<00:01:10.670> none<00:01:11.670> that's<00:01:12.060> not<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> say

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

that<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.930> isn't<00:01:13.140> any<00:01:13.470> roots<00:01:14.360> starting<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
that there isn't any roots starting to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.940 
that there isn't any roots starting to
perk<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.840> beneath<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:18.049> soil<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.799> they

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
perk out beneath the soil but they

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.499 
perk out beneath the soil but they
haven't<00:01:20.310> come<00:01:20.460> through<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> edges<00:01:21.150> yet<00:01:21.330> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
haven't come through the edges yet so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
haven't come through the edges yet so
that<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> can't<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.920> guy

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that you can't actually see it this guy

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.429 
that you can't actually see it this guy
actually<00:01:23.549> noted<00:01:23.880> yesterday<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.479> might<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
actually noted yesterday you might be

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.240 
actually noted yesterday you might be
able<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:25.920> at<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.189> top<00:01:26.430> there<00:01:28.250> very

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
able to see at the very top there very

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
able to see at the very top there very
even<00:01:29.700> crevice<00:01:30.119> there<00:01:30.329> there's<00:01:30.840> actually<00:01:31.200> some

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
even crevice there there's actually some

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
even crevice there there's actually some
roots<00:01:31.740> near<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> top<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.970> they're<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:35.540> I'm

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
roots near the top but they're not I'm

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
roots near the top but they're not I'm
mainly<00:01:37.020> looking<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> ones<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.920> are

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
mainly looking for the ones that are

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.740 
mainly looking for the ones that are
peeking<00:01:38.280> through<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.520> outer<00:01:38.970> edges<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
peeking through the outer edges of the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.810 
peeking through the outer edges of the
plugs<00:01:40.170> because<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.700> my

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
plugs because that's that's my

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.950 
plugs because that's that's my
measurement<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.479> experiment<00:01:43.009> but<00:01:44.009> wow

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
measurement for this experiment but wow

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.530 
measurement for this experiment but wow
really<00:01:45.960> shocked<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.590> these<00:01:46.710> results<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.540> would

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
really shocked at these results I would

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.120 
really shocked at these results I would
have<00:01:48.869> thought<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.470> least<00:01:49.740> they<00:01:49.979> would

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
have thought that at least they would

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.660 
have thought that at least they would
all<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.369> even<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> definitely<00:01:53.520> did<00:01:53.640> not

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
all be even but I definitely did not

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.539 
all be even but I definitely did not
expect<00:01:53.850> though<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.009> cuttings<00:01:56.009> without

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
expect though the cuttings without

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.440 
expect though the cuttings without
hormone<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.890> come<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.100> first<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.880> that's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
hormone to come in first here that's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.749 
hormone to come in first here that's
really<00:02:00.840> surprising<00:02:01.020> i<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.250> sure<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.610> this

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
really surprising i I'm not sure if this

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.330 
really surprising i I'm not sure if this
is<00:02:02.820> suggesting<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.680> colonial<00:02:04.950> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
is suggesting that the colonial is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340 
is suggesting that the colonial is
actually<00:02:05.850> inhibiting<00:02:06.509> rooting<00:02:06.930> or

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
actually inhibiting rooting or

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.840 
actually inhibiting rooting or
or<00:02:07.439> what<00:02:08.100> I'm<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:09.080> I'm<00:02:10.080> amazed<00:02:10.550> once<00:02:11.550> again

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
or what I'm just I'm amazed once again

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.570 
or what I'm just I'm amazed once again
so<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.709> not<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.490> to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
so the not that I really want to

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.030 
so the not that I really want to
bad-mouth<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.060> company<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.680> stuff<00:02:16.890> that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
bad-mouth the company but the stuff that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.250 
bad-mouth the company but the stuff that
I<00:02:17.069> was<00:02:17.220> using<00:02:17.459> was<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.209> original<00:02:18.690> root<00:02:18.959> tech

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
I was using was the original root tech

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.150 
I was using was the original root tech
cloning<00:02:19.830> gel<00:02:22.760> yeah<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.120> mean<00:02:24.330> all<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.840> did<00:02:24.959> was<00:02:25.290> at

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
cloning gel yeah I mean all I did was at

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.830 
cloning gel yeah I mean all I did was at
the<00:02:26.370> end<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.910> there<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.270> shove<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.630> in

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the end of it in there and shove it in

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.559 
the end of it in there and shove it in
the<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.350> plug<00:02:28.620> that's<00:02:29.270> pretty<00:02:30.270> much<00:02:30.390> all<00:02:30.540> I

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
the the plug that's pretty much all I

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.630 
the the plug that's pretty much all I
did<00:02:32.060> hard<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.180> believe<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:34.459> would<00:02:35.459> have

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
did hard to believe that I would have

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.070 
did hard to believe that I would have
four<00:02:36.650> rooted<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.830> one<00:02:38.100> side<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.730> none<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
four rooted on one side and none on the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.190 
four rooted on one side and none on the
other<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.750> think<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.050> very

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
other that's just I think this is very

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.360 
other that's just I think this is very
clear<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:46.380> know<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.530> might<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.280> do

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
clear that you know I might have to do

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.100 
clear that you know I might have to do
this<00:02:47.489> experiment<00:02:47.790> again<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.989> be

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
this experiment again just just to be

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.550 
this experiment again just just to be
sure<00:02:49.140> because<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.900> just<00:02:51.900> too<00:02:52.050> too

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
sure because this is just too too

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.390 
sure because this is just too too
surprising<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.840> could<00:02:55.620> keep<00:02:55.800> going<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.220> about

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
surprising I could keep going on about

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.890 
surprising I could keep going on about
how<00:02:56.550> surprised<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.090> am<00:02:57.239> but<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.450> think<00:02:57.750> I'm<00:02:57.840> just

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
how surprised I am but I think I'm just

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.840 
how surprised I am but I think I'm just
going<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.230> go<00:02:58.350> ahead<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.650> cut<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.370> short<00:02:59.640> here

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
going to go ahead and cut it short here

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
going to go ahead and cut it short here
maybe<00:03:00.120> I'll<00:03:00.299> do<00:03:00.450> another<00:03:00.630> video<00:03:00.900> update<00:03:01.380> I'm

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
maybe I'll do another video update I'm

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.360 
maybe I'll do another video update I'm
actually<00:03:01.709> going<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.220> town<00:03:02.430> tomorrow<00:03:02.959> so<00:03:03.959> I

actually going out of town tomorrow so I

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.250 
actually going out of town tomorrow so I
won't<00:03:05.370> be<00:03:05.519> able<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> check<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.930> plants

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
throughout the weekend but maybe I'll do

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.690 
throughout the weekend but maybe I'll do
