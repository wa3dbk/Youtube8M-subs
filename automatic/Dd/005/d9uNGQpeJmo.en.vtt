 Hello everyone, with you StarGame 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.200
 And today I will show you how to install 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.000
 CLEO scripts for GTA: San Andreas 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.420
 First, download CLEO.4.7z by this link [link in the description and on the screen] 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.020
 Click "Download" 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.500
 And swing 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.260
 But I will not download, because I have already downloaded 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.540
 How to download, run the archive 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.080
 And click CLEO4_setup.exe 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.480
 Put a tick 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.500
 Specify the path to GTA: San Andreas 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.420
 Again, indicate the path to GTA: San Andreas 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.500
 Now we go to the folder with GTA: SA 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.000
 And find the folder CLEO 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.520
 Now download some script 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.060
 I download this one, and you download any 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.780
 Here, downloaded. Run 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.780
 Now we go to CLEO again 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.880
 And shove the file "cs" there 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.880
 Now we go into the game and check 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.060
 Hooray, the script is working. StarGame was with you, bye everyone
