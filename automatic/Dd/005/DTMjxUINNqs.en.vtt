hello<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.079> am<00:00:01.770> vampiric<00:00:02.639> Dustin<00:00:03.179> welcome<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.689> an

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
hello I am vampiric Dustin welcome to an

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.309 
hello I am vampiric Dustin welcome to an
episode<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.819> experimental<00:00:05.819> factories<00:00:06.390> and

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
episode of experimental factories and

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.230 
episode of experimental factories and
then<00:00:07.529> today's<00:00:07.919> episode<00:00:08.429> we're<00:00:08.639> testing<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.090> new

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
then today's episode we're testing a new

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.459 
then today's episode we're testing a new
design<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.780> thought<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:11.690> essentially<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
design I thought of essentially it's a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490 
design I thought of essentially it's a
better<00:00:13.650> use<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:13.920> cars<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.910> belts<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:16.350> my

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
better use for cars on belts it's my

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.150 
better use for cars on belts it's my
idea

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
idea

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.730 
idea
interesting<00:00:17.880> way<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> make<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.740> transportation

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
interesting way to make a transportation

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.890 
interesting way to make a transportation
system<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> carry<00:00:20.760> huge<00:00:21.330> amounts<00:00:21.779> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
system to carry huge amounts of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.849 
system to carry huge amounts of
resources<00:00:22.730> now<00:00:23.960> scalable<00:00:24.960> wise<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.710> is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
resources now scalable wise this is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.890 
resources now scalable wise this is
probably<00:00:26.460> more<00:00:26.760> than<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> train<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
probably more than a train because it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.030 
probably more than a train because it
doesn't<00:00:28.230> suffer<00:00:28.529> from<00:00:28.710> any<00:00:29.189> slowdown<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:31.040> more

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
doesn't suffer from any slowdown of more

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.799 
doesn't suffer from any slowdown of more
cars<00:00:32.340> slower<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.940> goes<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.450> doesn't<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
cars slower it goes it doesn't have that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.299 
cars slower it goes it doesn't have that
problem

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
problem

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.729 
problem
the<00:00:35.820> only<00:00:35.969> problem<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> does<00:00:37.200> take<00:00:37.440> quite<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
the only problem is it does take quite a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
the only problem is it does take quite a
while<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.280> from<00:00:38.460> point<00:00:38.640> A<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.850> point<00:00:39.030> B<00:00:39.390> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
while to get from point A to point B so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.090 
while to get from point A to point B so
I<00:00:39.870> don't<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.200> good<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> gonna<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.739> for

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
I don't know how good it's gonna be for

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.619 
I don't know how good it's gonna be for
like<00:00:41.129> long<00:00:41.489> distance<00:00:42.230> but<00:00:44.000> well<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> look

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
like long distance but well have a look

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
like long distance but well have a look
for<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.079> decide<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.590> yourself<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
for it decide for yourself see if you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.520 
for it decide for yourself see if you
like<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> may<00:00:48.239> want<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> try<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.840> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
like it and may want to try it out and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.139 
like it and may want to try it out and
here<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:51.230> alright<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.370> basic<00:00:53.760> premised

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
here it is alright so the basic premised

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.170 
here it is alright so the basic premised
is<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:56.180> double-ended

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
is that you have a double-ended

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.010 
is that you have a double-ended
locomotive<00:00:57.949> going<00:00:58.949> back<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.309> forth<00:00:59.550> between

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
locomotive going back and forth between

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.969 
locomotive going back and forth between
point<00:01:01.020> B<00:01:01.140> train<00:01:01.680> stop<00:01:01.920> B<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.460> trains<00:01:03.090> stop<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
point B train stop B and trains stop a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.850 
point B train stop B and trains stop a
now<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> got<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> schedule<00:01:05.580> set<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.750> stop<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
now I got the schedule set so stop a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 
now I got the schedule set so stop a
that's<00:01:08.520> its<00:01:08.729> rest<00:01:08.970> position<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.930> it'll<00:01:10.049> give

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that's its rest position so it'll give

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.990 
that's its rest position so it'll give
it<00:01:10.200> five<00:01:10.530> seconds<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> cars<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.820> clear

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it five seconds for the cars to clear

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.770 
it five seconds for the cars to clear
and<00:01:12.710> then<00:01:13.710> train<00:01:14.010> B<00:01:14.220> it'll<00:01:14.460> stop<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.030> 60

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and then train B it'll stop for about 60

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.490 
and then train B it'll stop for about 60
seconds<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.500> it'll<00:01:17.040> pause<00:01:17.840> where<00:01:18.840> oops<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.470> need

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
seconds so it'll pause where oops I need

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
seconds so it'll pause where oops I need
actually<00:01:20.040> throw<00:01:20.250> some<00:01:20.430> power<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.790> these<00:01:21.110> let's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
actually throw some power on these let's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.070 
actually throw some power on these let's
get<00:01:22.290> these<00:01:22.409> powered<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.189> our<00:01:23.430> test<00:01:24.080> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
get these powered up for our test so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
get these powered up for our test so
these<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.439> pull<00:01:25.619> from<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.890> cars<00:01:26.299> now<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.360> have

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
these will pull from the cars now I have

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.160 
these will pull from the cars now I have
them<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.780> both<00:01:28.110> sides<00:01:28.189> mainly<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
them on both sides mainly because the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
them on both sides mainly because the
cars<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> little<00:01:32.939> wavy<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.450> put

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
cars do like to get a little wavy I put

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
cars do like to get a little wavy I put
these<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> exact<00:01:35.100> same<00:01:35.400> when<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
these all on on the exact same when I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.690 
these all on on the exact same when I
began<00:01:36.000> playing<00:01:36.840> around<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.700> so

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
began playing around with this so

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.780 
began playing around with this so
they've<00:01:38.970> kind<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.240> sidestep<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> little<00:01:40.110> bit

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
they've kind of sidestep a little bit

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.920 
they've kind of sidestep a little bit
some<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.939> problems<00:01:42.329> came<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
some of the problems came from the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.649 
some of the problems came from the
corners<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.340> I've<00:01:44.460> thrown<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.939> some<00:01:45.180> couple

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
corners so I've thrown in some couple

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
corners so I've thrown in some couple
yellows<00:01:45.960> slow<00:01:46.350> belts<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.909> it'll

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
yellows slow belts so that way it'll

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
yellows slow belts so that way it'll
crunch<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
crunch them up here and then when it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
crunch them up here and then when it
comes<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> corner<00:01:50.850> it'll<00:01:51.030> space<00:01:51.479> them<00:01:51.720> out

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
comes to the corner it'll space them out

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
comes to the corner it'll space them out
enough<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.950> clear<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> corner

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
enough that they can clear the corner

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.990 
enough that they can clear the corner
before<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> cars<00:01:54.479> start<00:01:54.899> interfering<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:56.000> but

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
before the cars start interfering it but

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020 
before the cars start interfering it but
we'll<00:01:57.149> show<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:58.700> I've<00:01:59.700> got<00:01:59.909> these

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
we'll show that here I've got these

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.910 
we'll show that here I've got these
chests<00:02:00.450> preloaded<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
chests preloaded with you know a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.789 
chests preloaded with you know a
thousand<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> two<00:02:02.729> thousand<00:02:03.210> different<00:02:03.329> iron

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
thousand to two thousand different iron

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.840 
thousand to two thousand different iron
so<00:02:04.799> we're<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.159> how<00:02:05.219> much<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.640> move

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
so we're gonna see how much we can move

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.970 
so we're gonna see how much we can move
real<00:02:06.060> quick<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.719> let's<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.229> powered<00:02:07.649> up

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:08.980 
real quick so let's get this powered up

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.170 
real quick so let's get this powered up
and<00:02:09.980> let's<00:02:10.430> turn<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.940> train<00:02:11.300> on<00:02:11.510> let<00:02:12.500> again

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
and let's turn this train on let again

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.350 
and let's turn this train on let again
now<00:02:14.180> since<00:02:14.540> cars<00:02:14.810> have<00:02:15.110> huge<00:02:15.820> slots<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:17.180> mean

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
now since cars have huge slots I mean

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.610 
now since cars have huge slots I mean
huge<00:02:17.840> slots<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:20.180> advantage<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.050> is<00:02:21.110> that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
huge slots the advantage to this is that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.770 
huge slots the advantage to this is that
I<00:02:21.680> can<00:02:21.950> they're<00:02:22.520> just<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.850> massive<00:02:23.330> chests

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
I can they're just like massive chests

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.580 
I can they're just like massive chests
on<00:02:23.960> belts<00:02:24.380> essentially<00:02:25.690> there<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.840> mod<00:02:27.200> for

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
on belts essentially there is a mod for

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.590 
on belts essentially there is a mod for
packaging<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.610> have<00:02:28.820> heard<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.450> haven't

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
packaging that I have heard of I haven't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.480 
packaging that I have heard of I haven't
tried<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.960> yet<00:02:30.110> myself<00:02:30.350> but<00:02:30.920> I've<00:02:31.070> heard<00:02:31.280> it's

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
tried it yet myself but I've heard it's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.430 
tried it yet myself but I've heard it's
pretty<00:02:31.730> good<00:02:31.910> about<00:02:32.120> packing<00:02:32.840> huge<00:02:33.140> amount<00:02:33.380> of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
pretty good about packing huge amount of

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.010 
pretty good about packing huge amount of
resources<00:02:33.910> let's<00:02:34.910> put<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.240> on<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> belt<00:02:35.630> but

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
resources let's put it on a belt but

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.180 
resources let's put it on a belt but
this<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.860> good<00:02:37.100> in-game<00:02:37.550> fix<00:02:37.880> for<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:39.190> one

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
this is a good in-game fix for that one

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.750 
this is a good in-game fix for that one
of<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.340> advantages<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.150> yep<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.050> can

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
of the advantages is yep you can

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.280 
of the advantages is yep you can
actually<00:02:43.760> grab<00:02:44.090> from<00:02:44.330> these<00:02:44.480> cars<00:02:44.810> like<00:02:45.110> you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
actually grab from these cars like you

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.500 
actually grab from these cars like you
would<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> chest<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:49.000> generally<00:02:50.000> um<00:02:50.210> if

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
would a chest and generally um if

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.390 
would a chest and generally um if
they've<00:02:50.720> come<00:02:50.960> within<00:02:51.170> range<00:02:51.350> of<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.010> repair

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
they've come within range of the repair

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.330 
they've come within range of the repair
or<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.820> robot<00:02:53.480> ports<00:02:53.780> oh<00:02:54.070> hey<00:02:55.070> there's

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
or the robot ports oh hey there's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.060 
or the robot ports oh hey there's
mingled<00:02:55.730> pork<00:02:56.030> what<00:02:56.540> do<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:56.720> know<00:02:56.960> there<00:02:57.950> you

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
mingled pork what do you know there you

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.370 
mingled pork what do you know there you
go<00:02:58.190> mangled<00:02:58.610> pork<00:02:58.850> there's<00:02:59.150> your<00:02:59.450> rebel<00:03:00.140> pork

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
go mangled pork there's your rebel pork

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.610 
go mangled pork there's your rebel pork
for<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.620> man<00:03:00.770> that<00:03:01.310> was<00:03:01.460> that<00:03:01.610> for<00:03:01.850> you

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
for you man that was that for you

for you man that was that for you
Whately<00:03:03.620> spoon<00:03:04.000> see<00:03:05.000> who<00:03:05.060> else<00:03:05.180> i<00:03:05.330> got<00:03:05.360> here<00:03:05.660> i

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
Whately spoon see who else i got here i

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.810 
Whately spoon see who else i got here i
just<00:03:06.200> threw<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.380> bunch<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.740> ports<00:03:07.310> down<00:03:07.520> because

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
just threw a bunch of ports down because

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.890 
just threw a bunch of ports down because
it<00:03:08.030> took<00:03:08.180> forever<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.600> get<00:03:08.750> those<00:03:09.700> Morgoth

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
it took forever to get those Morgoth

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.000 
it took forever to get those Morgoth
togas<00:03:12.970> leopards<00:03:13.970> sure<00:03:14.360> dot<00:03:14.570> all<00:03:15.440> right<00:03:15.620> so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
togas leopards sure dot all right so

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.890 
togas leopards sure dot all right so
that's<00:03:16.520> set<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.060> trains<00:03:17.300> moved<00:03:17.600> out<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
that's set the trains moved out of the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.740 
that's set the trains moved out of the
way<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.170> allowed<00:03:18.410> them<00:03:18.590> all<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:19.010> go<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.510> we're

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
way and allowed them all to go so we're

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.080 
way and allowed them all to go so we're
gonna<00:03:20.810> follow<00:03:21.080> them<00:03:21.350> through<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.940> we're

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
gonna follow them through and we're

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.780 
gonna follow them through and we're
gonna<00:03:23.180> come<00:03:23.390> down<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.870> station<00:03:24.790> once

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
gonna come down to the station once

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.340 
gonna come down to the station once
again<00:03:26.150> there's<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.480> slowdown<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:27.110> then<00:03:27.230> it

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
again there's the slowdown and then it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.520 
again there's the slowdown and then it
kind<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.650> pops<00:03:27.920> them<00:03:28.160> out<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:28.670> they<00:03:28.820> don't<00:03:29.530> get

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
kind of pops them out so they don't get

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.360 
kind of pops them out so they don't get
shoved<00:03:30.830> off<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.190> belt<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.980> guys<00:03:34.160> can

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
shoved off the belt you guys can

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.100 
shoved off the belt you guys can
experiment<00:03:34.700> see<00:03:35.090> if<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.270> guys<00:03:35.420> find<00:03:35.750> some

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
experiment see if you guys find some

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.260 
experiment see if you guys find some
pretty<00:03:36.290> good<00:03:36.470> ways<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.940> better<00:03:37.940> doing<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
pretty good ways of better doing the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.780 
pretty good ways of better doing the
corners<00:03:38.860> but<00:03:39.860> they'll<00:03:40.040> just<00:03:40.250> unload<00:03:40.580> like

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
corners but they'll just unload like

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.780 
corners but they'll just unload like
crazy<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:42.650> seems<00:03:42.980> like<00:03:43.190> they're<00:03:43.340> doing<00:03:43.459> both

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
crazy it seems like they're doing both

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.630 
crazy it seems like they're doing both
sides<00:03:44.090> on<00:03:44.330> all<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.660> them<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.310> great

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
sides on all of them so this is a great

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.460 
sides on all of them so this is a great
way<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:46.910> just<00:03:47.270> kind<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.920> empty<00:03:48.920> them<00:03:49.040> out

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
way to just kind of empty them out

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.750 
way to just kind of empty them out
sandwich<00:03:51.470> we<00:03:51.650> get<00:03:51.830> into<00:03:52.010> each<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.310> these<00:03:52.430> once

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
sandwich we get into each of these once

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.520 
sandwich we get into each of these once
it<00:03:52.970> leaves<00:03:54.040> I've<00:03:55.040> got<00:03:55.160> this<00:03:55.340> same<00:03:55.970> way

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
it leaves I've got this same way

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.850 
it leaves I've got this same way
60-seconds<00:03:57.530> first<00:03:57.950> break<00:03:59.320> it<00:04:00.320> is<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> little

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
60-seconds first break it is a little

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.920 
60-seconds first break it is a little
inconsistent<00:04:01.580> on<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.760> timings<00:04:02.209> because<00:04:02.660> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
inconsistent on the timings because the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.630 
inconsistent on the timings because the
trains<00:04:03.170> are<00:04:03.410> running<00:04:03.440> while<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.160> cars<00:04:04.400> are

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
trains are running while the cars are

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.960 
trains are running while the cars are
moving<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.100> can<00:04:07.280> play<00:04:07.459> around<00:04:07.670> with<00:04:07.820> the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
moving so you can play around with the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.280 
moving so you can play around with the
timings<00:04:08.330> of<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.510> different<00:04:08.810> stations

timings of the different stations

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.020 
timings of the different stations
depending<00:04:09.830> on<00:04:09.890> how<00:04:10.010> many<00:04:10.070> cars<00:04:10.370> they'll<00:04:10.910> have

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
depending on how many cars they'll have

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.640 
depending on how many cars they'll have
the<00:04:11.420> more<00:04:11.600> cars<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.020> have<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.200> on<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.440> belt

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
the more cars you have the on the belt

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.850 
the more cars you have the on the belt
the<00:04:12.890> longer<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.220> needs<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.550> stay<00:04:13.730> at<00:04:13.850> station<00:04:14.300> a

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
the longer it needs to stay at station a

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.130 
the longer it needs to stay at station a
I<00:04:15.860> really<00:04:16.700> should<00:04:16.880> probably<00:04:17.150> stay<00:04:17.510> at<00:04:17.540> station

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
I really should probably stay at station

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.719 
I really should probably stay at station
a<00:04:18.229> just<00:04:18.560> long<00:04:18.739> enough<00:04:18.770> to<00:04:19.070> let<00:04:19.220> all<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.430> cars

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
a just long enough to let all the cars

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:20.860 
a just long enough to let all the cars
pass

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
pass

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.820 
pass
the<00:04:21.870> rest<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.199> time<00:04:22.379> it<00:04:22.530> can<00:04:22.650> probably

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
the rest of the time it can probably

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.649 
the rest of the time it can probably
just<00:04:23.129> be<00:04:23.280> at<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.639> waiting<00:04:25.669> and<00:04:26.669> they<00:04:27.120> do<00:04:27.180> seem

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:27.659 
just be at be waiting and they do seem

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.469 
just be at be waiting and they do seem
to<00:04:27.840> kind<00:04:28.139> of<00:04:28.289> actually<00:04:28.470> work<00:04:28.979> while<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.759> cars

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
to kind of actually work while the cars

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.360 
to kind of actually work while the cars
are<00:04:30.689> moving<00:04:32.120> look<00:04:33.120> like<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.889> can<00:04:35.039> just<00:04:35.069> kind

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
are moving look like so it can just kind

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.070 
are moving look like so it can just kind
of<00:04:35.460> grab<00:04:35.699> on<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:36.030> go<00:04:36.210> as<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.569> is<00:04:38.449> so<00:04:39.449> you<00:04:39.960> know

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
of grab on the go as it is so you know

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.070 
of grab on the go as it is so you know
by<00:04:40.259> and<00:04:40.379> large<00:04:40.469> the<00:04:40.740> system<00:04:41.189> is<00:04:41.340> not<00:04:41.550> very

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.200 

what's<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.169> word<00:04:46.289> for<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.099> not<00:04:47.310> very<00:04:47.639> fine

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
what's the word for it's not very fine

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.070 
what's the word for it's not very fine
like<00:04:48.750> it's<00:04:48.930> hard<00:04:49.139> to<00:04:49.199> find<00:04:49.469> control<00:04:49.919> it<00:04:50.389> but<00:04:51.389> it

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
like it's hard to find control it but it

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.790 
like it's hard to find control it but it
has<00:04:52.669> mass<00:04:53.669> transportation<00:04:54.300> properties<00:04:55.110> let's

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
has mass transportation properties let's

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.730 
has mass transportation properties let's
see<00:04:55.919> how<00:04:56.039> many<00:04:56.099> did<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.520> get<00:04:56.580> in<00:04:56.879> there<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.740> got

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
see how many did I get in there I got

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.110 
see how many did I get in there I got
like<00:04:58.919> 200<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.990> 300<00:05:01.620> iron<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.610> every<00:05:02.909> single

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
like 200 to 300 iron in every single

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.920 
like 200 to 300 iron in every single
chest<00:05:03.509> and<00:05:03.990> there's<00:05:04.229> probably<00:05:05.599> let's<00:05:06.599> just<00:05:06.810> do

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
chest and there's probably let's just do

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.559 
chest and there's probably let's just do
a<00:05:06.960> count<00:05:07.259> quick<00:05:08.009> way<00:05:08.159> to<00:05:08.219> count<00:05:08.460> 13<00:05:09.030> chests<00:05:09.449> on

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
a count quick way to count 13 chests on

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.200 
a count quick way to count 13 chests on
that<00:05:09.750> side<00:05:11.539> no<00:05:12.539> don't<00:05:12.870> grab<00:05:12.960> those<00:05:13.229> and

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
that side no don't grab those and

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.670 
that side no don't grab those and
there's<00:05:16.580> 15<00:05:17.580> on<00:05:17.759> that<00:05:17.940> side<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:18.539> I<00:05:19.050> have<00:05:19.289> 28

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
there's 15 on that side so I have 28

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.330 
there's 15 on that side so I have 28
chests<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.430> got<00:05:20.580> like<00:05:20.759> 200<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.419> 300<00:05:21.960> each

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
chests that got like 200 to 300 each

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.309 
chests that got like 200 to 300 each
it's<00:05:23.340> not<00:05:23.520> too<00:05:23.729> bad<00:05:23.909> and<00:05:24.419> all<00:05:24.719> I<00:05:24.750> have<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.080> an

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
it's not too bad and all I have is an

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:31.700 
it's not too bad and all I have is an
investment<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:25.860> 10<00:05:26.520> cars<00:05:29.419> yeah<00:05:30.529> so<00:05:31.529> there's

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
investment of 10 cars yeah so there's

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.110 
investment of 10 cars yeah so there's
gonna<00:05:31.830> be<00:05:31.919> some<00:05:32.009> hiccups<00:05:32.310> on<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.729> system

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
gonna be some hiccups on the system

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.350 
gonna be some hiccups on the system
they're<00:05:33.300> gonna<00:05:33.419> have<00:05:34.139> weird<00:05:34.469> timings<00:05:35.360> you'll

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
they're gonna have weird timings you'll

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.540 
they're gonna have weird timings you'll
have<00:05:36.479> to<00:05:36.599> tweak<00:05:36.870> it<00:05:37.069> longer<00:05:38.069> the<00:05:38.159> belts<00:05:38.490> the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
have to tweak it longer the belts the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.230 
have to tweak it longer the belts the
longer<00:05:38.969> times<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.599> things<00:05:39.750> like<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:39.990> but

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
longer times and things like that but

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.969 
longer times and things like that but
this<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.300> pretty<00:05:42.659> much<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:43.050> very<00:05:43.080> basic<00:05:43.620> proof

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
this is pretty much a very basic proof

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.469 
this is pretty much a very basic proof
of<00:05:44.129> concept<00:05:44.639> for<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:45.560> cars<00:05:46.560> on<00:05:46.770> belts<00:05:47.479> design

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
of concept for the cars on belts design

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.230 
of concept for the cars on belts design
idea<00:05:48.900> I'd<00:05:49.889> love<00:05:50.310> to<00:05:50.400> see<00:05:50.580> what<00:05:50.699> everybody<00:05:51.000> can

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
idea I'd love to see what everybody can

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.110 
idea I'd love to see what everybody can
come<00:05:51.389> up<00:05:51.539> with<00:05:52.069> show<00:05:53.069> me<00:05:53.190> what<00:05:53.310> you<00:05:53.430> got<00:05:53.460> you

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
come up with show me what you got you

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.040 
come up with show me what you got you
guys<00:05:54.270> have<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.539> good<00:05:54.719> day

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
guys have a good day
