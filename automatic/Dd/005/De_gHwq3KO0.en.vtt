that<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.470> may<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.860> exist<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that there he may not exist and then I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630 
that there he may not exist and then I
started<00:01:33.509> thinking<00:01:33.869> about<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.369> there's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
started thinking about you know there's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.249 
started thinking about you know there's
got<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.329> absolutely<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> be

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
got to be there absolutely has to be

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
got to be there absolutely has to be
somebody<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.979> that's<00:01:38.009> responsible

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
somebody out there that's responsible

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
somebody out there that's responsible
for<00:01:38.790> yoga<00:01:39.180> pants<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.829> I'm<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
for yoga pants and you know I'm kind of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.450 
for yoga pants and you know I'm kind of
leaning<00:01:41.400> towards<00:01:41.579> he<00:01:41.880> exists<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.360> guys<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
leaning towards he exists now guys I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.670 
leaning towards he exists now guys I
don't<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.390> anyway<00:01:45.720> serious<00:01:46.200> side<00:01:46.350> apart

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
don't know but anyway serious side apart

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.679 
don't know but anyway serious side apart
um<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.579> want<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.939> talk<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.299> bit<00:01:48.450> about<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
um I want to talk a little bit about the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.670 
um I want to talk a little bit about the
flechette<00:01:48.840> night<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> told<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.500> guys<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
flechette night I told you guys that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.990 
flechette night I told you guys that
there<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.820> way<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
there was one really really good way to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
there was one really really good way to
use<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> spaz<00:01:51.479> 12<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.140> I've<00:01:52.229> been

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
use a spaz 12 you know I've been

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.630 
use a spaz 12 you know I've been
watching<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> gameplay<00:01:53.100> watch<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> damn

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
watching the gameplay watch the damn

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
watching the gameplay watch the damn
gameplay<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.119> could<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> potential<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
gameplay you could see the potential of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
gameplay you could see the potential of
this<00:01:55.110> weapon<00:01:55.369> basically<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.640> step

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
this weapon basically if they step

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.749 
this weapon basically if they step
inside<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.570> circular<00:01:58.250> area<00:01:59.250> thingy

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
inside that little circular area thingy

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.120 
inside that little circular area thingy
that<00:02:00.000> I've<00:02:00.119> got<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.530> they

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that I've got going on right now if they

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
that I've got going on right now if they
step<00:02:02.310> inside<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.360> putting<00:02:03.600> work

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
step inside of that you're putting work

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.539 
step inside of that you're putting work
in<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:04.350> basically<00:02:04.740> gonna<00:02:05.040> die<00:02:05.280> now<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
in there basically gonna die now the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
in there basically gonna die now the
difference<00:02:05.729> between<00:02:05.969> buckshot<00:02:06.630> flechette<00:02:07.049> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
difference between buckshot flechette is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.949 
difference between buckshot flechette is
the<00:02:07.860> flechette<00:02:08.009> has<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.940> tighter<00:02:09.420> spread<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the flechette has a tighter spread and

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.510 
the flechette has a tighter spread and
everybody<00:02:10.470> knows<00:02:10.679> titers<00:02:11.039> better<00:02:11.280> unless

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
everybody knows titers better unless

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.500 
everybody knows titers better unless
you're<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.790> nine<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.270> even<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you're like nine and even that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
you're like nine and even that
experienced<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.110> yet

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
experienced that yet

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740 
experienced that yet
but<00:02:14.010> tighter<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.580> always<00:02:14.940> better<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.480> if

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
but tighter is always better so if

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.090 
but tighter is always better so if
they're<00:02:15.930> sitting<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.530> little<00:02:16.620> bit<00:02:16.800> i<00:02:16.830> mean<00:02:16.890> if

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
they're sitting a little bit i mean if

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.400 
they're sitting a little bit i mean if
you're<00:02:17.190> more<00:02:17.459> inaccurate<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.180> guess<00:02:18.420> spreads<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
you're more inaccurate I guess spreads a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.870 
you're more inaccurate I guess spreads a
little<00:02:19.620> bit<00:02:19.709> better<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> tighter<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
little bit better but the tighter the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.220 
little bit better but the tighter the
spread<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.270> more<00:02:21.450> accuracy<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.050> more

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
spread the more accuracy in the more

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.600 
spread the more accuracy in the more
likelihood<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.040> you're<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.490> get<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
likelihood that you're going to get a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.940 
likelihood that you're going to get a
one<00:02:23.790> hit<00:02:23.970> kill<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.200> long<00:02:25.350> as<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.740> little

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
one hit kill so as long as it's a little

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.830 
one hit kill so as long as it's a little
bit<00:02:26.069> more<00:02:26.190> accurate<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.670> enjoy<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.630> one

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
bit more accurate I enjoy it now the one

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.090 
bit more accurate I enjoy it now the one
more<00:02:28.020> thing<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.410> has<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> better<00:02:28.980> advantage

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
more thing that has a better advantage

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.250 
more thing that has a better advantage
over<00:02:29.459> buckshot<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.090> also<00:02:30.270> more<00:02:30.720> effective

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
over buckshot it's also more effective

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.290 
over buckshot it's also more effective
in<00:02:31.410> range<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.580> little<00:02:32.940> bit<00:02:33.090> better

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
in range so if it's a little bit better

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.080 
in range so if it's a little bit better
with<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.569> cap<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> little<00:02:34.500> feet<00:02:34.890> extra<00:02:35.340> damage<00:02:35.550> or

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
with a cap a little feet extra damage or

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.970 
with a cap a little feet extra damage or
you<00:02:36.390> know<00:02:36.480> one<00:02:36.660> hit<00:02:36.840> kill<00:02:36.989> ratio<00:02:37.350> on<00:02:37.500> top<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.860> it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you know one hit kill ratio on top of it

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.800 
you know one hit kill ratio on top of it
go<00:02:38.550> ahead<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.000> use<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.480> look<00:02:39.600> at<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
go ahead and use it so you look at the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.300 
go ahead and use it so you look at the
decent<00:02:40.200> one<00:02:40.350> shot<00:02:40.590> kills<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.130> getting

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
decent one shot kills that I'm getting

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.920 
decent one shot kills that I'm getting
on<00:02:41.520> these<00:02:41.610> guys<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.270> know<00:02:42.300> medium<00:02:42.720> range

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
on these guys that you know medium range

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.930 
on these guys that you know medium range

fucking<00:02:55.350> nerds<00:02:55.590> or<00:02:55.769> somewhere<00:02:56.100> scientists<00:02:56.850> or

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
fucking nerds or somewhere scientists or

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.309 
fucking nerds or somewhere scientists or
calculating<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.750> crunching<00:02:58.110> some<00:02:58.260> numbers

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
calculating is crunching some numbers

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.410 
calculating is crunching some numbers
right<00:02:58.769> now<00:02:58.920> trying<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.640> prove<00:02:59.850> my<00:03:00.060> theory

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
right now trying to prove my theory

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.960 
right now trying to prove my theory
right<00:03:00.690> now<00:03:00.930> as<00:03:01.140> we<00:03:01.319> speak<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:02.610> got<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.910> be

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
right now as we speak and it's got to be

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.070 
right now as we speak and it's got to be
the<00:03:03.090> same<00:03:03.239> way<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.420> mean<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> tighter

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the same way I mean you get a tighter

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.600 
the same way I mean you get a tighter
spread<00:03:04.380> which<00:03:04.560> means<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:05.040> better<00:03:05.310> likelihood

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
spread which means a better likelihood

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.090 
spread which means a better likelihood
of<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.030> one-shot<00:03:06.420> kill<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:07.530> supposed<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.950> be

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
of a one-shot kill it's supposed to be

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.059 
of a one-shot kill it's supposed to be
not<00:03:08.340> as<00:03:08.519> strong<00:03:08.819> as<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.690> buckshot<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.830> close

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
not as strong as the buckshot in close

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.210 
not as strong as the buckshot in close
quarters<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.110> that's<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.530> don't<00:03:13.980> know<00:03:14.069> what<00:03:14.160> to

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
quarters and that's I don't know what to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.650 
quarters and that's I don't know what to
think<00:03:14.310> about<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.239> don't<00:03:15.600> really

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
think about that because I don't really

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.330 
think about that because I don't really
see<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.230> difference<00:03:16.260> I've<00:03:16.830> seen<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.069> lot<00:03:17.160> of

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
see the difference I've seen a lot of

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100 
see the difference I've seen a lot of
close-range<00:03:17.700> buckshot<00:03:18.239> kills<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.720> were

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
close-range buckshot kills that were

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.430 
close-range buckshot kills that were
extremely<00:03:19.530> ineffective<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:22.140> in

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
extremely ineffective so and it in

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.960 
extremely ineffective so and it in
there's<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.010> lot<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.190> some<00:03:23.370> women<00:03:23.670> item<00:03:23.850> using

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
there's a lot of some women item using

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.819 
there's a lot of some women item using
flechette<00:03:24.360> buckshot<00:03:24.900> or<00:03:25.110> slugs<00:03:25.170> there's<00:03:25.739> a

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
flechette buckshot or slugs there's a

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.229 
flechette buckshot or slugs there's a
lot<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:25.980> times<00:03:26.220> where<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.430> could<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.700> right<00:03:27.000> up

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
lot of times where I could be right up

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.720 
lot of times where I could be right up
on<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> dude<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.049> blast<00:03:28.890> him<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.280> chest<00:03:29.549> and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
on a dude and blast him in the chest and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.100 
on a dude and blast him in the chest and
he<00:03:29.850> survives<00:03:30.209> with<00:03:30.420> like<00:03:30.600> twenty-five

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
he survives with like twenty-five

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.140 
he survives with like twenty-five
percent<00:03:31.260> health<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.920> mean<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.610> happens<00:03:33.060> with

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
percent health I mean it happens with

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.430 
percent health I mean it happens with
what<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.510> use<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.959> it<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.230> happens<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.370> um

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
what you use it it just happens and um

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.569 
what you use it it just happens and um
so<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.470> guess<00:03:37.560> there's<00:03:37.890> some<00:03:37.950> inconsistencies

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
so I guess there's some inconsistencies

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.090 
so I guess there's some inconsistencies
with<00:03:38.940> all<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.360> weapons<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.709> has<00:03:40.890> to

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
with all of the weapons but this has to

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.020 
with all of the weapons but this has to
be<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.220> way<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.459> use<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.760> if<00:03:41.850> you've<00:03:41.940> been

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
be the way to use it if you've been

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
be the way to use it if you've been
using<00:03:42.209> buckshot<00:03:42.720> oh<00:03:42.750> you've<00:03:42.959> been<00:03:42.989> using<00:03:43.260> slug

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
using buckshot oh you've been using slug

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.660 
using buckshot oh you've been using slug
and<00:03:43.799> you're<00:03:43.890> just<00:03:43.980> going<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.220> be<00:03:44.310> stubborn<00:03:44.519> and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
and you're just going to be stubborn and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.550 
and you're just going to be stubborn and
be<00:03:44.760> like<00:03:44.880> no<00:03:44.940> slugs<00:03:45.359> better<00:03:45.600> try<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.290> out

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
be like no slugs better try this out

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.770 
be like no slugs better try this out
spend<00:03:47.160> an<00:03:47.280> hour<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.670> using<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.299> understand

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
spend an hour to using it and understand

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.910 
spend an hour to using it and understand
and<00:03:49.019> see<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.260> potential<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.680> this

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
and see the potential that this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.740 
and see the potential that this
attachment<00:03:50.700> has<00:03:50.970> on<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.510> is

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
attachment has on it it really is

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.280 
attachment has on it it really is
noticeable<00:03:52.290> buckshot<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.400> nail<00:03:54.269> slugs<00:03:55.109> is

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
noticeable buckshot is nail slugs is

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.930 
noticeable buckshot is nail slugs is
probably<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.709> second<00:03:56.070> best<00:03:56.160> overall<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.790> one

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
probably the second best overall the one

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.970 
probably the second best overall the one
thing<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.209> slugs<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.959> guess<00:03:58.350> lacks<00:03:58.620> over<00:03:58.859> this

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
thing the slugs I guess lacks over this

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.800 
thing the slugs I guess lacks over this
it's<00:03:59.160> a<00:03:59.250> little<00:03:59.489> bit<00:03:59.579> better<00:03:59.700> with<00:03:59.910> range<00:04:00.180> but

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
it's a little bit better with range but

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.940 
it's a little bit better with range but
again<00:04:01.109> you've<00:04:01.290> got<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> factor<00:04:01.829> and

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
again you've got a factor and

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.080 
again you've got a factor and
suppression<00:04:02.250> which<00:04:02.489> means<00:04:02.760> you're<00:04:02.880> gonna<00:04:02.970> be

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
suppression which means you're gonna be

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.970 
suppression which means you're gonna be
a<00:04:03.120> little<00:04:03.209> bit<00:04:03.420> more<00:04:03.540> accurate<00:04:04.049> it's<00:04:04.230> not<00:04:04.769> as

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
a little bit more accurate it's not as

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.680 
a little bit more accurate it's not as
good<00:04:05.130> as<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.400> used<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.760> be<00:04:05.970> long<00:04:06.209> range<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.570> used

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
good as it used to be long range I used

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.569 
good as it used to be long range I used
to<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.840> like<00:04:06.870> snide<00:04:07.230> people<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.920> metro<00:04:08.400> and

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
to be like snide people on metro and

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.060 
to be like snide people on metro and
shit<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.299> can't<00:04:09.600> really<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.859> much

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
shit you can't really do that so much

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.590 
shit you can't really do that so much
anymore<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.519> mean<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.030> almost<00:04:12.150> always<00:04:12.450> a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
anymore I mean it's almost always a

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.349 
anymore I mean it's almost always a
hitmarker<00:04:12.989> now<00:04:13.320> rather<00:04:13.590> than<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.920> one<00:04:14.100> hit<00:04:14.250> kill

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
hitmarker now rather than a one hit kill

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.360 
hitmarker now rather than a one hit kill
so<00:04:15.359> slugs<00:04:16.079> are<00:04:16.289> not<00:04:16.440> half<00:04:16.650> bad<00:04:16.680> they're<00:04:17.190> pretty

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so slugs are not half bad they're pretty

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.949 
so slugs are not half bad they're pretty
reliable<00:04:17.910> they're<00:04:18.090> not<00:04:18.239> bad<00:04:18.419> at<00:04:18.510> close<00:04:18.690> range

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
reliable they're not bad at close range

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.140 
reliable they're not bad at close range
and<00:04:19.229> even<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> slugs<00:04:19.950> are<00:04:20.190> weaker<00:04:20.609> than<00:04:20.640> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and even the slugs are weaker than the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.570 
and even the slugs are weaker than the
flechette<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.810> buckshot<00:04:22.140> in<00:04:22.590> close<00:04:23.159> quarters
