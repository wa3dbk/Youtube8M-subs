00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.460
 to everyone the demanded and 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.410
 welcome to a compilation of spots 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.090
 of the multiplayer of call of duty 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.760
 ghosts and in this compilation I'm going to 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.440
 teach the best spots for infected 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.750
 to hide in pretty places 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.270
 hidden does not look like two is in the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.250
 collection not the best voucher 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.250
 and I will bring you then this type of videos 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.560
 every time this first in this 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.140
 first spot would be on the whiteout map 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.539
 that what is said like that would be here 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.170
 under the water as we see then 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.609
 we will be on top of this rock if we go 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.559
 a little more down or we go a 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.390
 little further back we could fall and 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.159
 die so I recommend staying longer or 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.629
 except here, here we continue like this 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.519
 say invisible no one knew that 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.800
 we are there the next one is because it would be 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.969
 on the same map in this part what 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.069
 we have to make is a champagne 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.589
 grounds that would be jumping and crouching 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.870
 and in getting in here and so we have 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.609
 in this little spot and well for 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.070
 get deeper we would have to 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.500
 change of weapon we do not have to have that 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.140
 and one we would have to approach 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.030
 here to bend over and walk back or 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.310
 forwards it depends because here you can 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.350
 spin costs a bit to spin but it 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.390
 can and then if we want to get up 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.360
 well, we get a little closer to the edge of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.310
 where the water is already here and here we 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.310
 we can lift we can not stand 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.500
 but if half crouched the next 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.930
 map would be here that sure already 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.640
 you will know it on the map of facts would be 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.530
 climb here on top of the palm tree 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.360
 we have to be careful that we do not 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.340
 throw the throwing knives but it's 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.740
 a good spot the next would also be 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.509
 This one is also well known 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.759
 possibly many you will not know 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.490
 would jump and crouch there and then 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.899
 turn and already put us inside the tube 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.820
 I do not recommend reaching the end 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.979
 because if we do not get caught and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.410
 this spot is very good for infected 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.289
 the next map would be stone from 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.880
 we would have to approach here jump and 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.220
 sprint you do not have to bend over 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.259
 just jump to the beginning and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.390
 sprint towards this corner it's worth 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.820
 then back then we would go through like this 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.550
 say it on the wall and we would be in 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.229
 this kind of wahlberg we could see 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.060
 Well, to the people passing by up here 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.470
 and we can kill it, we're going to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.880
 they could see from below the body and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.470
 obviously on the map but we have 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.330
 silencer but the truth is 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.850
 pretty good for infected as ya 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.040
 I say the following map would be stone 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.800
 heaven and what we would have to do is 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.710
 a quite complicated stress to do 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.720
 it is very difficult this star but it 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.620
 can do if you have a lot of practice 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.660
 and eight of two ways the pair so doing 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.330
 slow in the same place and turn do not 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.220
 a 180 degree turn that is very 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.860
 complicated to do or to do it 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.590
 running that I'll show you now would be 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.560
 come here and without thinking three times 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.790
 I would jump I acquired rotate and good 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.230
 we would have to get up here already 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.390
 directly because we would be stuck 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.460
 here we could kill all the people that 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.530
 will approach us and the last spot then 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.970
 it would be here I do it pretty fast 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.800
 because I know it is well known already 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.500
 will go up in each secondary but you can 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.450
 make fast and sure it will continue 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.070
 working we have always told you that 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.930
 I will continue with the series of states I will bring 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.340
 so the after the patch because there 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.170
 many that have patched but today I have 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.890
 the ones after the patch so I'll go 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.150
 going up during the week 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.130
