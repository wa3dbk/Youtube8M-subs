00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.089
 good the first thing I want but today is to thank youtube to have me 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.570
 when the press gets in touch with them 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.390
 to write about the users and said that we go with the repechage yes I'm going to 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.320
 prepare stuffed aubergines and I'm going to make it with eggplant 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.730
 onion garlic green pepper its meat minced tomato 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.860
 and flour and milk for the bechamel the first thing to do 3 game in 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.180
 two long pieces of kingpin put them in the oven about 200 degrees 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.990
 a quarter of an hour although manipulation of the size of the eggplants I have 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.160
 caught too small to pay less 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.910
 we're going to get a little oil 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.910
 while we are going to chop a couple of cloves of garlic 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.340
 efe 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 and the brakes the fraternity with the hot oil 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940
 add the onion and the pepper 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.920
 and we let them suffer 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.920
 saving the aforementioned 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.710
 p 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:34.170
 while we go through the olive green color flour a pinch of salt 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.040
 ground black pepper 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.740
 and a little bit of nutmeg 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.990
 this we have already done about 8 3 million times 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.000
 but good they would always be incorporated 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.430
 at the last minute 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.910
 once we have cooked a little the flour we are adding milk as we 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.910
 you are thinking 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.730
 about 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.430
 d 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 until we get this tessitura 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.140
 p 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.190
 it was already the first one is also counted 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.840
 we had the minced meat 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840
 from third and that is to do it well 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.009
 Independent 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.019
 p 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.309
 efe 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:37.379
 while making the meat we are going to appeal and prosper the tomatoes 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.249
 dick 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.249
 b 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.599
 and the truth that in this list 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.599
 so let's take out his meat with a spoon 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.059
 We draw the eggplant meat 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:12.459
 and we do not add to the tomato for minced meat that we are attentive and what 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.479
 let's do about 4 5 minutes 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.559
 efe 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.239
 p 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.540
 we put out the fire and add a little celades melker mÃ¼cke 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.679
 dick 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.779
 about 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.179
 d 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:44.409
 and now we can reveal the aubergines and if you put them in a tight container 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.299
 collect them well I will not worry about separating them 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.629
 when the surveys the terms we read the letter of the above I start to gratinar 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.200
 and that is the result 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.870
 this data exceeds 5 to see if he achieved the hug until then
