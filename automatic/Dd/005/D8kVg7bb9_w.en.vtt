our<00:00:00.269> brains<00:00:00.870> wired<00:00:01.410> for<00:00:01.770> polygamy<00:00:02.220> well<00:00:02.669> I

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
our brains wired for polygamy well I

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.420 
our brains wired for polygamy well I
don't<00:00:02.790> know<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:02.970> my<00:00:03.210> brain<00:00:03.600> but<00:00:04.430> I'm

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
don't know about my brain but I'm

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.980 
don't know about my brain but I'm
talking<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.759> my<00:00:05.850> penis<00:00:11.360> we<00:00:12.360> often<00:00:12.509> refer<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
talking on my penis we often refer to

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.709 
talking on my penis we often refer to
monogamy<00:00:13.290> as<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.679> uniquely<00:00:14.219> human<00:00:14.670> trait<00:00:14.880> but

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
monogamy as a uniquely human trait but

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.750 
monogamy as a uniquely human trait but
for<00:00:15.929> about<00:00:16.080> half<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.619> us<00:00:16.800> that's<00:00:17.070> actually<00:00:17.550> not

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
for about half of us that's actually not

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.179 
for about half of us that's actually not
the<00:00:17.820> case<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.080> animal<00:00:19.470> kingdom<00:00:19.650> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the case so in the animal kingdom you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
the case so in the animal kingdom you
know<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> animals<00:00:21.060> either<00:00:21.150> made<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.720> life<00:00:21.930> or

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
know the animals either made for life or

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.370 
know the animals either made for life or
they're<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> little<00:00:22.800> bit<00:00:23.010> more<00:00:23.220> promiscuous

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
they're a little bit more promiscuous

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.019 
they're a little bit more promiscuous
most<00:00:25.380> animals<00:00:25.800> obviously<00:00:26.310> leaning<00:00:26.640> towards

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
most animals obviously leaning towards

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
most animals obviously leaning towards
promiscuity<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.529> greater<00:00:28.800> animal<00:00:29.250> kingdom

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
promiscuity the greater animal kingdom

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
promiscuity the greater animal kingdom
is<00:00:29.760> fairly<00:00:30.000> promiscuous<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:31.050> only<00:00:31.230> thirty

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
is fairly promiscuous with only thirty

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
is fairly promiscuous with only thirty
percent<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.340> primates<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.940> three<00:00:33.329> percent<00:00:33.750> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
percent of primates and three percent of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.170 
percent of primates and three percent of
mammals<00:00:34.320> sticking<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.969> mate<00:00:36.660> still<00:00:37.530> 21

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
mammals sticking to one mate still 21

hey<00:00:39.680> 03<00:00:40.680> /<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.829> with

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
hey 03 / I know they like to get on with

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.400 
hey 03 / I know they like to get on with
multiple<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.120> animals<00:00:45.600> maybe<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.170> can't

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
multiple the animals maybe they can't

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.840 
multiple the animals maybe they can't
tell<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> difference<00:00:46.920> some<00:00:47.309> animals<00:00:47.579> just

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
tell the difference some animals just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.229 
tell the difference some animals just
look<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.059> identical<00:00:48.739> um<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.340> most<00:00:50.730> animals

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
look very identical um so most animals

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.880 
look very identical um so most animals
in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> animal<00:00:51.660> kingdom<00:00:51.989> either<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.860> know

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
in the animal kingdom either you know

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.290 
in the animal kingdom either you know
promiscuous<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.789> stick<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> one

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
promiscuous or they stick to the one

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
promiscuous or they stick to the one
mate<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.719> talked<00:00:54.899> about<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.620> humans

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
mate that we talked about but humans

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.970 
mate that we talked about but humans
actually<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> best<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> both<00:00:57.510> world<00:00:58.230> so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
actually have the best of both world so

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.650 
actually have the best of both world so
you<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.460> talk<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> lot<00:00:59.820> about<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you know we talk a lot about like the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.959 
you know we talk a lot about like the
hook-up<00:01:00.930> culture<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.739> obviously<00:01:02.129> people<00:01:02.399> get

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
hook-up culture and obviously people get

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.640 
hook-up culture and obviously people get
married<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> divorce<00:01:04.199> negative

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
married and then the divorce negative

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.170 
married and then the divorce negative
remarried<00:01:05.250> or<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.610> have<00:01:05.729> kids<00:01:05.939> with

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
remarried or you can have kids with

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.030 
remarried or you can have kids with
whomever<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.710> as

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
whomever you like so it's not really as

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
whomever you like so it's not really as
strict<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> animal<00:01:09.630> kingdom

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
strict as it is in the animal kingdom

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.130 
strict as it is in the animal kingdom
and<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:11.040> actually<00:01:11.420> fall<00:01:12.420> into<00:01:12.869> both

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and we actually fall into both

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
and we actually fall into both
categories<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.040> depends<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.700> gender

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
categories and it depends on your gender

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.730 
categories and it depends on your gender
where<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.479> fall<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> actually

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
where you fall so this is actually

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.109 
where you fall so this is actually
really<00:01:16.950> interesting<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> look

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really interesting so if you take a look

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.719 
really interesting so if you take a look
here<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.659> pie<00:01:18.900> chart<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.950> they

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
here at this pie chart you can see they

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
here at this pie chart you can see they
looked<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> sexual<00:01:21.479> attitudes<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.549> men<00:01:23.549> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
looked at the sexual attitudes of men in

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.420 
looked at the sexual attitudes of men in
both<00:01:23.939> Britain<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> u.s.<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
both Britain and the u.s. and you can

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.149 
both Britain and the u.s. and you can
see<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.990> majority<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.530> men<00:01:28.860> are

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
see that the majority of men are

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.270 
see that the majority of men are
actually<00:01:29.340> prefer<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.600> attitudes<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
actually prefer have attitudes that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
actually prefer have attitudes that
support<00:01:32.280> polygamy<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:32.880> open<00:01:33.509> relationships

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
support polygamy or open relationships

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.130 
support polygamy or open relationships
whereas<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> smaller<00:01:35.250> portion<00:01:35.930> prefer<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> be

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
whereas a smaller portion prefer to be

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.109 
whereas a smaller portion prefer to be
monogamous<00:01:37.439> yeah<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
monogamous yeah and then we look at the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.840 
monogamous yeah and then we look at the
chart<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.630> women<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.920> actually<00:01:41.130> said<00:01:41.549> lean

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
chart for women they actually said lean

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.219 
chart for women they actually said lean
towards<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.890> monogamy<00:01:43.890> versus<00:01:44.280> polygamy<00:01:44.850> or

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
towards a monogamy versus polygamy or

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.330 
towards a monogamy versus polygamy or
open<00:01:46.229> relationships<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.860> talks<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.310> about

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
open relationships we talks a lot about

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
open relationships we talks a lot about
about<00:01:47.790> why<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.259> know

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
about why we think this is you know

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950 
about why we think this is you know
women<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.909> make<00:01:51.570> sure<00:01:51.780> they're

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
women have to you know make sure they're

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.899 
women have to you know make sure they're
young<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:52.979> selective<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
young and they have to be selective and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
young and they have to be selective and
have<00:01:54.240> somebody<00:01:54.479> who<00:01:54.720> stable<00:01:55.079> whereas<00:01:55.290> men

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
have somebody who stable whereas men

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
but this is you know clearly interesting

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.039 
but this is you know clearly interesting
that<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.790> clear<00:02:03.689> divide

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that that there is this clear divide

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.440 
that that there is this clear divide
that's<00:02:04.380> almost<00:02:04.649> fifty<00:02:05.009> percent<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.579> both<00:02:05.880> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that's almost fifty percent on both for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
that's almost fifty percent on both for
both<00:02:06.630> female<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.110> yeah<00:02:07.799> male<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.580> that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
both female and yeah male well in that

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.059 
both female and yeah male well in that
welder<00:02:09.390> well<00:02:09.840> there's

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
welder well there's

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.319 
welder well there's
difference<00:02:10.340> between<00:02:10.399> men<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.789> women<00:02:10.819> it's

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
difference between men and women it's

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.209 
difference between men and women it's
like<00:02:11.689> sort<00:02:11.959> of<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.140> subtle<00:02:12.530> difference<00:02:12.680> like

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.219 
like sort of a subtle difference like

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.000 
like sort of a subtle difference like
it's<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:13.609> it<00:02:14.180> looks<00:02:14.599> like<00:02:14.780> maybe<00:02:15.049> fifty<00:02:15.829> five

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
it's like it looks like maybe fifty five

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.280 
it's like it looks like maybe fifty five
percent<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.609> women<00:02:16.790> prefer<00:02:17.450> monogamy<00:02:18.230> and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
percent of women prefer monogamy and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.589 
percent of women prefer monogamy and
fifty-eight<00:02:18.889> percent<00:02:19.189> of<00:02:19.579> men<00:02:19.819> like<00:02:20.329> that's

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
fifty-eight percent of men like that's

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.929 
fifty-eight percent of men like that's
what<00:02:20.749> it<00:02:20.810> looks<00:02:20.959> like<00:02:21.049> it's<00:02:21.230> not<00:02:21.349> like<00:02:21.939> 7525

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
what it looks like it's not like 7525

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.459 
what it looks like it's not like 7525
sloping<00:02:23.450> back<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.749> forth<00:02:23.959> which<00:02:24.139> is<00:02:24.260> sort<00:02:24.409> of

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
sloping back and forth which is sort of

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.800 
sloping back and forth which is sort of
interesting<00:02:24.620> yeah<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.819> also<00:02:25.849> wonder<00:02:26.329> like

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
interesting yeah and I also wonder like

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.809 
interesting yeah and I also wonder like
if<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.319> were<00:02:27.409> to<00:02:27.500> break<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.769> down<00:02:27.980> by<00:02:28.400> like

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
if you were to break this down by like

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.300 
if you were to break this down by like
age<00:02:29.030> groups<00:02:29.480> maybe<00:02:29.930> by<00:02:30.139> country<00:02:30.709> like<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.129> this

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
age groups maybe by country like is this

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.039 
age groups maybe by country like is this
something<00:02:31.760> that's<00:02:31.790> strictly<00:02:32.239> like<00:02:32.599> genetic

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
something that's strictly like genetic

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.589 
something that's strictly like genetic
so<00:02:33.260> you'd<00:02:33.379> see<00:02:33.590> most<00:02:34.389> similarities<00:02:35.389> between

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
so you'd see most similarities between

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.539 
so you'd see most similarities between
countries<00:02:35.989> there's<00:02:36.889> something<00:02:37.340> where<00:02:37.519> maybe

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
countries there's something where maybe

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.489 
countries there's something where maybe
it's<00:02:37.909> a<00:02:37.969> generational<00:02:38.120> thing<00:02:38.510> where<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.469> know

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:39.499 
it's a generational thing where you know

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.800 
it's a generational thing where you know
maybe<00:02:40.340> Millennials<00:02:40.939> are<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:41.239> well<00:02:41.450> maybe<00:02:41.689> I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
maybe Millennials are like well maybe I

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.030 
maybe Millennials are like well maybe I
can<00:02:41.959> go<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.079> little<00:02:42.230> bit<00:02:42.409> crazy<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:42.919> our

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
can go a little bit crazy but our

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.089 
can go a little bit crazy but our
grandma's<00:02:43.549> like<00:02:43.879> not<00:02:43.909> settling<00:02:44.840> down<00:02:45.019> yeah<00:02:45.829> uh

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
grandma's like not settling down yeah uh

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.429 
grandma's like not settling down yeah uh
one<00:02:46.579> of<00:02:46.669> the<00:02:46.730> authors<00:02:47.030> talked<00:02:47.239> about<00:02:47.450> how<00:02:47.659> kind

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
one of the authors talked about how kind

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.379 
one of the authors talked about how kind
of<00:02:48.500> monogamy<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.069> very<00:02:49.280> new<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.849> our<00:02:49.909> species

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
of monogamy is very new to our species

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.390 
of monogamy is very new to our species
and<00:02:50.870> he<00:02:50.930> goes<00:02:51.079> into<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.530> humans<00:02:51.919> monogamy<00:02:52.340> is

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
and he goes into in humans monogamy is

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.069 
and he goes into in humans monogamy is
relatively<00:02:52.790> new<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.449> scene<00:02:53.480> we're

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
relatively new on the scene we're

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.720 
relatively new on the scene we're
talking<00:02:54.379> hundreds<00:02:54.919> of<00:02:55.010> thousands<00:02:55.400> of<00:02:55.400> years

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
talking hundreds of thousands of years

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.159 
talking hundreds of thousands of years
it's<00:02:55.939> a<00:02:56.030> winning<00:02:56.269> strategy<00:02:56.449> because<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:56.930> an

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
it's a winning strategy because it's an

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.649 
it's a winning strategy because it's an
a<00:02:57.379> so<00:02:57.799> novel<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.790> seems<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.150> work<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.569> the

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
a so novel and it seems to work in the

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.449 
a so novel and it seems to work in the
culture<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.199> we've<00:03:00.319> created<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.159> that's<00:03:01.370> a

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
culture that we've created so that's a

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.679 
culture that we've created so that's a
really<00:03:01.669> interesting<00:03:01.699> thought<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.389> me<00:03:02.510> that

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
really interesting thought to me that

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.899 
really interesting thought to me that
that<00:03:02.870> having<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.919> know<00:03:04.099> getting<00:03:04.310> married<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
that having you know getting married and

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.339 
that having you know getting married and
being<00:03:05.060> with<00:03:05.239> one<00:03:05.480> partner<00:03:05.780> frequent<00:03:06.139> life

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
being with one partner frequent life

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.379 
being with one partner frequent life
it's<00:03:06.590> kind<00:03:06.919> of<00:03:06.949> its<00:03:07.549> know<00:03:07.819> like<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.359> know

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
it's kind of its know like you know

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.780 
it's kind of its know like you know
before<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.230> guess<00:03:09.590> like<00:03:09.799> cavemen<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.549> they

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
before I guess like cavemen like they

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.089 
before I guess like cavemen like they
didn't<00:03:11.389> have<00:03:11.599> that<00:03:11.870> sort<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.409> system<00:03:12.829> you

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
didn't have that sort of system you

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.679 
didn't have that sort of system you
raise<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.340> your<00:03:13.730> family<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.150> like<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.299> village

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
raise it your family is like a village

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.539 
raise it your family is like a village
and<00:03:14.930> stuff<00:03:15.079> like<00:03:15.229> that<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.949> that's<00:03:16.189> that's

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
and stuff like that so that's that's

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.550 
and stuff like that so that's that's
pretty<00:03:16.729> interesting<00:03:17.689> to<00:03:17.959> think<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.409> as

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
pretty interesting to think of that as

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.749 
pretty interesting to think of that as
something<00:03:18.769> new<00:03:19.040> because<00:03:19.159> I<00:03:19.370> think<00:03:19.430> when<00:03:19.699> we

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:19.759 
something new because I think when we

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.429 
something new because I think when we
talk<00:03:19.790> about<00:03:20.000> marriage<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.540> lot<00:03:20.659> of<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.840> time<00:03:21.019> we

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
talk about marriage a lot of the time we

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.629 
talk about marriage a lot of the time we
talking<00:03:21.829> about<00:03:21.859> it<00:03:22.189> being<00:03:22.370> like<00:03:22.609> a

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
talking about it being like a

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.460 
talking about it being like a
traditional<00:03:23.329> thing<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.169> fact<00:03:24.379> that

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
traditional thing and the fact that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.409 
traditional thing and the fact that
we're<00:03:24.709> kind<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.280> made<00:03:25.519> this<00:03:25.669> like<00:03:25.879> bell<00:03:26.120> curve

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
we're kind of made this like bell curve

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.089 
we're kind of made this like bell curve
of<00:03:26.629> like<00:03:26.780> coming<00:03:27.109> back<00:03:27.229> down<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.769> like<00:03:27.919> them

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
of like coming back down to like them

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.199 
of like coming back down to like them
maybe<00:03:28.340> we'll<00:03:28.519> be<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.669> little<00:03:28.819> bit<00:03:29.060> more

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
maybe we'll be a little bit more

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.089 
maybe we'll be a little bit more
polygamous<00:03:29.750> now<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.199> going<00:03:30.680> back<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:31.069> our

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
polygamous now and going back to our

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.069 
polygamous now and going back to our
roots<00:03:31.489> it's<00:03:31.790> very<00:03:31.939> interesting<00:03:32.419> to<00:03:32.569> me<00:03:32.599> yeah

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
roots it's very interesting to me yeah

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.009 
roots it's very interesting to me yeah
although<00:03:33.680> again<00:03:33.949> I<00:03:34.400> think<00:03:34.669> the<00:03:35.239> way<00:03:35.599> that<00:03:35.629> we

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
although again I think the way that we

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.929 
although again I think the way that we
sort<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.439> have<00:03:36.650> become<00:03:37.099> more<00:03:37.280> polygamists<00:03:37.819> or

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
sort of have become more polygamists or

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.399 
sort of have become more polygamists or
that<00:03:38.150> they<00:03:38.269> were<00:03:38.329> in<00:03:38.599> like<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> 70s<00:03:39.290> or

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
that they were in like the 70s or

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.170 
that they were in like the 70s or
whatever<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:40.009> isn't<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:40.699> for<00:03:40.909> the<00:03:40.970> most

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
whatever it isn't really for the most

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.089 
whatever it isn't really for the most
part<00:03:41.540> they've<00:03:41.900> decided<00:03:42.229> oh<00:03:42.590> we're<00:03:42.799> gonna<00:03:42.889> give
