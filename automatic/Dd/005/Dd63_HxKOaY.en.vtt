00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
thing and then the weakness resistance
and<00:01:19.500> retrieved<00:01:19.890> costs<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.340> too<00:01:20.369> moved<00:01:20.610> over

and retrieved costs are too moved over

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.450 
and retrieved costs are too moved over
here<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> holographic<00:01:22.650> pattern<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.280> more

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
here and the holographic pattern is more

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.450 
here and the holographic pattern is more
hot<00:01:23.700> horizontal<00:01:24.450> stripes<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> as<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.280> see

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
hot horizontal stripes so as you can see

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.899 
hot horizontal stripes so as you can see
this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.790> zechariah<00:01:27.000> promo<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.729> then<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
this is zechariah promo and then the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
this is zechariah promo and then the
ultra-rare<00:01:30.509> Zekrom<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.350> basically<00:01:31.710> an<00:01:31.799> all

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
ultra-rare Zekrom is basically an all

ultra-rare Zekrom is basically an all
black<00:01:32.310> card<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.790> believe<00:01:33.030> hope<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.290> that

black card I believe hope I get that
what<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.930> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.470> black<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
what to see this is the first black and

tins<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> hope<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> same<00:01:43.799> card<00:01:44.100> trick

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
tins so I hope it's the same card trick

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.200 
tins so I hope it's the same card trick
I<00:01:44.579> were<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> assume<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.670> once
