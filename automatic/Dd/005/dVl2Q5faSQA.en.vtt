quite<00:00:45.030> high<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.570> often<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.559> need<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
quite high and often so you will need a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
quite high and often so you will need a
full<00:00:47.010> inventory<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.489> food<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.879> some<00:00:48.090> armor<00:00:48.329> if

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
full inventory of food and some armor if

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
full inventory of food and some armor if
you're<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> pure<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.700> you're<00:00:50.789> going

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you're a pure and I think you're going

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.040 
you're a pure and I think you're going
to<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> trouble<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:51.899> there's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to have a bit of trouble because there's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.049 
to have a bit of trouble because there's
not<00:00:52.170> too<00:00:52.500> many<00:00:52.649> safe<00:00:52.980> spots<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.670> thinking

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
not too many safe spots I'm thinking

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
not too many safe spots I'm thinking
maybe<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.719> able<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.989> find<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.350> few<00:00:55.379> safe<00:00:55.710> spots

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
maybe I be able to find a few safe spots

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950 
maybe I be able to find a few safe spots
behind<00:00:56.160> trees<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> logs<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.930> right

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
behind trees in the logs but as of right

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.410 
behind trees in the logs but as of right
now<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.320> couldn't<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.309> any<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
now I couldn't really see any so that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
now I couldn't really see any so that
could<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> bit<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> big<00:01:01.260> bother<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
could be a bit of a big bother if you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.270 
could be a bit of a big bother if you
were<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:02.879> pure<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.500> either<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.799> guys<00:01:04.949> they

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
were or pure but either way guys they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.200 
were or pure but either way guys they
give<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.760> 40<00:01:06.570> Slayer<00:01:06.810> XP<00:01:07.110> per<00:01:07.470> kill<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.210> their

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
give you 40 Slayer XP per kill and their

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.140 
give you 40 Slayer XP per kill and their
weakness<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.810> fire<00:01:10.260> spells<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> you're<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> mage

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
weakness is fire spells so you're a mage

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.789 
weakness is fire spells so you're a mage
and<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.840> actually<00:01:12.960> find<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.409> safe<00:01:13.590> spot

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and you can actually find a safe spot

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.560 
and you can actually find a safe spot
then<00:01:14.010> using<00:01:14.310> fire<00:01:14.490> spells<00:01:14.729> would<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.939> really

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
then using fire spells would be really

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.990 
then using fire spells would be really
advantageous<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:17.340> notable<00:01:17.759> drops

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
