00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.279
 so giraumon good evening that huh you're the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.800
 son of jean paul be so if we talk 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.080
 a few actuaries web pages 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 I wanted to know a little bit if you 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.060
 frequented for example the approved site to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.160
 to do less high level I do not want to say 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.680
 regularly but as soon as we have material 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.180
 to sell months to buy but more 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.920
 for material before 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.410
 I'm going to put an ad maybe 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.590
 already done business on a lot of 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.450
 down pretty much most of the ads from the 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.700
 material we wanted to sell it was 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.320
 sold thanks to will to do what is it 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.170
 you are already sold on business by 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.120
 example 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.710
 there were the plows we had two 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.329
 plows 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.110
 our which were sold on a graph 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.640
 make a 3-axle moving floor grab 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.460
 which was sold also on the beautiful 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.590
 case and then 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.100
 I think of plain tp that we sold 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.770
 also point us selling delay 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.440
 its sales us and quickly customers 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.300
 have come to see they thought about it then i 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.979
 was that's pretty much done 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.530
 quickly and the advantage is that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.899
 start it's at least on any 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.909
 europe business so that's enough 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.110
 known from the point of view for 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.280
 put these ads where is that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.409
 it's good but in practice all that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.320
 it's pretty handy c 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.250
 it makes me moved because 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.360
 at one point I find they 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.710
 would block at the tractors level 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.710
 could not sell our times where jose 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.729
 and then had a system with that there I 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.900
 believe that I had been able to put several 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 ads at the tractors level so 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.630
 it was and dances were good so 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.090
 it's incite to recommend for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.040
 someone who wants yes when we see the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.360
 number of advertisers almost all the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.190
 world is now going through business 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 it's a bit of a big corner of their school 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.390
 quite quite but in our 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.310
 website like for example internet 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.440
 are you frequent and no I 'm going 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.930
 rarely on other websites 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.030
 one I regularly frequent his 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.100
 large tractors passion therefore 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.090
 mainly the forum goes over for the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.560
 photos the news down here recently 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.030
 I have been a lot to put the news 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.520
 compared to beet pickles 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.980
 on the calais sector compared to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.260
 conditions to put pictures etc and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.910
 I'm also going to put our 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.650
 videos about montages of 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 two people who are us 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.340
 montages of the yards for for the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.560
 show to the public 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.610
 so it's a pretty lively site 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.750
 yeah go see there are a lot of work 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.520
 and it's a lot of young people I think 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.980
 that they are going to fise farmers who are going 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.300
 a little on the forums so at least they 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.980
 want the news in your break 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.210
 okay and are you frequent 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.560
