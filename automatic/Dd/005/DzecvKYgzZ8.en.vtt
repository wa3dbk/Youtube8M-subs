also dissipate heat and just by taking

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.039 
also dissipate heat and just by taking
it<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> box<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.720> touch<00:01:51.930> it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it out of the box and just to touch it

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
it out of the box and just to touch it
without<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> even<00:01:52.680> being<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.670> even<00:01:54.180> feels

without it even being on it even feels

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.230 
without it even being on it even feels
cool<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> touch<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.399> let's<00:01:56.399> look<00:01:56.549> at<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
cool to the touch now let's look at the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.770 
cool to the touch now let's look at the
back<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.810> plug<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:59.540> since<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
back when you plug it in since it's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
back when you plug it in since it's
powered<00:02:01.110> by<00:02:01.140> USB<00:02:01.439> port<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.490> lose<00:02:02.820> one

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
powered by USB port you will lose one

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.569 
powered by USB port you will lose one
USB<00:02:03.450> port<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:04.049> your<00:02:04.079> computer<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:05.310> however

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
USB port on your computer but however

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.940 
USB port on your computer but however
after<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.390> plug<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
after you plug it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.100 
after you plug it
you<00:02:07.189> still<00:02:07.460> have<00:02:07.640> one<00:02:07.880> left<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:08.750> you're

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
you still have one left so you're

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.009 
you still have one left so you're
actually<00:02:09.319> not<00:02:09.679> out<00:02:09.920> anything<00:02:10.540> right<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.780> is

the fan in the bank you can tell by this

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.130 
the fan in the bank you can tell by this
that<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.099> large<00:02:31.430> fan<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.510> is

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
that it is large fan it is

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.640 
that it is large fan it is
220<00:02:33.830> millimeters<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.959> simply<00:02:36.440> allows

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
220 millimeters and that simply allows

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.270 
220 millimeters and that simply allows
it<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:36.980> be<00:02:37.220> even<00:02:37.459> more<00:02:38.230> silent<00:02:39.230> than<00:02:39.319> you<00:02:40.160> know

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
it to be even more silent than you know

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.830 
it to be even more silent than you know
most<00:02:40.489> small<00:02:40.730> fans<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.180> come<00:02:41.299> in<00:02:41.450> coolers

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
because it doesn't have to spin so fast

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.890 
because it doesn't have to spin so fast
to<00:02:43.910> produce<00:02:44.060> here<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.840> larger<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:47.660> right

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900
