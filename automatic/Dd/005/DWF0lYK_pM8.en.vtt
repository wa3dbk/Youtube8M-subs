on<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> columns<00:01:33.119> after<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
on you know in the columns after that so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.010 
on you know in the columns after that so
the<00:01:35.130> Baron<00:01:35.430> still<00:01:35.640> sucked<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.210> initially<00:01:36.840> eat

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the Baron still sucked I initially eat

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.200 
the Baron still sucked I initially eat
over<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> Baron<00:01:37.680> Walter<00:01:38.040> goal<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.490> him<00:01:38.610> borna

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
over the Baron Walter goal to him borna

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
over the Baron Walter goal to him borna
will<00:01:39.390> tell<00:01:39.570> him<00:01:39.689> he<00:01:40.320> eat<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> same<00:01:41.040> time<00:01:41.250> so

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
will tell him he eat at the same time so

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.670 
will tell him he eat at the same time so
he<00:01:42.180> gets<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> move<00:01:42.600> anyway<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:42.990> i<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.500> bit

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
he gets to move anyway so i got this bit

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160 
he gets to move anyway so i got this bit
regardless<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.329> 2k<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.020> then

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
regardless and it was at 2k and then

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.300 
regardless and it was at 2k and then
suffered<00:01:46.530> some<00:01:46.619> recent<00:01:46.890> damage<00:01:47.009> kept

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
suffered some recent damage kept

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.770 
suffered some recent damage kept
happening<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.729> band<00:01:47.909> that's<00:01:48.360> why<00:01:48.420> meters

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
happening the band that's why meters

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
happening the band that's why meters
like<00:01:48.960> didn't<00:01:49.259> smile<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.100> said<00:01:50.280> no

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
like didn't smile it because we said no

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
like didn't smile it because we said no
more<00:01:50.490> damage<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.000> Baron<00:01:51.299> hit<00:01:51.420> center<00:01:51.689> instead

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
more damage and Baron hit center instead

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.510 
more damage and Baron hit center instead
but<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.799> AoE<00:01:53.100> damage<00:01:53.130> will

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
but we have like AoE damage will

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
but we have like AoE damage will
probably<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.060> hit<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.450> accident<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
probably like hit it on accident and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.870 
probably like hit it on accident and
then<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.470> got<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> parents<00:01:55.979> telling<00:01:56.219> us<00:01:56.310> but

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
then they got the parents telling us but

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310 
then they got the parents telling us but
since<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.090> happened<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.659> can't<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
since that happened you can't like it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.450 
since that happened you can't like it
sucks<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> figure<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.369> what

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
sucks but you have to figure out what

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.100 
sucks but you have to figure out what
you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.759> next<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.450> had<00:02:00.570> Baron<00:02:00.840> buff<00:02:00.960> we

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you can do next they had Baron buff we

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.179 
you can do next they had Baron buff we
had<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> little<00:02:01.469> bit<00:02:01.560> careful<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
had to be a little bit careful for the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.340 
had to be a little bit careful for the
next<00:02:02.340> three<00:02:02.490> minutes<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.540> isn't<00:02:03.930> enough

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
next three minutes but that isn't enough

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.469 
next three minutes but that isn't enough
of<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.860> deterrent<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.430> us<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
of a deterrent for us like not have a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.499 
of a deterrent for us like not have a
focus<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> game<00:02:07.910> do<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
focus on the game do you think that you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.680 
focus on the game do you think that you
guys<00:02:09.539> are<00:02:09.959> playing<00:02:10.679> very<00:02:11.520> differently<00:02:12.450> than

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
guys are playing very differently than

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
guys are playing very differently than
you<00:02:12.780> did<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> couple<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.319> weeks<00:02:13.440> ago

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you did a couple of weeks ago

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650 
you did a couple of weeks ago

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
katowice because I mean there you guys

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.930 
katowice because I mean there you guys
went<00:02:15.870> out<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.080> early<00:02:16.410> TSM<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:17.730> then<00:02:17.850> you

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
went out so early TSM one but then you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.910 
went out so early TSM one but then you
just<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.240> TSM<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:19.110> they<00:02:19.260> playing<00:02:19.530> differently

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
just be TSM are they playing differently

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.230 
just be TSM are they playing differently
what<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.430> do<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.550> think<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.970> skill<00:02:21.210> or

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
what what do you think is the skill or

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.670 
what what do you think is the skill or
how<00:02:21.750> did<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.960> would<00:02:22.140> end<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.380> working<00:02:22.500> out

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
how did this would end up working out

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.160 
how did this would end up working out
well<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:24.150> game<00:02:24.330> didn't<00:02:24.660> matter<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.900> much<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
well the game didn't matter that much to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.110 
well the game didn't matter that much to
TSM<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> mattered<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> lot<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.670> us<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:27.000> not

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
TSM but I mattered a lot to us I'm not

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.520 
TSM but I mattered a lot to us I'm not
saying<00:02:27.300> they<00:02:27.450> didn't<00:02:27.690> try<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:27.990> hard<00:02:28.110> as<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.350> can

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
saying they didn't try as hard as I can

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.530 
saying they didn't try as hard as I can
but<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.520> we<00:02:29.700> definitely<00:02:30.030> try<00:02:30.180> super<00:02:30.510> hard

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
but we that we definitely try super hard

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.240 
but we that we definitely try super hard
to<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.990> I'm<00:02:31.050> sure<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.320> did<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.620> well<00:02:31.740> but

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
to and I'm sure they did as well but

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.440 
to and I'm sure they did as well but
it's<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.490> like<00:02:32.610> when<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.090> game<00:02:33.270> doesn't

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it's just like when the game doesn't

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.910 
it's just like when the game doesn't
mean<00:02:33.660> anything<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.140> put<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.410> other<00:02:34.590> team<00:02:34.740> it

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
mean anything you put the other team it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.290 
mean anything you put the other team it
means<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.160> lot<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.340> them<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.210> have

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
means a lot to them you just have

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.580 
means a lot to them you just have
different<00:02:36.450> mentalities<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
different mentalities going to and you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.770 
different mentalities going to and you
can't<00:02:37.800> really<00:02:37.920> help<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.190> but<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.270> think<00:02:39.660> we

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
can't really help that but I think we

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300 
can't really help that but I think we
have<00:02:39.960> been<00:02:40.110> playing<00:02:40.200> better<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:41.160> because

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
have been playing better just because

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.010 
have been playing better just because
our<00:02:41.910> screams<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.510> been<00:02:42.600> going<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.870> lot<00:02:42.960> better

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
our screams have been going a lot better

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.960 
our screams have been going a lot better
and<00:02:43.440> our<00:02:43.560> team<00:02:43.860> environment<00:02:44.130> is<00:02:44.400> much<00:02:44.730> better

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and our team environment is much better

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.580 
and our team environment is much better
as<00:02:45.150> well<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.050> with<00:02:46.170> those<00:02:46.290> two<00:02:46.470> things

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
as well so with those two things

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.580 
as well so with those two things
combined<00:02:46.980> we've<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.340> been<00:02:47.460> playing<00:02:47.850> better

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
combined we've just been playing better

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.440 
combined we've just been playing better
how<00:02:49.590> how<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.160> team<00:02:50.550> environment<00:02:50.820> changed

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
how how is team environment changed

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.970 
how how is team environment changed
since<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:51.990> last<00:02:52.020> talked<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.590> remember

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
since we last talked because I remember

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.640 
since we last talked because I remember

shock and change like that relative

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.360 
shock and change like that relative
other<00:03:09.750> people<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.680> makes<00:03:10.800> people<00:03:10.950> grumpy

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370

about once again that's not an excuse

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.600 
about once again that's not an excuse
for<00:03:13.320> our<00:03:13.530> loss<00:03:13.710> because<00:03:13.920> other<00:03:14.070> teams<00:03:14.310> had<00:03:14.520> to

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
for our loss because other teams had to

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.880 
for our loss because other teams had to
go<00:03:14.730> through<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:14.970> as<00:03:15.210> well<00:03:15.240> but<00:03:16.050> it's<00:03:16.710> just

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
go through that as well but it's just

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.870 
go through that as well but it's just
the<00:03:16.920> environment<00:03:17.160> there<00:03:17.520> was<00:03:17.700> worse<00:03:17.850> than

the environment there was worse than

theology<00:03:53.190> pretty<00:03:53.400> handily<00:03:53.760> right<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.410> don't

theology pretty handily right I don't

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.690 
theology pretty handily right I don't
think<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.620> really<00:03:55.650> works<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.280> way<00:03:56.459> because

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
think it really works that way because

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.790 
think it really works that way because
teams<00:03:57.060> play<00:03:57.330> differently<00:03:57.690> different<00:03:58.110> teams

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
have different priorities on things so

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.150 
have different priorities on things so
just<00:04:00.930> because<00:04:01.020> we<00:04:01.170> beat<00:04:01.380> em<00:04:01.739> doesn't<00:04:01.950> mean<00:04:02.040> old

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
just because we beat em doesn't mean old

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.340 
just because we beat em doesn't mean old
pc<00:04:02.459> LG<00:04:02.700> because<00:04:03.090> i'm<00:04:03.180> sure<00:04:03.209> if<00:04:03.390> we<00:04:03.450> play<00:04:03.600> TSM

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350

again like a pacified i'm sure they

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.220

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
as well so it just really depends like

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.180 
as well so it just really depends like

prepare for a match

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.190 
prepare for a match
in<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:27.180> case<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.600> who<00:04:27.780> knows<00:04:27.930> what's<00:04:28.110> gonna

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
planned for like are you looking forward

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.290 
planned for like are you looking forward
to<00:05:49.470> the<00:05:49.560> break<00:05:49.650> at<00:05:50.070> all<00:05:50.130> because<00:05:50.790> I<00:05:51.030> know<00:05:51.090> it's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
to the break at all because I know it's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.090 
to the break at all because I know it's
been<00:05:51.420> kind<00:05:51.630> of<00:05:51.660> a<00:05:51.750> tough<00:05:51.930> split<00:05:52.740> for<00:05:52.890> you<00:05:52.950> guys

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
been kind of a tough split for you guys

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.860 
been kind of a tough split for you guys
and<00:05:53.370> then<00:05:53.490> you<00:05:53.700> obviously<00:05:54.060> have<00:05:54.360> playoffs<00:05:54.660> but

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
and then you obviously have playoffs but

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.630 
and then you obviously have playoffs but
are<00:05:55.440> you<00:05:55.590> sort<00:05:55.950> of<00:05:56.010> looking<00:05:56.190> forward<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.520> the

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
are you sort of looking forward to the

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.040 
are you sort of looking forward to the
fact<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:56.910> things<00:05:57.270> are<00:05:57.450> kind<00:05:57.690> of<00:05:57.720> wrapping<00:05:57.870> up

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
fact that things are kind of wrapping up

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.150 
fact that things are kind of wrapping up
a<00:05:58.140> little<00:05:58.320> bit<00:05:58.410> well<00:05:59.870> if<00:06:00.870> we<00:06:01.440> don't<00:06:01.530> get<00:06:01.710> second

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
a little bit well if we don't get second

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.590 
a little bit well if we don't get second
then<00:06:02.370> there's<00:06:02.550> no<00:06:02.730> break<00:06:02.910> right<00:06:03.180> now<00:06:03.210> so<00:06:03.480> the

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
then there's no break right now so the

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.960 
then there's no break right now so the
teams<00:06:03.840> i<00:06:03.990> have<00:06:04.170> a<00:06:04.200> week<00:06:04.470> or<00:06:04.680> like<00:06:04.950> the<00:06:05.430> bye<00:06:05.940> week

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
teams i have a week or like the bye week

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.850 
teams i have a week or like the bye week
they<00:06:06.690> can<00:06:06.840> technically<00:06:07.230> have<00:06:07.350> a<00:06:07.380> bakery<00:06:07.710> but<00:06:07.800> i

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
they can technically have a bakery but i

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.710 
they can technically have a bakery but i
don't<00:06:08.010> think<00:06:08.130> it'll<00:06:08.220> take<00:06:08.280> anyway<00:06:08.790> as<00:06:09.390> far<00:06:09.450> as

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
don't think it'll take anyway as far as

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.480 
don't think it'll take anyway as far as
after<00:06:10.170> the<00:06:10.320> season<00:06:10.620> ends<00:06:10.800> I<00:06:11.040> think<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.340> break

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
after the season ends I think the break

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.580 
after the season ends I think the break
is<00:06:11.640> relatively<00:06:12.060> short<00:06:12.330> like<00:06:12.540> a<00:06:12.630> month<00:06:12.930> to<00:06:13.410> two

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
is relatively short like a month to two

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.530 
is relatively short like a month to two
tops<00:06:13.920> so<00:06:14.550> I<00:06:14.580> don't<00:06:14.850> think<00:06:15.150> I'll<00:06:15.300> have<00:06:15.330> that

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
tops so I don't think I'll have that

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.110 
tops so I don't think I'll have that
much<00:06:15.720> time<00:06:15.870> off<00:06:15.930> anyway<00:06:16.380> so<00:06:16.860> I'm<00:06:17.730> also<00:06:17.940> in

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
much time off anyway so I'm also in

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.340 
much time off anyway so I'm also in
North<00:06:18.300> Carroll<00:06:18.510> so<00:06:18.600> I<00:06:18.630> don't<00:06:18.840> have<00:06:18.960> friends<00:06:19.110> up

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
North Carroll so I don't have friends up

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.720 
North Carroll so I don't have friends up
