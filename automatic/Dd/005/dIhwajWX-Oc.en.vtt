00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
like the design of this car alloy wheels

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.309 
like the design of this car alloy wheels
and<00:02:06.039> get<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.340> this<00:02:06.460> side<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.780> see<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.080> Tridion

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
and get on this side you see the Tridion

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.640

safety cell wrapping around the car if

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.740 
safety cell wrapping around the car if
you<00:02:11.800> go<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.040> youtube<00:02:12.580> there<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.420> actually

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
you go on youtube there is actually

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.900 
you go on youtube there is actually
video<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.349> one<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> these<00:02:14.830> cars<00:02:15.190> being<00:02:15.580> smashed

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
video of one of these cars being smashed

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.479 
video of one of these cars being smashed
into<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.300> concrete<00:02:16.510> barrier<00:02:16.780> at<00:02:17.470> 70<00:02:18.160> miles<00:02:18.310> an

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
into a concrete barrier at 70 miles an

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.580 
into a concrete barrier at 70 miles an
hour<00:02:18.640> they<00:02:18.880> did<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.150> remote<00:02:20.080> control<00:02:20.440> there

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
hour they did it remote control there

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.430 
hour they did it remote control there
was<00:02:20.709> no<00:02:20.830> driver<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.780> basically<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.900> car<00:02:23.140> was

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
was no driver and basically the car was

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.690 
was no driver and basically the car was
crunched<00:02:24.209> from<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.330> very<00:02:25.569> front<00:02:26.400> great<00:02:27.400> back

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
crunched from the very front great back

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.990 
crunched from the very front great back
to<00:02:28.060> here<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.069> I'll<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.250> open<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.580> door<00:02:30.760> you

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
to here and I'll just open the door you

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
to here and I'll just open the door you
can<00:02:31.180> see<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.660> driver's<00:02:32.230> legs<00:02:32.500> would<00:02:32.799> be

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
can see that the driver's legs would be

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.940 
can see that the driver's legs would be
in<00:02:33.100> there<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.420> driver's<00:02:34.810> legs<00:02:35.049> might<00:02:35.920> be

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
in there so the driver's legs might be

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.199 
in there so the driver's legs might be
crushed<00:02:36.310> unless<00:02:36.549> you<00:02:36.700> get<00:02:36.819> them<00:02:36.940> out<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
crushed unless you get them out of the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.720 
crushed unless you get them out of the
way<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.110> basically<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:39.010> doors<00:02:39.250> would<00:02:39.459> still

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
way but basically the doors would still

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.720 
way but basically the doors would still
open<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:41.200> Tridion<00:02:41.560> safety<00:02:41.620> cell<00:02:42.310> still

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
open and the Tridion safety cell still

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.780 
open and the Tridion safety cell still
kept<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.180> car<00:02:43.390> quite<00:02:44.290> safe<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:44.920> safe<00:02:45.580> little

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
kept the car quite safe so safe little

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.880 
kept the car quite safe so safe little
car<00:02:46.060> even<00:02:46.360> though<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.720> small<00:02:46.840> let's<00:02:47.709> take<00:02:47.860> a

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
car even though it's small let's take a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.440 
car even though it's small let's take a
look<00:02:48.099> at<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> room<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.640> key<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.299> a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
look at the room is key there is a

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
let's just point back take a look we're

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.289 
let's just point back take a look we're
going<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.260> open<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.590> roof<00:03:26.769> entirely<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.970> fold

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
going to open the roof entirely you fold

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.660 
going to open the roof entirely you fold
it<00:03:28.480> right<00:03:28.690> down<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.440> can<00:03:29.590> see<00:03:29.859> that<00:03:30.549> it

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
it right down so you can see that it

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.949 
it right down so you can see that it
folds<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.030> down<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.359> top<00:03:31.540> of<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.720> luggage

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
folds it down on top of the luggage

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.490 
folds it down on top of the luggage
garment<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.590> then<00:03:32.769> what<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:34.350> what<00:03:35.350> this

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
garment and then what this is what this

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.420 
garment and then what this is what this
is<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.730> roll<00:03:37.150> bar<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:38.739> add<00:03:38.859> safety<00:03:39.340> and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
is is the roll bar to add safety and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.490 
is is the roll bar to add safety and
stability<00:03:39.579> to<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.209> car<00:03:40.450> so<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.109> can<00:03:41.170> see<00:03:41.350> that

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
stability to the car so you can see that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.520 
stability to the car so you can see that
it's<00:03:41.650> pretty<00:03:41.799> open<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.870> one<00:03:43.959> folds<00:03:44.380> down

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
it's pretty open that one folds down
