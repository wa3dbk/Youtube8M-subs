00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.860
 I 'm running here today if the headmistress 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
 the creative mixer brand and performed a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.509
 incredible exposure to the company's 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.609
 your mother during all these years of fashion 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.609
 Is this collection a very 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.430
 special to me that she speaks in the heart 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.500
 and I started from the beginning diving 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 deep inside, wanting to look for 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.650
 thing to know the roots of fashion and I saw 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.329
 from childhood I had fascination with 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.510
 my mother's profits in the clothes that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.360
 she dressed to see fashion magazines and 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.879
 when I saw that there was a hunt around 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.050
 Rose and is a person who love color 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.940
 pink was this collection summer 2015 will be 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 dedicated to it then the collection in the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.910
 Truth is speaking of the summer collection 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 in now 2014 2015 and she is all 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.870
 inspired in this aesthetic, then I 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.300
 I took the heart first then 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.280
 some later we reedited and what 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.470
 stayed from here we can find in the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 shop in a contemporary way like this. 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.520
 plate that was a crockery that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.520
 to see from my great-grandmother's farm 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.000
 A lot of people talked about the exhibition and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.950
 even a Brazilian fashion rescue, right? 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.890
 Is the brand able to make this rescue? 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.979
 with a personality like your mother 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.560
 and our history does not stop telling us 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.750
 fashion story this is one thing that 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.860
 It was in his head was also 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.080
 because I think we have to have 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.270
 national fashion pride we have to 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.490
 to know that it has roots must know that 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.429
 there were always elegant women who 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.280
 cultivated this side of femininity of 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.520
 chic that they appreciated and that 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.360
 I found people in Brazil even people 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.360
 that could dictate fashion 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.520
