00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.269 

one<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.820> things<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.449> see<00:00:03.750> as<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.440> reconnect

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
one of the things I see as I reconnect

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.550 
one of the things I see as I reconnect
these<00:00:05.400> electrical<00:00:06.060> connectors<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.839> just<00:00:07.440> a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
these electrical connectors is just a

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.440 
these electrical connectors is just a
little<00:00:07.830> bit<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.099> corrosion<00:00:08.490> starting<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.300> them

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
little bit of corrosion starting on them

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.440 
little bit of corrosion starting on them
and<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.800> before<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.340> put<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> connections<00:00:12.269> back

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and so before I put the connections back

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.360 
and so before I put the connections back
together<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.170> put<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> little<00:00:13.559> electrical

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
together and I put a little electrical

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.510 
together and I put a little electrical
dielectric<00:00:15.299> grease<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.780> them<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.520> hopefully

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
dielectric grease on them and hopefully

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.460 
dielectric grease on them and hopefully
that<00:00:17.880> should<00:00:18.000> keep<00:00:18.240> them<00:00:18.390> nice<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.630> fresh<00:00:21.470> and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that should keep them nice and fresh and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.050 
that should keep them nice and fresh and
we<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> car<00:00:23.100> bird<00:00:23.279> carburetors

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
we have the car bird carburetors

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.179 
we have the car bird carburetors
reinstalled<00:00:24.830> all<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.369> hoses<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.119> hooked<00:00:27.330> up

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
reinstalled all the hoses are hooked up

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.009 
reinstalled all the hoses are hooked up
wirings<00:00:29.189> hooked<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
wirings hooked up and now it's time to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.319 
wirings hooked up and now it's time to
actually<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.800> start<00:00:32.250> installing<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.030> hyper

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
actually and start installing the hyper

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.889 
actually and start installing the hyper
charger<00:00:33.930> itself<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:36.000> will<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.329> able<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> go

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
charger itself so we will be able to go

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
charger itself so we will be able to go
back<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> instructions<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.370> came<00:00:38.670> with

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
back to the instructions that came with

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.850 
back to the instructions that came with
the<00:00:38.969> hyper<00:00:39.120> charger<00:00:42.230> okay<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> next

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the hyper charger okay then the next

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.600 
the hyper charger okay then the next
thing<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:45.590> comes<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.800> steel<00:00:47.250> piece

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
thing we do is comes with a steel piece

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.900 
thing we do is comes with a steel piece
here<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.420> little<00:00:49.129> piece<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.730> one

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
here this little piece here you take one

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.830 
here this little piece here you take one
of<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.210> original<00:00:51.449> clamps<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> bend<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
of your original clamps and you bend the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.210 
of your original clamps and you bend the
metal<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> hangs<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.410> that

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.560 

and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> take<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.760> clamp<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> your

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and then you take your clamp and your

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.690 
and then you take your clamp and your
air<00:01:06.750> duct<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.990> put<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.320> clamp<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:13.700> like

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
air duct and just put your clamp on like

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:24.500 
air duct and just put your clamp on like
that<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> looks<00:01:16.159> looks<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840 

now<00:01:25.510> when<00:01:25.780> reading<00:01:26.380> online<00:01:26.619> some<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.520> tips

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
now when reading online some of the tips

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.130 
now when reading online some of the tips
one<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.869> tips<00:01:29.140> somebody<00:01:29.590> had<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.130> um<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
one of the tips somebody had is um this

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.030 
one of the tips somebody had is um this
little<00:01:33.450> vacuum<00:01:34.450> line<00:01:36.119> nipple<00:01:37.119> here<00:01:37.830> will<00:01:38.830> go

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
little vacuum line nipple here will go

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.130 
little vacuum line nipple here will go
to<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.369> butterflies<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.300> hyper<00:01:40.509> charger

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
to the butterflies of the hyper charger

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.530 
to the butterflies of the hyper charger
and<00:01:41.380> they<00:01:42.369> don't<00:01:42.550> have<00:01:42.729> you<00:01:42.850> putting<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.330> on

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
and they don't have you putting this on

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.230 
and they don't have you putting this on
until<00:01:44.170> after<00:01:44.710> you<00:01:44.800> have<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.369> air<00:01:45.909> tube

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
until after you have the air tube

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.109 
until after you have the air tube
mounted<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.070> online<00:01:48.070> they<00:01:48.280> said<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.670> much

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
mounted and online they said it's much

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.359 
mounted and online they said it's much
easier<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:49.840> hook<00:01:50.259> your<00:01:50.500> vacuum<00:01:50.890> line<00:01:51.130> up

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
easier to hook your vacuum line up

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.100 
easier to hook your vacuum line up
before<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.799> mount<00:01:54.310> your<00:01:54.520> air<00:01:55.240> tube<00:01:55.540> here<00:01:55.869> and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
before you mount your air tube here and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.340 
before you mount your air tube here and
so<00:01:57.100> that's<00:01:57.280> what<00:01:57.460> I'm<00:01:57.550> going<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.759> do<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.350> then

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
so that's what I'm going to do and then

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.300 
so that's what I'm going to do and then
while<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.009> have<00:02:00.369> this<00:02:00.550> off<00:02:00.820> here<00:02:01.179> this<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
while I have this off here this is the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.300 
while I have this off here this is the
carburetor<00:02:03.310> vent<00:02:03.820> line<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.770> will<00:02:05.979> plug

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
carburetor vent line and this will plug

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.059 
carburetor vent line and this will plug
into<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.880> back<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.810> hyper<00:02:08.259> charger<00:02:08.860> also

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
into the back of the hyper charger also

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.580 
into the back of the hyper charger also
there<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> screw<00:02:10.539> in<00:02:10.720> fitting<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.410> back

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
there is a screw in fitting and the back

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.229 
there is a screw in fitting and the back
of<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.800> hyper<00:02:11.980> charger<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.700> holes<00:02:12.970> will

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
of the hyper charger and this holes will

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.110 
of the hyper charger and this holes will
plug<00:02:13.510> right<00:02:13.540> into<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.819> I'll<00:02:15.970> go

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
plug right into that and so I'll go

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.559 
plug right into that and so I'll go
ahead<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.650> remove<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.830> cap<00:02:18.130> here<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.640> put

the vacuum line on and the next step I'm

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.770 
the vacuum line on and the next step I'm
going<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.880> I'm<00:02:25.030> going<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.180> replace<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
going to do is I'm going to replace the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.229 
going to do is I'm going to replace the
air<00:02:26.500> tubes<00:02:26.830> from<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.250> carburetor<00:02:27.580> going<00:02:28.120> up

mounting the hyper charger this is going

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.490 
mounting the hyper charger this is going
to<00:04:09.010> be<00:04:09.130> my<00:04:09.280> first<00:04:09.490> real<00:04:09.820> big<00:04:10.030> criticism<00:04:10.750> of

to be my first real big criticism of

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.020 
to be my first real big criticism of
this<00:04:11.800> whole<00:04:12.040> thing<00:04:12.310> otherwise<00:04:12.610> it's<00:04:12.880> been

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
this whole thing otherwise it's been

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.600 
this whole thing otherwise it's been
pretty<00:04:13.270> nice<00:04:13.590> what<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.710> have<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:14.980> do<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.430> you

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
pretty nice what you have to do is you

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.070 
pretty nice what you have to do is you
have<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.910> try<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.180> get<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:17.520> ear<00:04:18.520> tube<00:04:20.070> inside

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
have to try to get this ear tube inside

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.200 
have to try to get this ear tube inside
the<00:04:23.080> hyper<00:04:23.290> charger<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:23.980> you<00:04:24.010> have<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.340> try<00:04:25.150> to

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
the hyper charger so you have to try to

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.410 
the hyper charger so you have to try to
bend<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.690> air<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.890> rubber<00:04:27.130> in<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.850> start

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
bend the air the rubber in and start

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.720 
bend the air the rubber in and start
working<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.930> around<00:04:29.260> there<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:30.490> no<00:04:30.670> small

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
working it around there that is no small

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.330 
working it around there that is no small
feat<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:32.230> then<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.530> bolt<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.920> on<00:04:33.040> there's

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
feat and then to bolt it on there's

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.640 
feat and then to bolt it on there's
three<00:04:33.670> bolts<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.690> order<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.110> get<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.410> bolt

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
three bolts and in order to get the bolt

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.710 
three bolts and in order to get the bolt
and<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.950> have<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.220> pry<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.640> rubber<00:04:37.030> back<00:04:37.360> and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
and you have to pry the rubber back and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.360 
and you have to pry the rubber back and
then<00:04:40.080> try<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.140> get<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.350> bolt<00:04:41.680> in<00:04:41.920> there<00:04:42.130> and

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
then try to get the bolt in there and

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.940 
then try to get the bolt in there and
put<00:04:43.270> another<00:04:43.360> in<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.750> other<00:04:43.900> end<00:04:44.230> or<00:04:44.770> the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
put another in the other end or the

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.090 
put another in the other end or the
other<00:04:45.100> side<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:47.230> is<00:04:47.410> no<00:04:47.590> easy<00:04:47.800> feat

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
other side and that is no easy feat

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.450 
other side and that is no easy feat
either<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.810> we'll<00:04:50.740> finish<00:04:50.950> this<00:04:51.220> up<00:04:51.430> by

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
either so we'll finish this up by

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.050 
either so we'll finish this up by
putting<00:04:51.940> three<00:04:52.720> bolts<00:04:53.110> in<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.910> bolting<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.030> to

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
putting three bolts in and bolting it to

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.040 
putting three bolts in and bolting it to
the<00:04:55.680> mounting<00:04:56.680> frame<00:04:56.950> here<00:04:57.570> other<00:04:58.570> than<00:04:58.690> that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
the mounting frame here other than that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.560 
the mounting frame here other than that
everything<00:04:59.950> else<00:05:00.100> has<00:05:00.280> been<00:05:00.400> fairly<00:05:00.970> decent

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
everything else has been fairly decent

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.690 
everything else has been fairly decent
but<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:02.140> is<00:05:02.470> that<00:05:02.920> I<00:05:03.010> go<00:05:03.250> back<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.640> the

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
but this is that I go back to the

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.450 
but this is that I go back to the
drawing<00:05:03.940> board<00:05:04.300> on<00:05:04.420> this<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.660> think<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:08.430> now<00:05:09.430> I

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
drawing board on this I think and now I

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.130 
drawing board on this I think and now I
will<00:05:10.980> screw<00:05:11.980> this<00:05:12.160> vacuum<00:05:12.460> fitting<00:05:12.940> on<00:05:13.140> the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
will screw this vacuum fitting on the

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.080 
will screw this vacuum fitting on the
back<00:05:14.320> of<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.560> hyper<00:05:14.710> charger<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.940> will

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
back of the hyper charger and I will

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.830 
back of the hyper charger and I will
hook<00:05:16.240> up<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.950> float<00:05:17.950> Bowl<00:05:18.160> vent<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.760> that<00:05:18.970> and

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
hook up the float Bowl vent to that and

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.750 
hook up the float Bowl vent to that and
I'll<00:05:20.380> take<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.740> vacuum<00:05:20.980> line<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.580> I'll<00:05:21.670> hook

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
I'll take the vacuum line and I'll hook

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.240 
I'll take the vacuum line and I'll hook
it<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.600> front<00:05:22.900> of<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.500> hyper<00:05:23.800> charger

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
it to the front of the hyper charger

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.150 
it to the front of the hyper charger
butterflies<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:28.720> now<00:05:28.960> we'll<00:05:29.140> put<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.350> cover

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
butterflies and now we'll put the cover

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.820 
butterflies and now we'll put the cover
on<00:05:30.310> they<00:05:31.150> call<00:05:31.360> that<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.660> trapdoor<00:05:32.140> I<00:05:32.170> guess

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.500 

and<00:05:35.830> now<00:05:36.130> with<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.400> cover<00:05:36.610> on<00:05:36.880> it'll<00:05:37.180> be<00:05:37.210> time

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
and now with the cover on it'll be time

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.260 
and now with the cover on it'll be time
to<00:05:37.780> put<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.320> gas<00:05:38.530> tank<00:05:38.920> and<00:05:39.100> seat<00:05:39.340> back<00:05:39.550> on<00:05:42.270> and

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
gauge wires here when you put your tank

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.440 
gauge wires here when you put your tank
on

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
on

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.010 
on
and<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:50.990> put<00:05:51.170> some<00:05:52.360> electric<00:05:53.360> grease<00:05:53.600> in<00:05:53.840> the

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
and to put some electric grease in the

and to put some electric grease in the
connection<00:05:54.530> here<00:05:54.890> too<00:05:55.100> before<00:05:55.280> I<00:05:55.490> put<00:05:55.670> it

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
connection here too before I put it

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.340 
connection here too before I put it
together<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.940> then<00:05:59.180> we'll<00:05:59.330> come<00:05:59.540> back<00:05:59.750> to<00:06:00.230> the

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
back up to the tank it's pretty

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.470 
back up to the tank it's pretty
important<00:06:09.070> then<00:06:10.070> it<00:06:10.190> will<00:06:10.280> be<00:06:10.400> time<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.850> put
