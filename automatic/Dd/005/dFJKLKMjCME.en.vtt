at<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> kick<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> good<00:00:26.760> kick<00:00:27.119> sound

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
at the kick now for a good kick sound

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.540 
at the kick now for a good kick sound
you<00:00:27.900> usually<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.619> two<00:00:28.890> different<00:00:29.070> samples

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
you usually want two different samples

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.930 
you usually want two different samples
one<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.660> supplies<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.679> lower<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.759> lower

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
one that supplies the lower the lower

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.060 
one that supplies the lower the lower
end<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> kick<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.899> another<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
end of the kick and another one that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
end of the kick and another one that
gives<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> kick<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.790> sparkle<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.420> pop<00:00:36.780> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
gives to kick some sparkle and pop and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.160 
gives to kick some sparkle and pop and
in<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.670> case<00:00:38.730> right<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.750> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
in my case right here we have this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
in my case right here we have this
sample<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> lows<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:42.629> one

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
sample here for the lows and this one

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.910 
sample here for the lows and this one
right<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> sparkle<00:00:45.680> now<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
right here for the sparkle now as you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
right here for the sparkle now as you
can<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.129> i<00:00:47.309> routed<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:49.020> kick<00:00:49.410> sample

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
can see i routed the first kick sample

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680 
can see i routed the first kick sample
which<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> lows<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.270> master

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
which is for the lows out the master

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.350 
which is for the lows out the master
output<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.309> into<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.489> equalizer<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:53.969> here

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
output and into an equalizer right here

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.630 
output and into an equalizer right here
and<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.170> noticed<00:00:55.530> i'm<00:00:55.710> only<00:00:56.010> using<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and as you noticed i'm only using the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.729 
and as you noticed i'm only using the
left<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.270> input<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.260> mono<00:00:58.469> signal

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
left out and input so it's a mono signal

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.520 
left out and input so it's a mono signal
because<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.520> usually<00:01:00.239> don't<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.140> stereo

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
because you usually don't want a stereo

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.119 
because you usually don't want a stereo
signal<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.219> low<00:01:03.059> end<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.799> routed

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
signal on your low end so it's routed

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.620 
signal on your low end so it's routed
into<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> equalizer<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.420> into

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
into this equalizer and then right into

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.539 
into this equalizer and then right into
the<00:01:06.810> mixer<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.170> combines<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> two<00:01:07.950> mix<00:01:08.310> add

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the mixer that combines the two mix add

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.510 
the mixer that combines the two mix add
the<00:01:08.610> two<00:01:08.970> kicks<00:01:09.360> samples<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.530> as

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the two kicks samples down here and as

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
the two kicks samples down here and as
you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> sequel<00:01:12.390> Iser<00:01:12.540> I've

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can see on the sequel Iser I've

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
you can see on the sequel Iser I've
boosted<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.500> lows<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.950> crazy<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.729> so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
boosted the lows like crazy so have so

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.210 
boosted the lows like crazy so have so
we<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.630> FET<00:01:16.080> basis<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> kick

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
we have a really FET basis for the kick

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
we have a really FET basis for the kick
sound<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.700> also<00:01:18.390> turned<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> low-cut

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
sound I also turned on the low-cut

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.170 
sound I also turned on the low-cut
because<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.220> many<00:01:20.430> lows<00:01:20.640> you're<00:01:20.970> bound

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because with so many lows you're bound

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.969 
because with so many lows you're bound
to<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.450> some<00:01:21.479> frequencies<00:01:22.140> under<00:01:22.350> 30<00:01:22.710> Hertz

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to have some frequencies under 30 Hertz

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.469 
to have some frequencies under 30 Hertz
which<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:23.909> create<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.600> unwanted<00:01:25.290> Rumble

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
which will create some unwanted Rumble

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.789 
which will create some unwanted Rumble
so<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.840> hear<00:01:28.049> when<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> turn<00:01:28.500> off<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so as you can hear when I turn off the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.510

this<00:01:29.729> kick<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> actually<00:01:30.720> quite<00:01:30.990> weak<00:01:32.299> but

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this kick is actually quite weak but

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.749 
this kick is actually quite weak but
with<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.810> crazy<00:01:34.470> boost<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:34.979> lows<00:01:35.220> which

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
with the crazy boost on the lows which

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.880 
with the crazy boost on the lows which
is<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> way<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> parameter<00:01:37.740> one

offer I also cut off the highs on this
lower<00:01:48.960> key<00:01:49.380> example<00:01:49.799> because<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.850> said<00:01:50.909> the

lower key example because as I said the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
lower key example because as I said the
second<00:01:51.659> key<00:01:51.780> example<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.470> layer<00:01:52.649> 2<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
second key example which is layer 2 the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.069 
second key example which is layer 2 the
first<00:01:53.100> will<00:01:53.880> contribute<00:01:54.329> these<00:01:54.750> higher

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
first will contribute these higher

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.240 
first will contribute these higher
sparkly<00:01:55.770> sounds<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.040> cut

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
sparkly sounds and and this way if I cut

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
sparkly sounds and and this way if I cut
them<00:01:59.399> off<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> lower<00:01:59.969> sample<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.810> won't

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
them off the lower sample they won't

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.160 
them off the lower sample they won't
interfere<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.469> each<00:02:01.619> other<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
interfere with each other so on the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.929 
interfere with each other so on the
second<00:02:04.560> kick<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:05.159> are<00:02:05.340> routed<00:02:05.640> out<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
second kick which are routed out the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
second kick which are routed out the
output<00:02:06.270> 3<00:02:06.540> &amp;<00:02:06.719> 4<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.530> down<00:02:07.680> here

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
output 3 &amp; 4 as you can see down here

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.510 
output 3 &amp; 4 as you can see down here
into<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.899> second<00:02:10.560> equalizer<00:02:10.890> down<00:02:11.129> here<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
into the second equalizer down here and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.140 
into the second equalizer down here and
then<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> compressor<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.629> back<00:02:12.930> in

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
then into the compressor and back in

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.170 
then into the compressor and back in
the<00:02:13.209> mixer<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.860> one<00:02:15.129> is<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> sparkle

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the mixer this one is for the sparkle

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.720 
the mixer this one is for the sparkle
and<00:02:16.239> pop<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.019> what<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.230> did<00:02:17.409> was<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.860> scooped<00:02:18.610> out

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and pop so what I did was I scooped out

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.550 
and pop so what I did was I scooped out
the<00:02:18.790> lows<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.599> kick<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.230> does<00:02:20.379> not

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the lows of this kick so it does not

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.280 
the lows of this kick so it does not
interfere<00:02:20.890> with<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.670> boom<00:02:22.599> down<00:02:22.959> here<00:02:23.170> with

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
interfere with the boom down here with

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.880 
interfere with the boom down here with
the<00:02:23.439> low<00:02:23.590> kick<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:25.629> added<00:02:25.840> some<00:02:26.319> high

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the low kick and I added some high

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.630 
the low kick and I added some high
frequencies<00:02:27.489> up<00:02:27.730> at<00:02:28.769> 8.2<00:02:29.769> kilohertz<00:02:30.189> with<00:02:30.609> a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
frequencies up at 8.2 kilohertz with a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.020 
frequencies up at 8.2 kilohertz with a
gain<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:30.849> 8.6<00:02:31.510> DB<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.109> Q<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.409> 1.3<00:02:32.890> which<00:02:33.760> just

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
gain of 8.6 DB and a Q of 1.3 which just

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.890 
gain of 8.6 DB and a Q of 1.3 which just
gives<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.329> some<00:02:34.540> more<00:02:34.750> sparkly<00:02:35.500> tone<00:02:36.370> elytis

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.300 

then<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.109> kick<00:02:41.319> runs<00:02:41.530> into<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.799> compressor

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
then this kick runs into a compressor

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.580 
then this kick runs into a compressor
which<00:02:42.519> tightens<00:02:42.939> it<00:02:43.150> up<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.540> supplies<00:02:44.349> the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
which tightens it up and supplies the

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.289 
which tightens it up and supplies the
necessary<00:02:44.620> pop<00:02:45.310> for<00:02:45.579> a<00:02:45.609> good<00:02:45.849> kick<00:02:46.060> zone<00:02:48.299> this

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
necessary pop for a good kick zone this

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.869 
necessary pop for a good kick zone this
compressor<00:02:49.720> has<00:02:50.109> some<00:02:50.799> usual<00:02:51.129> settings<00:02:51.730> so

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
compressor has some usual settings so

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.849 
compressor has some usual settings so
the<00:02:52.000> threshold<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.450> at<00:02:52.599> minus<00:02:52.959> 20<00:02:53.260> ITB<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
the threshold is at minus 20 ITB the

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.660 
the threshold is at minus 20 ITB the
ratio<00:02:54.190> up<00:02:54.370> at<00:02:54.579> 10<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.239> 1<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.989> attack<00:02:56.290> up<00:02:56.530> at<00:02:56.799> 70

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
ratio up at 10 to 1 the attack up at 70

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.250 
ratio up at 10 to 1 the attack up at 70
milliseconds<00:02:58.209> which<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.599> pretty<00:02:58.780> important

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
milliseconds which is pretty important

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.129 
milliseconds which is pretty important
so<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.829> first<00:03:00.519> transient<00:03:01.030> has<00:03:01.299> 70

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
so the first transient has 70

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.050 
so the first transient has 70
milliseconds<00:03:02.680> where<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.489> can<00:03:03.639> play<00:03:03.790> without

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
milliseconds where it can play without

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.030 
milliseconds where it can play without
being<00:03:04.420> compressed<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.500> creates<00:03:05.859> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
being compressed and that creates the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.069 
being compressed and that creates the
pop<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:07.150> brought<00:03:07.389> the<00:03:07.480> release<00:03:07.750> all<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
pop and I brought the release all the

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.809 
pop and I brought the release all the
way<00:03:08.109> down<00:03:08.349> so<00:03:08.680> if<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.010> kick<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.370> played<00:03:09.609> in

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
way down so if the kick is played in

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.979 
way down so if the kick is played in
quick<00:03:10.030> succession<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.780> will<00:03:10.930> still<00:03:11.200> pop<00:03:11.730> and

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
quick succession it will still pop and

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.440 
quick succession it will still pop and
then<00:03:13.989> this<00:03:14.230> runs<00:03:14.590> into<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.489> mixer<00:03:16.000> again<00:03:16.239> to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
then this runs into the mixer again to

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.110 
then this runs into the mixer again to
be<00:03:16.540> mixed<00:03:16.840> with<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.260> lower<00:03:17.709> kick<00:03:18.010> if<00:03:18.250> we<00:03:18.970> now

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
be mixed with the lower kick if we now

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.240 
be mixed with the lower kick if we now
linked<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.720> bow<00:03:19.989> if<00:03:20.410> we<00:03:20.709> now<00:03:20.829> linked<00:03:21.069> both

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
linked the bow if we now linked both

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.520 
linked the bow if we now linked both
kicks<00:03:21.609> together<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.329> comb<00:03:22.510> we<00:03:23.139> can<00:03:23.349> play

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
kicks together on the comb we can play

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.140 
kicks together on the comb we can play
this<00:03:23.709> kick<00:03:23.980> sample<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.639> sounds<00:03:24.940> pretty

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
this kick sample and it sounds pretty

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.879 
this kick sample and it sounds pretty
awesome<00:03:25.540> I'd<00:03:25.900> say<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:29.440> has<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.739> necessary

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
awesome I'd say it has the necessary

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.300 
awesome I'd say it has the necessary
pump<00:03:30.699> and<00:03:31.000> BOM<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.599> lows<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.109> still<00:03:33.069> has

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
pump and BOM and the lows and still has

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.159 
pump and BOM and the lows and still has
a<00:03:33.579> sparkle<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.209> pop<00:03:34.419> in<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.690> ice<00:03:34.870> and

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
a sparkle and a pop in the ice and

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.199 
a sparkle and a pop in the ice and
that's<00:03:35.590> due<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.040> layering<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.819> two

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
that's due to the layering of the two

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.420 
that's due to the layering of the two
different<00:03:37.599> examples<00:03:40.169> now<00:03:41.169> let's<00:03:41.799> move<00:03:41.949> on<00:03:42.159> to

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
different examples now let's move on to

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.360 
different examples now let's move on to
the<00:03:42.909> snare<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:47.079> snares<00:03:47.319> are<00:03:47.560> normally<00:03:48.340> a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
the snare the snares are normally a

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.800 
the snare the snares are normally a
little<00:03:48.639> more<00:03:48.729> complicated<00:03:49.389> than<00:03:49.479> the<00:03:49.629> kick

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
little more complicated than the kick

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.719 
little more complicated than the kick
because<00:03:50.139> you<00:03:50.470> want<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.739> really<00:03:50.919> nice<00:03:51.159> popping

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729 
because you want a really nice popping

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.750 
because you want a really nice popping
sound<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.650> don't<00:03:53.829> want<00:03:53.979> it<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.190> hurt<00:03:54.400> in

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
sound but you don't want it to hurt in

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.849 
sound but you don't want it to hurt in
your<00:03:54.819> ears<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:56.139> still<00:03:56.379> want<00:03:56.560> some<00:03:56.709> highs

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
your ears and you still want some highs

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.099 
your ears and you still want some highs
up<00:03:57.069> in<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.280> place<00:03:57.489> as<00:03:57.699> well<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.840> let<00:03:58.989> me

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
up in the place as well so let me

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.349 
up in the place as well so let me
quickly<00:03:59.590> go<00:03:59.919> over<00:03:59.949> what<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.519> did<00:04:00.609> for<00:04:01.209> this

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
quickly go over what I did for this

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.860 
quickly go over what I did for this
snare<00:04:02.669> as<00:04:03.669> you<00:04:03.909> can<00:04:04.060> see<00:04:04.209> we<00:04:04.359> have<00:04:04.569> two

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
snare as you can see we have two

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.740 
snare as you can see we have two
different<00:04:05.109> drum<00:04:05.799> sounds<00:04:06.220> as<00:04:06.879> well<00:04:06.940> just<00:04:07.599> like

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
different drum sounds as well just like

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.530 
different drum sounds as well just like
with<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> kick<00:04:08.169> and<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.549> first<00:04:09.549> one<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:10.060> wanted

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
with the kick and the first one I wanted

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.020 
with the kick and the first one I wanted
to<00:04:10.659> be<00:04:10.750> really<00:04:11.049> airy<00:04:11.349> and<00:04:11.709> have<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.549> focus<00:04:12.940> on

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
to be really airy and have a focus on

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.279 
to be really airy and have a focus on
the<00:04:13.150> high<00:04:13.299> end<00:04:13.440> as<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:15.790> can<00:04:15.940> hear<00:04:16.180> so<00:04:17.139> what<00:04:17.260> I

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
the high end as you can hear so what I

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.080 
the high end as you can hear so what I
did<00:04:17.470> was<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.769> took<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:18.639> sample<00:04:19.060> right

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
did was I took the this sample right

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.300 
did was I took the this sample right
here<00:04:19.479> which<00:04:19.900> without<00:04:20.380> processing<00:04:20.650> sounds

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
here which without processing sounds

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.970 
here which without processing sounds
like<00:04:21.489> this

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.180 

so<00:04:25.980> it's<00:04:26.130> quite<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.430> weak<00:04:26.670> sample<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:28.530> routed<00:04:28.950> it

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
so it's quite a weak sample I routed it

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.820 
so it's quite a weak sample I routed it
out<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.520> master<00:04:29.940> output<00:04:30.330> into<00:04:31.140> this

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
out the master output into this

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.680 
out the master output into this
equalizer<00:04:32.370> right<00:04:32.580> here<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:33.270> into<00:04:33.450> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
equalizer right here and then into the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.270 
equalizer right here and then into the
mixer<00:04:34.020> where<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.380> gets<00:04:34.590> mixed<00:04:34.800> with<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.100> other

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
mixer where it gets mixed with the other

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.150 
mixer where it gets mixed with the other
snare<00:04:35.700> sound<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:37.560> scooped<00:04:37.920> out<00:04:38.100> the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
snare sound and I scooped out the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.920 
snare sound and I scooped out the
frequencies<00:04:38.760> around<00:04:38.880> 400<00:04:39.450> Hertz<00:04:39.600> because

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
frequencies around 400 Hertz because

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.110 
frequencies around 400 Hertz because
that's<00:04:40.380> just<00:04:40.650> where<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.070> wooden<00:04:41.520> kind<00:04:41.970> of

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
that's just where the wooden kind of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.210 
that's just where the wooden kind of
unwanted<00:04:42.660> frequencies<00:04:42.960> are<00:04:43.500> on<00:04:43.740> usnea

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
unwanted frequencies are on usnea

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.310 
unwanted frequencies are on usnea
usually<00:04:46.160> in<00:04:47.210> this<00:04:48.210> oh<00:04:48.390> wait<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.960> have<00:04:49.140> it<00:04:49.170> done

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
usually in this oh wait I have it done

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.320 
usually in this oh wait I have it done
by<00:04:49.440> pests<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:52.460> well<00:04:53.460> in<00:04:53.670> this<00:04:53.820> example<00:04:54.150> you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
by pests so well in this example you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.860 
by pests so well in this example you
can't<00:04:54.570> really<00:04:54.810> hear<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.200> but<00:04:56.480> usually<00:04:57.480> with

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
can't really hear it but usually with

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.420 
can't really hear it but usually with
the<00:04:57.990> snare<00:04:58.260> there<00:04:58.500> can<00:04:58.800> be<00:04:58.830> some<00:04:59.190> unwanted

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
the snare there can be some unwanted

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.970 
the snare there can be some unwanted
frequencies<00:04:59.700> at<00:05:00.180> about<00:05:00.360> 400<00:05:00.870> Hertz<00:05:01.050> which

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
frequencies at about 400 Hertz which

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.640 
frequencies at about 400 Hertz which
just<00:05:02.910> weaken<00:05:03.420> the<00:05:03.540> sound<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.900> all<00:05:04.080> if<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.470> run

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
just weaken the sound of all if you run

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.320 
just weaken the sound of all if you run
it<00:05:04.770> into<00:05:04.920> a<00:05:05.010> compressor<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:05.850> I've<00:05:06.060> just

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
it into a compressor so I've just

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.620 
it into a compressor so I've just
scooped<00:05:06.720> them<00:05:06.840> out<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.970> then<00:05:08.970> boosted<00:05:09.450> some

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
scooped them out and then boosted some

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.510 
scooped them out and then boosted some
highs<00:05:09.810> right<00:05:10.110> here<00:05:10.380> because<00:05:11.010> I<00:05:11.130> wanted<00:05:11.400> this

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
highs right here because I wanted this

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.970 
highs right here because I wanted this
first<00:05:11.760> sample<00:05:12.720> this<00:05:12.930> first<00:05:13.230> snare<00:05:13.530> sound<00:05:13.860> to

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
first sample this first snare sound to

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.680 
first sample this first snare sound to
be<00:05:14.070> really<00:05:14.430> really<00:05:14.700> Airy<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.240> kind<00:05:15.600> of

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
be really really Airy and kind of

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.870 
be really really Airy and kind of
supplies<00:05:16.560> some<00:05:16.770> high-end<00:05:17.190> frequencies<00:05:17.670> to

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
supplies some high-end frequencies to

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.740 
supplies some high-end frequencies to
this<00:05:18.000> sound<00:05:19.460> then<00:05:20.460> we<00:05:20.640> have<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:21.030> second<00:05:21.570> snare

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
this sound then we have the second snare

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.340 
this sound then we have the second snare
sound<00:05:22.910> which<00:05:23.910> as<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.240> can<00:05:24.390> hear<00:05:24.570> supplies<00:05:24.930> the

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
sound which as you can hear supplies the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.210 
sound which as you can hear supplies the
lower<00:05:25.590> pop<00:05:26.040> of<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:27.000> snare<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:27.840> it's<00:05:28.770> routed<00:05:29.010> out

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
lower pop of a snare and it's routed out

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.760 
lower pop of a snare and it's routed out
the<00:05:29.400> three<00:05:29.910> and<00:05:30.060> four<00:05:30.240> outputs<00:05:30.660> right<00:05:31.440> into

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
the three and four outputs right into

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.590 
the three and four outputs right into
the<00:05:31.950> second<00:05:32.310> equalizer<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:32.970> then<00:05:33.210> into<00:05:33.480> this

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
the second equalizer and then into this

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.990 
the second equalizer and then into this
mixer<00:05:33.930> down<00:05:34.050> here<00:05:34.290> and<00:05:34.560> as<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.490> can<00:05:35.520> see<00:05:35.669> I've

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
mixer down here and as you can see I've

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.420 
mixer down here and as you can see I've
boosted<00:05:36.690> some<00:05:37.080> frequencies<00:05:37.530> at<00:05:37.680> about<00:05:37.890> 200

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
boosted some frequencies at about 200

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.360 
boosted some frequencies at about 200
Hertz<00:05:38.640> which<00:05:39.180> is<00:05:39.210> where<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:39.870> pop<00:05:40.080> of<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.380> usual

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
Hertz which is where the pop of a usual

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.740 
Hertz which is where the pop of a usual
snare<00:05:41.700> sits<00:05:42.570> with<00:05:43.350> a<00:05:43.380> gain<00:05:43.590> of<00:05:43.620> 10<00:05:43.950> DB<00:05:44.280> and

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
snare sits with a gain of 10 DB and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.240 
snare sits with a gain of 10 DB and
parameter<00:05:46.130> parametric<00:05:47.130> cue<00:05:47.400> of<00:05:47.640> 2.0<00:05:48.330> and<00:05:49.250> that

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
parameter parametric cue of 2.0 and that

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.950 
parameter parametric cue of 2.0 and that
just<00:05:50.490> gives<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:50.790> this<00:05:50.970> nice<00:05:51.270> kind<00:05:51.540> of<00:05:51.630> dull

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
just gives it this nice kind of dull

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.230 
just gives it this nice kind of dull
sound<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:52.830> then<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.280> scooped<00:05:53.669> out<00:05:53.790> all<00:05:54.060> the

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
sound and then I scooped out all the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.770 
sound and then I scooped out all the
highs

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
highs

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.870 
highs
because<00:05:55.260> like<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.890> said<00:05:56.040> I<00:05:56.160> focused<00:05:56.640> on<00:05:56.730> the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
because like I said I focused on the

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.280 
because like I said I focused on the
Airy<00:05:57.060> highs<00:05:57.419> with<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:57.990> first<00:05:58.230> snare<00:05:58.560> sample

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290

now on on their own these two snare
sounds<00:06:03.540> sound<00:06:03.780> pretty<00:06:04.020> weak<00:06:04.320> and<00:06:04.530> they<00:06:04.950> don't

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
sounds sound pretty weak and they don't

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.540 
sounds sound pretty weak and they don't
offer<00:06:05.370> that<00:06:05.520> much<00:06:06.980> but<00:06:07.980> when<00:06:08.100> you<00:06:08.190> mix<00:06:08.340> them

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
offer that much but when you mix them

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.350 
offer that much but when you mix them
together<00:06:10.610> they<00:06:11.610> start<00:06:11.910> to<00:06:11.970> sound<00:06:12.240> pretty

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
together they start to sound pretty

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.290 
together they start to sound pretty
awesome<00:06:12.840> and<00:06:13.230> what<00:06:14.040> I<00:06:14.070> did<00:06:14.280> then<00:06:14.430> was<00:06:14.640> just

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
awesome and what I did then was just

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.180 
awesome and what I did then was just
chucking<00:06:15.720> a<00:06:15.930> rear<00:06:16.230> up<00:06:16.380> under<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.770> mixer

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
chucking a rear up under this mixer

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.520 
chucking a rear up under this mixer
which<00:06:17.520> autorads<00:06:18.030> up<00:06:18.210> as<00:06:18.390> a<00:06:18.450> send<00:06:18.990> effect<00:06:19.080> and

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
which autorads up as a send effect and

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.190 
which autorads up as a send effect and
then<00:06:20.130> I<00:06:20.160> just<00:06:20.520> brought<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.390> aux<00:06:21.570> up<00:06:21.810> a<00:06:21.870> bit<00:06:22.020> on

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
then I just brought the aux up a bit on

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.280 
then I just brought the aux up a bit on
the<00:06:22.560> highest<00:06:23.460> nail<00:06:23.669> with<00:06:23.970> less<00:06:24.240> pop<00:06:24.540> so<00:06:25.169> we

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
the highest nail with less pop so we

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.110 
the highest nail with less pop so we
have<00:06:25.440> some<00:06:25.710> nice<00:06:25.890> little<00:06:25.919> reverb<00:06:26.669> in<00:06:26.910> the<00:06:27.090> back

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
have some nice little reverb in the back

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.700 
have some nice little reverb in the back
then<00:06:30.120> I<00:06:30.150> routed<00:06:30.390> this<00:06:30.720> whole<00:06:30.900> signal<00:06:31.260> into<00:06:31.680> a

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
then I routed this whole signal into a

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.430 
then I routed this whole signal into a
tape<00:06:32.040> distortion<00:06:32.220> unit<00:06:32.669> and<00:06:33.030> a<00:06:33.300> compressor<00:06:33.780> to

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
tape distortion unit and a compressor to

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.300 
tape distortion unit and a compressor to
make<00:06:34.800> it<00:06:34.979> pop<00:06:35.190> even<00:06:35.370> more<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:37.680> compressor<00:06:38.130> has

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
make it pop even more the compressor has

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.570 
make it pop even more the compressor has
the

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.360 
the
usual<00:06:38.909> settings<00:06:39.330> a<00:06:39.720> threshold<00:06:40.439> at<00:06:40.620> minus<00:06:40.949> 17

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
usual settings a threshold at minus 17

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.670 
usual settings a threshold at minus 17
DB<00:06:41.580> ratio<00:06:42.330> at<00:06:42.539> seven<00:06:42.900> point<00:06:43.050> three<00:06:43.169> two<00:06:43.500> one

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
DB ratio at seven point three two one

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.710 
DB ratio at seven point three two one
and<00:06:43.949> the<00:06:44.250> attack<00:06:44.550> up<00:06:44.729> at<00:06:45.060> seventy-seven

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
and the attack up at seventy-seven

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.510 
and the attack up at seventy-seven
milliseconds<00:06:46.259> so<00:06:46.740> we<00:06:46.830> have<00:06:46.919> a<00:06:46.949> nice<00:06:47.099> popping

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
milliseconds so we have a nice popping

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.369 
milliseconds so we have a nice popping
sound<00:06:47.759> and<00:06:47.939> the<00:06:48.240> release<00:06:48.509> down<00:06:48.719> at<00:06:48.960> fifty

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:49.379 
sound and the release down at fifty

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:51.939 
sound and the release down at fifty
milliseconds

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
milliseconds

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.990 
milliseconds
now<00:06:52.949> that's<00:06:53.250> it

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
now that's it

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.050 
now that's it
