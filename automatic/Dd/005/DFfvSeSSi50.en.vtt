00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone here hoffe what and what 

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:07.259
 such how are you expecting that very well and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.339
 nothing here we have been without time without 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.619
 without uploading a gameplay and well 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.209
 I have brought you this because it is a little 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.280
 bad throat or a little bit 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.920
 still a little bit with catarrh and well I'm 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.230
 pretty jodidillo but good we're going to 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.740
 try to make a nice comment without 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.450
 good thing you hear me regurgitate 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.860
 there throat because the truth is that 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.650
 I keep something jodidillo and I'm bitten 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.540
 little to comment but good as 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.140
 you can see attack that on the way is 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 one that in gameplay is extreme 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 ends which is what this is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.989
 it's good we're betting that in this 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.530
 run of 25 casualties without dying is it 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.899
 got with suffering and playing the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.880
 very tactical tactical even skimming the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.770
 I'm going to have a good 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.500
 small I will comment while 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.850
 while you watch the streak while you see the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 I just spotted doing right now 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 and well I will go comment and while 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.550
 while watching watching gameplay I guess that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.440
 edit so you see 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.120
 since it is extreme and you can not 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.700
 value very well on what is the map 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.410
 and you can not value seeing everything with 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 clarity not what they are killing and what 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.460
 No, but I hope that Sep 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.479
 value and good has already taken me more than 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.610
 in the glasses he was recording 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.860
 lately he has not recorded but he has taken me 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.950
 a few yes and good will be 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.990
 recorded and I can have it and nothing at the end 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.700
 that value it and if not extreme 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.619
 and it costs a lot 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 and good to say what I have not 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.940
 because you are seeing the advantage is that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.729
 now I'm wearing eights in a row without killing and 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.979
 good time came and bayern with 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.000
 extended charger and handle you know 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.890
 that garlic or valleys come with 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.869
 silenced already series is one of the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.360
 weapons that already come with integrated things 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.910
 like some Franks that are already coming 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.009
 with silencer I think a rifle 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.060
 assault I think it's the last I think it's 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.979
 the goal I think you already have already taken as 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
 hunter or is already hunted 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.289
 integrated moving faster and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.610
 good I carry lethal of a lethal no 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.350
 He came no secondary did not take 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.959
 No tactics I do not need in this 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.040
 I do not need it, although it's good 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.189
 take it later 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.989
 and unsheathed after sprinting 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.430
 prestidigitaciÃ³n hunter indispensable 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.109
 I in this game made you a hunter to 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.239
 everything as faster I feel more 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.909
 comfortable and I feel that the enemies do not 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.799
 they give so many indispensable hunter bullets 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.560
 and I shoot a lot and I like it more 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.709
 shoot a lot so it 's imperative 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.609
 take it and then took the locator 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.909
 that is the issue that when what is 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.560
 He took the sleeping the I took him when 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.750
 they shoot me that does not move me do not know 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.879
 move so much the look for me is almost 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.069
 important because the jonay and when you 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.889
 shoot you are going a lot especially to 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.200
 half long distances as they are good 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.379
 he took it not and then pack the streak the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.760
 specialist I take deadly silence 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.090
 amplifier that is and comes from the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.790
 Boot that with low reserves that are 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.189
 who listen better to the steps and then 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.599
 took in trying to please not what 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.849
 it's been holding man all 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.090
 gusts and then I have drawn fast 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.410
 with the specialist bonus 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.370
 and I carry the thing that the gusts and kill more 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.950
 I do not know what you killed yourself more and well 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.629
 It is a everything that I carry and it has worked 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.550
 pretty well I think it 's a principal 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.849
 have is a specialist what they are worth 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.690
 the streaks and hit harder and 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.030
 good 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.800
 for pleasure I feel good with this 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.660
 class the univalle goes very well the truth 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.570
 I do not have to put the red dot or anything 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.880
 so and well then as you can see 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.040
 the game I'm always moving around 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.430
 the peripheral this map did not advance by the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.860
 middle of the map and the maps all almost 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.660
 all but not to say all except the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.220
 strike are that it's a pretty map 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.810
 we like all the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.090
 players of every last one that is more 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.970
 little one with more nooks there is no 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.790
 clear area in the center and good we 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.400
 what is this call of duty all maps 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.380
 They are very large and have a very 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.180
 limited what is in the center very 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.710
 limited to hide for so much is 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.120
 get into the center of norm happens is 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.549
 almost suicide because it's going to come 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.590
 bullets everywhere and like in this 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.230
 game the range of life is very very very 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.330
 small you kill two bullets it is 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.920
 pretty complicated do not get good 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.420
 streaks because there is always one that 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.100
 kill there is always one that will see you 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.190
 there is always one that you loose a shot 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.660
 and we'll give as you can see here and 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.760
 I was a little worried I did not know 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.889
 how many were playing extreme and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.349
 aside I had not looked 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.419
 and nothing knew that they were coming because 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.090
 had a reactive radar so nothing 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.419
 I had to wait for the yes you can 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.419
 rub a little to campear is fashionable 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.460
 but well I think that and I feel that if 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.180
 wants to take out very long runs in this 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.590
 game can not go crazy is 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.689
 technically impossible to remove the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.729
 departures with this and double attention 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.009
 short of pinchitos and with him he will click and 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.080
 It came to me like a motherfucker and a streak that 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.610
 He took the loose and already because I was 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.409
 blinded and I did not know where they were from 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.289
 coming and I bent down well had I 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:17.110
 seen since you already know the theory that 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.469
 after taking death you come and you 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.379
 then kill the hand of modern warfare 3 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.060
 which then back here as you can see 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.560
 when I took you out that is very similar to 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.870
 modern warfare 3 changes the color of the 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.750
 map is orange remains for 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.870
 the whole game and well then at the end 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.150
 out then humiliate salt the enemy's no 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.249
 leaving all inactive what is the 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.350
 radars and everything from the enemy of charges 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:43.960
 all the helicopters all 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.270
 and good is very good very well in this 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.390
 map specifically does not come out the save as 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.700
 when you take the package but for 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.250
 example on other maps like like the 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.590
 the futuristic factory that looks like 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.580
 the white environments 2 well in that in 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:04.120
 that in that room 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.580
 it's how you get 7 out what you get 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.310
 all cloudy in the skate are table that the 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.530
 that and also leaves all cell or leaves or 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.900
 the map is destroyed and destroyed 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.729
 everything and good because it is a pass because 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.889
 really, well, if you notice that you have 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.020
 removed the one that destroys the map and all 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.939
 Well the game is going to end and it's not going 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.740
 to finish because we have not finished the 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:26.710
 percentage of deaths or anything not 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.780
 we get to 75 it's low confirmed it's going 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.620
 because they go from the game to the host they 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.449
 goes the game does not let us continue and 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.190
 what is going to do new truth that 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.990
 I took them out quite happy for the 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.449
 Regarding the student, she does or does not know what 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.509
 I wanted and good and if not then 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.770
 if after no longer hear they are played 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.840
 adapt match if not left 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.969
 constancy of love that what I was looking for 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.740
 in order for my advice it is not good 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.139
 it's not that you 're in a corner or 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:56.169
 be that you keep but it is a bit 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:58.779
 Tactical as a head and know well 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.759
 the maps well the response and especially 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:02.560
 if you go with a team like I was not 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.139
 well, not as you can see here 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.470
 pulling the host the game is over and I 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.700
 leave 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.580
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.580
 we are in the next video bye bye
