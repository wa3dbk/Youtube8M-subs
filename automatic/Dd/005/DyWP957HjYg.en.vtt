00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.270
 it's clearly a murder like that reacted 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.210
 to the medical-surgical insurance hospital 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 social for an appendicitis that day the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.150
 doctors told him he had to be 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.279
 intervened when I came on Tuesday it 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.340
 joined her to get her out of the hospital to take her to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.619
 the house and take care of it for a few days 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.180
 that I could be my mom was already in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 intensive care with a lot of 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.769
 Apparatus on the face looked like surgery 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.160
 routine but instead of injecting a 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.940
 analgesic, they injected adrenaline 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.399
 consequence was fatal 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.680
 and they told him a few hours ago that my 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.510
 Mom had had a heart attack at that point 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.219
 we thought it had been something 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.500
 what happened to her naturally 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.809
 understands was the answer they gave him 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.909
 the doctors when she died that was what 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.280
 that we knew until then that my 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.140
 Mom had a heart attack the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.610
 doctors never told him his mother 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.949
 had died from adverse reactions 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.930
 caused by the change of cartoons of 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.810
 ampoules of the fentanyl analgesic or 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.149
 by adrenaline treatment that prevents 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.429
 cardiorespiratory arrest after 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.659
 his mother's funeral he finds out that there is 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.340
 an open investigation in the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.220
 national direction of medicines by 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.649
 alleged medical negligence to the detriment 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.840
 of Dona Hortensia, her suspicions were 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.840
 confirmed after publication of the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.050
 results the procedure of 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.430
 Operating room storage is 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.730
 completely inadequate 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.500
 it's a macabre murder that 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.780
 they did my mom and they have maybe 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.730
 done to a lot of people justice is what 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.530
 what this family asks after knowing the 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.810
 they have not really stayed in arms 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 Crusaders came to the tower 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.590
 Social Security Administration for 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.300
 request the file in which 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.970
 the names of the medical team 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.970
 who participated in his mother's surgery 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.470
 he fears that cases like this will be repeated and 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.650
 asks the authorities of the institute 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.030
 Salvadoran Social Security 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.580
 collaboration and a thorough debugging 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.740
 of the bad elements that far from giving 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.860
 relief cause the death of their 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.869
 patients if in the case of my mom is 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.390
 documented as they say it is 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.190
 complete is the only case that they tell me 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.410
 that is documented has to serve 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.730
 for something he understands me and what I want 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.880
 is that these people are dismissed 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.460
 of his position and pay in jail 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.500
 not only seek justice but to mark a 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.810
 precedent to prevent more 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.090
 rightful owners die from negligence 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.640
