this<00:00:36.480> runs<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> single<00:00:37.079> double<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.860> battery

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
this runs on a single double a battery

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.479 
this runs on a single double a battery
this<00:00:39.059> runs<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.600> two<00:00:39.899> triple<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.770> batteries<00:00:41.250> and

with it once as well is I actually put a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.020 
with it once as well is I actually put a
y<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.840> fired<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> two<00:01:37.409> other<00:01:38.030> flashes

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
y on here fired it to two other flashes

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.080 
y on here fired it to two other flashes
so<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> fired<00:01:39.450> three<00:01:39.780> at<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.320> time<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.090> you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
so I fired three at one time so you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.359 
so I fired three at one time so you
don't<00:01:42.360> need<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.990> whole<00:01:43.259> bunch<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.740> receivers

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
don't need a whole bunch of receivers

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
don't need a whole bunch of receivers
one<00:01:44.610> receiver<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> fire<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> whole

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
one receiver and you can fire a whole

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.770 
one receiver and you can fire a whole
bunch<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.680> flashes<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.520> comes<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.210> different
