think<00:01:05.860> about<00:01:05.950> that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
think about that

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.500 
think about that
really<00:01:07.180> is<00:01:07.840> there<00:01:08.020> any<00:01:08.140> one<00:01:08.710> particular

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
really is there any one particular

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.640 
really is there any one particular
engagement<00:01:10.510> that<00:01:10.689> you<00:01:10.900> had<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.350> really

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
engagement that you had that really

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.630 
engagement that you had that really
stands<00:01:12.130> out<00:01:12.369> as<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.869> something<00:01:14.799> different

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
stands out as as something different

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
stands out as as something different
than<00:01:15.760> maybe<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:16.119> other<00:01:16.240> experiences<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:16.960> had

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
than maybe the other experiences you had

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.859 
than maybe the other experiences you had
I<00:01:19.990> think<00:01:20.770> attacking<00:01:21.549> this<00:01:21.729> great<00:01:22.479> number<00:01:22.840> of

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
I think attacking this great number of

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.940 
I think attacking this great number of
109s<00:01:23.799> is<00:01:24.009> quite<00:01:24.250> memorable<00:01:25.830> could<00:01:26.830> you

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
109s is quite memorable could you

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.499 
109s is quite memorable could you

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
that means return to base and so we all

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.009 
that means return to base and so we all
headed<00:03:12.620> out<00:03:12.859> for<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.159> South<00:03:13.730> China<00:03:13.760> Sea<00:03:14.389> and<00:03:15.159> I

headed out for the South China Sea and I

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.770 
headed out for the South China Sea and I
got<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.139> thinking<00:03:18.439> about<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.889> lead<00:03:19.129> airplane

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
got to thinking about that lead airplane

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.599 
got to thinking about that lead airplane
so<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.840> turned<00:03:21.139> around<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.650> went<00:03:21.799> back<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.310> and

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
so I turned around and went back in and

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.240 
so I turned around and went back in and
I<00:03:22.849> caught<00:03:23.090> him<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.500> he<00:03:24.530> was<00:03:24.739> turning<00:03:25.010> to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
I caught him just as he was turning to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.390 
I caught him just as he was turning to
go<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.430> his<00:03:25.670> base<00:03:25.909> and<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:27.200> got<00:03:28.099> him<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.370> a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
go to his base and I got him with a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.780 
go to his base and I got him with a
sidewinder<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:30.500> when<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:30.680> got<00:03:31.400> onto<00:03:31.609> the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
sidewinder and when I got onto the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.789 
sidewinder and when I got onto the
tanker<00:03:32.739> yeah<00:03:34.150> 400<00:03:35.150> pounds<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.510> fuel<00:03:35.750> left

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
tanker yeah 400 pounds of fuel left

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.259 
tanker yeah 400 pounds of fuel left
that's<00:03:36.799> four<00:03:37.190> minutes<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.669> flying<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.180> then

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
that's four minutes of flying and then

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.809 
that's four minutes of flying and then
therefore<00:03:38.449> if<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.319> gauge<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.739> accurate<00:03:40.160> he

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
therefore if the gauge is accurate he

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.500 
therefore if the gauge is accurate he
started<00:03:41.180> out<00:03:41.269> in<00:03:41.329> p38<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:43.060> all<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.329> your
