00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the reload rate i guess my average was

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.850 
the reload rate i guess my average was
1.6<00:03:02.790> seconds<00:03:03.360> which<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.569> pretty<00:03:04.019> damn<00:03:04.410> fast

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
1.6 seconds which is pretty damn fast

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.069 
fast furnace or if a 1.6 seconds or 1.7
seconds<00:03:10.709> into<00:03:10.859> my<00:03:10.950> average<00:03:11.569> that's<00:03:12.569> out<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.780> 10

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079

not<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.519> noob<00:03:36.819> gun<00:03:37.410> hmmm<00:03:39.180> but<00:03:40.180> yeah<00:03:40.330> so<00:03:40.950> damaged

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
not a noob gun hmmm but yeah so damaged

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.040 
not a noob gun hmmm but yeah so damaged
I<00:03:42.220> guess<00:03:42.459> um<00:03:43.530> damage<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.830> pretty<00:03:45.580> good<00:03:46.050> it's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
I guess um damage is pretty good it's

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.710 
I guess um damage is pretty good it's
pretty<00:03:47.319> average<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.739> would<00:03:47.890> say<00:03:48.330> close<00:03:49.330> range

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
pretty average I would say close range

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.890 
pretty average I would say close range
and<00:03:49.989> medium<00:03:50.349> range<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.040> like<00:03:51.670> 30<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.450> 35

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
and medium range it is like 30 to 35

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.729 
and medium range it is like 30 to 35
damage<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.799> that's<00:03:54.130> like<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:55.110> 30<00:03:56.110> that's<00:03:56.470> like<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
damage so that's like a 30 that's like a

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.360 
damage so that's like a 30 that's like a

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
i think i covered it all pretty much

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.980 
i think i covered it all pretty much
overall<00:05:36.680> this<00:05:36.830> gun<00:05:37.069> is<00:05:37.099> a<00:05:37.340> sexy<00:05:37.729> gun<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:38.810> only

overall this gun is a sexy gun the only

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.070 
overall this gun is a sexy gun the only
flaw<00:05:39.229> with<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.590> would<00:05:39.770> be<00:05:40.330> recoil<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.720> little

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
flaw with it would be recoil a little

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.680 
flaw with it would be recoil a little
bit<00:05:42.199> if<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:43.130> are<00:05:43.580> going<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.060> spray<00:05:44.360> with<00:05:44.569> this

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
bit if you are going to spray with this

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.320 
bit if you are going to spray with this
kind<00:05:44.930> of<00:05:44.960> long-range<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:46.639> chances<00:05:47.030> of<00:05:47.060> you

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
kind of long-range the chances of you

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.620 
kind of long-range the chances of you
getting<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:47.930> kill<00:05:48.169> or<00:05:48.409> like<00:05:49.060> negative<00:05:50.060> 5<00:05:50.360> at<00:05:50.599> a

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
getting a kill or like negative 5 at a

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.050 
getting a kill or like negative 5 at a
10<00:05:52.539> mainly<00:05:53.539> because<00:05:53.569> this<00:05:53.990> gun<00:05:54.169> is<00:05:54.199> not<00:05:54.470> a

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
10 mainly because this gun is not a

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.870 
10 mainly because this gun is not a
long-range<00:05:56.060> like<00:05:56.690> spring<00:05:57.680> done<00:05:57.949> like<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.460> m12

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
long-range like spring done like the m12

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.770 
long-range like spring done like the m12
is<00:05:59.090> rui<00:05:59.930> to<00:06:00.380> actually<00:06:00.800> like

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
is rui to actually like

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.350 
is rui to actually like
first<00:06:02.440> with<00:06:02.680> it<00:06:02.830> as<00:06:03.070> long<00:06:03.220> range<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.790> a<00:06:04.150> close

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
first with it as long range and a close

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.000 
first with it as long range and a close
range<00:06:04.660> if<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:04.870> spray<00:06:05.110> with<00:06:05.260> it<00:06:05.380> you<00:06:05.620> can<00:06:05.650> you

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
range if you spray with it you can you

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.350 
mean you can get to really say she kills
at<00:06:10.570> close<00:06:10.780> range<00:06:11.080> if<00:06:11.350> you<00:06:11.530> spray<00:06:11.880> if<00:06:12.880> you<00:06:13.180> can

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
at close range if you spray if you can

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.360 
at close range if you spray if you can
single<00:06:13.660> shot<00:06:13.840> I<00:06:14.500> don't<00:06:14.860> think<00:06:15.010> this<00:06:15.100> gun<00:06:15.340> is

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
single shot I don't think this gun is

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.129 
single shot I don't think this gun is
the<00:06:15.580> right<00:06:15.760> gun<00:06:15.910> for<00:06:16.120> you<00:06:16.240> because<00:06:16.570> the<00:06:16.750> firing

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
the right gun for you because the firing

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.180 
the right gun for you because the firing
rate<00:06:17.260> I<00:06:17.410> know<00:06:17.500> I<00:06:17.590> was<00:06:17.770> forgetting<00:06:18.100> something

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
rate I know I was forgetting something

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.790 
rate I know I was forgetting something
firing<00:06:18.850> right<00:06:19.030> firing<00:06:19.660> rate<00:06:20.080> is<00:06:20.260> really<00:06:20.440> fast

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
firing right firing rate is really fast

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.490 
firing right firing rate is really fast
so<00:06:21.370> that<00:06:21.730> doesn't<00:06:22.690> help<00:06:22.780> single<00:06:23.080> shutters<00:06:23.470> a

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
so that doesn't help single shutters a

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.620 
so that doesn't help single shutters a
lot<00:06:23.830> but<00:06:24.070> like<00:06:24.310> bursting<00:06:24.820> it<00:06:25.050> is<00:06:26.050> okay<00:06:26.440> a<00:06:27.630> long

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
lot but like bursting it is okay a long

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.360 
lot but like bursting it is okay a long
range<00:06:28.930> but<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.290> firing<00:06:29.650> rate<00:06:29.830> is<00:06:29.980> really<00:06:30.130> good

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
range but the firing rate is really good

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.450 
range but the firing rate is really good
which<00:06:30.550> is<00:06:30.580> why<00:06:30.700> i<00:06:30.820> spray<00:06:31.270> a<00:06:31.300> lot<00:06:31.510> in<00:06:31.660> this<00:06:31.720> game

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
which is why i spray a lot in this game

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.130 
which is why i spray a lot in this game
on<00:06:33.460> ya<00:06:33.840> so<00:06:34.840> this<00:06:35.650> gun<00:06:35.950> is<00:06:36.330> overall<00:06:37.330> really<00:06:37.600> sexy

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
on ya so this gun is overall really sexy

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.430 
on ya so this gun is overall really sexy
really<00:06:38.500> beast<00:06:38.770> really<00:06:39.370> awesome<00:06:39.669> I<00:06:40.440> don't

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
really beast really awesome I don't

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.810 
really beast really awesome I don't
think<00:06:41.500> it<00:06:41.770> was<00:06:41.860> worth<00:06:42.040> my<00:06:42.340> money<00:06:42.370> though

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820
