00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:05.250
Welcome to Ahmet's kitchen, today we make flatbread pizza

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.619
we need from you:

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.809
a flatbread

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.659
100g mozzarella

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.140
50g beef salami

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:24.259
1/4 red bell pepper and 1/4 green

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.589
small tomatoes

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.089
4 count

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.289
the side

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.850
we do now with Ayva

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.770
but you can also take pastrierte tomatoes

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.650
that would be the classic

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.250
as I said

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.160
We take mild Ayva

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.280
let's get started

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.080
to make

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.700
you to

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.850
Stir bissle

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.850
and make it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.450
Of course not everything

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.580
3 tbsp

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.080
that's enough then

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.490
everywhere it, otherwise it is too dry

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.220
auc HThe corners

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.320
now it the cheese

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.330
good for students

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.540
if you have no time

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.540
Fast

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.090
Salami and it

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.719
I cut the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:14.009
in length, for decoration

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:21.009
4 count

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:40.489
tomatoes

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.749
ok, finished

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:22.749
now it is in the oven, middle shelf, 200 Â° C

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.619
we soon see how long it takes

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:32.699
We show first (10-15 min)

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.010
is completed

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.010
a little olive oil on it

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.269
we cut it

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.469
let's see if the size ranges

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:59.389
of the knife

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.429
on the plate

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:06.859
as we cut it exactly

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.019
done

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.849
so you can serve it

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.560
I wish you a good appetite, until next time, Ahmet, bye :)
