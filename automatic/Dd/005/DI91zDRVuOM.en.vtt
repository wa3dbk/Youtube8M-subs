third person shooter feel to the game so
as<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:19.680> pressing<00:00:19.949> f5<00:00:20.580> once

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
as you can see just by pressing f5 once

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.820 
as you can see just by pressing f5 once
it<00:00:21.480> will<00:00:21.630> actually<00:00:21.810> switch<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.560> mode

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
it will actually switch you to this mode

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.460 
it will actually switch you to this mode
and<00:00:23.119> this<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> lot<00:00:24.630> better<00:00:24.810> than<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> usual

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and this is a lot better than the usual

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.750 
and this is a lot better than the usual
third<00:00:25.890> person<00:00:26.279> you'll<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.519> where<00:00:26.670> you're

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
third person you'll get where you're

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.759 
third person you'll get where you're
just<00:00:26.789> exactly<00:00:27.359> behind<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> character<00:00:28.260> but

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
just exactly behind the character but

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.349 
just exactly behind the character but
what<00:00:28.890> they<00:00:28.980> seem<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.340> done<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.670> shifted

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
what they seem to have done is shifted

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.479 
what they seem to have done is shifted
your<00:00:30.390> player<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.900> left<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
your player to the left and you have a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.910 
your player to the left and you have a
better<00:00:32.969> view<00:00:33.360> over<00:00:34.079> his<00:00:34.230> shoulder<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:34.829> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
better view over his shoulder which I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
better view over his shoulder which I
suppose<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.190> why<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.579> called<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> mod

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
suppose is why they called the mod

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.010 
suppose is why they called the mod
shoulder<00:00:37.079> surfing<00:00:37.410> um<00:00:38.270> one<00:00:39.270> thing<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.750> will

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
shoulder surfing um one thing you will

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.740 
shoulder surfing um one thing you will
notice<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.160> crosshair<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.629> can

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
notice is the crosshair so as you can

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.660 
notice is the crosshair so as you can
see<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.500> no<00:00:43.710> block<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.219> range<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
see if there is no block in range you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.310 
see if there is no block in range you
will<00:00:44.789> actually<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.539> crosshair<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
will actually have a crosshair in the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
will actually have a crosshair in the
middle<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.710> screen<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.700> if<00:00:47.850> i<00:00:47.940> come<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
middle of the screen but if i come to

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.810 
middle of the screen but if i come to
focus<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.930> tree<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.039> crosshair<00:00:50.610> will

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
focus on this tree the crosshair will

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.930 
focus on this tree the crosshair will
actually<00:00:51.180> magically<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.489> think

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
actually magically a up here now i think

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.880 
actually magically a up here now i think
that<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:55.350> cool<00:00:55.710> feature

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that is actually a really cool feature

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.290 
that is actually a really cool feature
because<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.340> lot<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> time<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.030> your

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
because a lot of the time you have your

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.520 
because a lot of the time you have your
crosshair<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> middle<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> screen

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
crosshair in the middle of the screen

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
crosshair in the middle of the screen
and<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.460> really<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.940> need<00:01:00.270> need<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and you don't really know need need it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
and you don't really know need need it
there<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
there but on this as you can see the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.210 
there but on this as you can see the
course<00:01:03.000> i<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.449> move<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> cross

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
course i can actually move so the cross

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.210 
course i can actually move so the cross
i<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.519> move<00:01:05.760> its<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> bit<00:01:07.229> jerky<00:01:07.560> but

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
i will move its kind of a bit jerky but

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.250 
i will move its kind of a bit jerky but
it<00:01:08.460> actually<00:01:08.580> works<00:01:08.909> quite<00:01:09.119> well<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:10.140> will

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
it actually works quite well and it will

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.219 
it actually works quite well and it will
jump<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:11.280> block<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> block<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.750> easy<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
jump from block to block so it's easy to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530 
jump from block to block so it's easy to
see<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:14.010> block<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.670> selecting<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.390> it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
see what block you are selecting so it's

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.340 
see what block you are selecting so it's
really<00:01:15.720> easy<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.860> play<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:18.180> f5<00:01:18.570> mode<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.049> makes

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
really easy to play an f5 mode it makes

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.679 
really easy to play an f5 mode it makes
it<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> lot<00:01:19.650> easier<00:01:19.830> than<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.880> usually<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.330> in

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it a lot easier than it usually is in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.620 
it a lot easier than it usually is in
the<00:01:21.960> normal<00:01:22.380> f5<00:01:22.799> mode<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:24.180> well<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the normal f5 mode and as well as that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.539 
the normal f5 mode and as well as that
it<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.049> feels<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.740> cool<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.250> running

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it just feels really cool just running

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.249 
it just feels really cool just running
around<00:01:26.640> over<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> shoulder<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> your

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
around over the shoulder of your

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
around over the shoulder of your
character<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.640> but

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
character I don't know what it is but

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510 
character I don't know what it is but
it's<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.960> feels<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.560> much<00:01:31.740> better<00:01:31.979> so

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's it just feels so much better so

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
it's it just feels so much better so
well<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> put<00:01:33.090> together<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.590> feels

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
well to put together and it just feels

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.429 
well to put together and it just feels
nice<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.460> um<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.840> hoping<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.229> you'd

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
shoulder view the of the bow but it's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
shoulder view the of the bow but it's
not<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.909> good<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> can
