00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 in elementary school number 14 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.930
 justino campo the west is elisa 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.310
 I ended up being the best student and the best 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.160
 partner 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.410
 for that reason the medical club rotary 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.340
 to do my first three years of 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.170
 high school 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.630
 precisely now 40 years later for 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.080
 On the 21st they give me a prize in 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.080
 the rotary club 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.140
 well those three years I did them in the form 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.780
 of the secondary form normal from 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.400
 of the third year I did at night because I started 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.250
 to work 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.320
 and good as finish school 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.980
 there came the problem 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.720
 greater because the medicine for three courses 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 in the morning notes to treat others to 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.329
 noon and it is more difficult 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.250
 have a job a schedule that allows 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.219
 to that guy that is so 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.920
 inflexible so good I do not have more 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.660
 alternative that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.630
 work but what I could do 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.510
 did changas or come book or 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.050
 worked in a workshop or did what 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.450
 could the reality is true that came 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.000
 good to put together some cartons for 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.180
 try to sell them for is a fact 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.180
 picturesque 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.980
 what we did was with a friend 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.110
 we have a lot of people known a 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.479
 lots of friends who kept us all 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.400
 the diaries of the week the end of 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.680
 week we retired to uruguay that 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.270
 Many cardboard boxes and good once 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.320
 every 15 they give is per month and let's make one 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.159
 paper and we sold them 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 that was something else to add the work 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:50.430
 in the afternoon if they called me to do some 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:52.950
 park to paint so he was 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.360
 doing that all the time and lived on 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.030
 that was not something else 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.090
 really we try not to waste 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:06.240
 nothing everything we could do to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.240
 that would bring some welcome weight
