00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hello there I am again with a new one 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.500
 Video for you I have lately 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.540
 Once again a few drugstore products 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.690
 accumulated and shows you of course 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.820
 again and I have my first time here 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 to such a sensitive shampoo from albert 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.230
 gripped without silicone without anything without 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.449
 plan irritated and sensitive 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.060
 scalp there is on it fellow citizens and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.980
 even that calms and cares and exactly 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.460
 I needed that because mine 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.599
 scalp really hurt so me 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.040
 I do not even have that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.950
 shed or something so easy 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.930
 really hurt right and I have 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.399
 then thought about where the leg 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.309
 can come and I noticed that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.020
 especially here at the back of the back where 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.120
 I especially many animals and then 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 a lot of styling products always 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 Slash it so it also peter holds 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.410
 my scalp has the most 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.780
 hurt 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.390
 and then I thought it is then 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.059
 maybe now after five ten and twenty 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.739
 years of styling products 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.769
 The scalp may have meals 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.320
 bit back and a little bit 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.210
 less in my hair and hew 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 to support that I thought I could 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.830
 a sensitive shampoo I do not have you 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 yes lately, that tells my bio teacher 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.479
 has become and of course I have 1 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.430
 I bought it, I really use it 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.900
 always durable and i do not use it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.030
 for the body, although that too 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.119
 could use the body I take that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.759
 So much for the face so before me 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.909
 my care application and i have here 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.000
 Two scars on the neck and use for it 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.650
 me too so i cream oils my face 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.180
 to take but very little 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.530
 of which it is really very rich 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.259
 and then I prefer that in principle here 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090
 I can honestly go down that way 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.340
 Do not tell my scars like that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.840
 I have become less visible 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.850
 I wished it was not so 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.860
 I have the feeling that it is for that 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.020
 whole skin picture just fine what 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.880
 does and my skin is so very very 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.530
 dry so therefore i can do some 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.450
 I always had good use of products 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.189
 lately, dr scheller 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.200
 bought hand together and found him so 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.670
 good and thought i have to have others 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.759
 Try products and then have 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.840
 this is the doctor scheller argan oil and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.700
 amaranth facial cream afterwards 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.790
 Cream understood that is a bit 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.310
 more expensive I believe the 10 12 euro 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.450
 but since I give it by the hand that way 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.370
 I thought that was thrilled 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.080
 maybe it's worth trying 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.250
 So I can tell you it smells 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.750
 very very good but I have to be here 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.280
 a little bit longer to really test 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.319
 what to say to be able to do that 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.360
 Well, something that you usually do not care for 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.030
 really often in wood looks 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.280
 Handkerchiefs and I had you guys 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.549
 just show because they are so pretty 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.400
 I think this packs this little 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:47.290
 bird then so pretty and so 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.349
 choose form and the brand is hoping and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.400
 sure of dm and unfortunately there was still 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.410
 otherwise I would have that one pack 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.910
 I bought hundreds of them 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.950
 so beautiful here on the other side 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.239
 there is another bird on it and it 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.860
 are simply such yes 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.799
 Handkerchiefs you can pull out so 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.150
 a bit thicker is on my 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.739
 nightstand and I already know that 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.090
 I will be sad , they will all be 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.410
 mostly india limited and are 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.980
 then someday just not anymore 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.630
 assortment and then others come in 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.370
 but this is my opinion 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.380
 after permanently in the assortment I take 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.579
 rarely have such a pretty handkerchief 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.560
 Packing seen now we come to 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.959
 otherwise not seen 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.349
 at least not in german wood and 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.090
 these are three products from poland i 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.980
 I have a Polish girlfriend and she has 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.079
 These things brought to me from Poland 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.420
 are also from the drugstore because of it 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.920
 I thought I let them here discreetly 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.680
 with incorporated perhaps yes 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.310
 somebody of you in poland and that 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.919
 is once a mascara pump up curling 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.919
 mascara and my girlfriend said that 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.419
 the drugstore really does that 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.609
 The best mascara is when I'm great 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:58.900
 looking forward to it and then she still has me 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:01.739
 Here are these two pack face masks 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.010
 once brought a regenerating 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.230
 and one with hyaluron that's all in 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.849
 that's why I'm trying on polish 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.310
 not first read to you 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.359
 but evelyn cosmetics I just manage 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.359
 yet to pronounce it like that 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.830
 yes yes something I stay there one you 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.570

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.009
 infobox there you can the evening back 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.050
 read again if you are 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.270
 speak polish or more often mean 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.650
 Poland since my wife meant to be 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.180
 very very good and i will turn you on 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.860
 Report every case as soon as I get it 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.870
 has tried and although it is so 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.539
 terribly hot is currently 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.479
 I have bathing products again 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.000
 I also like to have a bath in summer 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.250
 and then really very cool and actually 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.380
 then usually not with such a big one 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.440
 but like to paint with something 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.509
 bubbly salty and there I have 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.870
 the one thereof dresdner it is a 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:01.740
 Whirlpool bought that feels right here 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:06.090
 inside, as if that were one way or the other 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.099
 Something would be in it somehow and that 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.530
 I think there were two different ones 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:17.370
 fragrance directions and up here 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:19.229
 it smells nice and you judge 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.729
 Actually what am I totally surprised 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.000
 do not know exactly how they do that 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:27.389
 It's just a tiny hole in it 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.960
 the pack is right in any case 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.880
 very good that here is the scent direction 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.669
 sensuality and exoticism and goes for it 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.169
 with a long time i like that if after 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.520
 that's how long it's bubbling 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.889
 no matter how long it bubbles 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.659
 I just think it's beautiful and 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:46.949
 I'm looking forward to trying it out 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:50.340
 that is without silicone oils without mineral 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:53.159
 paraffin and pgs and then I still have 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.789
 bought from valea so here it is one 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:59.310
 a bath salt probably for a moment with coco 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.590
 and cassis scent and i thought coconut and 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.590
 Cassis could do it now in the summer 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.570
 be really comfortable if that 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.190
 Bathwater is not so hot and you 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.919
 he saves so takes a bit 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.460
 cool and coconut always reminds me 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.080
 so on the Caribbean and holiday and smaller 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.180
 vacation in my bathtub 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.099
 That's it for my dear ones again today 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.270
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.710
 I wish you a miracle 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.550
 wonderful day and hope we see 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.240

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.240
