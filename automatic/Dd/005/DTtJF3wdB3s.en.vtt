practices see how far should get the
other<00:01:28.609> thing<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:28.939> think<00:01:28.999> is<00:01:29.179> really<00:01:29.420> important

other thing I think is really important
is<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.049> actually<00:01:30.229> don't<00:01:30.920> just<00:01:31.159> stick<00:01:31.490> to

things<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.780> do<00:01:38.899> are<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.289> a<00:01:39.560> for
