00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
his own Hulk hands and then you can

his own Hulk hands and then you can
smash<00:02:05.990> up<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.289> bus<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.950> use<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.280> shield

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
smash up a bus and use this a shield

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.070 
smash up a bus and use this a shield
which<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.330> can<00:02:08.360> grind<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:09.019> a

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080

skateboard<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.269> ridiculous<00:02:11.269> there's<00:02:11.480> all

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
skateboard it's ridiculous there's all

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.970 
skateboard it's ridiculous there's all
sorts<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:11.989> nutty<00:02:12.170> ways<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.650> use<00:02:12.800> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
sorts of nutty ways to use the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.110 
sorts of nutty ways to use the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
game and that's what makes the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:24.770 
game and that's what makes the
experience<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.590> much<00:02:15.709> fun

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.930 

the<00:02:25.780> game<00:02:25.960> has<00:02:26.170> an<00:02:26.350> open-ended<00:02:26.890> gta-like<00:02:27.430> feel

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
the game has an open-ended gta-like feel

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.490 
the game has an open-ended gta-like feel
to<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.270> though<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.750> story<00:02:28.990> missions<00:02:29.200> are

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500

completely linear coming one at a time

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.660 
completely linear coming one at a time
the<00:02:32.350> rest<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.710> time<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.100> can<00:02:33.250> kind<00:02:33.460> of<00:02:33.520> go

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
the rest of the time you can kind of go

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.180 
the rest of the time you can kind of go
do<00:02:33.910> these<00:02:34.120> kooky<00:02:34.420> side<00:02:34.780> missions<00:02:35.260> like<00:02:35.530> races

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
do these kooky side missions like races

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.770 
do these kooky side missions like races
and<00:02:36.430> rescue<00:02:36.760> missions<00:02:37.120> or<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.660> just

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
and rescue missions or you can just

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.240 
and rescue missions or you can just
wander<00:02:37.960> around<00:02:38.110> busting<00:02:38.740> up<00:02:38.860> whatever<00:02:39.010> you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
wander around busting up whatever you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.580 
wander around busting up whatever you
feel<00:02:39.460> like<00:02:39.930> everything<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.080> game<00:02:41.230> breaks

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
feel like everything in the game breaks

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.800 
feel like everything in the game breaks
and<00:02:41.890> breaks<00:02:42.220> real<00:02:42.550> good<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.570> kind<00:02:43.780> of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and breaks real good so it's kind of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.240 
and breaks real good so it's kind of
hard<00:02:43.960> not<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.620> caught<00:02:44.800> up<00:02:44.830> in<00:02:45.130> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
hard not to get caught up in the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.090 
hard not to get caught up in the

Smashing of stuff the main storyline is

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.070 
Smashing of stuff the main storyline is
good<00:02:48.310> though<00:02:48.610> it's<00:02:48.790> also<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.300> little<00:02:49.570> sporadic

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
good though it's also a little sporadic

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.900 
good though it's also a little sporadic
in<00:02:50.200> spots<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.770> some<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.340> story<00:02:51.550> missions

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
in spots and some of the story missions

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.810 
in spots and some of the story missions
aren't<00:02:52.210> so<00:02:52.570> great<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:54.160> games<00:02:54.310> at<00:02:54.460> its<00:02:54.580> best

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
aren't so great the games at its best

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.550 
aren't so great the games at its best
when<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.510> asking<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.050> blow<00:02:56.320> stuff

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
when it's just asking you to blow stuff

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.590 
when it's just asking you to blow stuff
up<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.070> when<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.730> kind<00:02:57.820> of<00:02:57.970> veers<00:02:58.210> into<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
up and when it kind of veers into the

up and when it kind of veers into the

fetch quest and escort mission territory

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.240 
fetch quest and escort mission territory
it's<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:00.910> little<00:03:01.150> less<00:03:01.330> fun

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
it's a little less fun

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.100 
it's a little less fun
none<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.280> these<00:03:03.430> missions<00:03:03.760> are<00:03:03.880> bad<00:03:04.330> exactly

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
none of these missions are bad exactly

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.870 
none of these missions are bad exactly
but<00:03:05.290> they<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:05.590> also<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.920> pretty<00:03:06.220> frustrating

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
but they can also be pretty frustrating

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.699 
but they can also be pretty frustrating

GameCube<00:03:37.200> version<00:03:37.230> fares<00:03:37.890> probably<00:03:38.400> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
GameCube version fares probably the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.100 
GameCube version fares probably the
worst<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.910> three<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.390> more<00:03:39.660> framerate

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
worst of the three with more framerate

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.900 
worst of the three with more framerate
drop<00:03:40.530> than<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.769> rest<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.459> ps2<00:03:41.879> version

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
drop than the rest and the ps2 version

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.839 
drop than the rest and the ps2 version
has<00:03:42.540> kind<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.049> junkie<00:03:43.620> draw<00:03:43.860> distance<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.489> it

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
has kind of a junkie draw distance to it

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.240 
has kind of a junkie draw distance to it
thus<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.870> Xbox<00:03:46.260> version<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.890> preferable

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
thus the Xbox version is the preferable

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.979 
thus the Xbox version is the preferable
of<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.519> bunch<00:03:47.760> but<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.599> need<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.780> get<00:03:48.900> the

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
of the bunch but if you need to get the

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.809 
of the bunch but if you need to get the
game<00:03:49.170> on<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.410> ps2<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.129> Gamecube<00:03:50.579> you'll

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
game on the ps2 or the Gamecube you'll

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:58.250 
game on the ps2 or the Gamecube you'll
