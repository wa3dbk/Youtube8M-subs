00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 go to all dead guys who talk like 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.870
 see we are in the second how to do 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.820
 sea and in g a volume 2 in fact are 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.969
 many of Italian texts this is mine 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.349
 channel and I'll show you how to stop in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.770
 g on venus 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.770
 the first point is the first point 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.820
 precisely when you went on the patrol of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.010
 venus bis 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.840
 fear at this point and you must do 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.550
 out first the enemies you find here 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 around to position them more or less in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.920
 this corner and have a vision 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.670
 from the top so that it has enemies 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.110
 from every corner of the map as you see 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.600
 we have the two snipers shooting there 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.739
 in that in that other circle that mobile 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 they answer more down and then we say more 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 long time to make them wait outside 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.910
 that marry less but there really are 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.309
 so many sincerely the virtual shower 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 which you can find in g I don't know what it is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.809
 the fact is that of all those I have 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 tried the earth is what it seems to me 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.010
 more relationship time and in large 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.810
 found 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.750
 the fact is that this is the first point 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.290
 now going on entering this one 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.090
 spam portal and doing this 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.610
 road that I show you we come 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.540
 at the second location which is what 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.310
 some find it better than the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.259
 Earth then you will be judge which 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.960
 do to find in g until you do 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.960
 block this trick here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 I recommend you do it at least in two but 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.560
 if you want to do it a little faster too 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.880
 in three because it is difficult to jump too 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.229
 because it is impossible to skip this 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 point 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.790
 the fact is that you have to kill the three le 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.100
 three spheres and even if they are level 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.550
 low we say in three people you put us 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550
 less 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.429
 come in 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.020
 killed the three spheres he sees go up I think 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.700
 now last because he made the campaign is 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.080
 a pretty easy thing to kill 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.720
 last friends left we make them 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.450
 out because anyway it is also these 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.550
 they can give you some g 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.480
 obviously for those with a varied ass 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.480
 available 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.459
 let's do all this speeded up 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.269
 because if it didn't last 15 of alone of 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.709
 road also because then the point where 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.370
 you can use it to find in g ha 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.360
 really a bullshit you see here that 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.849
 they kill these monsters anyway 23 g 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.410
 we can find even if they are common 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.890
 however the lumens always do 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.739
 comfortable I have been doing these days for 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.200
 do this sort of trick now has 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.739
 made 10 thousand lumens and in just a few 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.480
 hours therefore also in large municipalities 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.610
 they are convenient 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.269
 once off we have these here 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.470
 therefore we find type 67 enemies 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:18.950
 we cross dark alley and call it 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.230
 and then we arrived in the second in the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.780
 second post here will advise you 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.810
 rocket launchers make out these 20 30s 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:32.390
 enemies you see that already some ingram 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.150
 race out comes out though it is okay 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.310
 once you've killed everyone, you have to throw yourself away 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.049
 below it looks strange but you have 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.900
 throw all those three underneath 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.880
 of your group they must jump under 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.700
 there is the waiting three seconds 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.319
 that will make you shoot and return precisely 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.049
 in this part where you have suffered others 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.250
 30 enemies to destroy 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.950
 colangelo atc for a second is all one 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.880
 comings and goings kill multiverse back 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.400
 back 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.079
 I hope the video will have been helping 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.489
 I invite you to leave a nice like a 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.810
 comment and write the case you don't have 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.980
 still made those deaths sail for everyone 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.670
 Hello 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.670
 the comte
