00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.300
 always on the stand of the greenhouse and 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.720
 finally berlin and there we came across 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.259
 the room knows at 210 and 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.259
 at 2.11 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 a 3g connection then 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.360
 to be pretty simple with you 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.000
 this tablet that looks very much 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.620
 from design to the back we wanted 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 find in test on a yacht tablet 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.690
 dot com 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.149
 I want to see the tablet quickly 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.949
 while all nice is that serves us 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.359
 really still has this little tool 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.579
 which is called acer ring 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.890
 it allows me to have a whole bunch of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.040
 things in direct access to take from 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.830
 files for example 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.579
 she is directly on the gallery 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.910
 I imagine 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.910
 I am 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.930
 we included android 4 who already has a vintage 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.250
 on it then I'll take you on a little tour 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.920
 technical specifications here 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.770
 always the classic 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 the cable between them 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 the other and 3.5 millimeters for the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.500
 the audio a micro usb 1 usb 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.920
 it's mostly a nice surprise there if 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920
 we open 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 it got too thick 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.030
 yeah that's it a micro sd a button 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.040
 reset is always amazing to see that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.380
 I closed them 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.560
 these complain 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.930
 our goal is besides moreover 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.450
 we 'll say it's also for really the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.110
 chassis beyond her is one to two 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.840
 are more evolved otherwise there 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.820
 the volume button here and the loch and the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.800
 sensor are here 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.530
 I do not see a camera 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.320
 but no camera the speaker here 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.659
 but I do not see a camera elsewhere 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.579
 these few cameras for video here 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.970
 so then at the state level we are 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.160
 on June 10 inches 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.620
 which is really good is that that the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.810
 big difference with the the 200c that 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.910
 that of his soul and a tegra 2 this one 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.510
 is sure integral - and it shows 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.920
 really in terms of fluidity 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.710
 does very quickly there are no shots of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.050
 language 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.180
 really good if 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.010
 always the possibility with android 4 2 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.970
 then directly associations etc 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.970
 title ca c 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.500
 then we can go up to eight 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.700
 hours 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.640
 2 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.150
 autonomy is 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.629
 bluetooth 2.1 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.670
 a GPS and the front camera which is 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.879
 2 megapixels the resolution of these of the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.650
 1280 by 800 in hd so here is a 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.500
 beautiful tablet we do not have them yet 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.640
 details about the noise but that's 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.470
 something he does not hurt the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.939
 road drying case that makes products 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.349
 which are quite resistant 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.590
 only small complaint that can be made 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.230
 it's the thickness that is still 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.050
 quite awesome if we compare with the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.379
 premium with something nice enough 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.379
 imposing
