rubberized<00:02:07.610> casing<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.700> top<00:02:08.910> I'll<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.119> peel

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
rubberized casing on top I'll just peel

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.660 
rubberized casing on top I'll just peel
this<00:02:09.840> back<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> little<00:02:10.349> bit<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.619> show<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.890> the

this back a little bit to show you the
way<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.940> is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
way this is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.199 
way this is
did<00:02:12.739> actually<00:02:12.890> I'm<00:02:13.190> inside<00:02:13.430> I've<00:02:13.730> steal<00:02:14.030> this

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
did actually I'm inside I've steal this

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.970 
did actually I'm inside I've steal this
so<00:02:14.450> well<00:02:14.659> it's<00:02:14.930> actually<00:02:15.019> hard<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.470> remove<00:02:15.799> at

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so well it's actually hard to remove at

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.100 
so well it's actually hard to remove at
this<00:02:16.099> point<00:02:17.260> but<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.500> any<00:02:18.590> case<00:02:19.840> let<00:02:20.840> me<00:02:20.900> just

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
this is ok I'm going to put the loop

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.509 
this is ok I'm going to put the loop
don't<00:02:27.560> want<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.739> scratch<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.129> stream<00:02:28.400> on

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
don't want to scratch to the stream on

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.660 
don't want to scratch to the stream on
that<00:02:28.750> one<00:02:29.750> thing<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.959> don't<00:02:30.049> want<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.290> do<00:02:30.670> ok

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that one thing you don't want to do ok

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.390 
that one thing you don't want to do ok
so<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.879> got<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.209> top<00:02:33.019> cover<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.250> then

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
so I got the top cover on and then

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.539 
so I got the top cover on and then
flipped<00:02:34.640> over<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.750> can<00:02:35.870> see<00:02:36.129> you<00:02:37.129> are<00:02:37.250> adding

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
flipped over you can see you are adding

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.220 
flipped over you can see you are adding
quite<00:02:37.849> a<00:02:37.879> few<00:02:38.120> millimeters<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.720> thickness

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230

just turn on my little kitchen scale
here<00:04:56.180> let's<00:04:57.180> put<00:04:57.449> on<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:58.469> ipad<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.639> give<00:05:00.360> it

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
here let's put on the ipad and give it

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:08.779 
here let's put on the ipad and give it
away<00:05:00.889> so<00:05:01.889> it's<00:05:02.219> we<00:05:02.789> are<00:05:03.000> at<00:05:03.919> two<00:05:04.919> pounds<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:07.789> 13

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
away so it's we are at two pounds and 13

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:14.619 
away so it's we are at two pounds and 13
ounces<00:05:09.560> okay<00:05:10.560> that's<00:05:11.810> quite<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:12.930> bit

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
ounces okay that's quite a bit

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.329 
ounces okay that's quite a bit
considering<00:05:15.629> that<00:05:15.689> the<00:05:15.960> 16<00:05:16.409> ounces<00:05:16.770> is<00:05:16.979> also<00:05:17.310> a

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 
considering that the 16 ounces is also a

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.350 
considering that the 16 ounces is also a
pound<00:05:17.669> so<00:05:18.210> we're<00:05:18.360> just<00:05:18.389> under<00:05:18.689> three<00:05:19.020> pounds

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
pound so we're just under three pounds

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.689 
pound so we're just under three pounds
with<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.629> with<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.199> case<00:05:22.409> on<00:05:22.620> I'm<00:05:23.009> just<00:05:23.490> we'll

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
with the with the case on I'm just we'll

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.320 
with the with the case on I'm just we'll
do<00:05:23.789> a<00:05:23.819> double<00:05:24.180> check<00:05:24.210> on<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.680> gram<00:05:25.919> weight

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
do a double check on the the gram weight

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.719 
do a double check on the the gram weight
we're<00:05:27.330> at<00:05:27.419> forty<00:05:27.749> five<00:05:28.400> ounces<00:05:29.539> fully<00:05:30.539> laden

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
we're at forty five ounces fully laden

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:40.749 
we're at forty five ounces fully laden
or<00:05:33.770> if<00:05:34.770> we<00:05:34.919> get<00:05:35.099> two<00:05:35.569> grams<00:05:36.569> we're<00:05:38.779> 1277<00:05:39.779> grams

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
or if we get two grams we're 1277 grams

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.610 
or if we get two grams we're 1277 grams
with<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.909> case<00:05:42.149> on<00:05:42.389> so<00:05:42.750> if<00:05:42.930> you're<00:05:43.080> at<00:05:43.370> 680<00:05:44.370> Oh

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
with the case on so if you're at 680 Oh

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.740 
with the case on so if you're at 680 Oh
without<00:05:46.620> a<00:05:46.649> case<00:05:46.949> on<00:05:47.189> you're<00:05:47.819> almost<00:05:47.969> you<00:05:48.539> can

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
without a case on you're almost you can

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.920 
without a case on you're almost you can
basically<00:05:48.960> Dublin<00:05:49.529> the<00:05:49.620> weight<00:05:49.770> of<00:05:49.889> your<00:05:49.919> iPad

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
basically Dublin the weight of your iPad

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.889 
basically Dublin the weight of your iPad
so<00:05:52.610> it's<00:05:53.610> now<00:05:53.789> closer<00:05:54.149> to<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.449> weight<00:05:54.599> of<00:05:54.750> an

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:54.899 
so it's now closer to the weight of an

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:58.670 
so it's now closer to the weight of an
actual<00:05:55.370> laptop<00:05:56.479> a<00:05:57.479> problem<00:05:58.199> of<00:05:58.259> a<00:05:58.319> smaller

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
you're taking about half the weight off

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.249 
you're taking about half the weight off

but<00:07:24.960> I<00:07:24.990> happen<00:07:25.919> to<00:07:25.979> think<00:07:26.039> this<00:07:26.310> is<00:07:26.460> one<00:07:26.669> of<00:07:26.759> the

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 
but I happen to think this is one of the

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:30.140 
but I happen to think this is one of the
best<00:07:27.060> cases<00:07:27.960> on<00:07:28.080> the<00:07:28.199> market<00:07:28.529> right<00:07:28.560> now<00:07:29.150> there

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
best cases on the market right now there

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.730 
best cases on the market right now there
are<00:07:30.300> I<00:07:30.330> think<00:07:30.719> there<00:07:31.050> isn't<00:07:31.199> one<00:07:31.590> other

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
are I think there isn't one other

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.830 
are I think there isn't one other
product<00:07:32.189> which<00:07:32.370> is<00:07:32.520> even<00:07:32.939> more<00:07:33.210> protective

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
product which is even more protective

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.170 
product which is even more protective
than<00:07:33.870> this<00:07:34.139> case<00:07:34.439> I<00:07:34.740> think<00:07:35.460> it's<00:07:35.759> even<00:07:36.000> more

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
than this case I think it's even more

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.230 
than this case I think it's even more
expensive<00:07:37.009> which<00:07:38.009> has<00:07:38.189> metal<00:07:38.699> pieces<00:07:38.939> around

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 
expensive which has metal pieces around

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.140 
expensive which has metal pieces around
it<00:07:39.949> so<00:07:40.949> you<00:07:41.039> can<00:07:41.159> get<00:07:41.250> really<00:07:41.400> crazy<00:07:41.759> but<00:07:42.120> I
