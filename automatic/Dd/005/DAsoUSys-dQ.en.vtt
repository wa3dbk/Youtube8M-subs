 we can 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.659
 as we can observe moving it through the work environment it hit a 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.509
 to find in opposition

 of the photograph we were retouching 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.750
 once confirmed we will give what we got as the picture 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.270
 adapts to the cut 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.060
 we can rotate the

 simply 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.660

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.900
 for this comfortable menu we will even see 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.470
 rotate it 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.470
 the unemployed 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.850
 as we want

 once we have got screwed as we want a lot of filters 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.910
 the preferred ones 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.980
 that date will reopen mind to the image 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.490
 we are going to select a good one so let's see 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.110
 all the joy that it offers us 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.150
 and when we have found the one we want 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
 we will leave it to continue retouching image 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.000
 we have as we have curious effects that will give us a spectacular result 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.630
 to our photographs 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.400
 is to see how a much more artistic touch comes out 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 the section of levels we will adjust the brightness the contrast 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.560

 our image 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.270
 well for the improvement by and for what we are doing that is commune 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.590
 this one of more artistic composition 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.400
 one of the advantages headquarters schemes and you can adjust the image by with levels 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.780
 and by curve 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.150
 we will be able to establish the curves 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.309

 to give a more fun or explanatory touch to our photos 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:27.869
 we have 70 mañón we will select the form the color and that we will establish 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.049
 context 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.549
 when confirming demos that auto stuffed so I was not wrong 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.659
 the size of the text and from here we will be able to select 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.519
 the ain who used the source 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.730

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.280
 number of frames to give a more fun touch to photography or 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.569
 a final touch 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.199
 more than interesting 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.789
 we see how we have great joy and we select one of them 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.649
 we can also give a background color or we can set 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.879
 the degree of d 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.199
 intensity 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.169
 a reflection 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.839
 and once she has it 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.849
 will allow us to share it on twitter facebook explained that there will be 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:27.659
 try out 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.929
 in rd let's say a concrete resolution for 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:35.009
 eneko land in these social networks also to save it of course 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.009
 lowering salvaredy versus resolutions or also the original 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:43.129
 and we said let's have it let's save it in our photo reel 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.419
 and how are we going to show is awaiting 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.419
 with the highest resolution 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.899
 we have the 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.899
 images that we have retouched 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.949
