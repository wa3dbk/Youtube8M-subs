found how you can get the thundergun

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.850 
found how you can get the thundergun
from<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.160> nazi<00:00:08.610> zombie<00:00:09.210> mode<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
from the nazi zombie mode in the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.850 
from the nazi zombie mode in the
campaign<00:00:11.269> now<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.330> reason<00:00:12.809> why<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.139> found<00:00:13.620> this

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
campaign now the reason why I found this

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.680 
campaign now the reason why I found this
or<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> thought<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.030> could<00:00:15.179> find<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.509> is

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
or what I thought you could find this is

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.029 
or what I thought you could find this is
when<00:00:15.900> i<00:00:15.929> was<00:00:16.109> doing<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.500> mission<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
when i was doing this mission for the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.730 
when i was doing this mission for the
first<00:00:17.310> time<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> actually<00:00:17.789> found<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.680> outline<00:00:19.680> of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
first time I actually found a outline of

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.790 
first time I actually found a outline of
a<00:00:20.010> lot<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.880> thunderbolt<00:00:21.449> written<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
a lot of a thunderbolt written on the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.700 
a lot of a thunderbolt written on the
wall<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.570> later<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.930> level<00:00:25.470> which

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
wall at later on in level which

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.620 
wall at later on in level which
obviously<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.130> only<00:00:26.519> see<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.269> nazi

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
obviously you only see in the nazi

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.720 
obviously you only see in the nazi
zombie<00:00:28.019> genre<00:00:28.230> game<00:00:28.890> because<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.519> where

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
zombie genre game because that's where

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 
zombie genre game because that's where
they<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:30.179> all<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> guns<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> wall<00:00:31.439> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
they put all the guns on the wall you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
they put all the guns on the wall you
can<00:00:31.679> purchase<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.160> from<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> wall<00:00:32.610> so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
can purchase them from the wall so

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.080 
can purchase them from the wall so
basically<00:00:33.840> my<00:00:34.430> reasoning<00:00:35.430> behind<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.850> was

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
basically my reasoning behind this was

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.000 
basically my reasoning behind this was
the<00:00:36.239> fact<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.350> remember<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the fact that if you remember back to

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.549 
the fact that if you remember back to
world<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.640> war<00:00:38.969> there's<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.930> hard<00:00:40.170> landing

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
world at war there's the hard landing

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
world at war there's the hard landing
level<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> Peleliu<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.660> get

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
level of on Peleliu you actually can get

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.880 
level of on Peleliu you actually can get
a<00:00:42.960> ray<00:00:43.379> gun<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.719> this<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.989> put<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.710> game

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
a ray gun now this was put into the game

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.880 
a ray gun now this was put into the game
in<00:00:47.460> World<00:00:47.700> War<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.870> developers<00:00:49.770> were

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
in World War when the developers were

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.430 
in World War when the developers were
doing<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> beta<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.910> zombie<00:00:51.510> maps<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.020> they

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
doing a beta for zombie maps and they

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
doing a beta for zombie maps and they
didn't<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.890> any<00:00:53.039> animations<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
didn't have any animations for the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
didn't have any animations for the
actual<00:00:55.079> people<00:00:55.440> walking<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.280> they

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
actual people walking you know they

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.639 
actual people walking you know they
didn't<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:56.820> hire<00:00:57.629> any<00:00:57.989> access<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.410> do

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
didn't actually hire any access to do

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.560 
didn't actually hire any access to do
any<00:00:58.890> walking<00:00:59.070> animations<00:00:59.789> further<00:01:00.120> zombie

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
any walking animations further zombie

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.420 
any walking animations further zombie
mode<00:01:00.780> until<00:01:00.989> later<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> development

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
mode until later on in the development

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.880 
mode until later on in the development
so<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> beta<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.809> used<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.350> animations

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so as a beta they used the animations

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
so as a beta they used the animations
that<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.129> had<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.729> few<00:01:05.939> more<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.450> strike

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that they had from a few more to strike

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
that they had from a few more to strike
the<00:01:06.930> peleliu<00:01:07.380> Beach<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> Japanese

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the peleliu Beach of all the Japanese

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.870 
the peleliu Beach of all the Japanese
soldiers<00:01:09.689> wandering<00:01:10.200> around<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> daze<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
soldiers wandering around in a daze that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
soldiers wandering around in a daze that
sort<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> were<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> original<00:01:13.020> animations

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
sort of were the original animations

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800 
sort of were the original animations
they<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:13.950> their<00:01:14.250> zombie<00:01:14.670> map<00:01:15.270> testing

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
they use for their zombie map testing

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.630 
they use for their zombie map testing
when<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.080> were<00:01:16.200> developing<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> game<00:01:16.799> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
when they were developing the game so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
when they were developing the game so
that's<00:01:17.820> why<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.119> put<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> ray<00:01:18.509> gun<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.869> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that's why they put the ray gun in that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.749 
that's why they put the ray gun in that
