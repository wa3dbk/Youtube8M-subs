small<00:00:57.200> sitting<00:00:58.130> Eagles<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:59.420> I<00:01:00.110> consulted<00:01:01.070> with

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.969 
my consultant at cadu in Cardiff Wales
and<00:01:07.340> we<00:01:08.180> decided<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:09.049> it<00:01:09.409> would<00:01:09.560> be<00:01:09.710> better

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
and we decided that it would be better

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.590 
and we decided that it would be better
to<00:01:10.840> ring<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.140> Eagle<00:01:12.890> tower<00:01:13.189> with<00:01:13.609> dark<00:01:14.299> gray

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
to ring the Eagle tower with dark gray

owls<00:01:18.049> I<00:01:18.609> think<00:01:19.609> that<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:19.850> parrot<00:01:20.149> can<00:01:20.329> pass

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
owls I think that the parrot can pass

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.300

more<00:01:20.749> is<00:01:20.929> any<00:01:21.140> kind<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.469> bird<00:01:21.649> almost<00:01:21.890> right

more is any kind of bird almost right
exactly<00:01:22.819> yes<00:01:23.289> so<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.939> original<00:01:25.939> castle<00:01:26.210> began

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
exactly yes so the original castle began

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.919 
exactly yes so the original castle began
with<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.319> Eagle<00:01:27.619> tower<00:01:27.859> and<00:01:28.539> went<00:01:29.539> to<00:01:29.810> the

at<00:01:44.959> the<00:01:45.139> corner<00:01:45.469> over<00:01:45.649> there<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.280> that<00:01:46.909> was

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
at the corner over there and that was

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.050 
at the corner over there and that was
the<00:01:47.270> original<00:01:47.840> castle<00:01:48.670> until<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.880> was

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
the original castle until it was

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.289 
the original castle until it was
captured<00:01:50.810> by<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.049> Welsh<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:52.299> approximately

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
captured by the Welsh in approximately

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.649 
captured by the Welsh in approximately
twelve<00:01:54.170> ninety-three<00:01:54.799> okay<00:01:55.759> very<00:01:55.999> cool<00:01:56.329> so

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
twelve ninety-three okay very cool so

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.569 
twelve ninety-three okay very cool so
now<00:01:56.810> one<00:01:57.529> of<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.709> things<00:01:57.920> about<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.159> build<00:01:58.399> this

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
now one of the things about a build this

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.279 
now one of the things about a build this
large<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.029> that<00:01:59.060> it<00:01:59.479> would<00:01:59.959> be<00:02:00.079> near

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
large is that it would be near

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.620 
large is that it would be near
impossible<00:02:00.319> to<00:02:00.889> transport<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.579> together<00:02:02.119> so

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
impossible to transport it together so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.480 
impossible to transport it together so
how<00:02:02.899> does<00:02:02.959> it<00:02:03.170> break<00:02:03.319> down<00:02:03.590> for<00:02:03.770> transit<00:02:04.279> if<00:02:04.369> it

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
how does it break down for transit if it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.529 
how does it break down for transit if it
does<00:02:04.700> there<00:02:05.240> are<00:02:05.509> six<00:02:06.200> major<00:02:06.499> pieces<00:02:07.539> since

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
does there are six major pieces since

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.410 
does there are six major pieces since

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
level the splits are fairly easy to see

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.250 
level the splits are fairly easy to see
not<00:02:17.220> nearly<00:02:17.460> as<00:02:17.670> easy<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.000> see<00:02:18.300> at<00:02:18.450> home<00:02:18.660> where
