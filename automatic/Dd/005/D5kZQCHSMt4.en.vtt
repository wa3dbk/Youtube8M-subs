00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.059 

well<00:00:03.850> the<00:00:03.909> problem<00:00:04.090> for<00:00:04.359> all<00:00:04.480> aircraft<00:00:05.069> is

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069 
well the problem for all aircraft is

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.240 
well the problem for all aircraft is
that<00:00:06.759> when<00:00:07.270> flying<00:00:07.540> at<00:00:07.720> night<00:00:08.100> the<00:00:09.100> lights

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
that when flying at night the lights

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.459 
that when flying at night the lights
inside<00:00:09.700> the<00:00:09.850> cockpit<00:00:10.030> are<00:00:10.420> always<00:00:11.200> turned

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
inside the cockpit are always turned

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.440 
inside the cockpit are always turned
down<00:00:11.679> very<00:00:11.950> dim<00:00:12.250> so<00:00:12.549> that<00:00:12.700> the<00:00:12.790> pilots<00:00:13.179> eyes

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
down very dim so that the pilots eyes

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.990 
down very dim so that the pilots eyes
can<00:00:13.780> adjust<00:00:14.110> to<00:00:14.349> the<00:00:14.860> light<00:00:15.190> levels<00:00:15.639> inside

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
can adjust to the light levels inside

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.630 
can adjust to the light levels inside
the<00:00:16.059> aircraft<00:00:16.540> and<00:00:16.990> those<00:00:17.259> outside<00:00:17.770> so<00:00:18.610> that

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
the aircraft and those outside so that

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.179 
the aircraft and those outside so that
they<00:00:19.630> can<00:00:19.810> see<00:00:20.020> both<00:00:20.500> inside<00:00:20.920> and<00:00:20.949> outside

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
they can see both inside and outside

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.910 
they can see both inside and outside
clearly<00:00:21.760> what<00:00:22.660> happens<00:00:23.050> with<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.350> lasers<00:00:23.769> is

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
clearly what happens with the lasers is

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.859 
clearly what happens with the lasers is
that<00:00:24.130> when<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.279> very<00:00:24.640> very<00:00:24.910> bright<00:00:25.269> light<00:00:25.570> is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
that when a very very bright light is

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.960 
that when a very very bright light is
then<00:00:26.349> introduced<00:00:26.830> into<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.279> cockpit<00:00:27.730> in<00:00:27.880> a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
then introduced into the cockpit in a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.710 
then introduced into the cockpit in a
way<00:00:28.150> that's<00:00:28.449> not<00:00:28.720> controlled<00:00:29.199> by<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.439> pilot

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
way that's not controlled by the pilot

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200 
way that's not controlled by the pilot
it's<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:32.050> can<00:00:32.439> really<00:00:32.890> disorientate<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.879> pilot

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
it's a can really disorientate the pilot

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.660 
it's a can really disorientate the pilot
and<00:00:34.360> crew<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.839> have<00:00:35.559> really<00:00:36.070> very<00:00:36.309> dangerous

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
and crew and have really very dangerous

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.910 
and crew and have really very dangerous
consequences<00:00:36.970> for<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.510> aircraft<00:00:37.870> but<00:00:38.830> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
consequences for the aircraft but the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.799 
consequences for the aircraft but the
problem<00:00:39.100> has<00:00:39.400> increasingly<00:00:40.089> grown<00:00:40.540> in<00:00:40.780> recent

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
problem has increasingly grown in recent

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.689 
problem has increasingly grown in recent
years<00:00:42.030> didn't<00:00:43.030> used<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:43.269> happen<00:00:43.479> very<00:00:44.350> much

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
years didn't used to happen very much

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.549 
years didn't used to happen very much
but<00:00:45.699> with<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.000> advent<00:00:46.150> of<00:00:46.479> cheap<00:00:46.559> handheld

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
but with the advent of cheap handheld

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.280 
but with the advent of cheap handheld
lasers<00:00:48.040> available<00:00:48.519> on<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.699> internet<00:00:49.290> very

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
lasers available on the internet very

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.579 
lasers available on the internet very
often<00:00:50.500> from<00:00:50.890> outside<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.369> UK<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.900> problem<00:00:53.350> is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
often from outside the UK the problem is

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.090 
often from outside the UK the problem is
getting<00:00:54.659> much<00:00:55.659> worse<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.260> it's<00:00:56.799> really

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
getting much worse and it's really

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.560 
getting much worse and it's really
gathered<00:00:57.519> pace<00:00:57.699> in<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.000> last<00:00:58.180> couple<00:00:58.420> of

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
gathered pace in the last couple of

gathered pace in the last couple of
years<00:00:59.100> aircraft<00:01:00.100> are<00:01:00.280> now<00:01:00.369> routinely<00:01:00.640> being

years aircraft are now routinely being
targeted<00:01:01.989> with<00:01:02.140> lasers<00:01:02.589> and<00:01:02.799> very<00:01:03.100> dangerous

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519

the<00:01:04.510> pilots<00:01:04.960> attention<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.619> immediately

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
the pilots attention is immediately

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.220 
the pilots attention is immediately
taken<00:01:07.000> away<00:01:07.450> from<00:01:07.510> what<00:01:07.930> they're<00:01:08.110> actually

they're used to inside the cockpit that

they're used to inside the cockpit that
they<00:01:26.080> are<00:01:26.470> immediately<00:01:27.040> unable<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:28.030> do

anything other than focus on the laser

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.270 
anything other than focus on the laser
it's<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.300> criminal<00:01:31.630> offense<00:01:31.930> punishable<00:01:32.860> by

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
it's a criminal offense punishable by

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's a criminal offense punishable by
imprisonment<00:01:34.950> people<00:01:35.950> on<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.070> ground<00:01:36.220> may

imprisonment people on the ground may

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.310 
imprisonment people on the ground may
not<00:01:36.730> know<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.480> this<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.780> actually<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.170> case

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
not know that this is actually the case

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.250 
not know that this is actually the case
and<00:01:39.250> certainly<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.790> lot<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.570> youngsters<00:01:40.810> who

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
and certainly a lot of youngsters who

and certainly a lot of youngsters who

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
use lasers in this way very often have

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.000 
use lasers in this way very often have
no<00:01:43.960> idea<00:01:44.290> that<00:01:44.440> they're<00:01:44.560> committing<00:01:44.920> an

no idea that they're committing an

offence but they are a very serious one
if<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:48.010> consider<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.610> many<00:01:48.850> aircraft<00:01:49.090> that
