00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello friends I am angel pocket 01 and al 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.699
 Finally one of the most important sets arrived 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.949
 expected of armor and finally came the 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.480
 cream are combat and a and well at least 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.970
 It is one of the most anticipated by me 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.160
 because for a simple reason you will see 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.080
 later 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.110
 all right 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.720
 let's start with the box 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.560
 I do not know if you 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.840
 have seen that before the boxes were more 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.440
 simple less elaborate was only 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.100
 plastic was more plastic than cardboard and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 now they do not know is not it 's not so bad of 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.589
 fact is a good detail only that I feel 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.750
 previously they retained more 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.070
 originality of half prox but good 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.220
 any change is good 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.180
 well here we can see how is the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.059
 drawing of the armory itself the two 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.100
 big and the elite with a sword of 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:11.040
 energy is from the girl armor and clear and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.990
 has 47 pieces is the number 9 702 8 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.060
 Well there you can get it in 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.490
 blockbuster to 209 pesos 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 let's go around the set 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.140
 the description says the actress shawn 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.780
 camber 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.840
 prepares an elite cape crimson a 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.220
 sort of great ground and a great for the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.289
 battle with a complete kobenan armory 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.750
 arm your drums with kobenan weapons 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.750
 advanced and adapts to your sagging lead 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.020
 as never before with the pilot helmet 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.030
 alternate the armor honor guard and the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.280
 energy state 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.119
 they made a mistake to compose this one 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 should be word or in itself the sword of 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.130
 good energy here we can see the cost 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.439
 qualifications 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.020
 personally this is my favorite the 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.450
 third 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:11.360
 here we can see how it would look like armed 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:15.530
 Launches another set the nap brut 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.530
 the armory of the unece combat 1 and the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.530
 armory of the govern 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.050
 here are the characters and good many 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.600
 box now let's take command 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.320
 There are seven easy steps 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.360
 in about five minutes they are finished 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.800
 eight forgiveness 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.800
 and well that would be 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.209
 this back but well let's pass something 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.209
 interesting 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.760
 to the best of all the armory let's start 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.659
 with the drones and let's leave for the end 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.519
 here we can see a spectrum exactly 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.140
 like that of the towers only this time 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.709
 is in red brings the same weapon and times 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.659
 the same size now all the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.150
 characters bring with a mini base for 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.290
 put them 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:17.260
 here we can see him crimson ground that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.260
 brings two plasma grenades 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.610
 this crimson ground is exactly the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.220
 Same color and exactly the same 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.190
 details that the one in the first bar is 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.020
 that only now is bigger and so 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.480
 is the new design of during but in 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.090
 everything else is the same 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.849
 here we can see the armory we can see 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.180
 that here has a logo covenant here the 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.700
 parts that can be customized to raise 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.849
 the ruler is at the head of the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.299
 pilot of the camber of the legs 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.430
 on this side are the arms and here a 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.549
 Stinger rifle exactly like 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:01.069
 the spain's nothing is detailed it's just 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:04.010
 the curl the good sting the curious thing about 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.010
 the trees is that you can flip the 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.629
 thanks to having these connectors 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.829
 they go one way and one becomes like that 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.829
 occupies less space 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.250
 but let's move on to what really 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.250
 matter 'in the video 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.850
 the honor of and this is why I have 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.400
 been waiting at least me for 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.600
 too much time here we can see the 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.410
 spear 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.410
 let's see the more detailed 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.900
 from above it looks like this is not that I 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.900
 has bent but that's the way 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.410
 It has all its golden details and 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.289
 black and it's perfect to get in 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.499
 both hands of the elite 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.490
 but good now let's move to the elite brings 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.490
 an energy sword 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.460
 and the leader if it is this we can see here 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.050
 the head with the details of the guard 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.220
 of honor these two 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.800
 good 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.190
 those two horns that you have there that 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.520
 they have golden details and a little 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.740
 black details 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.800
 there you can see the jaw that is 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.480
 golden and just between the hull and the 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.090
 jaw is the eye 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.440
 well here we can also see the 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.440
 golden details 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.409
 Y 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.610
 now let's go to the arms have the 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:43.430
 same type d 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.710
 protuberances that the helmet 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.230
 and the protuberances are flexible 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.370
 they have the same details and another 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.370
 golden detail here 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.390
 They have more details on the wrist 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.580
 and then the body is the same so the 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:06.169
 torso so do not change the arm 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.169
 left is the same 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:12.119
 here behind him and I forgot 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.119
 tell them has a little golden detail 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.730
 now let's move legs to legs 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:24.240
 they are totally new good almost in their 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:27.569
 totality as we can see here 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.030
 has more golden details and this is no longer 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.680
 goes where it is supposed to be 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.470
 lilly knee but it goes a little 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.650
 further down now it's longer too 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.810
 These legs are changed and the details 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.860
 reds no longer occupy all of his foot and 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.319
 now it's only in one part 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.310
 on the other leg is exactly what 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:51.990
 same 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:54.530
 and well this link looks very good next 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.530
 of the inquisitor 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.150
 obviously with its respective 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.150
 so 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.009
 with his spear 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:15.180
 and well this is the grÃ­msson combo 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:23.569
 this is all it brings for 209 pesos 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:25.950
 waiting for an honor guard 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:28.110
 it's quite worth it 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:31.530
 up to here the video today I am an angel 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.840
