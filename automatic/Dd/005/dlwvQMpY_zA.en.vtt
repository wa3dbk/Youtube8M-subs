because I took out a piece from inside

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.580 
because I took out a piece from inside
this<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.760> faster<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:38.210> yeah<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:40.230> let's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
this to make it faster so yeah so let's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
this to make it faster so yeah so let's
try<00:00:41.190> testing<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:53.809> what<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:54.960> gonna

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
try testing it out so what we're gonna

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.650 
try testing it out so what we're gonna
do<00:00:55.350> we're<00:00:55.770> gonna<00:00:55.860> take<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.489> launcher<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
do we're gonna take this launcher this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.290 
do we're gonna take this launcher this
is<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:59.070> took<00:00:59.789> out<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> piece

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
is the one that's I took out a piece

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.070 
is the one that's I took out a piece
from<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> makes<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.350> much<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.430> smoother<00:01:03.390> like

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
from it makes it much more smoother like

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.190 
from it makes it much more smoother like
you<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.880> hear<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> noise<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.780> cuz<00:01:07.020> it's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you you hear a noise here cuz it's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
you you hear a noise here cuz it's
hitting<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.650> thing<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:09.060> in

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
hitting a thing like when it's going in

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
hitting a thing like when it's going in
circles<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.900> yeah<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.830> like

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
circles it's going yeah so it's like

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.960 
circles it's going yeah so it's like
dragging<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:13.159> thing<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.400> took<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.909> out

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
dragging on this thing I took that out

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
dragging on this thing I took that out
so<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> could<00:01:15.689> go<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:16.110> faster<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:18.080> yeah<00:01:19.110> at

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
so I could go a lot faster and yeah at

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
so I could go a lot faster and yeah at
first<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.860> won't<00:01:19.979> work<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.340> well<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.150> then

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
first it won't work that well but then

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
first it won't work that well but then
when<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.140> start<00:01:22.409> using<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.310> launch<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
when you start using it and launch it

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
when you start using it and launch it
will<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.970> used<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.479> using<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.080> beyblade

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
will get used to using your beyblade

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:35.749 
will get used to using your beyblade
like<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:27.380> first<00:01:28.380> let<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:29.030> show<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:34.759> one

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
and okay use it like normal Babli just

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.539 
and okay use it like normal Babli just
mixed<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> few<00:01:45.570> pieces<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.490> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
mixed up the few pieces so then you just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.819 
mixed up the few pieces so then you just
twirl<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.240> normal<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:51.140> um<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.680> it's

twirl it like normal and um you see it's

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
twirl it like normal and um you see it's
more<00:01:53.780> like<00:01:55.009> it's<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.369> aggressive<00:01:57.170> because

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
more like it's more aggressive because

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.219 
more like it's more aggressive because
it<00:01:58.500> goes<00:01:58.649> faster<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.790> look<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.960> right

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
orange one actually has a better tip and

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.210 
orange one actually has a better tip and
spin<00:04:12.940> track<00:04:13.269> because<00:04:13.810> I<00:04:13.840> mixed<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.620> one<00:04:14.799> up<00:04:14.980> I

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
spin track because I mixed that one up I

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.360 
spin track because I mixed that one up I

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.790 
this launcher and the baby fell on that
one<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.730> we'll<00:04:28.330> do<00:04:28.540> another<00:04:28.570> one<00:04:29.200> in<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.500> sec

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
one so we'll do another one in a sec

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.970 
one so we'll do another one in a sec
sorry<00:04:30.250> about<00:04:30.700> that

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
sorry about that

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.510 
sorry about that
but<00:04:32.980> it's<00:04:33.640> kind<00:04:34.390> of<00:04:34.600> easy<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.590> say<00:04:36.040> cause<00:04:36.370> you

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
but it's kind of easy to say cause you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.020 
but it's kind of easy to say cause you
can<00:04:36.670> see<00:04:36.880> it's<00:04:37.060> losing<00:04:37.360> spin<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.790> but<00:04:39.790> you

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
can see it's losing spin but but you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.150 
can see it's losing spin but but you
never<00:04:40.270> know<00:04:40.570> maybe<00:04:41.020> at<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.350> last<00:04:41.560> second

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
never know maybe at the last second

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.030 
never know maybe at the last second
you'll<00:04:42.640> it's<00:04:43.510> now<00:04:43.930> getting<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.500> little<00:04:44.770> tight

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
you'll it's now getting a little tight

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.400 
you'll it's now getting a little tight
but<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.370> really<00:04:45.940> because<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.840> can<00:04:46.990> see<00:04:47.200> that

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
but not really because you can see that

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.560 
but not really because you can see that
-<00:04:48.070> like<00:04:48.790> that<00:04:49.060> right<00:04:49.300> there

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
- like that right there

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.910 
- like that right there
and<00:04:49.950> that<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.280> looks<00:04:51.490> smoother<00:04:52.650> but<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:53.770> was

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
and that it looks smoother but I was

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.690 
and that it looks smoother but I was
kind<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.370> close<00:04:54.760> actually<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.070> this

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
kind of close actually because and this

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.620 
kind of close actually because and this
hit<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.560> thing<00:04:59.560> so<00:05:00.840> let's<00:05:01.840> try<00:05:02.170> we've<00:05:02.500> done

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
hit that thing so let's try we've done

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.390 
hit that thing so let's try we've done
this<00:05:04.630> again<00:05:05.350> it's<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.740> same<00:05:05.770> thing<00:05:06.010> the

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
this again it's the same thing the

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.260 
this again it's the same thing the
normal<00:05:06.820> launcher<00:05:07.240> is<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.510> red<00:05:08.100> gold<00:05:09.100> one<00:05:09.370> and

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
normal launcher is the red gold one and

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.440 
normal launcher is the red gold one and
then<00:05:10.450> the<00:05:10.800> clear<00:05:11.800> one<00:05:11.980> is<00:05:12.100> this<00:05:12.250> one<00:05:14.880> let's<00:05:15.880> try

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
then the clear one is this one let's try

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.780 
then the clear one is this one let's try
launching<00:05:16.930> this<00:05:17.320> one<00:05:17.590> first<00:05:17.890> again<00:05:18.220> they'll

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
launching this one first again they'll

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.350 
launching this one first again they'll
get<00:05:19.060> a<00:05:19.090> little<00:05:19.360> bit<00:05:19.690> harder<00:05:20.110> to<00:05:20.920> show<00:05:21.130> you

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
get a little bit harder to show you

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.010 
get a little bit harder to show you
potential<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:28.270> was<00:05:28.420> actually<00:05:28.840> very

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
potential that was actually very

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.470 
potential that was actually very
aggressive<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:29.860> could've<00:05:30.160> beat<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.730> normal

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
aggressive that could've beat a normal

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.450 
aggressive that could've beat a normal
beyblade<00:05:32.490> but<00:05:33.490> let's<00:05:34.000> see<00:05:34.270> this<00:05:34.600> could<00:05:35.460> affect

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
beyblade but let's see this could affect

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.720 
beyblade but let's see this could affect
it<00:05:37.090> it's<00:05:37.750> stabilized<00:05:38.500> actually<00:05:39.070> because<00:05:39.550> what

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
it it's stabilized actually because what

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.630 
it it's stabilized actually because what
happened<00:05:40.180> was<00:05:40.590> when<00:05:41.590> I<00:05:41.620> launched<00:05:42.130> it<00:05:42.220> started

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
happened was when I launched it started

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.040 
happened was when I launched it started
going<00:05:42.790> like<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:43.600> circle<00:05:44.170> it<00:05:44.530> him<00:05:44.980> and<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:46.420> whoo

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
going like a circle it him and the whoo

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.880 
going like a circle it him and the whoo
that<00:05:47.470> was<00:05:47.620> a<00:05:47.650> good<00:05:48.100> hit<00:05:49.030> right<00:05:49.510> there<00:05:49.890> with

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
that was a good hit right there with

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.010 
that was a good hit right there with
this<00:05:51.190> one<00:05:51.430> it<00:05:52.030> was<00:05:52.240> more<00:05:52.420> aggressive<00:05:52.720> because

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
this one it was more aggressive because

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.830 
this one it was more aggressive because
of<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.440> launcher<00:05:53.860> again<00:05:54.210> but<00:05:55.210> you<00:05:55.480> know<00:05:55.510> all

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
of the launcher again but you know all

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.450 
of the launcher again but you know all
is<00:05:55.990> about<00:05:56.230> the<00:05:56.440> launcher<00:05:56.890> it's<00:05:57.100> also<00:05:57.250> about

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
is about the launcher it's also about

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.610 
is about the launcher it's also about
the<00:05:57.700> bay<00:05:57.880> but<00:05:58.390> mostly<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:58.930> launcher<00:05:59.350> and<00:05:59.500> how

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
the bay but mostly the launcher and how

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.950 
the bay but mostly the launcher and how
you<00:06:00.180> set<00:06:01.180> it<00:06:01.300> go<00:06:01.480> because<00:06:02.440> if<00:06:02.920> you<00:06:03.190> do<00:06:03.400> a<00:06:03.960> crappy

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
you set it go because if you do a crappy

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.490 
you set it go because if you do a crappy
launch<00:06:05.800> then<00:06:06.490> your<00:06:06.880> bay<00:06:07.360> will<00:06:07.630> just<00:06:07.900> be<00:06:08.260> bad

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
launch then your bay will just be bad

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.090 
launch then your bay will just be bad
but<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.280> could<00:06:09.460> see<00:06:09.670> here<00:06:10.000> that<00:06:10.660> even<00:06:11.620> though

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
but you could see here that even though

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.100 
but you could see here that even though
the<00:06:12.760> bay<00:06:13.030> was<00:06:13.300> right<00:06:13.540> here

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
the bay was right here

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.040 
the bay was right here
this<00:06:14.500> one<00:06:14.800> came<00:06:15.040> in<00:06:15.100> and<00:06:15.520> knocked<00:06:16.510> this<00:06:16.810> one

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
this one came in and knocked this one

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.180 
this one came in and knocked this one
here<00:06:17.380> and<00:06:17.620> then<00:06:18.190> it<00:06:18.370> went<00:06:18.580> like<00:06:18.760> that<00:06:18.790> and<00:06:20.190> even

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
here and then it went like that and even

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.640 
here and then it went like that and even
if<00:06:22.000> it<00:06:22.210> knocked<00:06:22.450> it<00:06:22.690> to<00:06:22.720> the<00:06:22.960> wall<00:06:23.170> it's<00:06:23.350> still

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
if it knocked it to the wall it's still

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.520 
if it knocked it to the wall it's still
one<00:06:23.890> because<00:06:24.600> not<00:06:25.600> just<00:06:25.630> because<00:06:26.080> of<00:06:26.110> a<00:06:26.320> bay

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
one because not just because of a bay

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.620 
one because not just because of a bay
before<00:06:26.890> the<00:06:28.440> everything<00:06:29.440> in<00:06:29.650> it<00:06:29.800> so<00:06:30.630> that's

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
before the everything in it so that's

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.689 
before the everything in it so that's
how<00:06:32.500> you<00:06:32.560> have<00:06:32.860> it

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
how you have it

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.969 
how you have it
and<00:06:34.270> again<00:06:34.509> they're<00:06:34.719> the<00:06:34.840> same<00:06:35.020> be<00:06:35.289> a<00:06:35.590> little

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
and again they're the same be a little

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.149 
and again they're the same be a little
bit<00:06:36.129> so<00:06:36.849> you<00:06:37.330> just<00:06:37.599> look<00:06:38.259> at<00:06:38.409> my<00:06:38.560> other<00:06:38.740> video

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
bit so you just look at my other video

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:45.450 
bit so you just look at my other video
to<00:06:39.449> see<00:06:40.449> how<00:06:41.080> you<00:06:41.949> change<00:06:42.879> inside<00:06:43.569> and<00:06:43.979> out<00:06:44.979> and

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
to see how you change inside and out and

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.659 
to see how you change inside and out and
I<00:06:45.939> compared<00:06:46.719> inside<00:06:47.259> of<00:06:47.499> them<00:06:47.680> both<00:06:48.400> of<00:06:48.460> them

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
I compared inside of them both of them

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.239 
I compared inside of them both of them
so<00:06:49.479> that's<00:06:50.020> pretty<00:06:50.319> much<00:06:50.409> it<00:06:50.560> and<00:06:50.919> it<00:06:51.069> also

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:51.249 
so that's pretty much it and it also

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:53.279 
so that's pretty much it and it also
teaches<00:06:51.639> you<00:06:51.999> how<00:06:52.120> to<00:06:52.150> change<00:06:52.810> colors<00:06:53.169> just

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
teaches you how to change colors just

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.920 
teaches you how to change colors just
please<00:06:53.680> you<00:06:54.039> just<00:06:54.120> they<00:06:55.120> just<00:06:55.360> fit<00:06:55.569> right<00:06:55.749> in

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:58.029

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.879 
sizes but you could do the same thing
with<00:07:04.719> the<00:07:04.840> launcher<00:07:05.199> it's<00:07:05.319> the<00:07:05.409> same<00:07:05.620> thing
