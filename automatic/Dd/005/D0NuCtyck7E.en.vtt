00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and sizes I know it's a lot of work but

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.740 
and sizes I know it's a lot of work but
this<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.719> process<00:00:39.870> much<00:00:40.350> easier

a cover from the grip so we'll cut a

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.569 
a cover from the grip so we'll cut a
sheet<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.780> paper<00:02:04.929> in<00:02:05.110> half<00:02:05.350> then<00:02:05.950> form<00:02:06.340> each

it<00:03:38.690> would<00:03:39.170> actually<00:03:39.350> make<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.800> rifle<00:03:40.070> looks

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
it would actually make the rifle looks

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.360 
it would actually make the rifle looks
better<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.930> can<00:03:42.080> also<00:03:42.230> keep<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.800> place<00:03:43.070> by

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
better you can also keep it in place by

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.580 
better you can also keep it in place by
putting<00:03:43.610> some<00:03:43.970> tape<00:03:44.180> around<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:50.260> now<00:03:51.260> let's

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
putting some tape around it now let's
