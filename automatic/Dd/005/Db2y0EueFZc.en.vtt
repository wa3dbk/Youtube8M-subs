lags<00:03:09.910> like<00:03:10.299> slightly<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.579> kind<00:03:12.910> of

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
lags like slightly but it's kind of

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 
lags like slightly but it's kind of
unnoticeable<00:03:13.870> when<00:03:14.349> you're<00:03:14.530> actually<00:03:14.739> doing

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
unnoticeable when you're actually doing

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.819

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
normally this looks really

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.620 
normally this looks really
unprofessional<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.850> know<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.269> have

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
unprofessional and so you know you have

my whole desktop and it just that just
doesn't<00:03:32.079> look<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.410> bad<00:03:33.069> professional<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.389> if

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
doesn't look that bad professional so if

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.920 
doesn't look that bad professional so if
you<00:03:35.019> go<00:03:35.139> to<00:03:35.200> device<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.130> then<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.940> click
