00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 good albums sold 25 online here 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.319
 we are back with subscribers and we 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.880
 we find in the clouds exactly in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.200
 the clouds we find ourselves 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.740
 we find in the sky eye that I'm going to 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 stop 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.140
 very cool blue 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.550
 very good paint of dry the map is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.470
 breaks the straw has broken 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.599
 you have seen him uncle suddenly has 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.279
 faded mother very lad 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.019
 my mother seriously and I do not know what is there 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.840
 what design architect he was but 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.780
 we go to guilds region he touched on the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 title in the Christmas lottery here 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.730
 we go there is not worth fresh wintour and what 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.800
 is doing perfect if they choose me from 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.600
 I pass the whole map yes without falling 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 very rich for that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.780
 but impossible is one more as is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 perfect 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.660
 very well 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.500
 It will be exactly what I wanted to do 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.340
 eat me the back of the truck 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 I like to suck the leaks understand 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.850
 a lot more 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.560
 and I ate the escape and now I wanted to 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.920
 also test how he knew the part of 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.690
 back was you know and now is when I already 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.550
 I'll move on to yes sir of the 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.530
 bike 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.460
 habits and is that these ten senses 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.460
 guys these days felt 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:42.160
 but I'm never telling me that 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.810
 complicated and the 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.310
 subscribers and it scares me because the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.960
 subscribers we can tolerate and you know 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.170
 what is happening good bye writer 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.770
 of course see you in the Basque 12 or 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.600
 at the end of the year we are going to see a town that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.830
 it's called 12 west but it 's not even 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.170
 God, because we get the pringao 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.600
 madriñán serious guys I'm pretty 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.070
 complicated in that unique area with everything 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.560
 ok but we're going to get it I know 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.560
 we all know it quite motivated 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.670
 and jumps gave today to jump when I do not want 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.350
 that skip knowing is as if as if not 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.430
 It does not help when it pleases and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.730
 loss of what he wants 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.510
 so that we have a lot of kids 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.090
 we face jump we accelerate horse 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.190
 and we jump that simple and now we fall 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.000
 we actually got there by state 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.560
 but what 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.180
 let's do a double jump more 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.180
 profitable because look then 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.530
 from here we arrived not from here we 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.700
 we come jumping in life today the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.520
 subscriber that was here with me a 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.050
 tentative suddenly it stacks up or it 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.120
 he loses the police so it 's me I do not know why 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.380
 what but to the maximum there are three that is the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.239
 bitch which would play this with 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.730
 a lot of people, even though it's not cool either 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.180
 because if people do not put on 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.730
 impossible 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.050
 eye to have jump not what is this or 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.730
 double jump or shit seems to happen 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.560
 the quick points and lets make the fool 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.910
 It is difficult to say it is difficult because 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.890
 is the ways to break up are 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.800
 planes it would be easy but jimmy like 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.950
 a kind of stopper cited from yogurt 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.230
 and it 's a bit complicated ojito ojito 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.150
 ojito ojito ojito ojito ojito ojito 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.480
 ojito ojito that they give him for sac the 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.010
 things those weird plugs and we caught the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.390
 point my friends we caught the point and not 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.290
 we know because if I do not I can never 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.269
 do things ethically 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.879
 the first ones and they are 22 control points 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.879
 I hope you're telling me uncle 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.189
 we are with 22 control points I think 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.390
 that is not even with other private life 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.909
 ok but calm 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.019
 peaceful quiet 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.019
 but no 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.489
 we have the puntazo we have it but 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.439
 we have the point that is what it is that what 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.989
 that cool is not worth that I certainly 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.700
 spent the last Christmas is my mother 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.549
 boy today I sing to a dad 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.790
 noeles sang him 2.0 go let's go let's go 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.139
 come on you have to jump down highlight 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.019
 for somewhat complicated rivas really 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.539
 you'll tell me today I almost like to contain 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.870
 but not well the point is adjusted 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.870
 work 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.789
 do not 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.540
 in sight the position that has remained 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.380
 uncle stays a plan like in position 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.170
 fetal 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.400
 about the same as I had little but I 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.940
 it does not matter how fetal one to record 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.860
 thanks now let's go let's go let's go to 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.050
 good flip that's going to feel little 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.940
 likely that I make boy who wanted the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:53.800
 point is to catch the puntazo the 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.800
 I point the point I think so 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.570
 my character seriously those Christmases 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.370
 as more machine we still stop a 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.100
 I jump down and do a backflip 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.260
 lateral reality I do not know what it's called the 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.810
 the acrobatics go for a spin as 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.070
 a clip with a bike dude I do not know how 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.050
 an odd turn I do not know what it's called 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.400
 second does not matter the fact is that we are going to 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.840
 win chivas is super cool map 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.040
 towards I do not know what happened but that as 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.470
 I say no but that only the limit was 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.150
 for three and some there are two I do not know why 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.530
 suddenly there were a thousand and since 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.940
 hit the bump is that what happened 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.500
 ahead did not suddenly stop the uncle 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.090
 like he left he knows about the courage of 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.920
 said until later and I do not know why 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.570
 really but good the fact is that I 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.650
 lack he is having to stop and how it happened I 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.650
 for now from your site 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.620
 interesting in the beginning because no 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.270
 they make a career that is only 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.410
 parkour and without running and without having to 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.560
 walk because through the streets that this 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.810
 I like it 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.480
 the creators of games in plan 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.480
 parkour but active the one with the racket 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.680
 play with subscribers 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.000
 and well, I was first today 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.800
 there was a person that was me because he is 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.210
 a very bulky but good result 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.190
 case that I was chatting, which is what 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.600
 It helps, well, you know, we leave the 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.860
 favorites and like to leave comments 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.300
 copies of this ramis internet that I 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.290
 has enchanted life as we see each other in the 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.290
 next video goodbye
