00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
because this is something that was

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.790

far<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.270> had<00:01:42.570> no<00:01:42.720> idea<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.259> he

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
far as I know I had no idea that he

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.120 
far as I know I had no idea that he
sucked<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.670> wells<00:01:45.509> his<00:01:45.720> DNA<00:01:46.079> made<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.829> himself

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
sucked in wells his DNA made of himself

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.350 
sucked in wells his DNA made of himself
look<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.670> anyways<00:01:48.090> getting<00:01:48.240> back

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
look like that so anyways getting back

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.840 
look like that so anyways getting back
to<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.500> blue<00:01:49.710> streak<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
to this we have this blue streak and it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850 
to this we have this blue streak and it
seems<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.659> singularity<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.500> event

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
seems like the singularity that event

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.340 
seems like the singularity that event
that<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> flash<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.549> trying<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.970> stop<00:01:54.350> he

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
that the flash is trying to stop he

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.499 
that the flash is trying to stop he
stops<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.060> hearing<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.450> a

has his power to change and it's pretty
awesome<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.730> in<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> first<00:03:46.270> season<00:03:46.540> we're

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
awesome that in the first season we're

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.360 
awesome that in the first season we're
left<00:03:46.989> with<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.350> like<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.650> know<00:03:47.770> him<00:03:47.980> jumping

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
left with that like you know him jumping

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.880 
left with that like you know him jumping
into<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.820> singularity<00:03:49.330> and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
into the singularity and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.160 
into the singularity and
to<00:03:50.980> happen<00:03:51.160> next<00:03:51.460> so<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:52.240> make<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.810> shorter

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
to happen next so to make it shorter

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.320 
to happen next so to make it shorter
than<00:03:53.200> why<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.530> think<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.520> future

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
than why I think that that is future

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.480 
than why I think that that is future

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
angelic glow about him he's got if you

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.730

number<00:04:14.980> three<00:04:15.010> called<00:04:15.730> slip<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:17.290> can<00:04:17.470> read

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
number three called slip you can read

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.860 
number three called slip you can read
all<00:04:17.890> about<00:04:18.100> this<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:19.090> basically<00:04:19.329> their

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
all about this and and basically their

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.830 
all about this and and basically their
narration<00:04:20.380> of<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.590> trailer<00:04:20.890> pretty<00:04:21.160> much<00:04:21.400> is

narration of the trailer pretty much is

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.690 
narration of the trailer pretty much is
is<00:04:22.840> why<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.350> put<00:04:23.740> two<00:04:23.890> and<00:04:23.919> two<00:04:24.220> together<00:04:24.370> I

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
is why I put two and two together I

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.280 
is why I put two and two together I
figure<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.450> is<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.840> story<00:04:26.110> that

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
figure that this is the story that

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.840 
figure that this is the story that
they're<00:04:26.440> going<00:04:26.590> with<00:04:26.800> all<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.490> say<00:04:27.669> is

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
they're going with all I can say is

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.450 
they're going with all I can say is
future<00:04:28.450> Barry<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.710> present-day<00:04:30.160> Barry

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
future Barry and the present-day Barry

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.900 
future Barry and the present-day Barry
which<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.300> one<00:04:31.450> who<00:04:32.100> was<00:04:33.100> on<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.430> show<00:04:33.460> he

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
which is the one who was on the show he

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.290 
which is the one who was on the show he
trying<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.750> solve<00:04:35.080> something<00:04:35.830> on<00:04:36.070> two<00:04:36.850> ends<00:04:37.240> of

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
trying to solve something on two ends of

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.409 
trying to solve something on two ends of
the<00:04:37.419> spectrum<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:38.760> it's<00:04:39.760> very<00:04:40.030> interesting

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
the spectrum and it's very interesting

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.850 
the spectrum and it's very interesting
how<00:04:40.780> they're<00:04:40.990> going<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.230> me<00:04:41.440> in<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.680> middle

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
how they're going to me in the middle

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.770 
how they're going to me in the middle
but<00:04:42.310> Wally<00:04:42.520> plays<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:42.940> pretty<00:04:43.210> big<00:04:43.390> part<00:04:43.660> in

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
but Wally plays a pretty big part in

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.380 
but Wally plays a pretty big part in
this<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.350> I<00:04:44.950> just<00:04:45.070> think<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.730> it's<00:04:46.060> amazing

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
this and I just think that it's amazing

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.050 
this and I just think that it's amazing
that<00:04:46.720> this<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.200> show<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:48.060> implementing

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
that this this show is is implementing

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.870 
that this this show is is implementing
that<00:04:49.180> now<00:04:49.390> obviously<00:04:50.140> there<00:04:50.350> are<00:04:50.440> other

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
that now obviously there are other

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.950 
that now obviously there are other
candidates<00:04:51.880> on<00:04:52.060> who<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.390> blue<00:04:52.540> streak<00:04:52.780> can

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
candidates on who that blue streak can

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.840 
candidates on who that blue streak can
be<00:04:53.110> kid<00:04:53.470> like<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.860> said<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.160> can<00:04:54.250> be<00:04:54.430> zoo<00:04:54.610> people

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
be kid like I said it can be zoo people

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.150 
be kid like I said it can be zoo people
things<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.330> zoom<00:04:55.570> by<00:04:55.780> honestly<00:04:56.560> zoom<00:04:56.950> does

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
things that zoom by honestly zoom does

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.520 
things that zoom by honestly zoom does
not<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:57.669> don't<00:04:58.000> think<00:04:58.210> he<00:04:58.360> has<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.780> blue<00:04:59.020> the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
not I don't think he has the blue the

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.520 
not I don't think he has the blue the
the<00:04:59.830> blue<00:05:00.220> coloring<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:01.450> could<00:05:01.990> be<00:05:02.140> cobalt

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
the blue coloring and it could be cobalt

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.750 
the blue coloring and it could be cobalt
blue<00:05:02.650> but<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:02.890> don't<00:05:03.070> think<00:05:03.250> he<00:05:03.400> moves<00:05:03.580> that

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
blue but I don't think he moves that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.940 
blue but I don't think he moves that
fast<00:05:04.000> from<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.660> understand<00:05:05.080> cobalt<00:05:05.560> blue<00:05:05.740> has

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.700 
fast from I understand cobalt blue has
the<00:05:06.070> power<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.600> get<00:05:07.600> what<00:05:07.840> his<00:05:07.990> heart<00:05:08.290> desires

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
the power to get what his heart desires

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.680 
the power to get what his heart desires
and<00:05:08.979> to<00:05:09.160> steal<00:05:09.370> speed<00:05:09.700> but<00:05:09.910> I<00:05:10.060> don't<00:05:10.240> ever<00:05:10.390> I

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
and to steal speed but I don't ever I

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.909 
and to steal speed but I don't ever I
don't<00:05:10.870> think<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.320> he<00:05:11.410> could<00:05:11.530> ever<00:05:11.650> match<00:05:11.890> the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
don't think that he could ever match the

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.370 
don't think that he could ever match the
speed<00:05:12.700> that<00:05:12.940> he<00:05:13.240> is<00:05:13.330> running<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.900> obviously

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
speed that he is running and obviously

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.990 
speed that he is running and obviously
if<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.950> would<00:05:15.070> make<00:05:15.190> sense<00:05:15.370> if<00:05:15.580> this<00:05:15.790> was<00:05:15.970> a

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
if it would make sense if this was a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.480 
if it would make sense if this was a
feature<00:05:16.240> flash<00:05:16.570> because<00:05:17.190> Barry's<00:05:18.190> already

feature flash because Barry's already
honed<00:05:18.669> his<00:05:18.760> powers<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.960> future<00:05:20.350> flash<00:05:20.620> is

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
honed his powers and the future flash is

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.640 
honed his powers and the future flash is
a<00:05:21.250> bit<00:05:21.460> cuckoo<00:05:22.169> because<00:05:23.169> of<00:05:23.290> something<00:05:23.500> that

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
a bit cuckoo because of something that

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.710 
a bit cuckoo because of something that
