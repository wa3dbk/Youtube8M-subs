00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
along the road and I noticed them and I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.600 
along the road and I noticed them and I
thought<00:00:41.640> holy<00:00:41.940> smokes<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.690> wonder<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:44.489> was

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.100 
thought holy smokes I wonder and it was
trickier<00:00:45.030> than<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.079> I

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
trickier than you think because what I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
trickier than you think because what I
had<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> film<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.219> manual

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
had to do is film it with manual

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.760 
had to do is film it with manual
settings<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.050> lens<00:00:49.260> wanted<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
settings because the lens wanted to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.410 
settings because the lens wanted to
focus<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> background<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.270> everything

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
focus on the background and everything

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.869 
focus on the background and everything
else<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.460> had<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
else like that so first of all I had to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.660 
else like that so first of all I had to
get<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> flies<00:00:54.539> into<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> viewfinder<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
get the flies into the viewfinder go to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.340 
get the flies into the viewfinder go to
the<00:00:56.850> manual<00:00:57.270> setting<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:57.780> sure<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> could<00:00:58.109> get

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the manual setting make sure I could get

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279 
the manual setting make sure I could get
him<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.559> focus<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.250> then<00:01:00.210> film<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.170> that

emerging<00:01:58.320> technology<00:01:59.280> that's<00:01:59.490> coming<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
emerging technology that's coming to the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.179 
emerging technology that's coming to the
US<00:02:00.570> military<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:03.229> always<00:02:04.229> give<00:02:04.560> permission

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
US military and I always give permission

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.560 
US military and I always give permission
because<00:02:05.399> i<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.299> wonderful

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
because i think it's just so wonderful

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.080 
because i think it's just so wonderful
that<00:02:07.049> people<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:08.129> our<00:02:08.340> videos<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.879> want<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
that people like our videos and want to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.140 
that people like our videos and want to
use<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.910> got

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
use them so this is what we just got

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.580 
use them so this is what we just got
today<00:02:12.540> back<00:02:12.900> from

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
today back from

if<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:06.489> haven't<00:03:06.730> seen<00:03:07.209> an<00:03:07.480> animal<00:03:07.689> flying<00:03:08.290> in

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
if you haven't seen an animal flying in

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.360 
if you haven't seen an animal flying in
slow-mo<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.849> haven't<00:03:10.239> lived<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.920> see<00:03:12.189> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
slow-mo you haven't lived to see the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.580 
slow-mo you haven't lived to see the
detail<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.209> elegance<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:14.049> they<00:03:14.319> can

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
detail and the elegance that they can

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
turn that they can maneuver that they

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.780 
turn that they can maneuver that they
can<00:03:17.200> avoid<00:03:17.319> obstacles<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.459> they<00:03:18.519> can

can avoid obstacles that they can

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.449 
can avoid obstacles that they can
recover<00:03:19.239> when<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.629> perturb<00:03:20.079> them<00:03:20.379> it's<00:03:21.129> just

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
recover when you perturb them it's just

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.099 
recover when you perturb them it's just
unbelievable<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.450> if<00:03:22.629> we<00:03:22.780> can<00:03:22.959> learn

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
unbelievable and if we can learn

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.160 
unbelievable and if we can learn
something<00:03:23.470> from<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.829> when<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:24.489> make

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
something from that when we make
