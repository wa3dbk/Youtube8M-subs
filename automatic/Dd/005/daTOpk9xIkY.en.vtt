started differently because we live in
the<00:01:10.560> Caribbean<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.610> an

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
the Caribbean and because we have an
island<00:01:11.880> life<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.720> much<00:01:12.840> wanted<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
island life so we very much wanted it to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.020 
island life so we very much wanted it to
be<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:13.830> wanted<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> keep<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.700> integrity

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
opportunities and use them to grow

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.010 
opportunities and use them to grow
creatively<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.550> I<00:06:11.610> think<00:06:11.850> that<00:06:12.030> because<00:06:12.900> it

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
creatively and I think that because it

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.570 
creatively and I think that because it
worked<00:06:13.200> out<00:06:13.350> and<00:06:13.530> we<00:06:13.590> got<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:13.860> many<00:06:13.950> pages<00:06:14.400> out

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
worked out and we got so many pages out

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.270 
worked out and we got so many pages out
of<00:06:14.700> it<00:06:14.820> it<00:06:15.090> it<00:06:15.780> was<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.020> successful<00:06:16.800> endeavor

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
of it it it was a successful endeavor

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.880 
of it it it was a successful endeavor
but<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:18.360> could<00:06:18.570> have<00:06:18.660> been<00:06:18.840> awful<00:06:19.260> so<00:06:19.620> there's

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
but it could have been awful so there's

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.550 
but it could have been awful so there's
always<00:06:20.040> that<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:20.640> know<00:06:20.910> sideline<00:06:21.630> but<00:06:21.900> again

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
always that you know sideline but again

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.620 
always that you know sideline but again

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
when you have the support of the team it

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.970 
when you have the support of the team it
really<00:06:24.990> makes<00:06:25.170> a<00:06:25.290> difference
