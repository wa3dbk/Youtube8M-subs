00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
not physical I think it's more bits with

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680 
not physical I think it's more bits with
anything<00:00:31.759> there<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.880> mention<00:00:33.090> fatigue<00:00:33.480> or

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
just back up back up knock off is the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
just back up back up knock off is the
lack<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> focus<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.670> trickling
