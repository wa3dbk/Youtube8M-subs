that vertical management system really

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
that vertical management system really
only<00:01:21.180> looks<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.600> surface<00:01:21.990> appearances<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.890> all

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
only looks at surface appearances so all

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.300 
only looks at surface appearances so all
of<00:01:23.100> our<00:01:23.310> diagnostic<00:01:24.030> codes<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:25.310> appearances

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
of our diagnostic codes are appearances

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
think about it just take ADHD for

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
think about it just take ADHD for
example<00:01:29.509> hyperactive<00:01:30.509> inattentive<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
example hyperactive inattentive and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
diagnosis they have nothing to do with

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.520 
diagnosis they have nothing to do with
brain<00:01:35.909> function<00:01:36.360> whatsoever<00:01:36.659> they're<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
brain function whatsoever they're just

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.950 
brain function whatsoever they're just
the<00:01:37.740> way<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> person<00:01:38.130> looks<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.780> course

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the way a person looks and of course

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.469 
the way a person looks and of course
that<00:01:40.189> encourages<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.369> vertical<00:01:41.909> management

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that encourages this vertical management

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.200 
that encourages this vertical management
system<00:01:43.070> diminishes<00:01:44.070> feedback<00:01:44.579> loops<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.149> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
system diminishes feedback loops so you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.080 
system diminishes feedback loops so you
really<00:01:45.570> don't<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.220> set<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.549> patient<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
really don't get set up with a patient a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.510 
really don't get set up with a patient a
feedback<00:01:48.509> loop<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.079> there's<00:01:49.710> no<00:01:49.920> really

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
feedback loop and there's no really

approach I'm well and let me put it this

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.150 
approach I'm well and let me put it this
way<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.050> looks<00:02:10.259> really<00:02:10.440> basic<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.069> there

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
way if it looks really basic and there

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
way if it looks really basic and there
are<00:02:11.220> no<00:02:11.340> complicating<00:02:11.970> factors<00:02:12.360> yes<00:02:12.569> i'm

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
are no complicating factors yes i'm

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.309 
are no complicating factors yes i'm

education but most of the people come in
with<00:02:15.620> complications<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:16.980> if<00:02:17.280> i<00:02:17.430> ask<00:02:17.609> that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
with complications because if i ask that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.360 
with complications because if i ask that
number<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.389> question<00:02:18.900> then<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.950> whole<00:02:20.099> world

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370

changes dramatically we're going to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.959 
changes dramatically we're going to
review<00:02:22.590> immune<00:02:23.010> dysfunction<00:02:23.249> we're<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:23.909> to

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
review immune dysfunction we're going to

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.360 
review immune dysfunction we're going to
mute<00:02:24.120> review<00:02:24.599> hormones<00:02:25.079> and<00:02:25.409> we're<00:02:26.189> going<00:02:26.310> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
mute review hormones and we're going to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.709 
mute review hormones and we're going to
measure<00:02:26.549> their<00:02:26.790> neurotransmitters

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
measure their neurotransmitters

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.509 
measure their neurotransmitters
precisely<00:02:28.290> before<00:02:28.859> we<00:02:28.950> go<00:02:29.099> ahead<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.280> do

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
precisely before we go ahead and do

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.420 
precisely before we go ahead and do
anything<00:02:29.760> basically<00:02:30.889> quite<00:02:31.889> quite<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.159> bit<00:02:32.340> of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
anything basically quite quite a bit of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.089 
anything basically quite quite a bit of
fun<00:02:32.549> really<00:02:33.379> absolutely<00:02:34.379> yeah<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.709> agree<00:02:34.920> with

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
fun really absolutely yeah I agree with

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.759 
fun really absolutely yeah I agree with
you<00:02:36.349> so<00:02:37.349> as<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.519> result<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.939> that<00:02:39.000> whole<00:02:39.269> thing

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
you so as a result of that whole thing

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.259 
you so as a result of that whole thing
I've<00:02:40.769> changed<00:02:41.129> my<00:02:41.250> practice<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.849> mean<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.150> know

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
I've changed my practice I mean you know

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.629 
I've changed my practice I mean you know
I'm<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:43.079> guy<00:02:43.439> and<00:02:43.469> it's<00:02:43.799> in<00:02:44.189> a<00:02:44.310> really

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
I'm a guy and it's in a really

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.300 
I'm a guy and it's in a really
significant<00:02:45.120> state<00:02:45.299> of<00:02:45.419> transformation<00:02:46.109> now

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
significant state of transformation now

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.690 
significant state of transformation now
I<00:02:47.599> would<00:02:48.599> say<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.019> other<00:02:49.230> thing<00:02:49.530> about<00:02:49.700> where

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
I would say this other thing about where

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.670 
I would say this other thing about where
I'm<00:02:50.879> going<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.299> where<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.510> think<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.109> would

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
I'm going and where I think I would

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.399 
I'm going and where I think I would
encourage<00:02:52.799> all<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.340> us<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.579> think<00:02:54.000> about<00:02:54.409> yes

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
encourage all of us to think about yes

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.479 
encourage all of us to think about yes
people<00:02:55.829> don't<00:02:56.400> use<00:02:56.730> medications<00:02:57.540> correctly

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
people don't use medications correctly

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.369 
people don't use medications correctly
at<00:02:59.489> times<00:02:59.909> and<00:03:00.359> they<00:03:00.569> use<00:03:00.900> them<00:03:01.139> quite

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
at times and they use them quite

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.330 
at times and they use them quite
frivolously<00:03:02.040> based<00:03:02.639> on<00:03:04.069> partly<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:05.219> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
frivolously based on partly on the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.129 
frivolously based on partly on the
diagnostic<00:03:06.150> code<00:03:06.419> so<00:03:06.719> if<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.109> a

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
diagnostic code so if you have a

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.530 
diagnostic code so if you have a
diagnosis<00:03:07.859> that's<00:03:08.129> bipolar<00:03:08.699> than<00:03:09.030> bipolar

Virginia Beach is not that small but but

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.750 
Virginia Beach is not that small but but
many<00:05:22.470> of<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.740> family<00:05:23.040> practitioners<00:05:23.640> are

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
writing for it routinely i think so i

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.660 
writing for it routinely i think so i
think<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:27.090> public<00:05:27.300> changes<00:05:28.070> will<00:05:29.070> ultimately

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
think the public changes will ultimately

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.310 
think the public changes will ultimately
change<00:05:29.970> medicine<00:05:30.450> so<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:30.900> a<00:05:31.170> whole<00:05:31.290> nother

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
change medicine so that's a whole nother

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.500 
change medicine so that's a whole nother
issue<00:05:31.620> but<00:05:32.010> I<00:05:32.070> think<00:05:32.160> comprehensive<00:05:33.090> medicine

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
issue but I think comprehensive medicine

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.840 
issue but I think comprehensive medicine
is<00:05:33.660> where<00:05:34.350> I<00:05:34.380> want<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.650> plant<00:05:34.920> my<00:05:35.160> flag<00:05:35.400> and

is where I want to plant my flag and

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.610 
is where I want to plant my flag and
