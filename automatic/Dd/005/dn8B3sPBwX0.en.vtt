00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.410
 I'm back hello here video with me 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.280
 I thought so because the whole 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.540
 have cool kids 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.580
 Now you have this hashtags your name 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 insert and I want it so cool and me 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
 I want something like that, too 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.500
 hashtag and not with in too 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.880
 be a twitter trend 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.830
 I know that they can not do it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.930
 but it is about the principle and if 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 you do not try then you can not 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.680
 say that it did not work out 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 which in any case I would now like 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.399
 a video series make the hashtags 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:41.820
 camilli is called there super creative me 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.710
 know the abbreviation would be but otherwise 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.480
 is a good idea I think so that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.579
 first video is and none on this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.200
 glorious idea could come that me 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.860
 bind so ingeniously and to a series 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.120
 do the totally new on youtube 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.070
 I ask myself picked out 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.570
 and those are from tumblr and i found those 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.190
 really nice because they are something 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 others are and I just start 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 My favorite ice cream to advise 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.900
 Favorite species are these water ice 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.060
 things and if you like those too 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.439
 you have to rush and if you are 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 do not pay attention then you kick yourself 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.830
 Choco moderately the mouth angle to the mark 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.330
 if you would choose a plant 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.009
 I 've never lived in my life 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.990
 considering which plant I would be but 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.600
 I think I would like to be one 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 Daisies because I think 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.930
 Daisies are the unrated case 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.270
 plant because these grow everywhere 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.979
 they are practically as weeds but they 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.509
 are still pretty you can eat the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.020
 did you know that my daisy 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.720
 salad and you can make flowers 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.549
 make out completely and I think that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.780
 simply awesome daisy best flower 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.119
 Can you cook 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.619
 no i can not cook any of them 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.790
 not lie at all but that is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.700
