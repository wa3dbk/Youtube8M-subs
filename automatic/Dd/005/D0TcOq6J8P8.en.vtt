despite what nikon says is as powerful
as<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> 800s<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.219> doesn't<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.579> thermal

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
advantages believe the 700 has the three

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.340 
advantages believe the 700 has the three
way<00:02:11.780> turning<00:02:12.780> whereas<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:13.440> 800

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
way turning whereas your 800

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.860 
way turning whereas your 800
can<00:02:14.530> only<00:02:14.740> rotate<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.640> side<00:02:15.760> one<00:02:16.360> way<00:02:16.570> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
can only rotate to the side one way and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.300 
can only rotate to the side one way and
it<00:02:16.990> can<00:02:17.110> only<00:02:17.140> go<00:02:17.350> partially<00:02:17.830> decide<00:02:18.160> the

it can only go partially decide the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.250 
it can only go partially decide the
other<00:02:18.460> way<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.240> get<00:02:19.480> full<00:02:19.720> directional

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
other way so you get full directional

other way so you get full directional
rotation<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:22.120> lot<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.540> other<00:02:22.950> advantages<00:02:23.950> I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160

I've<00:02:34.060> gotten<00:02:34.450> away<00:02:34.540> from<00:02:34.630> using<00:02:34.840> those<00:02:35.200> all

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
I've gotten away from using those all

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.410 
I've gotten away from using those all
together<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:36.490> those<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:36.940> need<00:02:37.240> them

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
together for those of you that need them

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.820 
together for those of you that need them
there's<00:02:37.630> ways<00:02:37.810> around<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
there's ways around it you get the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.040 
there's ways around it you get the
little<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.760> little<00:02:39.790> shoe<00:02:40.420> mount<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.870> has

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
little the little shoe mount that has

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.740 
little the little shoe mount that has
the<00:02:41.230> plug-in<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.070> but<00:02:42.880> basically<00:02:43.030> most<00:02:43.540> of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
the plug-in for it but basically most of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.750 
the plug-in for it but basically most of
us<00:02:43.870> are<00:02:44.050> using<00:02:44.320> wireless<00:02:44.740> remote<00:02:45.070> triggers<00:02:45.550> so

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
us are using wireless remote triggers so

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250 
us are using wireless remote triggers so
you<00:02:45.850> don't<00:02:46.090> need<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.780> know<00:02:46.930> they<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.230> a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
you don't need it you know they have a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.460 
you don't need it you know they have a
shoe<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.620> them<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.810> know<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.110> do<00:02:50.290> need

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
shoe on them and you know if you do need

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.340 
shoe on them and you know if you do need
it<00:02:50.620> there's<00:02:50.800> ways<00:02:50.950> around<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.340> too<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.780> so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
it there's ways around that too and so

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.960 
it there's ways around that too and so
he's<00:02:53.560> basically<00:02:53.770> looks<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.880> know

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
he's basically looks like you know

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.800 
he's basically looks like you know
giving<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.390> two<00:02:55.540> thumbs<00:02:55.810> up<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.430> he<00:02:57.940> said<00:02:58.210> what

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
giving it two thumbs up and he said what

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.540 
giving it two thumbs up and he said what
I<00:02:58.840> found<00:02:59.170> was<00:02:59.350> an<00:02:59.500> awesome<00:02:59.740> flash<00:03:00.190> with<00:03:00.460> the

I found was an awesome flash with the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.250 
I found was an awesome flash with the
power<00:03:00.760> control<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.360> options<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:01.960> make<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.230> a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
power control and options that make it a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.830 
power control and options that make it a
must-have<00:03:02.740> for<00:03:02.860> my<00:03:03.160> flash<00:03:03.460> arsenal<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.240> will<00:03:04.720> be

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
must-have for my flash arsenal I will be

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.420 
must-have for my flash arsenal I will be
adding<00:03:05.020> more<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.560> these<00:03:05.680> great<00:03:05.920> units<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.340> my

flash bag as needed so I'm gonna put one
on<00:03:09.910> order<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.420> I'm<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.110> play<00:03:11.320> around

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
on order and I'm going to play around

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.460 
on order and I'm going to play around
with<00:03:11.770> it<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.070> basically<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:13.690> as<00:03:13.840> he's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
saying here from what I'm reading and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.370 
saying here from what I'm reading and
from<00:03:16.300> what<00:03:16.420> I've<00:03:16.540> already<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.050> know<00:03:17.080> gone

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
from what I've already you know gone

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.750 
from what I've already you know gone
through<00:03:17.620> with<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.860> specs<00:03:18.160> when<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.370> reviewed

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
through with the specs when I reviewed

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.050 
through with the specs when I reviewed
it<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:20.190> think<00:03:21.190> I'm<00:03:21.310> probably<00:03:21.460> going<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.850> end<00:03:21.880> up

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
it I think I'm probably going to end up

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.650 
it I think I'm probably going to end up
