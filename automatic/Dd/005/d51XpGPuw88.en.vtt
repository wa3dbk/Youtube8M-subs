belief to all these people that are
usually<00:04:15.599> just<00:04:15.810> sold<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.859> idea<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.250> they

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
usually just sold the idea that they

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.390 
usually just sold the idea that they
can't<00:04:18.090> like<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.410> there's<00:04:19.620> them<00:04:20.099> and

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
can't like that that there's them and

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.039 
can't like that that there's them and
then<00:04:20.849> there's<00:04:21.000> those<00:04:21.209> people<00:04:21.599> who<00:04:21.780> have

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
then there's those people who have

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
then there's those people who have
succeeded<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:23.160> that<00:04:23.310> there's<00:04:23.490> no<00:04:23.699> bridge<00:04:24.000> and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
succeeded and that there's no bridge and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.689 
succeeded and that there's no bridge and
so<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.870> show<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.229> is<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.190> bridge<00:04:26.460> for

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
so the show is a is is that bridge for

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.969
