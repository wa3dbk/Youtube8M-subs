00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
like almost the whole plane to it of

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.620 
like almost the whole plane to it of
course<00:00:26.580> there's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.849> little<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.210> more<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.599> i

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
very very neat theme couldn't be neater

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.260 
very very neat theme couldn't be neater
than<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.110> on<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.709> opposite<00:03:28.100> edge<00:03:28.280> you

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
than that and on the opposite edge you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.110 
than that and on the opposite edge you
can<00:03:29.450> see<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:31.100> looks<00:03:31.130> just<00:03:31.400> like<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.760> would

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
can see that it looks just like it would

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.150 
can see that it looks just like it would
if<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:33.110> had<00:03:33.140> sewn<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.590> right<00:03:33.740> sides<00:03:34.010> together

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
if you had sewn the right sides together

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.580 
if you had sewn the right sides together
so<00:03:34.940> basically<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.540> only<00:03:35.630> trick<00:03:35.990> is<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.230> sew

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
so basically the only trick is to sew

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.490 
so basically the only trick is to sew
the<00:03:36.740> wrong<00:03:36.920> sides<00:03:37.250> together<00:03:37.550> first<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.500> then

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the wrong sides together first and then

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.970 
the wrong sides together first and then
flip<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.190> turn<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.490> no<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.360> hope<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.920> was

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
flip it and turn it no I hope that was

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.870 
flip it and turn it no I hope that was
helpful<00:03:43.870> thank
