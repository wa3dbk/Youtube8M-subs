00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
hook can be already locked so the hook

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
hook can be already locked so the hook

moves of this plastic part around that

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.440 
moves of this plastic part around that
rubber<00:03:34.440> bulb<00:03:34.680> because<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.820> locked<00:03:36.120> yet

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
rubber bulb because it's not locked yet

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.620 
rubber bulb because it's not locked yet
so<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.290> by<00:03:37.590> doing<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:37.980> by<00:03:38.850> doing<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
so and by doing that by doing that the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.470 
so and by doing that by doing that the
suction<00:03:39.930> cup<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.290> moving<00:03:40.769> it's<00:03:41.610> moving<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.150> at

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
suction cup is moving it's moving but at

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.819 
suction cup is moving it's moving but at
the<00:03:42.690> same<00:03:42.930> time<00:03:43.200> it's<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.959> see<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.410> moving

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
the same time it's you see it's moving

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.789 
the same time it's you see it's moving
but<00:03:47.010> at<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.880> same<00:03:48.150> time<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.930> area<00:03:49.320> it

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
but at the same time in that area it

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.880 
but at the same time in that area it
helped<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:51.269> lock<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:54.450> adhere<00:03:54.959> better<00:03:54.989> just

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
helped it to lock to adhere better just

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.580 
helped it to lock to adhere better just
and<00:03:56.660> let's<00:03:57.660> see<00:03:58.140> what's<00:03:58.650> going<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.310> happen<00:04:00.000> and

and let's see what's going to happen and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.250 
and let's see what's going to happen and
we<00:04:01.590> lock<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:02.299> anyway<00:04:03.299> when<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.510> lock<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.079> so

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
we lock it anyway when you lock it so

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.690 
we lock it anyway when you lock it so
it's<00:04:05.010> staying<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.430> uh<00:04:06.440> like<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.650> actually<00:04:08.010> feel

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
it's staying but uh like I actually feel

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.259 
it's staying but uh like I actually feel
that<00:04:08.910> it's<00:04:09.060> going<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.390> be<00:04:09.650> staying<00:04:10.650> there<00:04:11.269> for

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
that it's going to be staying there for

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.270 
that it's going to be staying there for
good<00:04:13.310> so<00:04:14.989> yeah<00:04:15.989> it's<00:04:16.290> it's<00:04:16.650> not<00:04:16.829> more<00:04:17.070> already

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
like a the approximate distance between

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.680 
like a the approximate distance between
two<00:05:15.500> cops<00:05:16.099> probably<00:05:16.520> that<00:05:17.090> would<00:05:17.330> be<00:05:17.479> all

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
two cops probably that would be all
