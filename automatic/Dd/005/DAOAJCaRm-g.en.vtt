00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
so I made it into Vegas with about 20

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.640 
so I made it into Vegas with about 20
miles<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.299> spare<00:03:57.599> I<00:03:57.750> didn't<00:03:58.139> charge<00:03:58.260> it<00:03:58.439> all

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
miles to spare I didn't charge it all

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.709

the<00:03:58.769> way<00:03:58.859> in<00:03:58.980> Barstow<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.430> got<00:03:59.639> to<00:03:59.819> about<00:04:00.000> 230

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:00.719 
the way in Barstow I got to about 230

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.569 
the way in Barstow I got to about 230
miles<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:01.200> range<00:04:01.439> and<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:02.040> figured<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.489> it

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
miles of range and I figured that it

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.099 
miles of range and I figured that it
would<00:04:02.670> be<00:04:02.849> more<00:04:03.419> than<00:04:03.450> sufficient<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:03.959> make

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
would be more than sufficient to make

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.280 
would be more than sufficient to make
150<00:04:04.709> mile<00:04:04.889> range<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.760> get<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:05.970> into<00:04:06.510> town<00:04:06.750> turns

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
150 mile range to get it into town turns

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.500 
150 mile range to get it into town turns
out<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.530> long<00:04:07.739> uphill<00:04:08.069> takes<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.120> lot<00:04:09.239> more<00:04:09.419> out

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
out the long uphill takes a lot more out

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.399 
out the long uphill takes a lot more out
of<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.659> car<00:04:09.840> than<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.169> would<00:04:10.290> have<00:04:10.319> thought

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
of the car than I would have thought

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.920 
of the car than I would have thought
