00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:04.999 
figure to show you how to convert a dmg

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.300 
figure to show you how to convert a dmg
file<00:00:05.209> to<00:00:05.419> an<00:00:05.509> ISO<00:00:05.870> file<00:00:06.140> which<00:00:06.439> is<00:00:06.680> basically

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
file to an ISO file which is basically

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.660 
file to an ISO file which is basically
an<00:00:07.930> image<00:00:08.930> file<00:00:09.140> has<00:00:09.350> been<00:00:09.380> compressed<00:00:09.860> using

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
an image file has been compressed using

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.020 
an image file has been compressed using
the<00:00:10.850> Mac<00:00:11.060> compression<00:00:11.840> to<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.470> dmg<00:00:12.980> and<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:13.640> ISO

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
the Mac compression to a dmg and the ISO

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.460 
the Mac compression to a dmg and the ISO
is<00:00:14.180> basically<00:00:14.510> something<00:00:14.840> that<00:00:14.990> Windows

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
is basically something that Windows

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.439 
is basically something that Windows
users<00:00:15.830> use<00:00:16.160> all<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.429> time<00:00:16.580> to<00:00:16.759> burn<00:00:16.910> CDs<00:00:17.300> etc

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
users use all the time to burn CDs etc

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.929 
users use all the time to burn CDs etc
and<00:00:18.259> this<00:00:18.890> just<00:00:19.160> shows<00:00:19.339> you<00:00:19.490> how<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.699> convert

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
and this just shows you how to convert

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.200 
and this just shows you how to convert
and<00:00:20.300> it's<00:00:20.570> really<00:00:20.749> easy<00:00:21.640> any<00:00:22.640> files<00:00:22.939> that<00:00:23.150> I

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
and it's really easy any files that I

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.669 
and it's really easy any files that I
mention<00:00:23.659> can<00:00:24.050> be<00:00:24.140> downloaded<00:00:24.529> in<00:00:24.619> the

called the mg to IMG Exe it's not a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.400 
called the mg to IMG Exe it's not a
program<00:00:34.969> with<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.270> UI<00:00:35.449> so<00:00:35.780> you<00:00:35.870> don't<00:00:36.050> open<00:00:36.320> it

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
file to be named so if I it's one might

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.980 
file to be named so if I it's one might
to<00:01:11.000> be<00:01:11.090> called<00:01:11.890> tutorial<00:01:12.890> ISL<00:01:13.850> just<00:01:14.509> hit<00:01:14.780> enter

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
to be called tutorial ISL just hit enter

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.649 
to be called tutorial ISL just hit enter
and<00:01:15.619> you'll<00:01:16.460> see<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:16.729> starts<00:01:16.970> converting<00:01:17.450> and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
and you'll see it starts converting and

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.200 
and you'll see it starts converting and
if<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.140> look<00:01:18.350> up<00:01:18.619> into<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.070> folder<00:01:19.399> you<00:01:20.000> see

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
if you look up into the folder you see

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.749 
if you look up into the folder you see
that<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.049> ISO<00:01:21.590> file<00:01:21.829> gets<00:01:22.070> created<00:01:22.490> whatever

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
that the ISO file gets created whatever

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.420 
that the ISO file gets created whatever
your<00:01:22.909> dmg<00:01:23.270> file<00:01:23.479> was<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:24.159> recommend<00:01:25.159> just<00:01:25.280> put

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
your dmg file was I recommend just put

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.940 
your dmg file was I recommend just put
in<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.579> dmg<00:01:25.939> file<00:01:26.149> in<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.960> file<00:01:27.200> into<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
in the dmg file in to the file into the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.609 
in the dmg file in to the file into the
folder<00:01:27.979> with<00:01:28.399> the<00:01:28.430> dmg<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.540> IMG<00:01:29.750> Exe<00:01:30.320> just

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
folder with the dmg to IMG Exe just

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.080 
folder with the dmg to IMG Exe just
because<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:30.920> makes<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.219> lot<00:01:31.310> easier<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.030> you

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
because it makes it a lot easier and you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.310 
because it makes it a lot easier and you
can<00:01:32.869> see<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.469> just<00:01:33.500> decompresses<00:01:35.320> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
can see that it just decompresses the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.090 
can see that it just decompresses the
dmg<00:01:36.590> into<00:01:37.460> your<00:01:37.640> ISO<00:01:37.939> and<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.560> ISO<00:01:39.920> will

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
dmg into your ISO and it the ISO will

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.529 
dmg into your ISO and it the ISO will
end<00:01:40.250> up<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:42.350> will<00:01:42.469> end<00:01:42.619> up<00:01:42.740> bigger<00:01:43.039> in<00:01:43.880> this

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
end up it will end up bigger in this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.429 
end up it will end up bigger in this
case<00:01:44.780> it's<00:01:44.990> gonna<00:01:45.079> be<00:01:45.200> about<00:01:46.119> 500<00:01:47.439> megabytes

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
case it's gonna be about 500 megabytes

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.289 
case it's gonna be about 500 megabytes
bigger<00:01:48.619> also<00:01:49.430> something<00:01:49.789> around<00:01:49.909> there<00:01:50.060> but

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
bigger also something around there but

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.969 
bigger also something around there but
it<00:01:50.390> depends<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:50.869> obviously<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.469> empty<00:01:51.860> they

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
it depends on obviously the empty they

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.679 
it depends on obviously the empty they
are<00:01:53.110> converting<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.880> that's<00:01:55.880> basically<00:01:56.390> it

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
are converting and that's basically it

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.389 
are converting and that's basically it
that's<00:01:56.990> all<00:01:57.109> you<00:01:57.200> need<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.439> know<00:01:57.530> as<00:01:58.219> I<00:01:58.340> said

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
that's all you need to know as I said

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.039 
that's all you need to know as I said
the<00:01:58.579> downloads<00:01:58.880> in<00:01:59.060> your<00:01:59.149> description<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.719> just

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
the downloads in your description I just

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.330 
the downloads in your description I just
thought<00:02:00.200> I'd<00:02:00.380> do<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:00.619> video<00:02:00.890> because<00:02:01.070> this

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
thought I'd do this video because this

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.099 
thought I'd do this video because this
is<00:02:01.520> one<00:02:01.759> of<00:02:01.789> those<00:02:01.969> things<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.390> people<00:02:02.570> ask

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
is one of those things that people ask

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.039 
is one of those things that people ask
about<00:02:03.409> quite<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.039> lot<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:05.359> even<00:02:05.570> had<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.930> look

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
about quite a lot and I even had to look

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.120 
about quite a lot and I even had to look
for<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.289> once<00:02:06.469> myself

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
for it once myself

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.830 
for it once myself
so<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:07.789> like<00:02:07.939> they<00:02:08.179> are<00:02:08.300> there<00:02:08.479> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so just like they are there and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.690 
so just like they are there and
obviously<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.950> helps<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.250> see<00:02:10.429> someone

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
obviously it helps to see someone

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.820 
obviously it helps to see someone
actually<00:02:10.819> do<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.269> so

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
actually do it so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.590 
actually do it so
and<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:13.910> that's<00:02:14.120> for<00:02:15.640> one<00:02:16.640> thing<00:02:16.820> that<00:02:17.390> is

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
and I think that's for one thing that is

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.840 
and I think that's for one thing that is
necessary<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.770> mention<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.700> can

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
necessary to mention is that you can

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.150 
necessary to mention is that you can
also<00:02:20.120> when<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.870> convert<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.320> dmg<00:02:21.680> actually

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
also when you convert a dmg actually

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.340 
also when you convert a dmg actually
converts<00:02:22.520> yes<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.240> if<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.570> bootable<00:02:23.870> dmg

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
converts yes so if it's a bootable dmg

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.290 
converts yes so if it's a bootable dmg
it<00:02:24.530> will<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> beautiful<00:02:25.250> ISO<00:02:25.820> as<00:02:25.940> well<00:02:26.090> which

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
it will be a beautiful ISO as well which

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.990 
it will be a beautiful ISO as well which
is<00:02:26.510> always<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:27.050> good<00:02:27.320> thing<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.640> yeah<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.850> just

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000
