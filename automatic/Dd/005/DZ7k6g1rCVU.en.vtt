00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.880
 first it was someone link 3rd 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.149
 she crafted from eight bars and a bucket 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.210
 then i'm important 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.629
 different rods that is u so here are three in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.860
 row 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.850
 amazo then reinforced 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.340
 Blaze Ignat needed it was three and z 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.609

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.710
 also we will need nas bylo of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 Playt so let's say fee 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.130
 ifrit that is how else we will do 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.550
 you know how to Kravchenko need more than five 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:30.500
 efrita bucket of water and 3 calling thread 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:39.770
 we get 5 as you see now I'm 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:42.250
 so here we put put to remel 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.250
 until 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.370
 Precisely and see craft and 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.070
 we will need weapons directly 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:59.360
 for ax 6 diamonds and 5 i have a shower 32 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.740
 base rod and me and 5 club place i 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440
 will place 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.800
 next we will need for the sword so 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.330
 let's take all these already we 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.670
 will need 1 diam 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.959
 Smeared rod and 2k boards so let's say 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:22.280
 To Kirk, we need two 2 again 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.050
 2 different rods and 3 boards for a shovel 2 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.810
 oil rods no fee 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.360
 so let's test so let's say and 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.640
 these boards but for starters that's how you 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.970
 You see pepalo was conducted for if Ignat 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.610
 formed but for the beginning we shall put on abuse 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.209
 how is he without armor with so many 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.000
 footwear 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:46.409
 armor crafted from mixed 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.290
 mixed ingots gland and ifrite out 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.150
 bullion lo crafting here you see before 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.030
 that is, a standard picture of armor 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.230
 just from the others of it so let's 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.180
 let's turn off 10 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.910
 see first as Bude show how 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.709
 Cherkassy sword with how many blows 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.930
 he is already a zombie 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.680
 here is another customer with two hits 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.000
 that is, it is very fast as for me 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.780
 Now let's see how much a hurricane 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.459
 will inflict an archer a few 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.459
 as you see we kill them almost with 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.650
 first strikes then let's say 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.340
 spent so many diamonds 10 actions 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.260
 legs 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:33.450
 works like let's and also we attack 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:37.709
 their day and continue to shoot 20 as you 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.019
 see how you see armor 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.629
 barely suffered i mean it's a bunch 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.299
 diamond armor and well, but spent 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.389
 neman diamond and dal let's check 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.430
 ourselves we are it almost instantly just 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.160
 destruction I did not even have time to figure out 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.040
 that broke it steeper than a diamond ax 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.829
 in general instantly just cuts down but not 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.489
 pickax also represent let's for 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.930
 comparisons get out of gay fashion 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.540
 some let'll get 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.540
 obsidian block just to find it 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.120
 now wait a second here he is obsidian 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.709
 let's leave it and turn off the repair 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.489
 see after how many seconds she 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.169
 will break 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.229
 with 2 3 4 that is why we are so much 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:29.250
 faster than without this pickaxe 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:31.440
 how tagging recipes are correct because 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.520
 from spending not he well how would spend 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.090
 a lot and although it justifies simply 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.560
 just brutally justifies its price so 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.820
 let's just look at it 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.650
 he is a wonderful ax 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.310
 double sided I really liked him 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.080
 crafting and as you noticed it we almost 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.970
 does not break that is the durability of them 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.880
 very big i tried to break but not 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.610
 tired honestly simple and here you can 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.030
 could tell to search around 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.830
 shovels she would have suffered a little if 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.050
 you will like can download the description 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.300
