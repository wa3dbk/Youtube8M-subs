unbelievable meaning that it can go at
that<00:02:02.700> speed<00:02:02.970> without<00:02:03.530> using<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that speed without using the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.800 
that speed without using the
afterburners<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:05.820> takes<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.150> lot<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.360> fuel

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
afterburners which takes a lot more fuel

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.959 
afterburners which takes a lot more fuel
so<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.200> pretty<00:02:07.470> impressive<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.819> you're

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:08.969 
so that's pretty impressive here you're

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.659 
so that's pretty impressive here you're
getting<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.269> side<00:02:09.479> shot<00:02:09.779> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.669> f-22

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:11.669 
getting a side shot of the f-22

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.400 
getting a side shot of the f-22
absolutely

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
absolutely

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.200 
absolutely
menacing<00:02:13.800> gorgeous<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.490> see<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
menacing gorgeous so you can see the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.910 
menacing gorgeous so you can see the
plane<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.660> way<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.960> it's<00:02:16.080> built<00:02:16.290> now<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
plane in the way that it's built now the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.110 
plane in the way that it's built now the
additional<00:02:17.370> thing<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.730> wanted<00:02:17.940> well

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
additional thing that I wanted well

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.070 
additional thing that I wanted well
first<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.510> all<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.630> want<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> tell<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.990> about

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
first of all I want to tell you about

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.860 
first of all I want to tell you about
this<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.770> maximum<00:02:20.730> speed<00:02:21.000> that's<00:02:21.240> estimating

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
this the maximum speed that's estimating

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.320 
this the maximum speed that's estimating
again<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.410> maximum<00:02:23.070> speed<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.640> classified<00:02:24.300> so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
again the maximum speed is classified so

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.500 
again the maximum speed is classified so
this<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.070> guess<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.640> song<00:02:26.880> wikipedia

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
this is a just a guess in song wikipedia

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.450 
this is a just a guess in song wikipedia
is<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:29.040> max<00:02:29.820> out<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:30.360> around<00:02:31.460> 2.25

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
is that it can max out at around 2.25

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.580 
is that it can max out at around 2.25
month<00:02:32.760> that's<00:02:32.970> around<00:02:33.300> 1500<00:02:34.140> miles<00:02:34.260> an<00:02:34.470> hour

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
month that's around 1500 miles an hour

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.440 
month that's around 1500 miles an hour
now<00:02:34.800> again<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.190> don't<00:02:35.580> know<00:02:35.730> what<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> maximum

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
now again I don't know what the maximum

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.090 
now again I don't know what the maximum
speed<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.840> plane<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.980> is

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
speed of this plane is and it is

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.640 
speed of this plane is and it is
classified<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.850> fact<00:02:39.450> I've<00:02:39.660> seen<00:02:40.050> one<00:02:40.380> website

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
classified in fact I've seen one website

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.010 
classified in fact I've seen one website
that<00:02:41.220> says<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> F<00:02:42.180> points<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.870> do

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
that says that the F points you can do

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.920 
that says that the F points you can do
Mach<00:02:43.440> 2<00:02:43.740> point<00:02:44.040> 5<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.550> top<00:02:44.760> speed<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.240> another

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
Mach 2 point 5 at top speed and another

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.750 
Mach 2 point 5 at top speed and another
website<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.410> speculates<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.520> even

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
website that speculates that it can even

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.020 
website that speculates that it can even
exceed<00:02:48.420> Mach<00:02:48.750> 3<00:02:49.410> which<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.400> absolutely

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
exceed Mach 3 which is absolutely

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.880 
exceed Mach 3 which is absolutely
incredible<00:02:51.180> although<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.230> website<00:02:52.710> said

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
incredible although this website said

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.230 
incredible although this website said
that<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.190> only<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.580> for<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.790> very<00:02:53.910> short

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
that it can only do it for a very short

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.980 
that it can only do it for a very short
period<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.540> time<00:02:54.630> due<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.740> some<00:02:56.870> detriments<00:02:57.870> to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
period of time due to some detriments to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.540 
period of time due to some detriments to
going<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.440> fast<00:02:58.650> for<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.160> kind<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
going that fast for this kind of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.490 
going that fast for this kind of
aircraft<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.210> stuff<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.020> in<00:03:01.140> terms<00:03:01.350> of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
aircraft and stuff like that in terms of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.280 
aircraft and stuff like that in terms of
the<00:03:01.590> stealth<00:03:01.830> capability<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.720> heat<00:03:03.960> and

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the stealth capability and the heat and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.560 
the stealth capability and the heat and
stuff<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.740> it<00:03:04.950> would<00:03:05.130> generate<00:03:06.000> for<00:03:06.360> doing

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
stuff that it would generate for doing

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.420 
stuff that it would generate for doing
that<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.900> again<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> don't<00:03:07.590> know<00:03:07.890> what<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.250> top

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
that so again I don't know what the top

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.720 
that so again I don't know what the top
speed<00:03:08.460> is<00:03:08.880> but<00:03:09.210> let's<00:03:09.660> just<00:03:09.870> say<00:03:10.080> it's<00:03:11.070> very

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
speed is but let's just say it's very

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.000 
speed is but let's just say it's very
very<00:03:11.880> fast<00:03:12.300> again<00:03:13.080> let's<00:03:13.290> let's<00:03:13.680> take<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> look

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
very fast again let's let's take a look

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.330 
very fast again let's let's take a look
at<00:03:14.070> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
at this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.580 
at this
so<00:03:14.670> what<00:03:14.820> you're<00:03:14.970> seeing<00:03:15.210> here<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.350> see

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
so what you're seeing here is you see

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.910 
so what you're seeing here is you see
that<00:03:16.830> kind<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.570> stealth<00:03:18.570> profile<00:03:19.140> now<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.709> way

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
that kind of stealth profile now the way

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.010 
that kind of stealth profile now the way
that<00:03:20.130> now<00:03:20.490> this<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.970> an<00:03:21.120> airplane<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.810> is

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
that now this is an airplane that is

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.170 
that now this is an airplane that is
built<00:03:22.350> for<00:03:22.440> stealth<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.760> way<00:03:23.970> that<00:03:24.120> it's

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
built for stealth it's the way that it's

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.780 
built for stealth it's the way that it's
built<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.810> design<00:03:25.140> whatever<00:03:25.410> helps<00:03:25.980> add<00:03:26.220> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
built the design whatever helps add to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.060 
built the design whatever helps add to
that<00:03:26.910> stealth<00:03:27.390> capability<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.320> addition<00:03:28.980> they

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
that stealth capability in addition they

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.030 
that stealth capability in addition they
use<00:03:29.280> materials<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:31.020> also<00:03:31.380> increase<00:03:31.830> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
use materials to also increase the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.930 
use materials to also increase the
stealth<00:03:32.340> capability<00:03:33.440> tremendous<00:03:34.440> plane<00:03:34.940> and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
stealth capability tremendous plane and

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.430 
stealth capability tremendous plane and
it<00:03:36.420> carries<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> range<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.320> different

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
it carries a range of different

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.320 
it carries a range of different
arguments<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.160> actually<00:03:38.520> has<00:03:38.670> internal

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
arguments it actually has internal

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.990 
arguments it actually has internal
weapons<00:03:39.510> base<00:03:40.080> that<00:03:40.920> also<00:03:41.160> helps<00:03:41.670> for<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
weapons base that also helps for the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.910 
weapons base that also helps for the
stealth<00:03:42.270> capability<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.800> know

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
stealth capability so that you know

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.000 
stealth capability so that you know
you've<00:03:44.070> got<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> more<00:03:45.150> stealthier<00:03:45.739> profile<00:03:46.739> if

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
you've got a more stealthier profile if

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.220 
you've got a more stealthier profile if
you<00:03:47.040> will<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:48.120> only<00:03:48.300> deploy<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.870> weapons

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
you will and you only deploy the weapons

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.590
