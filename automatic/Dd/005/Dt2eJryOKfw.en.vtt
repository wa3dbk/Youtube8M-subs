some people for some reason don't
particularly<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.350> version<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> i

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
you get it with the game anyway why they

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.050 
you get it with the game anyway why they
just<00:02:18.440> didn't<00:02:18.980> put<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.520> in<00:02:19.610> there<00:02:19.820> without<00:02:19.910> a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
just didn't put it in there without a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.970 
just didn't put it in there without a
code<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.510> would<00:02:20.630> have<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:20.750> been<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.680> whole<00:02:21.950> lot

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
code it would have just been a whole lot

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.860 
code it would have just been a whole lot
easier<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.970> not<00:02:23.180> working<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.600> moment

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
easier it's not working the moment

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.440 
easier it's not working the moment
obviously<00:02:24.410> not<00:02:24.530> activated<00:02:25.190> my<00:02:25.340> because<00:02:25.730> the

hopefully<00:02:31.880> that's<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.270> or<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:32.660> not<00:02:33.760> Sega<00:02:34.760> are

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
hopefully that's it or if not Sega are

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.000 
hopefully that's it or if not Sega are
going<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.150> need<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.360> sort<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.870> out<00:02:36.020> hopefully

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
going to need to sort it out hopefully

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.710 
going to need to sort it out hopefully
