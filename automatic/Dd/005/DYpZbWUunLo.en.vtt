00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 good morning, they are time for you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.790
 Nordic I will present you the collection that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:20.090
 we propose for 2014 and 2013 2014 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:24.600
 we are here found csr giant came out 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.769
 Nordic Dobermann is a giant exit 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.679
 with a radius of 18 meters and a half with 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.050
 system edited to increase the seal 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.239
 torsional from the important scenario from 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:44.820
 say this our race rapid patent 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.469
 profile that increases the curve input 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.129
 deformation of the ski and thus facilitates 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.420
 in input regarding the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.100
 slalom we keep it traditional skiing 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.640
 slightly unstructured from the cup 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.760
 of the world of clean simple skiing with 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.049
 a creature of eleven and thirteen meters 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.640
 in various lengths always with plate 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.470
 I have a new plate that we have 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.470
 proposed throughout our collection 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:21.479
 regarding all-mountain skiing 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:25.220
 we proposed the line of the line 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.479
 spitfire the top is called fire editi 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.360
 conceptually it is built like skiing 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.829
 of the giant but with one more creature 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 in fact 166 was abundant as a ray 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.649
 15 and a half meters always contact with 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:47.759
 evo plate is connected to tv's for 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.590
 regarding lord mountain 2 the charioteer 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.350
 proposes this line of his beck his 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.159
 which is a track but with a structure 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.179
 very light and see 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.659
 and also the very light work because 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.170
 built with a particular wood for 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.679
 the woman 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.870
 we proposed the spitfire tier1 ski 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.989
 which conceptually income sidecut 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.410
 takes up the spitfire line but more versatile 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.580
 light with a tip spatula 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:29.489
 traditional a moder head and provide 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:31.980
 while for the raids we have proposed is the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.989
 boss a new year project came out with 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.720
 double titan with a width 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:42.840
 107 mm insole procreato infront 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.060
 also the but always with a concept like 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.190
 you see camber under your foot at this 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.109
 ponce let's say it helps keep it skiing 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.810
 on snows particularly hard or 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:59.849
 difficult stable out of category for the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.239
 woman we presented the back to back 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.010
 which resumes the construction of the ski and 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.730
 of the line and very light lembeck 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.799
 versatile even for light use 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.579
 on difficult or fresh snow outside 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:18.900
 track or insole and 78 mm and how 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:23.340
 we can note I was created in tip to 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.060
 term always things proposal out 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.190
 category 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.299
 we resume the spitfire line as la 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.790
 new line the pro to the same 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.190
 centering the drawing of the dt we have 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.150
 proposed first though slightly 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.530
 deconstructed and the little hole more 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.930
 accessible to all categories of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.840
 skier 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.230
 here is governance spitfire pro 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.230
 that is
