revision super slim PlayStation 3 so you
can<00:00:11.460> see<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:11.969> they<00:00:12.120> are<00:00:12.269> side<00:00:12.540> by<00:00:12.599> side<00:00:12.780> next

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
can see here they are side by side next

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.519 
can see here they are side by side next
to<00:00:13.440> each<00:00:13.559> other<00:00:14.120> and<00:00:15.120> basically<00:00:15.240> see<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.900> one

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
to each other and basically see that one

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.150 
to each other and basically see that one
is<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:17.130> smaller<00:00:17.670> than<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> other<00:00:19.100> this<00:00:20.100> is

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
is a lot smaller than the other this is

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.310 
is a lot smaller than the other this is
obviously<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> original<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> small

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
obviously the original this is the small

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.750 
obviously the original this is the small
so<00:00:22.949> we're<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> look<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.400> them<00:00:23.490> from<00:00:23.580> all

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
so we're going to look at them from all

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.120 
so we're going to look at them from all
angles<00:00:24.980> we'll<00:00:25.980> look<00:00:26.099> at<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> front

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.549 

so<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> size<00:00:35.850> difference<00:00:36.090> there

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:51.310 

look<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:40.710> them<00:00:41.010> from<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> back<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.649> see

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
original PlayStation is much bigger the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.810

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
fans in the back and the original one

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.899 
fans in the back and the original one
has<00:01:21.330> an<00:01:21.509> on/off<00:01:21.960> switch<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> new<00:01:23.580> one<00:01:23.729> doesn't

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
has an on/off switch the new one doesn't

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.510 
has an on/off switch the new one doesn't
have<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.450> uses<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.890> half<00:01:26.159> as<00:01:26.369> much

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
have it uses about half as much

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
have it uses about half as much
electricity<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:28.320> new<00:01:28.470> one's<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
electricity the new one's also about a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.200 
electricity the new one's also about a
third<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> size<00:01:31.880> we'll<00:01:32.880> look<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
third of the size we'll look at the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.910 
third of the size we'll look at the
baggage<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
baggage is really not much to see in the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:45.460 
baggage is really not much to see in the
bottoms<00:01:37.040> just<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> big<00:01:38.310> hunk<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.140> big<00:01:43.350> hunk

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
1/3 the size and uses half the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.570 
1/3 the size and uses half the
electricity<00:02:24.680> power<00:02:25.680> switch<00:02:25.950> right<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.340> it's
