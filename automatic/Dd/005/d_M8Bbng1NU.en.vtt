digs<00:01:39.490> into<00:01:39.790> your<00:01:40.240> shelters<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.690> little<00:01:41.020> bit<00:01:41.200> but

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
digs into your shelters a little bit but

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.950 
digs into your shelters a little bit but
other<00:01:42.340> than<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.550> it's<00:01:43.240> been<00:01:43.390> really<00:01:43.570> really

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960
