00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
like a June update into the muscle cell

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.620

during these eating hours you know
during<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.700> guess<00:02:45.240> when<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.570> Sun<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.900> down<00:02:46.080> you

during I guess when the Sun is down you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.590 
during I guess when the Sun is down you
want<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.860> have<00:02:47.010> very<00:02:47.940> dense<00:02:48.210> amount<00:02:48.540> of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
want to have very dense amount of

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.510 
want to have very dense amount of
nutrition<00:02:48.870> another<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.040> start

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
nutrition another thing is to start

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.960 
nutrition another thing is to start
simple<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.210> end<00:02:51.930> complex<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.430> actually<00:02:53.940> I

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
simple and end complex so actually I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.670 
simple and end complex so actually I
would<00:02:54.330> start<00:02:54.660> off<00:02:54.840> if<00:02:54.990> you've<00:02:55.110> got<00:02:55.290> desserts

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
would start off if you've got desserts

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.590

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
desserts with protein you want to spike

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.220 
desserts with protein you want to spike
the<00:02:59.820> insulin<00:03:00.150> levels<00:03:00.510> towards<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.140> know

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
the insulin levels towards you know

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.290 
the insulin levels towards you know
eleven<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.830> twelve<00:03:02.070> thirty<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.970> want<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.209> eat
