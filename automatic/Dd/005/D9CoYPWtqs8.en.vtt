the enemy tank so let's type in our
angle<00:00:34.420> as<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:37.360> try<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:37.719> hit<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:38.020> enemy

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
angle as let's try and hit the enemy

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.920 
angle as let's try and hit the enemy
with<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.280> direct<00:00:39.700> hit<00:00:39.850> notice<00:00:40.629> that<00:00:40.660> I'm

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
with a direct hit notice that I'm

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.420 
with a direct hit notice that I'm
shooting<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.320> projectile<00:00:41.800> in<00:00:41.980> almost<00:00:42.280> a

straight line your score is given and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.450 
straight line your score is given and
then<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.149> angle<00:00:46.780> changes<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.920> as<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.280> height

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
then the angle changes and as the height

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.010 
then the angle changes and as the height
of<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.699> time<00:00:48.879> changes<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.510> becomes<00:00:49.840> more

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
of the time changes it becomes more

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.569 
of the time changes it becomes more
difficult<00:00:50.199> as<00:00:50.590> you<00:00:50.770> can't<00:00:51.010> just<00:00:51.309> shoot<00:00:51.520> a

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
difficult as you can't just shoot a

difficult as you can't just shoot a
straight<00:00:51.850> line<00:00:52.030> you'll<00:00:52.629> have<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.930> try<00:00:53.079> and

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
straight line you'll have to try and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.569 
straight line you'll have to try and
avoid<00:00:53.410> it<00:00:53.559> obstacle<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.129> shoot<00:00:54.399> a<00:00:54.460> projectile

level 4 in level 1 you get three lives
it's<00:01:17.230> on<00:01:17.410> earth<00:01:17.650> so<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:17.950> acceleration<00:01:18.220> due<00:01:18.610> to

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
it's on earth so the acceleration due to

it's on earth so the acceleration due to
gravity<00:01:18.790> is<00:01:19.270> 9.8<00:01:19.450> one<00:01:20.550> you<00:01:21.550> can<00:01:21.670> try<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:21.910> hit

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
gravity is 9.8 one you can try and hit

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.330 
gravity is 9.8 one you can try and hit
the<00:01:22.120> enemy<00:01:22.300> tank<00:01:22.960> at<00:01:23.050> any<00:01:23.200> time<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:24.010> exit

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
the enemy tank at any time and to exit

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.940 
the enemy tank at any time and to exit
you<00:01:24.490> can<00:01:24.640> press<00:01:25.180> exit

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.029 

level<00:01:28.700> 2<00:01:28.960> it's<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.079> similar<00:01:30.409> thing<00:01:30.590> except<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
level 2 it's a similar thing except the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.730 
level 2 it's a similar thing except the
tank<00:01:31.219> is<00:01:31.369> at<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.520> different<00:01:31.729> level<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.530> can

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
tank is at a different level so you can

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.399 
tank is at a different level so you can
you<00:01:34.159> actually<00:01:34.369> do<00:01:34.700> have<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.000> aim<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.509> a

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
you actually do have to aim a a

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.440 
you actually do have to aim a a
projectile<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.490> constituted<00:01:38.030> in<00:01:38.119> a<00:01:38.210> straight

and<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.350> acceleration<00:01:42.950> due<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.100> gravity<00:01:43.219> is

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
and the acceleration due to gravity is

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.690 
and the acceleration due to gravity is
different<00:01:43.909> because<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:44.270> on<00:01:44.360> marks

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
acceleration due to gravity is again

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.399 
acceleration due to gravity is again
different<00:01:55.299> there's<00:01:56.299> an<00:01:56.390> obstacle<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.079> there

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
different there's an obstacle and there
