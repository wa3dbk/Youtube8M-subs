00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
creative mode is the incredibly high

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.130 
creative mode is the incredibly high
mobility<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.480> ease<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.690> with

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
mobility and the in the the ease of with

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.870 
mobility and the in the the ease of with
which<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:21.160> like<00:02:21.310> fly<00:02:21.549> around<00:02:21.790> the

which you have to like fly around the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.099 
which you have to like fly around the
map<00:02:22.000> look<00:02:22.209> around<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> map<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.660> find

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
map look around the map and find

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.199 
map look around the map and find
different<00:02:23.440> things<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.310> thought<00:02:24.700> how<00:02:24.970> cool

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
different things so I thought how cool

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.490 
different things so I thought how cool
would<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.510> if<00:02:25.630> there<00:02:25.900> was<00:02:26.019> some<00:02:26.200> kind<00:02:26.350> of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
would it be if there was some kind of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.240 
would it be if there was some kind of
NPC<00:02:27.220> or<00:02:27.569> mob<00:02:28.569> or<00:02:28.930> some<00:02:29.200> kind<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.620> creature<00:02:29.920> or

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
NPC or mob or some kind of creature or

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.550 
NPC or mob or some kind of creature or
something<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:31.180> would<00:02:31.329> allow<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> console

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
something that would allow the console

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.090 
something that would allow the console
version<00:02:32.980> players<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.359> survival<00:02:35.319> mode<00:02:35.350> be

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
version players to in survival mode be

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.520 
version players to in survival mode be
able<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.760> fly<00:02:37.090> now<00:02:37.810> what<00:02:38.049> kind<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.290> creature

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
able to fly now what kind of creature

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.160 
able to fly now what kind of creature
could<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:38.889> be<00:02:39.130> I'm<00:02:39.730> thinking<00:02:40.739> Pegasus<00:02:43.170> okay

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
could this be I'm thinking Pegasus okay

could this be I'm thinking Pegasus okay
okay<00:02:44.859> I<00:02:44.889> know<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.190> know<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.519> sounds<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.359> little

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
okay I know I know that sounds a little

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.180 
okay I know I know that sounds a little
ludicrous<00:02:47.139> and<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.440> know<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.709> sounds<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.100> little

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
ludicrous and I know it sounds a little

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.879 
ludicrous and I know it sounds a little
out<00:02:48.400> there<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:49.329> how<00:02:49.600> cool<00:02:50.019> would<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.350> be<00:02:50.500> if

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
out there but how cool would that be if

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.789 
out there but how cool would that be if
there<00:02:51.160> was<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.639> Pegasus<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.630> Minecraft<00:02:53.260> that

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
there was a Pegasus in Minecraft that

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.440 
there was a Pegasus in Minecraft that
would<00:02:53.950> allow<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.489> go<00:02:54.609> super<00:02:55.060> super<00:02:55.209> fast

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
would allow you to go super super fast

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.080 
would allow you to go super super fast
super<00:02:55.840> super<00:02:56.200> fly<00:02:56.410> around<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.799> map<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.160> and

super super fly around the map and and

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.729 
super super fly around the map and and
just<00:02:58.389> see<00:02:58.600> all<00:02:58.630> kinds<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.260> stuff<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.650> just

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
just see all kinds of stuff and just

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.039

have<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:00.280> high<00:03:00.519> mobility<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:01.900> get

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
have that high mobility that you can get

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.020 
have that high mobility that you can get
in<00:03:02.139> creative<00:03:02.560> mode<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.489> can't<00:03:03.790> really

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
in creative mode but you can't really

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.150 
in creative mode but you can't really
get<00:03:04.359> in<00:03:04.690> on<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.109> peak<00:03:05.290> around<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> console<00:03:06.040> or

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
get in on the peak around the console or

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.910 
get in on the peak around the console or
in<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.400> PC<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.850> survival<00:03:07.299> mode<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.620> don't

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
in the PC in survival mode so I don't

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.530 
in the PC in survival mode so I don't
know<00:03:09.010> that's<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:09.609> my<00:03:09.850> idea<00:03:10.209> that's<00:03:10.389> what<00:03:10.480> I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
know that's just my idea that's what I

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.900 
know that's just my idea that's what I
think<00:03:10.870> would<00:03:10.989> be<00:03:11.019> totally<00:03:11.620> totally<00:03:11.769> cool<00:03:12.220> for

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
think would be totally totally cool for

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.809 
think would be totally totally cool for
a<00:03:12.940> console<00:03:13.840> specific<00:03:14.230> NPC<00:03:14.739> now<00:03:15.220> granted

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
a console specific NPC now granted

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.160 
a console specific NPC now granted
granted<00:03:16.000> there<00:03:16.299> had<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.599> be<00:03:16.690> like<00:03:16.810> some<00:03:17.019> kind

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
granted there had to be like some kind

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.390 
granted there had to be like some kind
of<00:03:17.230> cheat<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.709> would<00:03:17.829> enable<00:03:18.040> that

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
of cheat that you would enable that

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.250 
of cheat that you would enable that
would<00:03:18.790> allow<00:03:19.030> it<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.209> spawn<00:03:19.599> in<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.870> world<00:03:20.049> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
would allow it to spawn in the world and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.259 
would allow it to spawn in the world and
maybe<00:03:20.380> like<00:03:20.620> only<00:03:20.799> one<00:03:21.130> spawns<00:03:21.519> per<00:03:21.790> world<00:03:22.060> or

maybe like only one spawns per world or

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.509 
maybe like only one spawns per world or
something<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.660> don't<00:03:22.720> know<00:03:23.009> but<00:03:24.009> I<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.130> think

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
something I don't know but I just think

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.710 
something I don't know but I just think
it<00:03:24.579> would<00:03:24.639> be<00:03:24.729> a<00:03:24.759> totally<00:03:25.209> totally<00:03:25.540> cool

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
it would be a totally totally cool

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.180 
it would be a totally totally cool
addition<00:03:26.139> and<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.650> think<00:03:26.919> that<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.130> would

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
addition and I think that it would

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.370 
addition and I think that it would
definitely<00:03:27.400> add

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
definitely add

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.470 
definitely add
new<00:03:28.530> gist<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> console<00:03:29.790> specific<00:03:30.240> version

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
new gist to the console specific version

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.270 
new gist to the console specific version

there's<00:04:05.040> some<00:04:05.160> kind<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.400> copyright<00:04:05.670> hold<00:04:06.210> or

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
there's some kind of copyright hold or

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.570

something<00:04:06.690> on<00:04:06.780> Pegasus<00:04:07.290> itself<00:04:07.740> but<00:04:08.280> test

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
something on Pegasus itself but test

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.950 
something on Pegasus itself but test
something<00:04:08.790> similar<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.600> some<00:04:09.810> kind

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
something similar to that like some kind

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.380 
something similar to that like some kind
of<00:04:10.020> flying<00:04:10.230> creature<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.770> could<00:04:10.920> ride

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
of flying creature that you could ride

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.340 
of flying creature that you could ride
maybe<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.510> think<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.840> would<00:04:12.930> be<00:04:12.990> totally<00:04:13.140> cool

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
maybe I think that would be totally cool

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.410 
maybe I think that would be totally cool
and<00:04:13.680> like<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.790> said<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.000> don't<00:04:15.090> know<00:04:15.240> I<00:04:15.300> just

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
and like I said I don't know I just

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.550 
and like I said I don't know I just
think<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.630> would<00:04:15.690> be<00:04:15.780> totally<00:04:15.900> awesome<00:04:16.230> but

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
think it would be totally awesome but

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.960 
think it would be totally awesome but
like<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.040> said<00:04:17.100> you'd<00:04:17.370> have<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.580> there<00:04:17.730> have<00:04:17.880> to

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
like I said you'd have to there have to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.160 
like I said you'd have to there have to
be<00:04:18.000> some<00:04:18.180> kind<00:04:18.270> of<00:04:18.360> limit<00:04:18.630> on<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.020> can

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
be some kind of limit on it so you can

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.870 
be some kind of limit on it so you can
just<00:04:19.200> be<00:04:19.470> shooting<00:04:19.590> across<00:04:19.860> the<00:04:19.980> world<00:04:20.280> no

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
just be shooting across the world no

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.640 
just be shooting across the world no
problem<00:04:21.360> on<00:04:21.480> no<00:04:21.690> big<00:04:21.870> deal<00:04:22.020> whatever<00:04:22.260> whatever

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
problem on no big deal whatever whatever

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.920 
problem on no big deal whatever whatever
so<00:04:22.920> anyway<00:04:23.100> those<00:04:23.910> are<00:04:23.970> my<00:04:24.120> thoughts<00:04:24.210> let<00:04:24.840> me
