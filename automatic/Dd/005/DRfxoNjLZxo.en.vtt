00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.020
 the main idea of ​​what we are going to see

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.540
 important is to structure your 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.450

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.750
 silhouette that is going to be important 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:53.300
 structure and the silhouette that means 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.700

 drawing your size by wearing a 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.640
 belt so be careful it is not 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.490
 to tighten the belt at close to the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.760
 size but of the art laid on the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.400
 hips and so you will stand out 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.490
 your bust height compared to the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.100
 length of your legs and so you 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.739
 go lie down and refine your 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.690
 structured silhouette fashion silhouette 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.920
 with shapes that will create 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.620
 straight lines 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.900
 you will instead choose for example 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.810
 a trapezoid-shaped dress like the one 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.780
 it goes in triangle on the sides 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.269
 it will allow you to camouflage and the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.900
 belly and hips and she's going 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.780
 lengthen your silhouette in structure 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.850
 we draw and above all we do not forget to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.670
 play with overlays 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.610
 we can very well wear a small 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.459
 jacket at the waist without it being for 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.549
 that too centered but will have the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.110
 difference in tone or will allow you 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.120
 to balance to structure your 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.459
 silhouette 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.640
 so we said abel is round 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.750
 certainly but it pleases me abel while 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.049
 wood you can very well carried 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.209
 bright and nice color patterns and 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.500
 all this with darker colors 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.980
 on the parts of the body that you 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.300
 and refine or want a 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.750
 very little camouflaged 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.390
 if you choose a pattern for example 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.720
 like the pattern of this dress you 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.260
 would rather choose a little drawing in 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.500
 rather soft colors or even a 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.160
 little dark to blur the entire 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.550
 silhouette 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.250
 on the other hand you would of course avoid 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.440
 much bigger patterns the big ones 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.360
 well colored flowers well trimmed and especially 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.750
 the marinière in width because we know 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.970
 very well that stripes in width 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.700
 gives volume and are not there for 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.850
 structure in length my editor 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.380
 the silhouette bus lines so in 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.670
 the choice of clothing cuts that 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.380
 you can wear we will not forget the 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.540
 trapeze-shaped skirts that will come

 emphasize the size is concealed the 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.720
 hips 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.280
 you can also consider a cup 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.320
 straight skirts 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.930
