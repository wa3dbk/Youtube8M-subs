00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.310
 Hello guys 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.960
 in today's class we will meet the 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.030
 nutrients that contribute to the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.290
 development and healthy growth 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.030
 of children 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 also see which foods are 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.270
 sources of these nutrients so that you 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.560
 be careful when setting up the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.140
 your child's menu 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.359
 Let's start with the ingestion chaos. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.399
 adequate calcium content is important in 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.280
 childhood because in this phase the 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.219
 Intense growth of teeth and bones 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.710
 calcium is responsible for the 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.870
 maintaining growing bones 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.249
 between sources of calcium and we have milk 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.140
 and its derivatives such as yogurt and cheeses 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.899
 another super important nutrient is the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.030
 iron iron participates in the formation of 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.839
 a protein that carries oxygen to 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 cells 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:05.680
 the lack of iron brings joy that causes 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.290
 weakness and poor appetite 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.229
 learning the best sources of iron 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.990
 they are meats beans and green leaves 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.450
 and although cow's milk does not 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.670
 be a good source of iron already exist 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.409
 adapted laws for children who 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.600
 contribute to increased intake of 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.090
 of this nutrient 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.369
 Now let's talk about vitamins like that. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.409
 how minerals and vitamins participate 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.530
 development and growth 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.049
 let's stress vitamin A and a 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.140
 vitaminar participates in the training of all 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.750
 cartilage and even hostile tissues and 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.310
 vitamin D contributes to the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.770
 calcium in the bones 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.380
 the best sources of vitamin A are the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.710
 orange food like carrots 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.770
 pumpkin and mango and the sources of vitamin 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.719
 d egg yolk and fish besides of course 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.579
 sun exposure 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.560
 introducing these nutrients into the 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.999
 child feeding parents 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.130
 contribute to their 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.290
 developing countries that can 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.080
 grow play discover 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.700
 for today is this personal I hope you 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.700
 Next class of nutrition school
