smooth<00:04:20.139> it<00:04:20.320> out<00:04:20.440> spray<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.430> little<00:04:21.549> more<00:04:21.880> smooth

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
smooth it out spray a little more smooth

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.070 
smooth it out spray a little more smooth
it<00:04:22.600> out<00:04:22.750> spray<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> little<00:04:23.710> more<00:04:24.010> smooth<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.639> out

don't<00:04:26.080> even<00:04:26.380> bother<00:04:26.530> trying<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.340> get<00:04:27.490> to

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
don't even bother trying to get to

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.339 
don't even bother trying to get to
perfect<00:04:28.060> go<00:04:28.599> perfectly<00:04:28.960> flat<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:31.349> torturous

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
perfect go perfectly flat is torturous

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.480 
perfect go perfectly flat is torturous
as<00:04:32.590> it<00:04:32.889> is<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:35.320> think<00:04:36.099> instead<00:04:36.430> of

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
as it is and I think instead of

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.570 
as it is and I think instead of
waterboarding<00:04:37.180> they<00:04:37.690> should<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.889> this<00:04:39.160> as<00:04:39.520> a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
waterboarding they should have this as a

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.670 
waterboarding they should have this as a
torture<00:04:40.000> because<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:41.080> was<00:04:41.320> absolutely

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
torture because it was absolutely

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.310 
torture because it was absolutely
horrible<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.660> tree<00:04:43.900> over<00:04:43.930> there

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
horrible see that tree over there

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.740 
horrible see that tree over there

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
I was almost hanging from that tree by

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.250 
I was almost hanging from that tree by
paracord<00:04:47.320> because<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:47.950> this

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
paracord because of this

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.910 
paracord because of this
