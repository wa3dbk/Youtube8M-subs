this is a class for beginner or

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.050 
this is a class for beginner or
intermediate<00:00:14.910> or<00:00:15.599> even<00:00:16.109> advanced<00:00:16.440> students

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
intermediate or even advanced students

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.970 
intermediate or even advanced students
so<00:00:18.060> we're<00:00:18.300> doing<00:00:18.480> two<00:00:18.810> projects<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.830> this

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
so we're doing two projects for this

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.359 
so we're doing two projects for this
semester<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> portrait<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.830> took

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
semester one was a portrait and we took

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.660 
semester one was a portrait and we took
that<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:23.910> made<00:00:24.350> molds<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.890> plaster<00:00:26.430> and

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that and we made molds and plaster and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
that and we made molds and plaster and
cast<00:00:26.970> those<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.599> now<00:00:28.140> we're<00:00:28.320> working<00:00:28.500> our

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
cast those and now we're working our

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.970 
cast those and now we're working our
second<00:00:29.250> project<00:00:29.429> which<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> torso<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
second project which is a torso and so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.639 
second project which is a torso and so
you<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:32.940> Vanessa<00:00:33.540> our<00:00:33.989> male<00:00:34.320> model

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.650 

this<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:41.040> second<00:00:41.430> time<00:00:41.579> taking<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.450> class

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
this is my second time taking the class

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.450 
this is my second time taking the class
with<00:00:42.899> Professor<00:00:43.350> Gary<00:00:43.530> Hogan<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> figure

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
with Professor Gary Hogan the figure

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700 
with Professor Gary Hogan the figure
workshop<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.989> reason<00:00:46.230> why<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.379> taking

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
workshop and the reason why I'm taking

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
workshop and the reason why I'm taking
it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> by<00:00:47.910> day<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.390> software<00:00:48.870> engineer

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
it is a by day I'm a software engineer

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.959 
it is a by day I'm a software engineer
so<00:00:49.530> there's<00:00:49.710> frankly<00:00:50.129> something<00:00:50.460> nice<00:00:50.610> about

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so there's frankly something nice about

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
so there's frankly something nice about
once<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.870> week<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:52.559> hands<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> clay<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
once a week get my hands in clay and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
once a week get my hands in clay and
getting<00:00:53.820> dirty<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> doing<00:00:54.660> something

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
getting dirty and doing something

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.670 
getting dirty and doing something
tangible<00:00:56.000> we<00:00:57.000> began<00:00:57.300> by<00:00:57.570> creating<00:00:58.289> these

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
tangible we began by creating these

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
tangible we began by creating these
armatures<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.030> over<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
armatures so you see over here this is

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.500 
armatures so you see over here this is
an<00:01:00.930> armature<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.579> life-size

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
an armature which is of a life-size

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.219 
an armature which is of a life-size
scale<00:01:03.979> made<00:01:04.979> out<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.309> folding<00:01:05.970> pipes<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.689> wood

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
scale made out of folding pipes and wood

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.039 
scale made out of folding pipes and wood
and<00:01:07.409> wire<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.790> basically<00:01:09.299> what's<00:01:09.479> inside<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and wire it's basically what's inside of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.850 
and wire it's basically what's inside of
this<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> same<00:01:10.740> scale

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
this at the same scale

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.650 
this at the same scale
life-sized<00:01:12.860> piece<00:01:13.220> by<00:01:13.910> one<00:01:14.120> of<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.300> students

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
life-sized piece by one of the students

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.520 
life-sized piece by one of the students
in<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.900> class<00:01:15.550> so<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:17.390> can<00:01:17.420> kind<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.050> visualize

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
in the class so I can kind of visualize

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.120 
in the class so I can kind of visualize
how<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.220> is<00:01:20.140> existing<00:01:21.140> inside<00:01:21.680> of<00:01:21.860> here

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
how that that is existing inside of here

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.960 
how that that is existing inside of here
so<00:01:22.390> we'll<00:01:23.390> work<00:01:23.540> on<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:24.490> for<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.550> couple<00:01:25.850> more

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
so we'll work on this for a couple more

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.710 
so we'll work on this for a couple more
sessions<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.810> then<00:01:27.970> these<00:01:28.970> will<00:01:29.270> be<00:01:29.300> brought

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
sessions and then these will be brought

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.620 
sessions and then these will be brought
down<00:01:29.930> stairs<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.180> plaster<00:01:32.180> room<00:01:32.360> where

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
down stairs to the plaster room where

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.160 
down stairs to the plaster room where
they'll<00:01:32.810> be<00:01:33.220> turned<00:01:34.220> into<00:01:34.369> molds<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.170> we'll

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
they'll be turned into molds and we'll

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.950 
they'll be turned into molds and we'll
cast<00:01:36.410> those<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:37.060> plaster<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.450> would<00:01:41.600> use<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
cast those in plaster so I would use the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.130 
cast those in plaster so I would use the
blog<00:01:42.250> sort<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.310> aggressively<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:44.180> build<00:01:44.990> up

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
blog sort of aggressively to build up

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.350 
blog sort of aggressively to build up
some<00:01:45.350> volume<00:01:45.830> so<00:01:46.399> what<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.610> want<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:46.970> do<00:01:47.180> is

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
some volume so what I want you to do is

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.060 
some volume so what I want you to do is
to<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:48.080> work<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:48.290> I've<00:01:48.530> been<00:01:48.680> doing<00:01:48.950> this

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
to the work that I've been doing this

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.100 
to the work that I've been doing this
out<00:01:49.340> really<00:01:49.690> learning<00:01:50.690> just<00:01:50.899> how<00:01:51.020> to

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
out really learning just how to

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.050 
out really learning just how to
represent<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.740> figure<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.160> is<00:01:52.220> my<00:01:52.700> first

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
represent the figure this is my first

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.420 
represent the figure this is my first
art<00:01:53.390> class<00:01:53.690> since<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.440> was<00:01:54.680> in<00:01:54.860> college<00:01:55.040> many

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
art class since I was in college many

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.880 
art class since I was in college many
many<00:01:55.610> years<00:01:55.820> ago<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.899> sort<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.440> I

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
many years ago and so sort of and I

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.230 
many years ago and so sort of and I
didn't<00:01:58.130> even<00:01:58.220> have<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.460> lot<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.670> experience

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
didn't even have a lot of experience

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.880 
didn't even have a lot of experience
LEDs<00:01:59.509> this<00:01:59.930> has<00:02:00.080> really<00:02:00.350> been<00:02:00.530> my<00:02:00.560> first

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
LEDs this has really been my first

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.790 
LEDs this has really been my first
attempt<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:01.700> work<00:02:02.509> with<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.780> figure<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.229> try<00:02:03.740> to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
attempt to work with a figure to try to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.410 
attempt to work with a figure to try to
understand<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.340> properties<00:02:04.729> of<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.119> human

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
understand the properties of the human

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420 
understand the properties of the human
form<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.990> especially<00:02:06.530> as<00:02:06.619> its<00:02:06.770> realized<00:02:07.160> in

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
form and especially as its realized in

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.520 
form and especially as its realized in
clay<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.149> taking<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.050> through<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.380> whole

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
clay and taking it through the whole

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.040 
clay and taking it through the whole
process<00:02:09.739> from<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.970> know<00:02:11.060> conceptualization

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
process from you know conceptualization

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.560 
process from you know conceptualization
of<00:02:12.260> what<00:02:12.440> we're<00:02:12.590> going<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.800> do<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.570> sculpting

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
of what we're going to do to sculpting

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.060 
of what we're going to do to sculpting
the<00:02:14.660> form<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.050> then<00:02:15.170> realizing<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
the form to then realizing it in a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:26.970 
the form to then realizing it in a
plaster<00:02:16.459> cast
