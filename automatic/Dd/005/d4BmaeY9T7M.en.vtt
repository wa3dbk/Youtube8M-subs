00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
I guess this color scheme is broken when

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.840 
I guess this color scheme is broken when
you<00:01:03.640> do<00:01:03.820> that

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850

there
pressing<00:01:12.630> shift<00:01:13.100> apparently<00:01:14.100> breaks

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
pressing shift apparently breaks

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:28.120
