00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Ukraine should be ready for disintegration 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.020
 Russia we in recent months, often 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.940
 talking about the victory of our military and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.820
 volunteers over the Russian army 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.340
 separatist units for Russia 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.470
 which until recently 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.020
 involved in military conflicts is the most 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 a serious test that she has not yet 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.400
 passes all more previously straight 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.140
 collision or support one of 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 parties advisers and weapons 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.800
 led to a positive outcome but two 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.199
 wars with Chechnya 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 a population of much less than 1 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.489
 percent of the total number of Russians 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.480
 showed the failure of the Russian 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.670
 war machine 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.430
 the result was a public confession 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.010
 victories of Russia but on terms of Chechnya 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.610
 who now considers herself won 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.180
 by the side 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.079
 but Ukraine is not Chechnya people there though 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.390
 strong-willed 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.390
 but this small republic is 100 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 170 kilometers but it is the power of the spirit 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.570
 made her a winner in a fight with 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.000
 Russian army 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 By all measures our country is 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 a serious military opponent is impossible 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.350
 also forget it 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.119
 that the Ukrainians were considered among the best 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.520
 military men in the Soviet army namely 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.700
 on not held the organization discipline 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.580
 troops can remember who often was 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.950
 sergeant or ensign that's why 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.080
 Russia got involved in the adventure that she 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 may not survive the economic 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.130
 the failure of the country as a result 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.890
 quiet sanctions threatens Russia already in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.409
 for two maximum three years with such 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.909
 same scenario development and roll up with 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.579
 road war russian your 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.710
 defiantly unwilling and question how is he 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.040
 will leave will be overthrown or die his 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.649
 death is no longer worth it happen early 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.990
 or later people are introduced to the head 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.780
 that the Russian Federation without Putin 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.090
 impossible in this way Kremlin 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.549
 strategies themselves prepare the collapse scenario 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.549
 countries since after the death of the secretary general 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.469
 his seat was occupied by an elected politburo 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.329
 now the most important thing is that 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.939
 Russia will not be the continuity of power 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.130
 since everyone is fixated on only one 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.619
 personality any other will not only 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.429
 disputes but probably separatism inside 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.709
 federations 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.650
 Therefore, Ukraine should be ready for 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.079
 scenario 1 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.780
 Alla Russia must be calculated all 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.909
 possible future options in the west 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.930
 such things make the analytical center 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.030
 special services 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.459
 government agency just 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.319
 independent think tanks in 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.930
 Ukraine is very difficult with each of 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.450
 specified points but the consequences of expansion 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.140
 the territory of the Russian Federation is akin to the atomic explosion 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 bombs will touch strong we canâ€™t do much 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.349
 exclude 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.799
 that Kaliningrad will want to be part of 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.659
 Germany smoked and in Japan so on 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.220
 neighboring areas of Russia to our borders 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.379
 can in Ukraine 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.209
 collapse once again lead to 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.940
 breaking economic ties with Russia 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.980
 drop in exports is also necessary 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.810
 take into account the risk of loss of property 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.840
 Ukrainian business in some regions 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.030
 RF will reverse migration as 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.769
 today's displaced from 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.319
 Donbass and Ukrainians by 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.609
 origin who decide to return to 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.889
 historical homeland 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.650
 Ukraine will be desirable for living 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.569
 the most capable part of the Russians which 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.760
 they can realize themselves in their 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.560
 country it will cause significant 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.829
 migration flows through the territory 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 Ukraine as in the 90s this decay will lead to 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.819
 the growth of organized crime 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.340
 which will try to spread 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.620
 its influence on our country and such 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.780
 a huge number of factors and therefore 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.060
 if Ukraine is not able to do it 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.060
 it is necessary
