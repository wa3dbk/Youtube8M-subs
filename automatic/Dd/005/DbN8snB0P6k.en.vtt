invested so much in vic not just

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.650

on<00:02:09.810> offense<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.190> teams<00:02:11.370> looking

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
on offense I think if this teams looking

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
on offense I think if this teams looking
for<00:02:11.700> an<00:02:11.790> answer<00:02:11.910> it's<00:02:12.209> Gible<00:02:12.420> Shaw<00:02:12.660> McCoy<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
for an answer it's Gible Shaw McCoy the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
for an answer it's Gible Shaw McCoy the
ball<00:02:13.319> more<00:02:13.470> off

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
ball more off

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.070 
ball more off
I<00:02:13.860> think<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.340> give<00:02:14.550> Vic<00:02:14.820> one<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.360> shot<00:02:15.690> they

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
I think they give Vic one more shot they

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.560 
I think they give Vic one more shot they
play<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.440> Falcons<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.100> big<00:02:17.310> game<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:18.420> know
