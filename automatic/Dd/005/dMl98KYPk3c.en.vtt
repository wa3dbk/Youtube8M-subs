00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.960 

I<00:02:26.710> thought<00:02:27.710> it'd<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:27.890> really<00:02:28.130> fun<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.460> try<00:02:28.790> out

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
I thought it'd be really fun to try out

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.210 
I thought it'd be really fun to try out
humanely<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:30.260> idea<00:02:30.560> behind<00:02:30.680> writers<00:02:31.100> have

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
humanely the idea behind writers have

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.060 
humanely the idea behind writers have
got<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> sloop<00:02:31.760> self<00:02:32.060> around<00:02:32.410> yeah<00:02:33.410> my<00:02:33.590> voice<00:02:33.830> up

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
got a sloop self around yeah my voice up

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.310 
got a sloop self around yeah my voice up
I<00:02:34.370> use<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.150> my<00:02:35.270> solo<00:02:35.630> show<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.930> kind<00:02:36.260> of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
I use that in my solo show to kind of

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.470 
I use that in my solo show to kind of
create<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.950> more<00:02:37.400> structured<00:02:37.730> sounds<00:02:38.210> my<00:02:38.330> beat

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
create a more structured sounds my beat

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.060 
create a more structured sounds my beat
boxing<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.500> thought<00:02:39.710> be<00:02:39.830> really

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
boxing and I thought be really

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.740 
boxing and I thought be really
interesting<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.520> take<00:02:40.790> humans<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.540> give<00:02:41.660> each

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
interesting to take humans and give each

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.420 
interesting to take humans and give each
one<00:02:41.960> of<00:02:41.990> them<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.380> layer<00:02:42.710> I<00:02:43.010> kind<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.370> loop<00:02:45.430> but

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
one of them a layer I kind of loop but

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.300 
one of them a layer I kind of loop but
the<00:02:46.520> difference<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.060> with<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:48.290> foot<00:02:49.070> pedal

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the difference is with the foot pedal

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.130 
the difference is with the foot pedal
that<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.460> use<00:02:49.670> once<00:02:50.360> you've<00:02:50.510> put<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.750> loop<00:02:50.900> in

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
that I use once you've put the loop in

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.200 
that I use once you've put the loop in
that's<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.280> there's<00:02:52.550> kind<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.820> static

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
that's it is there's kind of static

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.520 
that's it is there's kind of static
