00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
that confidence come from I think there

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.420 
that confidence come from I think there
are<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:21.040> few<00:01:21.310> reasons<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.300> first<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.840> that

and<00:02:03.700> again<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.840> I'm<00:02:05.200> going<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.470> take<00:02:05.620> this

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
and again and I'm going to take this

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.770 
and again and I'm going to take this
from<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.010> slightly<00:02:06.220> different<00:02:06.430> perspective<00:02:06.790> as

as well they're students we know there's
more<00:02:09.640> than<00:02:09.789> one<00:02:09.970> answer<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.629> things

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
more than one answer the things

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.740 
more than one answer the things
you<00:02:12.310> know<00:02:12.400> i-i've<00:02:12.940> you'd<00:02:13.150> main<00:02:13.300> lesson<00:02:13.570> books

you know i-i've you'd main lesson books
is<00:02:13.870> broadly<00:02:14.140> applicable<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> lot<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.360> things

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
is broadly applicable to a lot of things

is broadly applicable to a lot of things
that<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.900> do<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.200> again<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:17.560> about<00:02:17.800> starting

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
how it would be and I found very quickly

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.600 
how it would be and I found very quickly
that<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.850> was<00:04:35.030> fully<00:04:35.270> prepared<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:36.980> I<00:04:37.280> think<00:04:37.520> in

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
that I was fully prepared and I think in

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.650 
that I was fully prepared and I think in
some<00:04:37.700> ways<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.480> know<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.230> felt<00:04:39.980> very<00:04:40.660> confident

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
some ways you know I felt very confident

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.360 
some ways you know I felt very confident
and<00:04:41.780> prepared<00:04:41.960> but<00:04:42.620> in<00:04:42.710> some<00:04:42.890> ways<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.190> best

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
and prepared but in some ways the best

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.490 
and prepared but in some ways the best
testimony<00:04:44.060> about<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:44.750> education<00:04:44.900> was<00:04:45.350> that

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
testimony about this education was that

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.990 
testimony about this education was that
no<00:04:45.620> one<00:04:45.650> knew<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:46.220> I'd<00:04:46.310> gone<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.640> a<00:04:46.670> waldorf

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
no one knew that I'd gone to a waldorf

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.520 
no one knew that I'd gone to a waldorf
school<00:04:47.180> no<00:04:47.300> one<00:04:47.420> said<00:04:47.540> oh<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.720> kind<00:04:48.170> of<00:04:48.260> act<00:04:48.410> a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
school no one said oh you kind of act a

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.810 
school no one said oh you kind of act a
little<00:04:48.650> different<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.250> must<00:04:49.370> have<00:04:49.580> gone<00:04:49.700> to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
little different you must have gone to

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.850 
little different you must have gone to
this<00:04:49.940> other<00:04:50.180> kind<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.570> school<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.230> so<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.740> think

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
this other kind of school and so I think

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.430 
this other kind of school and so I think
we're<00:04:52.460> sort<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:52.880> seamlessly<00:04:53.720> integrated<00:04:54.380> into

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
we're sort of seamlessly integrated into

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.560 
we're sort of seamlessly integrated into
wherever<00:04:54.800> we<00:04:55.160> go<00:04:55.370> there<00:04:55.640> isn't<00:04:55.880> sort<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.180> W

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
wherever we go there isn't sort of a W

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.440 
wherever we go there isn't sort of a W
on<00:04:56.750> our<00:04:56.780> on<00:04:57.110> our<00:04:57.400> chest<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:58.790> I<00:04:59.090> think<00:04:59.300> so<00:04:59.420> I

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
on our on our chest and I think so I

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.210 
on our on our chest and I think so I
think<00:04:59.540> for<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.870> parent<00:05:00.170> prospective<00:05:00.740> students

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
think for a parent prospective students

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.830 
think for a parent prospective students
or<00:05:01.340> parents<00:05:01.790> that's<00:05:01.970> really<00:05:02.330> important<00:05:02.780> I

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
or parents that's really important I

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.600 
or parents that's really important I
mean<00:05:02.960> we<00:05:03.080> take<00:05:03.320> amazing<00:05:03.740> strengths<00:05:04.340> from<00:05:04.490> this

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
mean we take amazing strengths from this

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.610 
mean we take amazing strengths from this
place<00:05:04.880> but<00:05:05.120> it's<00:05:05.450> not<00:05:05.570> like<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:05.870> stand<00:05:06.230> out<00:05:06.440> in

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
place but it's not like we stand out in

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.730 
place but it's not like we stand out in
a<00:05:06.770> in<00:05:06.980> a<00:05:07.100> bad<00:05:07.250> way<00:05:07.460> I<00:05:08.330> think<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.290> idea<00:05:09.650> of

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
a in a bad way I think the idea of

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.910 
a in a bad way I think the idea of
integrating<00:05:10.610> across<00:05:11.380> across<00:05:12.380> disciplines

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
integrating across across disciplines

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.710 
integrating across across disciplines
across<00:05:13.040> ideas<00:05:13.670> across<00:05:15.430> silos<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:17.030> definitely

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
across ideas across silos is definitely

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.300 
across ideas across silos is definitely
a<00:05:17.750> theme<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.260> comes<00:05:18.500> from<00:05:18.830> here<00:05:19.100> and<00:05:19.220> has

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
a theme that comes from here and has

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.100 
a theme that comes from here and has
served<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.910> think<00:05:20.120> all<00:05:20.270> of<00:05:20.300> us<00:05:20.570> very<00:05:20.750> well<00:05:20.840> in

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
served I think all of us very well in

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.690 
served I think all of us very well in
the<00:05:21.170> work<00:05:21.320> we<00:05:21.470> do<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.740> sounds<00:05:22.100> like<00:05:22.280> one<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.580> the

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
the work we do it sounds like one of the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.410 
the work we do it sounds like one of the
things<00:05:22.850> that<00:05:23.120> I<00:05:23.300> often<00:05:23.690> get<00:05:24.050> when<00:05:25.060> I<00:05:26.060> step<00:05:26.300> back

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
things that I often get when I step back

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.850 
things that I often get when I step back
and<00:05:26.480> think<00:05:26.720> about<00:05:26.780> how<00:05:26.900> people<00:05:27.110> describe<00:05:27.560> me

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
and think about how people describe me

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.680 
and think about how people describe me
in<00:05:27.890> my<00:05:28.130> in<00:05:28.340> my<00:05:28.490> work<00:05:28.700> life<00:05:28.970> people<00:05:29.330> say<00:05:29.510> you're

in my in my work life people say you're
an<00:05:29.780> amazing<00:05:30.200> dot<00:05:30.410> connector<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.760> think

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
an amazing dot connector and I think

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.120 
an amazing dot connector and I think
that<00:05:32.120> really<00:05:32.300> comes<00:05:32.690> from<00:05:33.230> the<00:05:33.830> kind<00:05:34.040> of

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
that really comes from the kind of

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.530 
that really comes from the kind of
education<00:05:34.640> we<00:05:34.730> get<00:05:34.880> here<00:05:35.090> where<00:05:35.240> you're<00:05:35.390> not

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
education we get here where you're not

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.480 
education we get here where you're not
limited<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:35.990> one<00:05:36.110> sort<00:05:36.560> of<00:05:36.620> path<00:05:36.890> of<00:05:37.160> thinking

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
limited to one sort of path of thinking

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.700 
limited to one sort of path of thinking
you<00:05:37.610> think<00:05:37.820> across<00:05:38.090> paths<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:39.350> I<00:05:39.410> think<00:05:39.590> that

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
you think across paths so I think that

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.500 
you think across paths so I think that
that<00:05:39.950> was<00:05:40.070> an<00:05:40.160> amazing<00:05:40.550> form<00:05:40.730> of<00:05:40.820> preparation

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
that was an amazing form of preparation

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.560 
that was an amazing form of preparation
I<00:05:41.750> think<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.520> idea<00:05:43.730> of<00:05:43.790> hard<00:05:44.000> work<00:05:44.240> which

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
I think the the idea of hard work which

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.390 
I think the the idea of hard work which
i<00:05:44.750> think<00:05:44.810> is<00:05:45.080> really<00:05:45.500> great<00:05:45.740> points<00:05:46.130> that<00:05:46.220> drew

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
i think is really great points that drew

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.310 
i think is really great points that drew
made<00:05:46.640> you<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.480> don't<00:05:47.690> shy<00:05:47.900> away<00:05:47.930> from<00:05:48.140> hard

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
made you you don't shy away from hard

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.900 
made you you don't shy away from hard

art that would be me on the last one but

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.700 
art that would be me on the last one but
you<00:06:01.880> do<00:06:02.060> it<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.480> and<00:06:02.960> you<00:06:03.020> can't<00:06:03.260> just<00:06:03.500> sort<00:06:03.680> of

you do it and and you can't just sort of

you do it and and you can't just sort of
shy<00:06:03.920> away<00:06:04.070> from<00:06:04.220> and<00:06:04.610> opt<00:06:04.790> out<00:06:05.060> you<00:06:05.390> do<00:06:05.570> it<00:06:05.720> and

you may not be it may not yet be the

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.310 
you may not be it may not yet be the
thing<00:06:08.090> you're<00:06:08.240> best<00:06:08.480> at<00:06:08.720> but<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.080> fact<00:06:09.260> that

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
thing you're best at but the fact that

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.170 
thing you're best at but the fact that
you<00:06:09.440> were<00:06:09.530> exposed<00:06:09.860> to<00:06:10.070> and<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.310> fact<00:06:11.090> that

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
you were exposed to and the fact that

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.880 
you were exposed to and the fact that
you<00:06:11.300> tried<00:06:11.600> it<00:06:11.840> I<00:06:11.960> think<00:06:12.140> gives<00:06:12.470> you<00:06:12.590> a<00:06:12.620> huge

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
you tried it I think gives you a huge

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.860 
you tried it I think gives you a huge
amount<00:06:13.070> of<00:06:13.250> confidence<00:06:13.640> later<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:14.630> I<00:06:14.690> think

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
amount of confidence later and I think

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.940 
amount of confidence later and I think
the<00:06:14.930> last<00:06:15.080> thing<00:06:15.290> I<00:06:15.350> would<00:06:15.500> just<00:06:15.530> say<00:06:15.740> is<00:06:15.860> this

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
the last thing I would just say is this

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.220 
the last thing I would just say is this
fearlessness<00:06:16.510> I<00:06:18.310> I'm<00:06:19.310> not<00:06:19.550> um<00:06:20.090> we<00:06:20.990> all<00:06:21.080> have

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
fearlessness I I'm not um we all have

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.600 
fearlessness I I'm not um we all have
different<00:06:21.500> I<00:06:21.560> would<00:06:21.710> never<00:06:21.860> go<00:06:22.040> snowboarding
