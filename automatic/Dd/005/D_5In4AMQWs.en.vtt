00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.059
 lg has just introduced the gpad sa 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.139
 first tablet we had the 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.330
 chance to take it in hand 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.849
 here is the result of our little test 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.259
 level design one is on 8 3 inches 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.509
 got a little bit ufo but 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.740
 level ergonomics nothing to report everything is going 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.500
 very well it holds well in hand 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.840
 the chosen materials are quality the 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.890
 back is aluminum or rather in a 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.900
 aluminum aspe material in any case that 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.400
 does not plastic cheap is good 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.559
 quality then that's for the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.030
 body level equipment the top 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.120
 speakers are of good quality it gives 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.710
 a good sound we have a micro slot sd 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.649
 which can allow you to increase 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.539
 overall storage space is 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.590
 a tablet that holds well in hand that 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.230
 is nice that gives an impression of 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.670
 quality then the screen the screen it's a 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.980
 very good points of this tablet 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.449
 lg announces the first tablet in 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.789
 8 inches full hd 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.170
 in fact she does more and 1920 x 1200 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.780
 pixels the colors are good 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.910
 balanced the slab lcd ip s offers a 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.910
 contrast really really well we can 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.690
 see with the brightness at 100% it's 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.690
 really very very clear 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.660
 then at system level on to android 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.460
 4.2.2 with the overlayer lg 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.140
 it brings a lot of features 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.880
 exclusive that we knew hours 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.380
 on devices on the optimus I have 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.340
 for example and found on the g2 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.840
 now more news then slide 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.320
 side to start so it's multi 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.700
 tasks 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.530
 we will call applications doing 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.970
 slide with three fingers we can 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.160
 call the notifications bar as 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.560
 we're doing it now and we're all going 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.340
 remembered actually by dragging from 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.590
 the left one can open up to 3 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.500
 applications at the same time like these 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.990
 what is rather practical ass plan 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.759
 slide the old multitasking of lg I you 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.960
 showed my words quick so in fact 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.759
 this function allows you to take 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740
 screenshots by pressing a 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.479
 touch and then to be able to write 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.920
 on it like that by hand rather 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.940
 convenient for taking notes sent 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.530
 jokes etc 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.080
 we know that already more than others 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.430
 marks there I show our canes who 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.720
 allows wake or put 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.160
 watch the tablet by tapping on it 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.220
 like hitting a door that gadget 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.560
 nice very very well against the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.880
 fonts touchdowns that allow you to 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 choose which icon displayed in a 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.959
 shortcut area down it's very 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.760
 very practical to use 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.049
 let's move on to the camera not big 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.510
 to say as usual it is 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.459
 a 5 megapixel tablet software 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.709
 is okay here I do not know if you 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.700
 can see it the screen is not 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.769
 catastrophic 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.080
 the colors are a little pale the level 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.390
 details blah 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.830
 this is our first test from there 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.400
 I do not have the first tablet of the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.230
 brand lg 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.730
 she will arrive on the market later this 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.230
 september we have not yet 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.970
 information about the price as soon as 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.590
