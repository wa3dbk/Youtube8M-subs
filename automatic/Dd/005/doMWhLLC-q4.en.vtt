00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi all a while ago i did 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.930
 a kind of 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.639
 done livestream chat and yes you will 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.380
 actually live chat with me and then 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.759
 I answer your questions via webcam 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.379
 and then I also asked if you too 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.980
 as nice as I would not withhold it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.779
 because I doubt very much but yes I have 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 nevertheless decided that I really do not like me 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.099
 want to keep because it seems really whole 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.869
 very nice to the girls who have my videos 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.730
 looking to meet 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.279
 so I would really like it 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.610
 if you are coming i wanted on sunday 2 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.350
 do it in february because that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.719
 the most central place is and for 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 myself it is also quite favorable 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 and then I want it at 1 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.210
 let it start 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.730
 I take my sister also saying a 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.079
 can you also meet her and yes 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.660
 that just love a nice day 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.640
 just make a little shopping with one 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.840
 group and maybe somewhere 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.149
 drinking or eating together, so what should you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.289
 have to leave earlier or no problem 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.480
 it just seems really nice to you 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.220
 just to see and it seems to me 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.630
 most convenient to get off a central point 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
 to speak 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.830
 I myself had the big starbucks for that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.040
 in mind that's the starbucks that 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.840
 opposite the sign with just the big one 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 sign with all information about the trains 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.700
 state and if you come and leave it alone 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.700
 reproach I have e-mail address below 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.020
 put that is contact at ultimate special 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.360
 on point heel 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.619
 because yes then I know you were coming and then 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.079
 I will send you one in advance 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.549
 email with some additional information and so o 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.259
 yes just for clarity it 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.600
 really doesn't matter what age you are 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.950
 does not indicate the age so 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.250
 probably incredibly varied 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.600
 are from what comes so 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.579
 everyone is welcome really doesn't matter 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.250
 and then I hope to see you 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.659
 so be sure to let us know if you are coming and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.979
 by the way, I will be like that again soon 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.869
 do a live chat because I really like it 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.610
 nice to interact with you 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.290
 and then I would 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 announce in advance because last time 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.390
 I did not 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.860
 like it actually just one 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.259
 experiment I had never done it before 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.640
 and I thought I'd just do it 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.320
 but next time it is too 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.500
 to announce 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.500
 bye
