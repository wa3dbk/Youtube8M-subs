00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.430
 how could we define it ippv 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.960
 there are many ways to define the iptv but some very simple way of 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.629
 understand 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.980
 what iptv concept this new technology is developed for 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.909
 allow 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.459
 to all customers that currently have broadband through the 

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:21.449
 adsl 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.539
 to send them the digital fully digital signal of a service like 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.710
 it's television 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.769
 and the video this is if it is a development that will allow us all 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.899
 current homes where internet was 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.909
 important 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.649
 make them reach an entertainment offer based on television 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.649
 in a simple way through its broadband 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.510
 in which is differentiate colate percent and cable television can the tdt and 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.600
 cable television the two are broadcast television signals 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.480
 that and digital in this sense is the same as the iptv 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.950
 but we find ourselves with a difference 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.030
 fundamental 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.329
 that support the characteristics that the bird has 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.359
 and broadband 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.019
 the first is that the tdt 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.690
 fimi that all the channels while they are in the air 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.380
 one needs to have an antenna in his building and be able to receive these 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 channels and then attended in his art a device 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.960
 that allows you to separate 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.090
 the different digital signals that get the same thing happens with the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.859
 TV 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.889
 by cable nothing more than the mission medium of all these channels at once 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 is according to puig it is a limited cable medium just like the tdt 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.400
 in this sense the iptv differs because it is using 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.710
 that part of the broadband that is interactivity is to say 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.970
 we could only sign 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.560
 cd from each home to the customer 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.180
 the contents that he in that mode that at that moment is demanding of a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.480
 very simple way through the command 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 the television he decides what content they want 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.590
 and how he wants to see them there gives us a big difference and that is 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.120
 we went from a television with schedules and with predefined contents to a 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.890
 model 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.179
 of service that will allow us to customize the offer 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.119
 to each customer what he needs and without jeep schedules r terms of that is the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.959
 big difference from DTT and cable 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.909
 there is some type tv in operation 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.820
 is currently carrying this service advice 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.270
 that has developed a lot in me in all the countries of europe is 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.439
 leading 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.529
 this this technology that we find what someone successes 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.339
 commercial the museum was for example in Spain 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:32.369
 started pioneering imagenio is the commercial brand of digital television 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:37.419
 currently and is having great commercial success, including 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:41.639
 four type adsl distributors and colanzi pointed to other competitors 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.689
 that are entering this market to offer customers in addition to the 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:46.589
 broadband 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.689
 interactive services 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.930
 and digital television stands out clearly highlight markets such as italy france and 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.969
 united kingdom where are they having 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.389
 a very important success within audiovisual products 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.200
 and he the case to highlight is that of john for a country 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.269
 is reaching almost a million customers only knows a ratio between 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.660
 small with a product already very mature 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.660
 and successful imacec very successful unemployment 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.799
 what technology does the iptv work with? 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.369
 but as commented 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:22.099
 the ptwc based on the network we have broadband adsl 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.759
 and about this time 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.279
 all the contents I court the contents of television 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:36.660
 movie theater 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.550
 documentary series 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.929
 we make them available to the client so that he can 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.149
 one hundred see 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:45.580
 very simple through the command 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.140
 loose teams want mtb today through a 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.669
 in a technology way that is the refrain 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:57.839
 We send this signal to the client's house and transforms it through a 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.320
 device arranges your house that is a decoder 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.519
 and will allow it 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.079
 In a very simple way 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.679
 individually all these contents 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.429
 as if I really had a video 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.979
 in your home a high quality DVD that you can rewind 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.900
 what advantages does it have compared to good normal digital television 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.640
 respect the television signal 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.779
 the video 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:25.680
 everything must be taken television 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.720
 mx and such 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.279
 we work with a digital standard that is for everyone makes sense 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.800
 we have the same 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.990
 the same 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.770
 the level of quality of the television signal now our point 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.660
 differential that appears is that clearly supported in interactivity 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.840
 that allows broadband adsl I will not allow to bring the client a 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.510
 series services unthinkable in other digital models that is to say the 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:49.439
 interactivity 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.340
 well since 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.750
 the television the client will be able to see his email 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.710
 will be able to buy movie tickets 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.100
 or to be able to surf the internet was even enter your bank and make your 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.159
 transfers we are not allowed 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.570
 the whole world of digital solutions 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.700
 that were previously available to the computer and now thanks to the iptv the 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.479
 we put 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.910
 on the customer's television
