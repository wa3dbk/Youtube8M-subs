00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.770 
just another record we've claimed the
reality<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.139> that<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:57.099> Chinese<00:03:57.730> have<00:03:58.239> the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
reality is is that the Chinese have the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.009 
reality is is that the Chinese have the
fastest<00:03:59.470> growing<00:03:59.560> rate<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.459> obesity<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.870> if

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
fastest growing rate of obesity and if

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.300 
fastest growing rate of obesity and if
they<00:04:02.139> keep<00:04:02.319> going<00:04:02.530> they're<00:04:02.829> going<00:04:02.859> to<00:04:03.010> catch

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
they keep going they're going to catch

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.729 
they keep going they're going to catch
up<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.609> us<00:04:03.639> very<00:04:03.940> very<00:04:04.150> rapidly<00:04:04.299> here<00:04:04.840> India<00:04:05.650> is

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
up to us very very rapidly here India is

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.030 
up to us very very rapidly here India is
now<00:04:05.859> number<00:04:06.069> three<00:04:07.139> as<00:04:08.139> far<00:04:08.380> as<00:04:08.410> obesity<00:04:08.769> rate

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
now number three as far as obesity rate

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.710 
now number three as far as obesity rate
goes<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.549> obesity<00:04:10.000> epidemic<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.690> taking

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
goes so the obesity epidemic is taking

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.740 
goes so the obesity epidemic is taking
place<00:04:11.109> worldwide<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:12.450> one<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.599> major

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
place worldwide and one of the major

place worldwide and one of the major
causes<00:04:14.079> of<00:04:14.349> that<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:15.030> believe<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:17.200> technology

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859
