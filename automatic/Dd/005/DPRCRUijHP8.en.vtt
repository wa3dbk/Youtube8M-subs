nice answer actually and the shop our uh

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.770 
nice answer actually and the shop our uh
it's<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.170> good<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.820> got<00:00:57.510> quite<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it's a it's good and it's got quite a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.990 
it's a it's good and it's got quite a
rapid<00:00:58.199> fire<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.680> well<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> could<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.850> know

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
rapid fire as well so you could you know

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
rapid fire as well so you could you know
a<00:01:00.030> couple<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.480> pops<00:01:00.690> into<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.140> zombie<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.710> there

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
a couple of pops into a zombie and there

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.609 
a couple of pops into a zombie and there
there<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.340> got<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.899> effective<00:01:03.899> range<00:01:04.170> it's

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
there have got a effective range it's

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.280 
there have got a effective range it's
probably<00:01:04.830> why<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.700> terms<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.119> pistols<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:07.080> are

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
probably why I'm terms of pistols we are

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.179 
probably why I'm terms of pistols we are
looking<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.890> probably<00:01:08.510> it's<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.979> close<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
looking at probably it's a close to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.600 
looking at probably it's a close to
mid-range<00:01:11.369> pistol<00:01:13.130> match<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> mark<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
mid-range pistol match to mark the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
mid-range pistol match to mark the
revolver<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.200> too

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
revolver really and it's not too

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
revolver really and it's not too
different<00:01:16.470> terms<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> range<00:01:17.360> much<00:01:18.360> less<00:01:18.689> will

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
different terms of range much less will

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.270 
different terms of range much less will
recall<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.439> well<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.159> quite

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
recall as well so it's going to be quite

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.149 
recall as well so it's going to be quite
accurate<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.229> saw<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
accurate with them as you saw there the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.300 
accurate with them as you saw there the
loudness<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:24.439> it's<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.710> too<00:01:25.860> bad<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.189> all

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
loudness it's it's not too bad at all

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.390 
loudness it's it's not too bad at all
really<00:01:26.729> nowhere<00:01:27.540> near<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.930> loud<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> 45

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really nowhere near as loud as the 45

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.600 
really nowhere near as loud as the 45
revolver<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> you're<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.520> have

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
revolver and so you're not going to have

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090 
revolver and so you're not going to have
any<00:01:32.729> problems<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.990> alert<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> means<00:01:34.650> um

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
any problems with the alert it means um

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.210 
any problems with the alert it means um
bees<00:01:35.390> unfortunately<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> radius<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
bees unfortunately the radius of this it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.990 
bees unfortunately the radius of this it
pretty<00:01:38.700> difficult<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.450> find<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.290> say

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
pretty difficult to find I will say

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
pretty difficult to find I will say
normally<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.240> found<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.899> military

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
normally only found in military

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
normally only found in military
complexes<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.600> likewise<00:01:46.320> finding<00:01:47.189> magazine

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
complexes and likewise finding magazine

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.090 
complexes and likewise finding magazine
for<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.390> well<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.350> pretty<00:01:49.799> tricky

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
for as well is going to be pretty tricky

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
for as well is going to be pretty tricky
so<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.970> aware<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.840> know<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.110> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so just be aware that you know if you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
so just be aware that you know if you
