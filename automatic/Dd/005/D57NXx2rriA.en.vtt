I'll know this pendant with the rubber
bands<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> float<00:01:12.810> down

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
bands and so it's going to float down

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.880 
bands and so it's going to float down
but<00:01:13.409> he<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.090> drop<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> low<00:01:15.869> egg<00:01:16.439> can't

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
but he has to drop it and low egg can't

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.810 
but he has to drop it and low egg can't
break<00:01:17.130> then<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.240> run<00:01:18.479> across<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:21.619> grass<00:01:22.820> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
break then you run across the grass the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
break then you run across the grass the
across<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> field<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
across the field and then you have to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.350 
across the field and then you have to
crack<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> into<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> bowl<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.820> prove<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
crack it into a bowl to prove that it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
crack it into a bowl to prove that it
didn't<00:01:27.600> crack<00:01:28.310> anyway<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
didn't crack anyway so you have to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.590 
didn't crack anyway so you have to
protect<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> egg<00:01:31.070> but<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.420> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
protect the egg but if you just so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.460 
protect the egg but if you just so

square each time and then smaller and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.530 
square each time and then smaller and
then<00:02:12.450> down

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
then down

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.380 
then down
just<00:02:13.810> patch<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.079> up<00:02:14.319> at<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.620> very<00:02:14.650> bottom<00:02:15.390> so

it kind of goes around the top of the
egg<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:22.230> what<00:02:23.230> kind<00:02:23.439> of<00:02:23.469> fits<00:02:23.709> right<00:02:23.950> in

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129
