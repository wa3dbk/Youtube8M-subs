00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.790
 hello very good to all today 60 in the 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.260
 channel to 141 times and let's say a 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.540
 little that goes for everyone who is 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.790
 well ours that is new is a channel 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.120
 basically dedicated to doing direct or 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.400
 is there some videos there are very few 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.410
 but videos tend to be for example a 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.780
 record of zombies a record of what 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.130
 be that I could not issue it in 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.560
 direct because I have not done it live 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.449
 and then it's a record so let's put it 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.699
 as a video because I will not be able to do 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.409
 something else I will not broadcast a video like that 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.769
 that's good basically to say that 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:38.410
 is going to made a channel dedicated to 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.390
 simply make direct 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.800
 Whoever wants to can look 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.350
 there is usually no schedule of 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.920
 direct every weekend 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 have a direct but the days the diary 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.719
 and well in the background you will have some 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.739
 some scenes of direct or 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.690
 battlefield I do not know and there you will have 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.690
 as you see the logo of the channel is 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.860
 oriented to direct with the theme of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.070
 Direct point and it is oriented to 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.619
 that sense a lot or much content 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.590
 of the channel is focused on zombies of 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.439
 call of duty and butterfield battlefield 4 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.060
 or battlefield 3 and that is the battery 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.240
 much content because it is focused on 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.179
 that to minecraft also a little bit 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.069
 league of legends a little bit of everything but 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.570
 those two are the priority ones of the 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.670
 channel 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.810
 I 'm not interested either because we're what 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.180
 let's take advantage to say no 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.610
 Interested in any type of boss x or anything 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.120
 We in the line of opinion have to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.740
 look like neither background nor anything 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.310
 thank you very much to anyone who wants to offer 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.310
 but 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.440
 and nothing, if you like we take a look 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.750
 by the channel look some direct look 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.610
 the little jumps that you do that maybe 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.950
 an hour that they follow us direct for that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.810
 It's going to be very cool and good since it's 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.490
 let's answer a question that is 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.070
 why are you direct on YouTube and not 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.619
 in tweets good twitch is a platform 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.509
 that occasionally fails me is a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.209
 thing does not reproduce the direct ones I do not know 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.670
 curtain and that not everyone reads it 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.980
 reproduce 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.750
 and almost nobody finds out about being notified 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.510
 because people look more youtube of 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.970
 first that tweets and is a platform 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.830
 Well, I like to see it once in a while 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.150
 I have channel in tweets and I use it 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.700
 once in a while to do tests of 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.500
 games and so on and how many are we 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.780
 five but good 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.640
 whoever wants to pass by is 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.930

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.700
