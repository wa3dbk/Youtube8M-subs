00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
at the top were you going to test to see

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.640 
at the top were you going to test to see
how<00:01:58.010> stronger<00:01:58.580> this<00:01:58.670> thing<00:01:58.880> actually<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.650> jen

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
how stronger this thing actually is jen

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.010 
how stronger this thing actually is jen
i'm<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.760> start<00:02:02.090> off<00:02:02.210> by<00:02:02.270> giving<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.900> a

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
i'm going to start off by giving it a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
i'm going to start off by giving it a
lot<00:02:03.560> bash<00:02:04.360> see<00:02:05.360> how<00:02:05.450> strong<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.020> but<00:02:06.200> I'm<00:02:06.320> we

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
lot bash see how strong it is but I'm we

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.650 
lot bash see how strong it is but I'm we
eventually<00:02:07.310> going<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.670> put<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.880> window<00:02:08.240> here<00:02:08.479> so

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
eventually going to put a window here so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.810 
eventually going to put a window here so
I'm<00:02:08.869> not<00:02:09.200> really<00:02:09.500> too<00:02:09.830> afraid<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.190> damaging

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
I'm not really too afraid of damaging

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.320 
I'm not really too afraid of damaging
this<00:02:11.180> thing<00:02:11.330> but<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:12.320> is<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.300> a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
this thing but this is this is a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.100 
this thing but this is this is a
polystyrene<00:02:15.790> house<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.950> as<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.310> see<00:02:20.110> it

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
polystyrene house and as you can see it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.640 
polystyrene house and as you can see it
takes<00:02:21.320> quite<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.010> bit<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.250> beating<00:02:22.840> so<00:02:23.840> then

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
takes quite a bit of beating so then

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.650 
takes quite a bit of beating so then
what<00:02:25.520> do<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.670> think<00:02:25.880> about<00:02:25.940> our<00:02:26.300> Polar<00:02:26.540> Star

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
what do you think about our Polar Star

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.540 
what do you think about our Polar Star
in<00:02:26.989> half<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.320> forth<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.709> think<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:28.250> got<00:02:28.400> good

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
in half so forth I think it's got good

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.340 
in half so forth I think it's got good
potential<00:02:28.910> Mike<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.630> can<00:02:29.780> see<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.020> not<00:02:30.170> you

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
potential Mike you can see I'm not you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.930 
potential Mike you can see I'm not you

pounding<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.459> side<00:02:34.670> absolutely<00:02:35.330> there's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
pounding on that side absolutely there's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.000 
pounding on that side absolutely there's
no<00:02:35.600> affection<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.110> think<00:02:36.380> what<00:02:36.560> happens<00:02:36.890> is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
no affection I think what happens is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.130 
no affection I think what happens is
that<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.459> polystyrene<00:02:37.910> has<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.570> cushioning

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
that the polystyrene has a cushioning

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.140 
that the polystyrene has a cushioning
effect<00:02:39.290> so<00:02:39.950> what<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.190> does<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.550> localizes

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
effect so what it does is it localizes

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.300 
effect so what it does is it localizes
the<00:02:41.390> vibration<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.350> spot<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.190> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
the vibration to the one spot and it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.160 
the vibration to the one spot and it
doesn't<00:02:43.610> carry<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.000> cross<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.840> also<00:02:44.930> doesn't

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
doesn't carry the cross it also doesn't
