see<00:01:57.200> right<00:01:57.380> here<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:59.950> planes

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.430 

the<00:02:15.459> second<00:02:15.879> element<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.360> telekinesis<00:02:17.200> is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the second element of telekinesis is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.490 
the second element of telekinesis is
lifesteal<00:02:18.160> which<00:02:18.940> slowly<00:02:19.420> drains<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.110> target

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
lifesteal which slowly drains the target

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.949 
lifesteal which slowly drains the target
time<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.069> gives<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.819> as<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.840> see

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
time and gives it to you as you can see

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.540 
time and gives it to you as you can see
right<00:02:23.080> here<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.440> target<00:02:23.620> eventually<00:02:24.220> dies

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
right here the target eventually dies

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.970 
right here the target eventually dies
because<00:02:25.030> well<00:02:25.629> it's<00:02:26.110> health<00:02:26.319> goes<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.650> zero

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
because well it's health goes to zero

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.229 
because well it's health goes to zero
and<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:28.480> after<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.019> we<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.500> lightning

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
and then after that we have lightning

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.480 
and then after that we have lightning

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
this is of my personal favorite elephant

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.610 
this is of my personal favorite elephant
but<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.360> pick<00:02:35.570> people<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.380> shocks

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
but you pick people up and it shocks

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.070 
but you pick people up and it shocks
everyone<00:02:36.950> around<00:02:37.250> them<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.760> even<00:02:38.660> after<00:02:38.960> you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
everyone around them and even after you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.870 
everyone around them and even after you
throw<00:02:39.320> them<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.620> shocks<00:02:39.890> people<00:02:40.070> along<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
throw them it shocks people along the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.190 
throw them it shocks people along the
way

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
way

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.130 
way
so<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.220> third<00:02:43.520> power<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.270> get<00:02:44.480> stomping

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
so the third power you can get stomping

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.320 
so the third power you can get stomping
and<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:46.250> first<00:02:46.490> element<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:46.940> get<00:02:47.060> for<00:02:47.240> that

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
and the first element you get for that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.190 
and the first element you get for that
is<00:02:47.660> wrong<00:02:48.110> which<00:02:48.850> well<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.420> launches<00:02:50.810> everyone

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
is wrong which well it launches everyone

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.190 
is wrong which well it launches everyone
back<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.680> does<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:52.130> pretty<00:02:53.030> decent<00:02:53.870> amount<00:02:53.930> of

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
back and does a pretty decent amount of

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.650 
back and does a pretty decent amount of
damage<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.800> them

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
damage to them

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.330 
damage to them
the<00:02:56.660> second<00:02:57.080> element<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:57.740> for<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.100> is

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the second element you get for this is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.930 
the second element you get for this is
gravity<00:02:59.090> which<00:02:59.600> is<00:03:00.080> my<00:03:01.010> personal<00:03:01.490> favorite

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
gravity which is my personal favorite

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.740 
gravity which is my personal favorite
because<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.420> levitates<00:03:02.690> everyone

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
because it levitates everyone

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.750 
because it levitates everyone
just<00:03:05.290> knock<00:03:05.740> down<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:06.220> also<00:03:06.370> looks<00:03:06.670> really

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
just knock down it also looks really

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.180 
just knock down it also looks really
cool<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.690> did<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:08.380> mention<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.740> works<00:03:09.040> on

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
cool and did I mention that works on

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.380 
cool and did I mention that works on
cars<00:03:09.490> as<00:03:09.730> well<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:11.460> for<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.520> final<00:03:12.970> element

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
cars as well and for the final element

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.070 
cars as well and for the final element
of<00:03:13.480> stomp

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
of stomp

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.040 
of stomp
we<00:03:14.260> have<00:03:14.470> shrink<00:03:14.910> which<00:03:15.910> makes<00:03:16.630> everyone

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
we have shrink which makes everyone

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.560 
we have shrink which makes everyone
smaller<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.890> literally<00:03:18.640> allows<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.390> just

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
smaller and literally allows you to just

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.040 
smaller and literally allows you to just
walk<00:03:19.840> right<00:03:20.140> over<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:21.540> now<00:03:22.540> for<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.840> final

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
walk right over and now for the final

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.280 
walk right over and now for the final

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
power which is fun what this does is it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.250 
power which is fun what this does is it
feels<00:03:26.560> damage<00:03:27.040> from<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.340> element<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
feels damage from that element to the
