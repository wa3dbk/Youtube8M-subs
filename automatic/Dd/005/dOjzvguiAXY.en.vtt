has a really great aggressive sort of

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.960 
has a really great aggressive sort of
rock-and-roll<00:00:18.449> acoustic<00:00:19.350> strum<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.010> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
rock-and-roll acoustic strum to it and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.929 
rock-and-roll acoustic strum to it and
it<00:00:21.090> uses<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.449> lot<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> basic<00:00:22.170> chords<00:00:22.939> although

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it uses a lot of basic chords although

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.310 
it uses a lot of basic chords although
it<00:00:24.119> still<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> little<00:00:24.779> fast<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.199> its

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
it still is a little fast in its
movements<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> thought<00:00:26.430> it'd<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.670> really

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.160 
movements but I thought it'd be a really
good<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.240> us<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> take<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> look<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.019> so

I can strum another a in there to finish

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.760 
I can strum another a in there to finish
off<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:57.959> measure<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:01.230> then<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.470> goes<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.650> E

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
off that measure and then it goes to E

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:17.490 
off that measure and then it goes to E
minor<00:04:05.900> I'm<00:04:06.900> sorry<00:04:07.200> II<00:04:07.349> minor<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.739> D

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.030

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.320 
so e minor d g d so the end chord
progression<00:04:21.370> does<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.670> and<00:04:21.940> then<00:04:22.210> we're

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
progression does that and then we're

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.410 
progression does that and then we're
right<00:04:22.510> back<00:04:22.690> into<00:04:26.970> now<00:04:27.970> needless<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.390> say

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
right back into now needless to say

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.210 
right back into now needless to say
again<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.900> hard<00:04:29.110> part<00:04:29.380> about<00:04:29.440> this<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:29.860> trying

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
again the hard part about this is trying

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.490 
again the hard part about this is trying
to<00:04:30.430> get<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:31.210> movements<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.900> happen<00:04:32.290> while

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
to get the movements to happen while

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.680 
to get the movements to happen while
you're<00:04:32.740> strumming<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:34.150> most<00:04:34.330> important

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you're strumming and the most important

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.900 
you're strumming and the most important
thing<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.900> remember<00:04:34.930> at<00:04:35.380> all<00:04:35.410> times<00:04:35.890> if<00:04:36.190> you

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
thing to remember at all times if you

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.490 
thing to remember at all times if you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
can think of it this way always think of

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.830 
can think of it this way always think of
your<00:04:38.620> right<00:04:38.800> hand<00:04:39.040> as<00:04:39.160> being<00:04:39.400> in<00:04:39.550> charge<00:04:39.840> you
