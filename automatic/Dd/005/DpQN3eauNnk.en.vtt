00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:37.700
 we're going to need pepper we're also going 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.340
 to need oil that you have 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.850
 at home we are going to need a chile 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.770
 guajillo hence the name comes 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.300
 of the fish fillet with garlic 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 will go in a preparation 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.140
 with chile guajillo and that's why attiyah 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.510
 let say 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.000
 and also played badly let's start 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.060
 we begin to sound our steak 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.090
 let's just put salt 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.670
 and we are going to put enough pepper 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.789
 pepper remember that pepper what 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.909
 All it does is enhance the flavor we 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.909
 to turn around and let's do the same 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.270
 Salt 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.220
 and on the other hand also good we're going to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.410
 leave this here we reserve it 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.530
 and we are also going to start preparing 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.370
 our eyes we have to chop what 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.730
 finest possible 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.970
 the three will keep with the finite that 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.040
 it can 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.500
 I will apply it right now 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.040
 I wanted to tell you and we are also going to 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.780
 our guajillo chile we are going to cut 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.780
 in strips too 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.180
 and applied our garlic and our chile 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.300
 guajillo cut into strips let's put 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.230
 in a pan or small pot 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.230
 oil 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.530
 and we are going to incorporate 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.749
 our garlic let's put it on low heat 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.560
 because if we can not be burned very 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:22.560
 quick garlic and that would embitter our 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.890
 here the only thing we have to do 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.200
 mix stir that they release their smell their 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.320
 aroma that release their color in this case 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.710
 the chile guajillo if you get stung 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.970
 begins to turn a more red color 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.400
 own of the same chile 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.760
 if you could not read well 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.709
 imagine not very rich 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.049
 and this is how we are going to find out 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.370
 when it is ready, this is all 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.950
 really what he does in our 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.769
 curb preparation when it is already 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.189
 ready is when our guajillo chile 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:02.209
 change a little color to all this is a 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.209
 low fire 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.680
 after two or three minutes 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.799
 approximately our guajillo chile 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.280
 already takes a golden texture is already a 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.730
 little more firm then it 's time to 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.040
 to turn off 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.890
 and book we go to the next 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.760
 casserole let's put our steaks 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.190
 that we already have 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.900
 previously reasoned we added a 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.630
 little bit of oil so we do not miss 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.190
 stick 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.680
 all this if you want to do it 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.230
 with olive oil 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.420
 ideals I do not have at the moment 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.300
 sunflower oil and that's what I'm 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.220
 use 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.820
 remember that we already had our 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.820
 steaks 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.230
 people 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.670
 we are going to put nothing else there that is 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.840
 incorporate a little more foundation because 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.840
 I like you to know 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.390
 our fish is ready 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.960
 now we 're going to serve, I'm going to tell you 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.420
 how it served we have a rice bed 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.170
 a rice base as you prefer 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:15.350
 call over let's put some leaves 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.700
 of lettuce that you have does not matter 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.680
 then let's put 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.340
 some curlers 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.710
 of that hour all this is to give 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.129
 colour 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:35.050
 let's also put some onion 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.740
 purple onion is ideal for 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.740
 fish 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.690

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.690
 already gone already ready 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.450

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.450
 from our bed 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:10.349
 finally dead prepared 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.349
 4 we wanted the top previously 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.100
 this will also serve as a 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.970
 kind of vinaigrette for our 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:28.130
 salad they 're going to go down and it's going to fall 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:31.130

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.130

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.440
 very nutritious very healthy 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.020
