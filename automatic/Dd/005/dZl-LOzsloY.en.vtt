00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
which is something that I've never seen

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.180 
which is something that I've never seen
on<00:00:36.570> any<00:00:36.780> other<00:00:37.020> phone<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.770> very<00:00:37.950> nice<00:00:38.129> to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
on any other phone so it's very nice to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.459 
on any other phone so it's very nice to
have<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.149> phone<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.170> me<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
have that on this phone but for me it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.170 
have that on this phone but for me it
really<00:00:40.559> doesn't<00:00:41.100> work<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:41.460> because<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
really doesn't work as well because it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.510 
really doesn't work as well because it
seems<00:00:42.390> laggy<00:00:42.750> while<00:00:43.200> recording<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> just

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
seems laggy while recording so I just

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.540 
seems laggy while recording so I just
decided<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.570> 4k<00:00:46.050> Ultra<00:00:46.469> HD<00:00:46.530> video<00:00:47.160> still

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
decided to use 4k Ultra HD video still

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
decided to use 4k Ultra HD video still
comes<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:47.969> beautiful<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.370> smooth

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
comes out very beautiful and very smooth

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.090 
comes out very beautiful and very smooth
but<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.510> still<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.899> HD<00:00:52.350> 1080p

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
but with that you still have HD 1080p

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
but with that you still have HD 1080p
720p<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.020> way<00:00:55.199> down<00:00:55.320> to

another<00:01:08.280> thing<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> also<00:01:08.909> found

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
another thing that I also found

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
another thing that I also found
interesting<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> video<00:01:10.409> settings<00:01:10.830> with

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
interesting in the video settings with

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
interesting in the video settings with
that<00:01:11.100> you're<00:01:11.310> able<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.970> choose<00:01:12.240> between<00:01:12.450> your

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
video codecs and your audio codecs now

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200 
video codecs and your audio codecs now
the<00:01:15.900> average<00:01:16.439> consumer<00:01:16.560> may<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.909> use

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the average consumer may not really use

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.820 
the average consumer may not really use
these<00:01:18.450> features<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.229> being<00:01:19.530> able<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
these features but I like being able to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.120 
these features but I like being able to
choose<00:01:20.070> between<00:01:20.280> H<00:01:20.729> point<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.270> 64<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.130> mpeg-4

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
choose between H point to 64 and mpeg-4

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
choose between H point to 64 and mpeg-4
video<00:01:23.670> because<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.869> size<00:01:25.080> difference

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
video because of the size difference

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
video because of the size difference
that<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.330> another<00:01:27.330> thing<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that they have another thing that I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
that they have another thing that I
found<00:01:27.930> interesting<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> camera<00:01:29.130> app<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
found interesting in the camera app that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.980 
found interesting in the camera app that
you<00:01:29.700> can't<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> live<00:01:30.479> view<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.900> your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you can't have a live view of your

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
you can't have a live view of your
built-in<00:01:31.470> filters<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.820> already

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
built-in filters so you could already

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.550 
built-in filters so you could already
know<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.479> your<00:01:33.659> pictures<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> look

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
know what your pictures going to look

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.440 
know what your pictures going to look
like<00:01:34.740> before<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.280> even<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.000> which<00:01:36.329> i

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
like before you even take it which i

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.240 
like before you even take it which i
think<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> very<00:01:36.840> good<00:01:37.110> thing<00:01:37.290> especially<00:01:37.619> if

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
think is a very good thing especially if

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
think is a very good thing especially if
you<00:01:38.430> use<00:01:38.460> Instagram<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:40.079> with<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.350> these

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you use Instagram now with all these

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.770
