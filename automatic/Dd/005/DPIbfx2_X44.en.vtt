00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:05.030
 About 4,000 MEPENGERS in Bremen at the bridge in Osnabrück are as loud as they are 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.030
 the approximately 7000 fans of the hosts 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.959
 I think that looks different Metten with the blue shirts played first 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.719
 were left to right 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.589
 Varel is that 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.089
 one of the strongest among the guests 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.089
 this one here today 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.819
 the first counter 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.149
 he had to forego the support of the pound he has today 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.420
 Birthday Wuttke to see 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.150
 Uli Sude Osnabrück coach also knew the clothes Hasler waive 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
 Ivo Rüthemann table injured »on the other side 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.260
 off the screen is not clarified where the big shows Wilfried Klaus 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 just do not continue 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.240
 Betting a lot more biting 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.330
 the initial phase, however, on both sides of this kind district championship 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.340
 many duels and in between also many ball losses 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.090
 and some players sometimes over-motivated us offenders example 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.510
 Referee Kircher and Hesse 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.680
 with big plans for today it has to be like that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 a good six percent 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.780
 more straightforward the guests Schulte he is an employee of approx 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.840
 Bernd Schaudinnus, however 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.930
 So here's the envelope 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 the release on the square 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.230
 the Meppen conductor 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.230
 that improves Bob Dylan and gave everything 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.200
 Bundesliga police needs distinctive beds became increasingly stronger Osnabrück 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.130
 a bit restless 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.360
 that is probably etc 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.820
 former top-league religious lose on average waiting for their 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.489
 Daughters waited 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.999
 straight 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.999
 comes too late 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.199
 the love affair is emphasized 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.199
 FIFA promised we want 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:29.949
 for a break 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.659
 0 for the guests of the footballing year Osnabrücker dared in the air 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.739
 lies 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.959
 After the break, the home team came as expected increased 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.149
 the cheapest is that 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:47.589
 not quite warm yet he may apologize for this 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.589
 money 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.429
 the referee continues to fight for clarity and good humor three greens 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.689
 shut down 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.689
 Free kick was left 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.439
 Liberty Globals SV Meppen 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.409
 just one was clear 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.869
 again the mail goes off 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.869
 this time it is the former Osnabrücker never 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 68 to create 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.639
 Osnabrück fought his courage somewhat forcibly and he still believes one of the 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.559
 best 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:39.809
 not so 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.979
 Waltz is wrong in the morning 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.979
 for the contest 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.019
 Madaíl who used to get used to it 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.019
 then also a risk 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.839
 while the guests feel the ball nice 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.509
 the match decided and so she would have Saarbrücken that is still 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.490
 further down 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.789
 Müller yesterday 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.789
 with a 2 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.759
 but the Osnabrück director is far from here 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.949
 a nice goal though big brother at the highly deserved victory of HSV 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.430
 at VfL Osnabrück 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.860
 without ideas and clock 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.789
 and especially the picture book and then 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.789
 make a final 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.139
 it is amazing
