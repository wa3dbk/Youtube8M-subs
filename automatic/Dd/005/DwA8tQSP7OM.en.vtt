00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
them very finely but because we have a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.920 
them very finely but because we have a
copy<00:01:19.160> each<00:01:19.370> of<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.730> almonds<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.240> cashews<00:01:20.720> it

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
together so this very simple recipe you

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.500 
together so this very simple recipe you
can<00:02:56.950> make<00:02:57.249> all<00:02:57.489> your<00:02:57.639> only<00:02:57.790> appliance<00:02:58.329> is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
can make all your only appliance is

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.780 
can make all your only appliance is
going<00:02:58.659> to<00:02:58.719> be<00:02:58.810> your<00:02:58.930> food<00:02:59.139> processor<00:02:59.379> and<00:03:00.280> if

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
going to be your food processor and if

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.309 
going to be your food processor and if
you<00:03:00.879> don't<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.359> a<00:03:01.389> food<00:03:01.569> processor<00:03:01.629> you<00:03:02.260> can

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
you don't have a food processor you can

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.250 
you don't have a food processor you can
use<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:02.829> coffee<00:03:03.189> grinder<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:05.079> I<00:03:05.200> said

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
use a coffee grinder but like I said

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.539 
use a coffee grinder but like I said
you'd<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.769> do<00:03:05.859> it<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.069> several<00:03:06.280> batches

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
you'd have to do it in several batches

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.800 
you'd have to do it in several batches
to<00:03:07.319> grind<00:03:08.319> up<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:09.250> nuts<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.480> goes<00:03:10.659> very

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
to grind up the the nuts so it goes very

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:18.360 
to grind up the the nuts so it goes very
quickly<00:03:10.930> in<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.799> multiprocessor<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:18.040> as<00:03:18.159> I'm

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
quickly in a multiprocessor and as I'm

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.580 
quickly in a multiprocessor and as I'm
mixing<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.299> can<00:03:19.480> really<00:03:19.870> smell<00:03:20.109> that

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
mixing this I can really smell that

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.280 
mixing this I can really smell that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
makes about 20 macaroons that is if you

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.479 
makes about 20 macaroons that is if you
don't<00:03:32.139> eat<00:03:32.230> most<00:03:32.439> of<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.739> dough<00:03:32.889> first<00:03:33.159> which

don't eat most of the dough first which

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.250 
don't eat most of the dough first which
is<00:03:33.669> very<00:03:34.389> hard<00:03:34.540> not<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:34.930> do<00:03:36.840> okay<00:03:37.840> once<00:03:38.079> it's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
is very hard not to do okay once it's

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.640 
is very hard not to do okay once it's
fairly<00:03:38.469> well<00:03:38.739> mixed<00:03:39.930> which<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.079> can<00:03:41.260> tell<00:03:41.469> it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
fairly well mixed which you can tell it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.780 
fairly well mixed which you can tell it
looks<00:03:41.799> like<00:03:41.980> your<00:03:42.129> standard<00:03:42.370> cookie<00:03:42.819> dough

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790

without all the bad stuff and we're

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.099 
without all the bad stuff and we're
going<00:03:50.169> to<00:03:50.349> add<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:51.489> our<00:03:51.759> left<00:03:52.569> leg<00:03:52.689> sheet

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
going to add it to our left leg sheet

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.189 
going to add it to our left leg sheet
here<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.479> tough<00:03:55.659> luck<00:03:55.840> street<00:03:56.049> on

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
here so I have the tough luck street on

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.949 
here so I have the tough luck street on
top<00:03:56.409> of<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.769> mesh<00:03:56.979> screen<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.729> the<00:03:58.689> reason

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
top of the mesh screen and the reason

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.149 
top of the mesh screen and the reason
we're<00:03:59.109> doing<00:03:59.229> that<00:03:59.379> is<00:03:59.620> because<00:03:59.769> there's<00:04:00.099> a

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
we're doing that is because there's a

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.409 
we're doing that is because there's a
lot<00:04:00.189> of<00:04:00.310> moisture<00:04:00.489> in<00:04:00.729> here<00:04:00.819> with<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.120> coconut

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
oil and maple syrup and we don't want to

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.110 
oil and maple syrup and we don't want to
lose<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.239> because<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.840> really<00:04:05.970> tastes<00:04:06.970> best

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
lose that because it really tastes best

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.939 
lose that because it really tastes best
very<00:04:07.389> moist<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:08.259> we're<00:04:08.379> going<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.560> keep<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.799> on

to<00:04:34.210> take<00:04:34.389> out<00:04:34.570> one<00:04:35.520> one<00:04:36.520> shelf<00:04:36.849> there<00:04:37.060> so<00:04:37.330> they

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
to take out one one shelf there so they

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.560 
to take out one one shelf there so they
fit<00:04:37.719> and<00:04:38.440> we're<00:04:38.560> going<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.740> turn<00:04:39.729> it<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:40.000> 112

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
fit and we're going to turn it to 112

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.330
