about<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.590> way<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.700> lights

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
about that on the way as the lights

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.940 
about that on the way as the lights
build<00:01:27.240> works<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.990> speeds<00:01:28.350> through<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
build works is it speeds through it and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.850 
build works is it speeds through it and
it<00:01:29.790> ends<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.150> setting<00:01:30.570> usually<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> continuous

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it ends up setting usually a continuous

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
it ends up setting usually a continuous
spell<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> continuous<00:01:33.360> trap<00:01:33.540> sorry<00:01:33.810> and

of<00:06:17.710> sub<00:06:17.890> whore<00:06:18.070> but<00:06:18.220> you<00:06:18.310> still<00:06:18.520> might<00:06:18.670> have

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
of sub whore but you still might have

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.580 
of sub whore but you still might have
that<00:06:19.000> malefic<00:06:19.510> gates<00:06:19.750> play<00:06:20.020> and<00:06:20.230> you<00:06:20.290> do<00:06:20.440> want

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
that Eradicator in your hand so I guess

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.570
