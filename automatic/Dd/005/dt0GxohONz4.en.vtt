somewhere<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> swear<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:14.550> once<00:02:14.820> wearables

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
somewhere I swear this once wearables

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
somewhere I swear this once wearables
maybe<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.470> them<00:02:16.680> swivel<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.430> don't

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
maybe not all of them swivel I don't

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.440 
maybe not all of them swivel I don't
know<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:21.080> don't<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.260> anyway<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:23.280> mean<00:02:23.730> they

how<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.049> explain<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.769> does<00:03:47.010> fingerprint<00:03:47.580> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
how to explain it it does fingerprint a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.789 
how to explain it it does fingerprint a
little<00:03:47.880> bit<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.239> that's<00:03:49.140> what<00:03:49.320> I'm<00:03:49.380> downside

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
little bit and that's what I'm downside

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.380 
little bit and that's what I'm downside
I<00:03:49.830> don't<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.790> don't<00:03:51.090> want<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.269> get

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
I don't like so you don't want to get

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.789 
I don't like so you don't want to get
your<00:03:51.480> fingerprints<00:03:51.900> all<00:03:52.110> over<00:03:52.200> here<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.650> once

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
your fingerprints all over here but once

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.520 
your fingerprints all over here but once
you<00:03:52.860> wipe<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.549> quite<00:03:53.820> beautiful<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.530> as

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
you wipe it it is quite beautiful and as

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.030 
you wipe it it is quite beautiful and as
you<00:03:56.160> can<00:03:56.340> see<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.610> mean<00:03:57.060> there's<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:58.040> this

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
you can see I mean there's just the this

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.310 
you can see I mean there's just the this
Mary<00:03:59.430> kind<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.030> feel<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.750> then<00:04:01.140> there's

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
Mary kind of feel to it and then there's

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.080 
Mary kind of feel to it and then there's
the<00:04:01.500> design<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.459> don't<00:04:02.760> know<00:04:02.850> if<00:04:02.970> it's

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the design that I don't know if it's

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.640 
the design that I don't know if it's
laser<00:04:03.360> etched<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.870> kind<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.080> feels<00:04:04.230> like<00:04:04.440> it

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
laser etched it kind of feels like it

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.140 
laser etched it kind of feels like it
but<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.830> don't<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.400> since<00:04:05.610> it's<00:04:05.790> classic

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
but I don't think so since it's classic

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.780 
but I don't think so since it's classic
it's<00:04:06.269> probably<00:04:06.510> painted<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.019> but<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.830> I<00:04:08.310> mean<00:04:08.670> it

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
it's probably painted on but I I mean it

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.640 
it's probably painted on but I I mean it
looks<00:04:08.970> pretty<00:04:09.330> cool<00:04:09.540> as<00:04:09.780> air<00:04:10.170> pollution

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
looks pretty cool as air pollution

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.000 
looks pretty cool as air pollution
written<00:04:10.950> along<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.370> sides<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:13.680> does

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
written along the sides and this does

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.680 
written along the sides and this does
kind<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.820> Bend

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
kind of Bend

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.170 
kind of Bend
think<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:17.130> know<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> really<00:04:17.790> don't<00:04:17.820> know<00:04:18.030> how

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
think you know I really don't know how

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.390 
think you know I really don't know how
to<00:04:18.209> fully<00:04:18.450> compact<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.230> that<00:04:19.890> based<00:04:20.130> arm

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
to fully compact this that based arm

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.310 
to fully compact this that based arm
yeah<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.970> probably<00:04:21.150> folds<00:04:21.660> all<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> way<00:04:22.049> and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
yeah that probably folds all the way and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.840 
yeah that probably folds all the way and
then<00:04:22.440> something<00:04:22.710> cool<00:04:23.010> happens<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.580> don't<00:04:23.760> know

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
then something cool happens I don't know

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.230 
then something cool happens I don't know
based<00:04:24.510> on<00:04:24.750> compactness<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.770> sound<00:04:26.610> quality<00:04:26.820> I

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
based on compactness and sound quality I

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.510 
based on compactness and sound quality I
was<00:04:27.690> extremely<00:04:28.230> impressed<00:04:28.590> i<00:04:29.100> know<00:04:29.160> uncle

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
but they're very easy bending so they

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.640 
but they're very easy bending so they
won't<00:05:21.240> fall<00:05:21.450> off<00:05:21.510> but<00:05:22.020> they<00:05:22.140> won't<00:05:22.320> squeeze

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.659 
the crap out of your head I like him a
lot<00:05:25.169> I<00:05:25.470> mean<00:05:25.680> they<00:05:25.800> sound<00:05:26.040> really<00:05:26.130> good<00:05:26.490> the

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
lot I mean they sound really good the

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.700 
lot I mean they sound really good the
base<00:05:26.850> is<00:05:27.060> pump<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.600> I'll<00:05:27.690> tell<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.930> there's<00:05:28.620> a

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
base is pump and I'll tell you there's a

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.010 
base is pump and I'll tell you there's a
lot<00:05:29.040> of<00:05:29.070> bass<00:05:29.340> in<00:05:29.610> them<00:05:29.730> but<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.390> doesn't<00:05:30.780> wash

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
lot of bass in them but it doesn't wash

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.830 
lot of bass in them but it doesn't wash
out<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.350> mids<00:05:31.800> in<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.070> trouble<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.840> of

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
out the mids in the trouble and of

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.110 
out the mids in the trouble and of
course<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.500> responds<00:05:35.100> to<00:05:35.220> equalizers<00:05:35.820> quite

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
course it responds to equalizers quite

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.880 
course it responds to equalizers quite
well<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:36.360> if<00:05:36.690> you're<00:05:36.840> using<00:05:37.050> bass<00:05:37.380> boost<00:05:37.650> or<00:05:37.860> a

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
well so if you're using bass boost or a

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.820 
well so if you're using bass boost or a
base<00:05:38.100> resistor<00:05:38.669> it<00:05:38.880> will<00:05:39.090> work<00:05:39.330> on<00:05:39.600> your

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
base resistor it will work on your

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.409 
base resistor it will work on your
iPhone<00:05:40.830> or<00:05:40.860> iPod<00:05:41.220> I<00:05:41.400> mean<00:05:41.610> there<00:05:41.730> are<00:05:41.820> decent<00:05:42.000> I
