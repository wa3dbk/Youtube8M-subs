Z target and then go ahead and do the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.270 
Z target and then go ahead and do the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
same thing and there we go we can go

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.740

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
ahead and hit it once more and I think

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.600 
ahead and hit it once more and I think
actually<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.050> does<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.800> don't<00:03:01.340> think<00:03:01.520> this

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
actually that does it I don't think this

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.790 
actually that does it I don't think this
boss<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.150> necessarily<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.840> long<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.410> go

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
boss is necessarily that long so go

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.050 
boss is necessarily that long so go
ahead<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:03.950> finish<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.520> there<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> go<00:03:04.910> it

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
ahead and finish it there you go it

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.940

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
weakness and yes the eye itself gives

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.650 
weakness and yes the eye itself gives
you<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> card<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:26.000> know<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.300> there's<00:03:26.570> a
