00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:08.380
 good morning everyone I am talking to you today 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.250
 new shades of wight with which is why 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.170
 he didn't know her is a company like tico 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.180
 we say with the same prices maybe a 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.210
 some price a little higher some 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.910
 cheaper price however we are there 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.650
 that sells online that is opening 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.240
 in many outlets throughout 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.869
 italy i bought these tints lips 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.240
 repurchased type 2 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.800
 then later they returned and bought them at 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.680
 35 then they are bought at 34 type because 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.200
 I am 30 with whom I am very well and 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.440
 they would be the liquid lipstick of the line 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.690
 make up artist who is a line of 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.380
 limited edition that made trouble with 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.600
 for this October and so we say they are 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.879
 lipsticks and designed for professionals 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.920
 we say that in my opinion just for i 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.300
 professionals are not meant because 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.570
 if I have to do a photo shoot 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.430
 certainly does not use a dye because 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.070
 to remove it then I dirty all the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.220
 base and therefore I prefer a lipstick that 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.170
 I can easily remove myself 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.700
 really finding it very well and it is 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.890
 that's why I'm doing a 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.020
 specific video on gold you know that 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.619
 I hardly make a single-brand video 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.540
 because I don't think it's useful but this 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.400
 time I decided to do it first 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.290
 because I bought several colors in 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.080
 all I have a dozen so I want 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.840
 let you see the colors well and then 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.540
 because I want to open a parenthesis le 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.070
 dyed lips only people are not lips 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.570
 lipsticks 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.640
 I have read many people who have 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.520
 you find it bad because they are dry, dry 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.430
 the lips are like that they must mark in 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.530
 lips have a dull effect not you 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.610
 then they move and dry the lips 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.619
 all the colors from kiko max do not go I know 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 my favorite color that is the thousand 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.030
 kisses no 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.340
 but this one also does the same 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 identical effect only that this can 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.180
 18 euros is this here a lipstick costs 6 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.310
 therefore euro and 90 are therefore equal 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.000
 I will recommend these colors for whom 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.760
 it supports the matting effect that dries 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 however a little lips and above all 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.070
 for those with asymmetrical lips if 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.070
 use shiny lipsticks and go to 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.130
 bleeding the lips so he gave out 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.440
 even half a centimeter of lips yes 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.209
 see you see the natural border of the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.360
 your lip 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.000
 I have this much lower side here 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.340
 compared to this side here and I assure you 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.670
 that you notice a lot if they put a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.100
 soft lipstick of the brighter ones 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.709
 and therefore we see very well use for 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.080
 more opaque rosettes and more 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.540
 just the dyed lips so I have 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.180
 this nuba sky of the micop prever 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.150
 sky of the kiko sky of mark therefore the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.330
 I use a lot also because I 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.549
 I do a job that forces me to 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.100
 talk so many hours a day i 'm always a 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.400
 talk and I need that lipstick 1 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.820
 Slavs in more I like the nuance of 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.620
 colors because they are many dark colors and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.920
 I like it because I have 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.200
 glasses I always have to make up well 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.750
 accept the lips because otherwise the 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.530
 your attention would fall only on the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.980
 first part here of the glasses then 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.019
 on the first part and therefore not yes 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.150
 then calibrate the attention on the face 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.120
 those with glasses must always touch them 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.970
 I advise you to apply them to make them 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.500
 dry to vary slightly from 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.040
 color a in the sense that once 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.519
 dried they print and color 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.070
 it gets a little darker as the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.980
 fact that they get tired contain alcohol 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.930
 then the alcohol evaporates and remains 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.769
 dyed and that's why they dry a little 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.900
 lips 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.550
 you have that only on watts on the lips 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.740
 actually on instagram blossomed crater 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.170
 almost all lipsticks so you can 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.710
 see them even from there but more than anything else 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.190
 being of the colors they do not vary in base 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.230
 to color in the sense that it does not change the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.269
 tonight I will show you it anyway 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.269
 swatch on both hand and lips 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.159
 chance 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.090
 to do 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.119
 you 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.100
 that excess 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.370
 decided 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.689
 it is not there 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.539
 to do 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:13.149
 that we basket hope this video of 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.549
 sensible to help and I remember that before 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:17.499
 to insist on the males you must have 

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:19.899
 however in addition to well hydrated e 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.979
 betting medicine cannot first 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:23.610
 win right away 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.610
 Hello
