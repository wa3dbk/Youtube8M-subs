00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.650
 Stunt kites deliver more energy than they are against the principle is simple and now 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.309
 a first practice in ICT 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.779
 a cargo ship equipped with the Train Dragon Sky Shells has 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.779
 Half a year in trial operation, we saved about 15 percent of fuel 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.810
 currently still in the middle of the pilot phase 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.220
 So far, we have got it that the use of whether is unproblematic in the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.179
 Inflation as well as in the daily handling system 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.330
 what we had at peak times up to 15 percent fuel savings 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.290
 and that's worth it 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.340
 a 55 percent savings with the system 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 according to further information of the shipping company can the 160 square meters large 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.730
 Dragon in good wind 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.940
 even the traction force that is almost the power of an aircraft engine 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.540
 speaks model and on smaller cargo ships the system already has 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.780
 longer proven now should be further tested in practice and the dragon 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.830
 get fit for commercial use when a light new 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.000
 technologies 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 from the development of the developmental stage 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.060
 Of course, things do not always go smoothly 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.040
 it does not work right away 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 one of those things for example 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.720
 that our system from Aachen promised that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.970
 was dimensioned 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.800
 so that the kite gets it due to the slightly higher load 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.950
 Percent burst it was very spectacular and we had to go to the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.680
 dragon 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.810
 So the other day you have some more strength in Durban in the fabric 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.470
 last brought Sky itself great interest from the industry 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.830
 Next year you want to equip 35 shots 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 Half of the production capacity is already booked 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.600
 however, the potential for global deployment is far greater 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.410
 In the people which of Shipping are listed over one hundred thousand ships 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.410
 in this register are all commercially used ships in the world 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.760
 recorded 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.100
 FCA effect is suitable for about sixty thousand of these sends 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.880
 Thousands Alsdorfer use many for a long time
