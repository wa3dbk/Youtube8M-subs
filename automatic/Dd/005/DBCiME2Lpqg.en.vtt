00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
feel like you did well yeah I think so I

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.859 
feel like you did well yeah I think so I
could<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:16.890> shot<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.130> little<00:00:17.279> better<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.910> and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
could have shot a little better but and

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.960 
could have shot a little better but and
all<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> full<00:00:19.230> court<00:00:19.470> staff<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:20.010> not<00:00:20.520> competed

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
all the full court staff I not competed

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
all the full court staff I not competed
really<00:00:21.150> hard<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.800> made<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> lot<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> good<00:00:23.100> play

apart I think my versatility now i'm a

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.869 
apart I think my versatility now i'm a
bigger<00:02:21.200> guard<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:22.069> lot<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.370> times<00:02:22.549> i'm<00:02:22.700> hard

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
bigger guard and a lot of times i'm hard

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.360 
bigger guard and a lot of times i'm hard
to<00:02:22.940> match<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.299> with<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.830> also<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.099> team

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
to match up with so and also a team

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.970 
to match up with so and also a team
could<00:02:25.810> carry<00:02:26.810> me<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.319> could<00:02:27.470> play<00:02:27.620> three

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
could carry me and I could play three

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.979 
could carry me and I could play three
different<00:02:28.250> positions<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.180> might<00:02:29.780> allow

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
different positions and I might allow

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.300 
different positions and I might allow
them<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.319> carry<00:02:30.560> another<00:02:30.709> big<00:02:30.950> guy<00:02:31.099> on<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
them to carry another big guy on the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.479 
them to carry another big guy on the
roster<00:02:31.430> or<00:02:31.970> on<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> rope<00:02:32.989> on<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.709> road<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.280> I

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
roster or on the rope on the road so I

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.390 
roster or on the rope on the road so I
think<00:02:34.730> definitely<00:02:35.540> my<00:02:35.810> versatility<00:02:36.400> family

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
think definitely my versatility family

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160 
think definitely my versatility family
they<00:02:37.549> had<00:02:37.700> they<00:02:37.790> feel<00:02:38.000> good<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.750> played<00:02:38.989> some

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
they had they feel good you played some

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.350 
they had they feel good you played some
point<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.860> davis<00:02:41.590> whether<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.739> make

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.270 

I<00:02:46.360> think<00:02:47.170> teams<00:02:47.349> know<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.770> can<00:02:47.950> play<00:02:48.099> point

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
I think teams know that I can play point

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.220 
I think teams know that I can play point
guard<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.790> did<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.090> every<00:02:49.660> possession<00:02:49.930> for

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
guard and I did it every possession for

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.220 
guard and I did it every possession for
four<00:02:50.440> years<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.709> Davis<00:02:51.099> so<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:52.390> think<00:02:52.930> what

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
four years of Davis so I think what

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.350 
four years of Davis so I think what
teams<00:02:53.470> what<00:02:54.220> they've<00:02:54.400> wanted<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.849> see<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.150> if<00:02:55.270> I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
teams what they've wanted to see is if I

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.610 
teams what they've wanted to see is if I
can<00:02:55.510> guard<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.810> point<00:02:56.020> guard<00:02:56.110> they<00:02:56.290> know<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.440> can

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
can guard a point guard they know I can

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620 
can guard a point guard they know I can
play<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:56.950> offense<00:02:57.400> but<00:02:57.640> they<00:02:58.239> want<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.510> see

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
play one on offense but they want to see

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.479 
play one on offense but they want to see
if<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.810> could<00:02:58.870> guard<00:02:59.170> one<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.890> couple<00:03:00.250> of<00:03:00.370> my

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
if I could guard one so a couple of my

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.120 
if I could guard one so a couple of my
workouts<00:03:00.880> I've<00:03:01.090> got<00:03:02.080> matched<00:03:02.290> up<00:03:02.500> with<00:03:02.739> you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130

know<00:03:03.220> smaller<00:03:03.550> quicker<00:03:03.819> point<00:03:04.180> guards<00:03:04.599> and<00:03:04.780> I

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
know smaller quicker point guards and I

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.220 
know smaller quicker point guards and I
think<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.680> did<00:03:05.830> really<00:03:05.860> well<00:03:06.099> so<00:03:06.780> we'll<00:03:07.780> see<00:03:07.989> but

more<00:06:14.140> just<00:06:14.380> because<00:06:14.500> I've<00:06:15.310> had<00:06:15.370> smaller<00:06:15.730> guys

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
more just because I've had smaller guys

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.820 
more just because I've had smaller guys
on<00:06:16.180> me<00:06:16.360> and<00:06:16.570> you<00:06:16.960> know<00:06:17.050> that's<00:06:17.230> my<00:06:17.410> advantage

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
on me and you know that's my advantage

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.770 
on me and you know that's my advantage
so<00:06:18.040> I<00:06:18.250> also<00:06:18.910> I<00:06:19.060> didn't<00:06:19.270> do<00:06:19.330> that<00:06:19.450> a<00:06:19.510> ton<00:06:19.750> of

so I also I didn't do that a ton of
Davis<00:06:20.170> too<00:06:27.180> i<00:06:28.180> think<00:06:28.840> yes<00:06:29.170> and<00:06:29.350> no<00:06:29.440> you<00:06:30.430> know<00:06:30.520> I

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
but i don't think that limits me I think

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.690 
but i don't think that limits me I think
if<00:06:38.530> somebody<00:06:38.830> asked<00:06:39.010> me<00:06:39.070> to<00:06:39.220> do<00:06:39.310> something<00:06:39.520> I

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
if somebody asked me to do something I

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.870 
if somebody asked me to do something I
can<00:06:39.850> do<00:06:39.970> it<00:06:40.090> no<00:06:40.420> question
