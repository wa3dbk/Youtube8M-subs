00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
on its own which is a very useful

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.360 
on its own which is a very useful
feature<00:00:48.829> for<00:00:48.949> this<00:00:49.309> race<00:00:50.739> now<00:00:51.739> as<00:00:52.010> your<00:00:52.190> city

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
is upgrading you may notice that it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.090 
is upgrading you may notice that it
takes<00:00:54.470> a<00:00:55.159> fairly<00:00:55.790> long<00:00:55.940> time<00:00:56.230> but<00:00:57.230> this<00:00:57.890> is

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
takes a fairly long time but this is

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.520 
takes a fairly long time but this is
sort<00:00:58.730> of<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:58.970> balanced<00:00:59.360> feature<00:00:59.600> because<00:01:00.170> other

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
sort of a balanced feature because other

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.799 
sort of a balanced feature because other
races<00:01:01.070> have<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.850> pay<00:01:02.089> for<00:01:02.149> their<00:01:02.449> upgrades

while yours is free although it is

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.840 
while yours is free although it is
slower<00:01:05.920> once<00:01:06.920> your<00:01:07.130> city<00:01:07.430> has<00:01:07.580> finished
