screwed<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.399> hard<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:50.820> we're<00:01:51.119> dumb<00:01:51.509> so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
screwed up so hard because we're dumb so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.510

we<00:01:52.229> plan<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:52.619> Josh<00:01:52.920> go<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.310> top<00:01:53.490> lane

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we plan to take Josh go for top lane

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
we plan to take Josh go for top lane
because<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> N<00:01:54.180> plays<00:01:54.420> yeah<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> yeah<00:01:55.619> so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
because the N plays yeah so and yeah so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
before so we let them have Yasuo

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.369 
before so we let them have Yasuo
because<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.510> didn't<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:12.840> they<00:02:13.050> would<00:02:13.200> pick

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
because we didn't think they would pick

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.790 
because we didn't think they would pick
it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
challenger but it'd have to be like

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.949 
challenger but it'd have to be like
really<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.550> for<00:03:44.700> fine<00:03:44.880> again<00:03:45.180> because<00:03:45.600> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
it's something really important to me

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.290 
it's something really important to me
and<00:03:54.900> unless<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.070> stream<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.970> scrims

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
and unless I can stream the the scrims

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.050 
and unless I can stream the the scrims
and<00:03:57.600> stuff<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.080> then<00:03:58.880> I'd<00:03:59.880> be

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
and stuff like that then I'd be

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.000 
and stuff like that then I'd be
completely<00:04:00.360> fine<00:04:00.660> with<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.870> but<00:04:01.170> most<00:04:01.770> likely

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
completely fine with it but most likely

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.830 
completely fine with it but most likely
it's<00:04:02.130> not<00:04:02.160> gonna<00:04:02.310> happen<00:04:02.489> like<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.760> see<00:04:03.630> so

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840
