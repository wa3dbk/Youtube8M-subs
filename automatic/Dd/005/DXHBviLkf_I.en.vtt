00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
these guys have a very strict regiment

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.029 
these guys have a very strict regiment
and<00:01:56.990> everything<00:01:57.320> they<00:01:57.439> do<00:01:57.500> as<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.920> can

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
and everything they do as you can

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.370 
and everything they do as you can
imagine<00:01:58.329> so<00:01:59.329> this<00:01:59.479> allows<00:01:59.630> them<00:01:59.899> to<00:02:00.020> get<00:02:00.200> their

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
imagine so this allows them to get their

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.959 
imagine so this allows them to get their
icing<00:02:00.710> recovery<00:02:01.070> treatment<00:02:01.250> in<00:02:01.520> on<00:02:01.640> their<00:02:01.880> way

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
icing recovery treatment in on their way

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.029 
icing recovery treatment in on their way
back<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.299> hotel<00:02:02.390> before<00:02:02.960> they<00:02:03.079> their<00:02:03.710> schedule

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
back to hotel before they their schedule

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.300 
back to hotel before they their schedule
goes<00:02:04.189> completely<00:02:04.579> crazy<00:02:04.850> with

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
goes completely crazy with

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.980 
goes completely crazy with
one<00:02:06.640> after<00:02:06.909> another<00:02:06.939> so<00:02:07.479> there's<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.840> huge

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
one after another so there's a huge

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.800 
one after another so there's a huge
benefit<00:02:08.410> for<00:02:08.440> these<00:02:08.649> guys<00:02:08.860> if<00:02:09.509> recovery<00:02:10.509> can

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
benefit for these guys if recovery can

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.800 
benefit for these guys if recovery can
be<00:02:10.840> efficient<00:02:11.560> or<00:02:11.709> AC<00:02:11.950> or<00:02:12.340> better<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:13.480> can<00:02:13.660> be

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
be efficient or AC or better it can be

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.760 
be efficient or AC or better it can be
both<00:02:13.989> then<00:02:14.410> less<00:02:15.099> perfect<00:02:15.400> or<00:02:15.819> scenario<00:02:16.770> after

in<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.359> given<00:03:40.600> day<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.769> we<00:03:42.519> can<00:03:42.700> improve

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
in a given day so that we can improve

in a given day so that we can improve
recovery<00:03:43.180> even<00:03:43.660> further<00:03:43.989> in<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.410> past<00:03:44.620> you

recovery even further in the past you
you<00:03:45.310> couldn't<00:03:45.609> feasibly<00:03:45.790> fill<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.450> tub<00:03:46.690> every

you couldn't feasibly fill a tub every
couple<00:03:47.980> hours<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.519> do<00:03:48.880> another<00:03:48.970> treatment

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
couple hours and do another treatment

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.759 
couple hours and do another treatment

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
resource available course now we can

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.259 
resource available course now we can
look<00:03:52.840> at<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.139> it's<00:03:53.410> not<00:03:53.620> only<00:03:53.950> as<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.340> scent

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
look at this it's not only as a scent

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.240 
look at this it's not only as a scent
oscillator<00:03:55.660> cover<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.200> also<00:03:56.319> as<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> tool<00:03:57.220> for

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
oscillator cover but also as a tool for

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.330 
oscillator cover but also as a tool for
further<00:03:57.819> research<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.480> make<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.750> even<00:03:58.870> better

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
further research to make it even better

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.400 
further research to make it even better
