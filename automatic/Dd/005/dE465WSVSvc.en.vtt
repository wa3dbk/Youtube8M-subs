after<00:01:50.310> taking<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:50.700> enemies<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> want

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
after taking these enemies out you want

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
after taking these enemies out you want
to<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.720> over<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> terminal<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to go over to the terminal like I do in

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.880 
to go over to the terminal like I do in
a<00:01:53.610> minute<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.720> instead<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> hacking<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.770> on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
a minute but instead of hacking it on

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
a minute but instead of hacking it on
the<00:01:55.979> first<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.490> want<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.969> quickly<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.360> go

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the first go you want to quickly just go

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
the first go you want to quickly just go
in<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> hack<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.430> close<00:01:59.850> back

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
in to hack it and then can close back

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.030 
in to hack it and then can close back
out<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.110> enemies<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.649> triggered

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
out of it so the enemies get triggered

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
out of it so the enemies get triggered
to<00:02:02.130> come<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> try<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> shoot<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> then

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to come to you to try to shoot you then

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
to come to you to try to shoot you then
you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.740> them<00:02:05.009> enemies

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you can take out then at them enemies

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.639 
you can take out then at them enemies
and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:05.880> hack<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.509> terminal<00:02:06.780> without

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and then hack the terminal without

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.779 
and then hack the terminal without
worrying<00:02:08.280> about

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
worrying about

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.559 
worrying about
the<00:02:08.849> enemy's<00:02:09.329> trying<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.229> kill<00:02:10.409> you<00:02:11.569> while

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
the enemy's trying to kill you while

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.479 
the enemy's trying to kill you while
you're<00:02:12.750> packing<00:02:13.109> it<00:02:13.409> and<00:02:13.500> can't<00:02:13.980> really

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
you're packing it and can't really

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.940 
you're packing it and can't really
protect<00:02:14.909> yourself<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.689> as<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.739> see

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
protect yourself so as you can see

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.979 
protect yourself so as you can see
there's<00:02:17.280> one<00:02:17.340> more<00:02:17.549> enemy<00:02:17.939> usually<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.629> here

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
there's one more enemy usually up here

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.979 
there's one more enemy usually up here
on<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.500> kind<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.099> on<00:02:20.969> the<00:02:21.510> gas<00:02:21.719> container

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
on the kind of on the gas container

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.250 
on the kind of on the gas container
stand<00:02:22.849> there's<00:02:23.849> around<00:02:24.120> seven<00:02:24.599> enemies<00:02:25.049> to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
stand there's around seven enemies to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770 
stand there's around seven enemies to
start<00:02:25.530> off<00:02:25.620> killing<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.390> before<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.540> go<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
start off killing and before you go to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.319 
start off killing and before you go to
hacker<00:02:28.109> terminal<00:02:28.799> so<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.700> seems<00:02:29.879> pretty<00:02:30.090> easy

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
hacker terminal so it seems pretty easy

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.960 
hacker terminal so it seems pretty easy
to<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:30.689> point<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.409> getting<00:02:32.310> out<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
to this point but getting out of the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.149 
to this point but getting out of the
humains<00:02:33.659> lab<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.049> what's<00:02:34.230> hard<00:02:34.439> so<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.709> go<00:02:34.920> over

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
humains lab is what's hard so I go over

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.250 
humains lab is what's hard so I go over
here<00:02:35.189> to<00:02:35.370> train<00:02:35.730> hack<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.180> terminal<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.870> then

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
here to train hack for terminal and then

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.550 
here to train hack for terminal and then
I<00:02:37.349> quickly<00:02:38.900> closed<00:02:39.900> off<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.200> straight<00:02:40.439> away

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I quickly closed off it straight away

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.780 
I quickly closed off it straight away
and<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.799> can<00:02:40.950> see<00:02:41.099> all<00:02:41.220> these<00:02:41.340> people<00:02:41.400> are

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
and you can see all these people are

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.610 
and you can see all these people are
rushing<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.209> me<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.450> try<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.689> kill<00:02:42.870> me<00:02:43.049> you

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
behind it and take out all the enemies

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.460 
behind it and take out all the enemies
that<00:02:50.730> are<00:02:50.849> going<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.030> try<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.959> come<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.349> you

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
that are going to try and come to you

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.710 
that are going to try and come to you
there<00:02:52.709> should<00:02:52.919> be<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.310> Hummer<00:02:53.909> coming<00:02:54.480> train

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
there should be a Hummer coming train

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.349 
there should be a Hummer coming train
get<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.139> that<00:02:56.099> stop<00:02:56.669> right<00:02:56.939> there<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.239> you

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
get you that stop right there and you

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.879 
get you that stop right there and you
can<00:02:57.510> take<00:02:57.659> out<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.989> enemies<00:02:58.290> from<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.709> there

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
can take out the enemies from that there

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.920 
can take out the enemies from that there
should<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.159> four<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.879> Hummer<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.269> then

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
should be four in the Hummer and then

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.559 
should be four in the Hummer and then
after<00:03:01.169> that<00:03:01.230> Hummers<00:03:01.620> came<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.329> usually

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
after that Hummers came that is usually

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.089 
after that Hummers came that is usually
when<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.019> are<00:03:04.049> safe<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.560> hack<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.919> terminal

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
when you are safe to hack the terminal

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.440 
when you are safe to hack the terminal
and<00:03:05.659> be<00:03:06.659> free<00:03:07.139> from<00:03:07.439> any<00:03:07.680> kind<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.549> guards

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and be free from any kind of guards

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.970 
and be free from any kind of guards
usually<00:03:10.079> there's<00:03:10.230> one<00:03:10.260> over<00:03:10.470> there<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:10.799> he

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
usually there's one over there but he

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.500 
usually there's one over there but he
doesn't<00:03:11.280> leave<00:03:11.370> too<00:03:11.549> much<00:03:11.700> damage<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.359> can

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
doesn't leave too much damage so you can

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.130 
doesn't leave too much damage so you can
just<00:03:12.629> have<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> terminal<00:03:13.379> with<00:03:13.949> him

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.690 

so<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:20.800> can<00:03:20.980> see<00:03:21.130> I'm<00:03:21.220> going<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.520> hyper

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
so you can see I'm going to hyper

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.980 
so you can see I'm going to hyper
terminal<00:03:21.970> now<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.450> want<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.690> go<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.840> my

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
terminal now you want to go to my

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.350 
terminal now you want to go to my
computer<00:03:23.140> external<00:03:23.920> devices<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.910> then<00:03:25.120> go<00:03:25.300> to

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
computer external devices and then go to

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.000 
computer external devices and then go to
here<00:03:25.690> where<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.200> can<00:03:26.380> see<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.680> numbers

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
here where you can see the numbers

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.590 
here where you can see the numbers
quickly<00:03:27.430> fireman<00:03:27.880> number<00:03:28.090> go<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.300> brute<00:03:28.570> force

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
quickly fireman number go to brute force

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.080 
quickly fireman number go to brute force
this<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.710> really<00:03:30.010> slow<00:03:30.280> when<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.580> was<00:03:30.730> doing<00:03:30.880> it

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
this is really slow when I was doing it

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.300 
this is really slow when I was doing it
but<00:03:31.330> I've<00:03:31.600> sped<00:03:31.960> it<00:03:32.080> up<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.710> you<00:03:32.800> just<00:03:32.860> have<00:03:33.130> to
