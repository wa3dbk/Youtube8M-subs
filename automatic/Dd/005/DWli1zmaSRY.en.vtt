00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
of that together until it looks about

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.760 
of that together until it looks about
like<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.209> then<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.510> will<00:02:34.660> add<00:02:34.810> 1/4<00:02:35.290> cup<00:02:35.410> of

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
like this and then I will add 1/4 cup of

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.770 
like this and then I will add 1/4 cup of
the<00:02:36.160> non-dairy<00:02:36.550> milk<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.060> use<00:02:37.270> rice<00:02:37.480> milk

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
the non-dairy milk so I use rice milk

the non-dairy milk so I use rice milk
and<00:02:38.500> 2<00:02:38.980> teaspoons<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.000> vanilla<00:02:40.239> extract

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.020 

and<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:45.010> will<00:02:45.160> continue<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.550> mix<00:02:45.820> all<00:02:46.000> of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
and then I will continue to mix all of

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.600 
and then I will continue to mix all of
that<00:02:46.120> together<00:02:46.390> until<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:48.070> well<00:02:48.190> combined

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
that together until it's well combined

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.860 
that together until it's well combined
then<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.920> will<00:02:51.130> get<00:02:51.490> my<00:02:51.700> dry<00:02:52.060> mixture<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.720> add

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
then I will get my dry mixture and add

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.620 
then I will get my dry mixture and add
the<00:02:53.050> wet<00:02:53.200> into<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.620> dry<00:02:54.270> wear<00:02:55.270> it<00:02:55.360> all<00:02:55.450> in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
the wet into the dry wear it all in

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.810 
the wet into the dry wear it all in
there<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:56.350> I'll<00:02:56.620> start<00:02:56.920> combining<00:02:57.430> that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
there and then I'll start combining that

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.660 
there and then I'll start combining that
together<00:02:58.680> you'll<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.770> able<00:02:59.830> to<00:03:00.010> see<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.490> you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
together you'll be able to see as you

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.250 
together you'll be able to see as you
mix<00:03:00.820> it<00:03:01.000> together<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.140> wait<00:03:02.230> until

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
mix it together I like to wait until

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.200 
mix it together I like to wait until
it's<00:03:02.590> pretty<00:03:03.250> well<00:03:03.430> mixed<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.940> then<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.090> will

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
it's pretty well mixed and then I will

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.710 
it's pretty well mixed and then I will
add<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.690> 1/2<00:03:05.020> cup<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.520> chocolate<00:03:06.520> chips<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.420> I

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
add a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips so I

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.240 
add a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips so I
then<00:03:07.990> start<00:03:08.260> mixing<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.590> together<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.160> I

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
then start mixing that together and I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.280 
then start mixing that together and I
can<00:03:09.400> usually<00:03:09.490> tell<00:03:09.760> by<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:10.120> point<00:03:10.330> if<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:11.110> need

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
can usually tell by that point if I need

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.630 
can usually tell by that point if I need
to<00:03:11.410> add<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> little<00:03:11.770> extra<00:03:11.980> rice<00:03:12.310> milk

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
to add a little extra rice milk

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.770 
to add a little extra rice milk
sometimes<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.150> need<00:03:13.300> like<00:03:13.450> an<00:03:13.540> extra

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
sometimes I need like an extra

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.490 
sometimes I need like an extra
tablespoon<00:03:14.110> or<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.070> sometimes<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.270> don't<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
tablespoon or so sometimes you don't and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.780 
tablespoon or so sometimes you don't and
then<00:03:17.590> I'll<00:03:17.710> just<00:03:17.830> keep<00:03:17.950> combining<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.490> until

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
then I'll just keep combining that until

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.430 
then I'll just keep combining that until
it's<00:03:18.940> pretty<00:03:19.060> well<00:03:19.300> mixed<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:19.960> as<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.320> can

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
it's pretty well mixed and as you can

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.440 
it's pretty well mixed and as you can
see<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.740> looks<00:03:21.280> quite<00:03:21.550> different<00:03:21.670> than<00:03:22.180> a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
see it looks quite different than a

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.660 
see it looks quite different than a
traditional<00:03:22.600> cookie<00:03:23.230> dough<00:03:23.350> but<00:03:24.040> stick<00:03:24.490> with

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
traditional cookie dough but stick with

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.430 
traditional cookie dough but stick with
it<00:03:24.820> because<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:25.570> will<00:03:25.690> taste<00:03:25.870> really<00:03:26.230> good

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
it because it will taste really good

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.530 
it because it will taste really good
just<00:03:27.100> for<00:03:27.250> living<00:03:27.460> it<00:03:27.550> onto<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.970> baking<00:03:28.120> sheet

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
just for living it onto the baking sheet

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.990 
just for living it onto the baking sheet
I<00:03:28.750> use<00:03:28.990> this<00:03:29.170> Silpat<00:03:29.620> silicone<00:03:30.280> baking<00:03:30.580> sheet

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
I use this Silpat silicone baking sheet

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.360 
I use this Silpat silicone baking sheet
to<00:03:31.420> help<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.140> cookies<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.560> stiff<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.220> then

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
to help the cookies not stiff and then

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.550 
to help the cookies not stiff and then
unlike<00:03:34.270> usual<00:03:34.600> cookie<00:03:34.990> dough<00:03:35.110> you're<00:03:35.290> fun<00:03:35.410> to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
unlike usual cookie dough you're fun to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.350 
unlike usual cookie dough you're fun to
take<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:35.980> cookie<00:03:36.340> dough<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.670> roll<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:36.970> kind

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
take this cookie dough and roll it kind

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.070 
take this cookie dough and roll it kind
of<00:03:37.420> into<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.660> ball<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.730> that's<00:03:39.780> how<00:03:40.780> they<00:03:40.930> will

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
of into a ball and that's how they will

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.670 
of into a ball and that's how they will
cook<00:03:41.320> so<00:03:41.710> they're<00:03:42.640> not<00:03:42.790> gonna<00:03:43.260> spread<00:03:44.260> out<00:03:44.320> at

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
cook so they're not gonna spread out at

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.990

all<00:03:44.800> this<00:03:45.100> probably<00:03:45.460> seems<00:03:45.610> totally

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
all this probably seems totally

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.980 
all this probably seems totally
counterintuitive<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.630> what<00:03:46.750> you've<00:03:46.900> done

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
counterintuitive to what you've done

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
going to mold them together and that's

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.550 
going to mold them together and that's
the<00:03:51.910> shape<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.120> they<00:03:52.330> will<00:03:52.480> be<00:03:52.600> in<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:53.410> can

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
the shape that they will be in you can

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.220 
the shape that they will be in you can
also<00:03:53.710> use<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.540> cookie<00:03:55.540> scooper<00:03:55.870> if<00:03:55.990> you<00:03:56.080> have
