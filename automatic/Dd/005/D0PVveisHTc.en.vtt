in<00:00:05.839> this<00:00:06.080> lesson<00:00:06.350> we'll<00:00:06.589> be<00:00:06.740> taking<00:00:07.040> a<00:00:07.160> look<00:00:07.309> at

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
in this lesson we'll be taking a look at

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.430 
in this lesson we'll be taking a look at
the<00:00:07.639> skylight<00:00:08.149> filter<00:00:08.389> available<00:00:08.809> in<00:00:09.230> color

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
the skylight filter available in color

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.430 
the skylight filter available in color
effects<00:00:09.830> Pro<00:00:10.160> for<00:00:10.580> what<00:00:11.570> this<00:00:11.719> filter<00:00:12.049> does<00:00:12.230> is

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
effects Pro for what this filter does is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.709 
effects Pro for what this filter does is
it<00:00:12.530> simulates<00:00:12.860> glass<00:00:13.339> warming<00:00:14.000> filters<00:00:14.450> and

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
it simulates glass warming filters and

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.499 
it simulates glass warming filters and
we<00:00:15.379> use<00:00:15.530> this<00:00:15.709> filter<00:00:16.129> to<00:00:16.160> remove<00:00:16.610> a<00:00:16.970> blue<00:00:17.180> cast

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:17.509 
we use this filter to remove a blue cast

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.640 
we use this filter to remove a blue cast
or<00:00:17.900> to<00:00:18.710> apply<00:00:19.270> warming<00:00:20.270> to<00:00:20.630> colors<00:00:21.050> throughout

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
or to apply warming to colors throughout

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.740 
or to apply warming to colors throughout
an<00:00:21.859> image<00:00:22.099> what's<00:00:22.789> great<00:00:23.000> about<00:00:23.029> this<00:00:23.390> filter

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
an image what's great about this filter

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.900 
an image what's great about this filter
is<00:00:23.900> that<00:00:23.930> we<00:00:24.199> can<00:00:24.349> do<00:00:24.500> it<00:00:24.619> intelligently<00:00:25.039> we

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
is that we can do it intelligently we

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.450 
is that we can do it intelligently we
can<00:00:26.090> apply<00:00:26.359> degrees<00:00:27.140> or<00:00:27.529> strengths<00:00:28.039> of<00:00:28.160> the

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
can apply degrees or strengths of the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.849 
can apply degrees or strengths of the
warming<00:00:29.000> filter<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.599> then<00:00:30.259> through<00:00:30.500> using

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
warming filter and then through using

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.499 
warming filter and then through using
control<00:00:31.220> points<00:00:31.580> we<00:00:31.699> can<00:00:31.820> control<00:00:32.269> exactly

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
control points we can control exactly

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.619 
control points we can control exactly
where<00:00:33.170> we<00:00:33.800> apply<00:00:34.160> that<00:00:34.190> warmth<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:35.480> get

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
where we apply that warmth to get

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:36.970 
where we apply that warmth to get
started<00:00:36.019> on<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.290> left<00:00:36.500> side<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:36.769> the<00:00:36.830> screen

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
started on the left side of the screen

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.009 
started on the left side of the screen
we'll<00:00:37.280> come<00:00:37.460> down<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.879> skylight<00:00:38.479> filter<00:00:38.659> and

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
we'll come down to skylight filter and

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.930 
we'll come down to skylight filter and
you'll<00:00:39.680> notice<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.040> icon<00:00:40.370> off<00:00:40.549> to<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.760> right

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
you'll notice the icon off to the right

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.969 
you'll notice the icon off to the right
indicating<00:00:41.510> there<00:00:41.690> are<00:00:41.839> some<00:00:42.049> visual<00:00:42.260> presets

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
indicating there are some visual presets

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.710 
indicating there are some visual presets
available<00:00:43.159> so<00:00:43.699> let's<00:00:43.879> take<00:00:44.119> a<00:00:44.150> look<00:00:44.420> at<00:00:44.540> those

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
available so let's take a look at those

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.250 
available so let's take a look at those
zero<00:00:45.500> one<00:00:45.769> is<00:00:45.949> subtle<00:00:46.369> that's<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.909> default

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
zero one is subtle that's the default

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.979 
zero one is subtle that's the default
zero<00:00:48.260> two<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.860> medium<00:00:49.339> and<00:00:49.489> zero<00:00:50.330> three<00:00:50.659> is

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
zero two is medium and zero three is

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.649 
zero two is medium and zero three is
strong<00:00:51.970> so<00:00:52.970> let's<00:00:53.089> come<00:00:53.210> over<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:53.510> right<00:00:53.629> side

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
strong so let's come over the right side

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.030 
strong so let's come over the right side
of<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.019> screen<00:00:54.140> we'll<00:00:54.440> take<00:00:54.589> a<00:00:54.619> look<00:00:54.860> at<00:00:54.949> the

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
of the screen we'll take a look at the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.560 
of the screen we'll take a look at the
control<00:00:55.430> we<00:00:55.610> have<00:00:55.760> available<00:00:56.000> for<00:00:56.449> this

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
control we have available for this

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.539 
control we have available for this
filter<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.080> that<00:00:57.559> control<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:57.979> strength<00:00:58.309> and

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
filter and that control is strength and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.880 
filter and that control is strength and
we<00:00:59.239> chose<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.809> strong<00:01:00.140> setting<00:01:00.680> from<00:01:00.830> the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
we chose the strong setting from the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.219 
we chose the strong setting from the
preset<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:01.610> that<00:01:01.790> defaults<00:01:02.210> at<00:01:02.330> 80%

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
preset and that defaults at 80%

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.560 
preset and that defaults at 80%
so<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.680> controls<00:01:04.100> how<00:01:04.489> much<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.150> filter

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
so this controls how much of the filter

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.050 
so this controls how much of the filter
is<00:01:05.600> applied<00:01:06.200> to<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.619> original<00:01:06.710> image<00:01:07.310> if<00:01:08.000> we

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
is applied to the original image if we

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.490 
is applied to the original image if we
move<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.630> right<00:01:08.659> we'll<00:01:08.960> increase

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
move that to the right we'll increase

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.020 
move that to the right we'll increase
the<00:01:09.710> effect<00:01:10.009> of<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.250> filter<00:01:10.579> and<00:01:10.700> if<00:01:10.789> we<00:01:10.880> move

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the effect of the filter and if we move

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.760 
the effect of the filter and if we move
it<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.179> the<00:01:11.359> left<00:01:11.509> will<00:01:11.780> decrease<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.469> effect

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
it to the left will decrease the effect

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.069 
it to the left will decrease the effect
of<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.009> filter<00:01:13.299> so<00:01:14.299> I<00:01:14.390> really<00:01:14.659> like<00:01:14.869> that

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
of the filter so I really like that

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.950 
of the filter so I really like that
right<00:01:15.409> about<00:01:15.710> right<00:01:16.399> there<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:16.700> think<00:01:16.869> 75%<00:01:17.869> is

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
right about right there I think 75% is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.020 
right about right there I think 75% is
perfect<00:01:18.409> now<00:01:19.009> we<00:01:19.039> could<00:01:19.310> easily<00:01:19.460> leave<00:01:19.850> this

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
perfect now we could easily leave this

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.789 
perfect now we could easily leave this
image<00:01:20.299> right<00:01:20.539> where<00:01:20.749> it<00:01:20.869> is<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.350> looks<00:01:21.560> like<00:01:21.679> it

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
image right where it is it looks like it

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.109 
image right where it is it looks like it
could<00:01:21.890> have<00:01:21.950> been<00:01:22.039> done<00:01:22.280> very<00:01:22.490> early<00:01:22.850> morning

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
could have been done very early morning

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.660 
could have been done very early morning
right<00:01:24.020> during<00:01:24.259> sunrise<00:01:24.499> or<00:01:24.979> very<00:01:25.249> late<00:01:25.490> in<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
right during sunrise or very late in the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.330 
right during sunrise or very late in the
evening<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.479> just<00:01:26.719> about<00:01:26.929> sunset<00:01:27.619> but<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.189> lot

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
evening it's just about sunset but a lot

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.580 
evening it's just about sunset but a lot
of<00:01:28.429> people<00:01:28.670> like<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.880> maintain<00:01:29.539> really<00:01:30.320> nice

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
of people like to maintain really nice

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.819 
of people like to maintain really nice
white<00:01:31.249> clouds<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.929> if<00:01:33.049> we<00:01:33.170> put<00:01:33.469> a<00:01:33.499> minus

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
white clouds so if we put a minus

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.889 
white clouds so if we put a minus
control<00:01:34.429> point<00:01:34.729> right<00:01:34.999> on<00:01:35.149> this<00:01:35.270> cloud<00:01:35.569> right

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
control point right on this cloud right

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.840 
control point right on this cloud right
here<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.289> whitest<00:01:36.679> one<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.280> then<00:01:37.700> that

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
here the whitest one and then that

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.130 
here the whitest one and then that
control<00:01:38.299> point<00:01:38.539> is<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.749> to<00:01:38.810> look<00:01:38.929> at<00:01:39.049> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
control point is going to look at the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.719 
control point is going to look at the
pixels<00:01:39.380> underneath<00:01:40.039> that's<00:01:40.249> gonna<00:01:40.460> look<00:01:40.579> at

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
pixels underneath that's gonna look at

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.020 
pixels underneath that's gonna look at
the<00:01:40.850> hue<00:01:41.119> saturation<00:01:41.390> color<00:01:42.700> contrast<00:01:43.700> and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
the hue saturation color contrast and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.969 
the hue saturation color contrast and
texture<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.689> it'll<00:01:44.960> apply<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.289> effect<00:01:45.799> of

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
texture and it'll apply the effect of

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.249 
texture and it'll apply the effect of
that<00:01:46.280> control<00:01:46.670> point<00:01:46.999> to<00:01:47.719> anything<00:01:48.049> within

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
that control point to anything within

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.349 
that control point to anything within
the<00:01:48.469> area<00:01:48.889> of<00:01:48.950> influence<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:49.789> if<00:01:49.969> we<00:01:50.060> increase

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
the area of influence so if we increase

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.179 
the area of influence so if we increase
the<00:01:50.539> area<00:01:50.569> of<00:01:51.049> influence<00:01:51.469> so<00:01:51.859> it<00:01:51.979> covers

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
the area of influence so it covers

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.330 
the area of influence so it covers
anything<00:01:53.149> that's<00:01:53.299> white<00:01:53.649> we'll<00:01:54.649> retain<00:01:54.859> that

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
anything that's white we'll retain that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.529 
anything that's white we'll retain that
nice<00:01:55.549> white<00:01:55.999> clean<00:01:56.679> feel<00:01:57.789> just<00:01:58.789> great

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
nice white clean feel just great

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.629 
nice white clean feel just great
you<00:02:00.139> might<00:02:00.350> want<00:02:00.499> to<00:02:00.560> drop<00:02:00.740> one<00:02:01.039> over<00:02:01.310> here<00:02:01.549> in

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
you might want to drop one over here in

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.399 
you might want to drop one over here in
the<00:02:01.729> sky<00:02:01.999> because<00:02:02.389> there's<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.749> little<00:02:03.200> bit<00:02:03.319> of

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
the sky because there's a little bit of

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.949 
the sky because there's a little bit of
warmth<00:02:03.679> going<00:02:03.979> on<00:02:04.130> there<00:02:04.609> and<00:02:05.509> we<00:02:05.659> can<00:02:05.810> make<00:02:05.929> a

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
warmth going on there and we can make a

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.690 
warmth going on there and we can make a
copy<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.499> control<00:02:06.649> point<00:02:07.159> by<00:02:07.310> holding<00:02:07.609> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
copy that control point by holding the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.719 
copy that control point by holding the
option<00:02:07.850> key<00:02:08.119> on<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.450> Mac<00:02:08.479> Alt<00:02:08.899> key<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.350> PC<00:02:09.729> and

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
option key on a Mac Alt key on a PC and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.220 
option key on a Mac Alt key on a PC and
we'll<00:02:10.880> just<00:02:11.060> drag<00:02:11.240> that<00:02:11.480> right<00:02:11.690> over<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.080> drop

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
we'll just drag that right over and drop

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.930 
we'll just drag that right over and drop
it<00:02:12.380> on<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> skies<00:02:12.800> will<00:02:13.340> maintain<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
it on the skies will maintain the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.690 
it on the skies will maintain the
original<00:02:14.030> color<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:14.990> sky<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.280> let's<00:02:16.460> take

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
original color in that sky so let's take

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.059 
original color in that sky so let's take
a<00:02:16.730> look<00:02:17.060> at<00:02:17.300> those<00:02:17.510> control<00:02:18.320> points<00:02:18.770> and

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
a look at those control points and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.830 
a look at those control points and
that<00:02:19.280> masking<00:02:19.819> is<00:02:19.939> being<00:02:20.180> applied<00:02:20.420> we'll

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
that masking is being applied we'll

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.289 
that masking is being applied we'll

control points anything that's black is

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.530 
control points anything that's black is
removing<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.889> effect<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:32.239> we're<00:02:32.389> using

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
removing the effect because we're using

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.319 
removing the effect because we're using

original image anything that's light
gray<00:02:40.670> or<00:02:41.030> white<00:02:41.750> will<00:02:42.680> retain<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.459> full

effect<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.870> filter<00:02:45.409> so<00:02:46.340> if<00:02:46.430> we<00:02:46.579> take<00:02:46.790> a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
effect of the filter so if we take a

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.330 
effect of the filter so if we take a
plus<00:02:47.480> control<00:02:47.900> point<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:48.769> drop<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.129> right

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
plus control point and we drop it right

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.000 
plus control point and we drop it right
here<00:02:49.609> on<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.819> barn<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:51.230> you'll<00:02:51.409> see<00:02:51.620> how<00:02:51.829> that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
here on the barn so you'll see how that

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.789 
here on the barn so you'll see how that
white<00:02:52.340> area<00:02:52.609> so<00:02:52.909> now<00:02:53.150> we've<00:02:53.900> returned<00:02:54.469> the

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
white area so now we've returned the

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.849 
white area so now we've returned the
full<00:02:55.099> effect<00:02:55.579> of<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.329> skylight<00:02:56.840> filter<00:02:57.049> to

full effect of the skylight filter to
the<00:02:58.099> barn<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:58.879> let's<00:02:59.060> go<00:02:59.209> back<00:02:59.449> and<00:03:00.169> we'll

click on that show/hide all control

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.470 
click on that show/hide all control
point<00:03:03.799> selections<00:03:04.250> again<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.790> now<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.209> can

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
point selections again and now you can

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.679 
point selections again and now you can
see<00:03:05.689> that<00:03:06.439> the<00:03:06.739> barn<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.849> brought<00:03:08.239> back<00:03:08.389> to<00:03:08.449> the

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
see that the barn is brought back to the

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.390 
see that the barn is brought back to the
full<00:03:08.989> effect<00:03:09.349> so<00:03:09.590> if<00:03:09.680> we<00:03:09.769> take<00:03:09.919> the<00:03:10.099> opacity

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
full effect so if we take the opacity

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.720 
full effect so if we take the opacity
slider<00:03:11.389> from<00:03:11.870> 100%<00:03:12.409> down<00:03:12.919> to<00:03:13.099> zero

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
slider from 100% down to zero

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.879 
slider from 100% down to zero
that's<00:03:14.449> the<00:03:14.689> original<00:03:14.989> color<00:03:15.439> of<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> barn

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
that's the original color of the barn

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.149 
that's the original color of the barn
and<00:03:16.189> then<00:03:17.030> applying<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:18.049> skylight<00:03:18.949> filter

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
and then applying the skylight filter

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.670 
and then applying the skylight filter
that's<00:03:19.969> the<00:03:20.209> warm<00:03:20.569> color<00:03:21.019> of<00:03:21.169> the<00:03:21.230> barn<00:03:21.469> I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
that's the warm color of the barn I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.189 
that's the warm color of the barn I
think<00:03:22.219> that<00:03:22.340> works<00:03:22.519> really<00:03:23.030> well<00:03:23.269> bring<00:03:24.049> to

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
think that works really well bring to

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.469 
think that works really well bring to
your<00:03:24.290> attention<00:03:24.709> right<00:03:24.919> to<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.220> barn

your attention right to the barn

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.939 
your attention right to the barn
beautifully<00:03:26.479> so<00:03:26.900> let's<00:03:27.049> take<00:03:27.199> a<00:03:27.229> quick<00:03:27.799> look

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
beautifully so let's take a quick look

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.439 
beautifully so let's take a quick look
at<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.220> original<00:03:28.430> image<00:03:28.639> by<00:03:28.970> clicking<00:03:29.000> on<00:03:29.359> the

at the original image by clicking on the
compare<00:03:29.780> button<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:30.500> there's<00:03:30.680> where<00:03:30.799> we

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
compare button so there's where we

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.539 
compare button so there's where we
started<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.549> really<00:03:32.389> in<00:03:32.509> just<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.810> few<00:03:32.989> seconds

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
started and really in just a few seconds

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.129 
started and really in just a few seconds
we've<00:03:34.549> brought<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.819> lot<00:03:35.030> more<00:03:35.060> warmth<00:03:35.659> a<00:03:35.870> lot

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
we've brought a lot more warmth a lot

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.050 
we've brought a lot more warmth a lot
more<00:03:36.319> interest<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.829> think<00:03:36.859> to<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.370> image<00:03:37.699> all

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
more interest I think to this image all
