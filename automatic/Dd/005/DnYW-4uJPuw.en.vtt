it<00:00:40.430> is<00:00:40.579> fairly<00:00:40.910> easy<00:00:41.060> just<00:00:42.280> build<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.579> ton<00:00:44.000> of

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
it is fairly easy just build a ton of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.560 
it is fairly easy just build a ton of
mage<00:00:44.390> towers<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.700> upgrade<00:00:46.700> as<00:00:46.970> you<00:00:47.300> get<00:00:47.450> the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
already lost them so but not a big deal

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.679

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
because we still are able to do it we

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.330 
because we still are able to do it we
did<00:01:26.810> have<00:01:27.020> one<00:01:27.380> or<00:01:27.499> two<00:01:27.619> close<00:01:27.859> calls<00:01:28.189> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
did have one or two close calls the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.010 
did have one or two close calls the
first<00:01:28.579> time<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:28.789> passed<00:01:29.119> this<00:01:29.389> there<00:01:29.779> there

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
first time I passed this there there

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.330

were<00:01:30.709> no<00:01:30.770> close<00:01:31.159> calls<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.569> just<00:01:33.099> you<00:01:34.099> time

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.249 
were no close calls so it just you time
those<00:01:34.579> meteors<00:01:35.060> right<00:01:35.359> I<00:01:35.389> think<00:01:35.779> your<00:01:35.959> he'll

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
those meteors right I think your he'll

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.989 
those meteors right I think your he'll
be<00:01:36.439> just<00:01:36.799> just<00:01:37.609> fine<00:01:40.029> and<00:01:41.590> as<00:01:42.590> we<00:01:42.829> are<00:01:43.310> about<00:01:43.609> to
