00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.640
 yes 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:15.370
 the bmw z8 is not an old car but if 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:20.830
 already a classic was presented in the lounge 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:24.700
 of the automobile of Frankfurt in 1999 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.540
 this is a p mwv z8 one of my cars 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.090
 favorites looks a lot like 507 about 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.110
 everything on the grill very beautiful with the 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.079
 kidney shape typical of vw babies comes 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.900
 with a skirt that pushes the car towards 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.230
 down to increase stability to a 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.880
 I dream these headlights integrated in the part 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.920
 lead 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.530
 of the fenders are wide so that 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 can fit these thick tires 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 build you're 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.229
 6 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.350
 the BMW Z8 is a dream car and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.100
 when a successful 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.189
 combination of elegance and power with 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.310
 the fun when driving the zeta 8 comes 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.070
 especially the engine 1 of 8 of 32 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.939
 valves with a maximum torque of 500 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.580
 newtons meter and 400 horsepower 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:32.429
 It has tremendous strength designed 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.909
 could rectify the forms of ceta 8 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:41.009
 reminiscent of those of the bm w roster 507 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.920
 presented in 1955 this convertible is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.310
 made practically by hand together with the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.649
 high price 235 thousand deutsche mark 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.470
 then and the small number of 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.110
 manufactured units five thousand 703 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.110
 then promised great exclusivity 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.960
 a typical design element of the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.399
 rosters of the 50s and 60s 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.800
 is in the zeta 8 the curved back 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.220
 However, its body is still visible today 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.480
 modern and timeless 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.600
 this is the heart of the bmw z8 the engine 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.990
 of 8 with 500 newtons meter of torque 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.310
 maximum and 400 horsepower 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:34.070
 the first m 5 engine really powerful in 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.290
 bands this stabilizer bar I made it 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.750
 mount to increase the rigidity of the 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.910
 bodywork was necessary because it handled 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.150
 in sport because I was a runner 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.660
 for me it is absolutely a car of 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.660
 dream 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.530
 acceleration in less than five seconds 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.610
 from scratch so zeta 8 is not only very 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.900
 powerful but it also sounds if 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.510
 I always compare the sound of the engine 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.360
 back in the exhaust pipe with a bear 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.740
 roaring grizzli who is angry by 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.540
 something like that is the sound 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.540
 show that we have had 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.380
 you can clearly see how the 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.380
 power from below 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.620
 let's see now the interior what I 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.220
 The combination of leather is very popular 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.120
 beige with black piano lacquer 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.810
 interesting is the instrument panel 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.510
 in the middle as in the mini 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.400
 here you can see the revolution counter 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.820
 Water temperature speed level 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.730
 tank then this magnificent steering wheel with 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.520
 radios like before but with air bag 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.920
 integrated one goes comfortable with a lot 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.590
 comfort and has great visibility 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.220
 from inside have follow-up 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.180
 1 z 8 was James Bond's car in the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.700
 movie tomorrow never dies 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.670
 you're having the fascinating thing about this 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.299
 auto is mostly design I encourage you to 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.920
 say that in 30 or 40 years 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:17.840
 will achieve a fame like the one that now 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.840
 has the son 507 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.940
 but this sports car also has a 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.940
 magnificent engine in the m5 and consumption is 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.940
 naturally high constant the zeta 8 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.440
 It is also a car for every day 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.240
 that shows that practically no 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.669
 It needs maintenance and is very 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.580
 reliable the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.099
 load gasoline from time to time with 400 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.639
 horses consumes a lot but for the rest 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.639
 all 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.290
 depending on how you drive you can consume 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:58.170
 between 15 and 20 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.170
 exclusivity has its price 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.960
 now buying a set to 8 is today very 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.150
 difficult because it is already a car 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.060
 collection the price goes up constantly 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.490
 and I found it on the internet but it's 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.310
 increasingly difficult for me is the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.470
 most beautiful sports will take a lot 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.220
 come a car so wonderfully 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.220
 beautiful
