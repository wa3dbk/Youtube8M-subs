00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
playing so to do this what I did was got

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
playing so to do this what I did was got
this<00:00:37.649> little<00:00:38.070> mic<00:00:38.340> flange<00:00:38.670> from<00:00:39.059> Sweetwater

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
this little mic flange from Sweetwater

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
this little mic flange from Sweetwater
for<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.809> five<00:00:40.050> bucks<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.920> right

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
for about five bucks you can see right

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.959 
for about five bucks you can see right
there<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.010> opened<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> keyboard

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
there and I then opened up the keyboard

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
there and I then opened up the keyboard
and<00:00:45.329> had<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.170> off<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> circuit<00:00:46.860> board

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and had to take off the circuit board

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
and had to take off the circuit board
and<00:00:47.430> remove<00:00:47.730> all<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> important<00:00:48.719> components

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
and remove all the important components

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529 
and remove all the important components
that<00:00:49.829> were<00:00:49.920> under<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.309> spot<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that were under this spot so that I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.000 
that were under this spot so that I
could<00:00:51.690> take<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> power<00:00:52.079> drill<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:52.739> drill

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
could take a power drill and then drill

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
could take a power drill and then drill
straight<00:00:53.370> through<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> metal<00:00:54.090> top<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:55.110> create

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
straight through the metal top to create

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.549 
straight through the metal top to create
the<00:00:55.829> sink<00:00:56.370> holes<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> flange<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:58.440> could

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the sink holes for the flange you could

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
the sink holes for the flange you could
probably<00:00:58.739> mount<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> plastic

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
probably mount this on a plastic

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
probably mount this on a plastic
keyboard<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.629> well<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.559> might<00:01:01.800> want<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
keyboard as well you just might want to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
keyboard as well you just might want to
start<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.550> very<00:01:03.180> small<00:01:03.480> drill<00:01:03.809> bits

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
start with some very small drill bits

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
start with some very small drill bits
and<00:01:04.170> work<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.439> way<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.670> larger<00:01:05.970> bits

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
and work your way up to the larger bits

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
and work your way up to the larger bits
to<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.630> sure<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:07.799> crack<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to make sure that you don't crack the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.780 
to make sure that you don't crack the
casing<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.680> what<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> did<00:01:10.920> next<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.310> put<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
casing so what I did next was put the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.450 
casing so what I did next was put the
bolts<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.510> from<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> underside<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.590> then

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
bolts in from the underside and then

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.480 
bolts in from the underside and then
attach<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> lock<00:01:15.600> nuts<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.170> top<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
attach to the lock nuts on top here and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
attach to the lock nuts on top here and
then<00:01:17.970> next<00:01:18.210> thing<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.020> thing<00:01:19.200> was

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
then next thing you know this thing was

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.160 
then next thing you know this thing was
super<00:01:19.920> securely<00:01:20.310> fastened<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> circuit

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
super securely fastened the circuit

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.109 
super securely fastened the circuit
board<00:01:22.320> goes<00:01:22.439> back<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> place<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
board goes back in place all the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.359 
board goes back in place all the
connectors<00:01:24.659> reconnected<00:01:25.530> keyboard<00:01:26.220> gets

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369

connectors reconnected keyboard gets
closed<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:29.369> flange<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.000> set<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
closed back up and the flange is set and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.010 
closed back up and the flange is set and
ready<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> next<00:01:31.619> step<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.880> next<00:01:33.570> step<00:01:33.720> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
ready for the next step so next step is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.620 
ready for the next step so next step is
you<00:01:34.740> want<00:01:34.799> some<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.159> pipe<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.119> guy

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you want some kind of pipe like this guy

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.810 
you want some kind of pipe like this guy
right<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.710> believe<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> quick

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
right here which I believe is a quick

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.929 
right here which I believe is a quick
lock<00:01:39.740> extender<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.979> got<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.640> some

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
lock extender that I got with some

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.120 
lock extender that I got with some
little<00:01:42.470> boom<00:01:43.470> mic<00:01:44.009> kit<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.860> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little boom mic kit and so this just

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.420 
little boom mic kit and so this just
simply<00:01:47.670> screws<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.329> top<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> flange<00:01:49.430> like

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
simply screws on top of the flange like

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.100 
simply screws on top of the flange like
so<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> actually<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> really

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so and this is this is actually a really

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.690 
so and this is this is actually a really
good<00:01:55.350> size<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.460> don't<00:01:56.520> want

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
good size this one here you don't want

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.010 
good size this one here you don't want
to<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.850> too<00:01:57.030> big<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> don't<00:01:57.899> want

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
to be too big because you don't want

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.139 
to be too big because you don't want
this<00:01:58.079> thing<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.350> an<00:01:58.469> obstruction<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.250> think

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this thing to be an obstruction I think

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.990 
this thing to be an obstruction I think
six<00:02:00.390> inches<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:01.110> right<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.000> then

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
six inches is just about right and then

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.310 
six inches is just about right and then

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
and the cool thing with this setup is

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.070 
and the cool thing with this setup is
you've<00:02:22.430> even<00:02:22.550> got<00:02:22.850> some<00:02:23.120> threads<00:02:23.480> sticking<00:02:23.810> up

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
you've even got some threads sticking up

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.800 
you've even got some threads sticking up
here<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:25.040> are<00:02:25.070> being<00:02:25.340> unused<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.390> get

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
here that are being unused so you get

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.400 
here that are being unused so you get
something<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.490> like<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.520> gooseneck<00:02:29.090> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410
