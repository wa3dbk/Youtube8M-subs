hoorah<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.840> irnv<00:00:24.320> scope<00:00:24.770> which<00:00:24.980> you<00:00:25.130> see

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
hoorah to the irnv scope which you see

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.279 
hoorah to the irnv scope which you see
right<00:00:25.369> here<00:00:25.730> which<00:00:25.940> is<00:00:26.090> basically<00:00:26.600> hacks<00:00:26.990> I

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
right here which is basically hacks I

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.140 
right here which is basically hacks I
thought<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.130> was<00:00:28.190> kind<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.580> balance<00:00:28.970> when<00:00:29.119> I

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
thought it was kind of balance when I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.120 
thought it was kind of balance when I
first<00:00:29.420> used<00:00:29.570> it<00:00:29.900> but<00:00:30.110> came<00:00:30.650> to<00:00:30.770> realize<00:00:31.100> that

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
first used it but came to realize that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.220 
first used it but came to realize that
it's<00:00:31.490> pretty<00:00:31.670> stupid<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:32.510> I'll<00:00:32.660> pose<00:00:32.960> this

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
it's pretty stupid so I'll pose this

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.930 
it's pretty stupid so I'll pose this
question<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.770> you<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.160> let<00:00:34.340> me<00:00:34.370> know<00:00:34.520> what<00:00:34.820> you

question to you and let me know what you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.110 
question to you and let me know what you
think<00:00:35.150> in<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.480> comment<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.230> what<00:00:37.010> if<00:00:37.190> dice<00:00:37.640> the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
think in a comment so what if dice the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.900 
think in a comment so what if dice the
developers<00:00:38.690> completely<00:00:39.620> remove<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.370> irnv

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
developers completely remove the irnv

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.510 
developers completely remove the irnv
scope<00:00:41.330> from<00:00:41.899> multiplayer<00:00:42.530> therefore<00:00:43.340> would

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
scope from multiplayer therefore would

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.190 
scope from multiplayer therefore would
just<00:00:43.670> be<00:00:43.820> not<00:00:44.030> there<00:00:44.270> it's<00:00:44.510> not<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.690> choice<00:00:44.989> you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
just be not there it's not a choice you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.440 
just be not there it's not a choice you
can't<00:00:45.410> use<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:45.800> however<00:00:46.610> some<00:00:46.880> single<00:00:47.270> player

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
can't use it however some single player

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.750 
can't use it however some single player
missions<00:00:47.660> required<00:00:48.290> or<00:00:48.559> co-op<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.610> that's

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
missions required or co-op so that's

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.190 
missions required or co-op so that's
fine<00:00:50.030> but<00:00:50.450> it<00:00:50.660> just<00:00:50.780> wouldn't<00:00:50.899> be<00:00:51.050> there

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
fine but it just wouldn't be there

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.200 
fine but it just wouldn't be there
multiplayer<00:00:51.620> what<00:00:51.860> would<00:00:51.950> you<00:00:52.010> guys<00:00:52.130> think

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
multiplayer what would you guys think

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.400 
multiplayer what would you guys think
honestly<00:00:53.210> in<00:00:53.360> my<00:00:53.390> opinion<00:00:53.510> I<00:00:53.960> would<00:00:53.989> be<00:00:54.170> okay

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
honestly in my opinion I would be okay

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.410 
honestly in my opinion I would be okay
with<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:54.559> because<00:00:54.829> there<00:00:55.670> are<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.940> lot<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.210> other

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
with it because there are a lot of other

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.389 
with it because there are a lot of other
good<00:00:56.660> choices<00:00:56.719> for<00:00:57.320> scopes<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:58.280> would

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
good choices for scopes it would

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.340 
good choices for scopes it would
definitely<00:00:58.579> be<00:00:58.760> more<00:00:59.000> fair<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.540> it<00:01:00.230> would

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
definitely be more fair and it would

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.229 
definitely be more fair and it would
allow<00:01:00.620> new<00:01:01.190> players<00:01:01.520> to<00:01:01.789> actually<00:01:02.059> have<00:01:02.210> a

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
allow new players to actually have a

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.999 
allow new players to actually have a
chance<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.020> guys<00:01:03.200> who<00:01:03.530> have<00:01:03.559> unlocked

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
chance to the guys who have unlocked

here's some patch gameplay with the new

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.090 
here's some patch gameplay with the new
iron<00:01:14.390> be<00:01:14.660> scoped<00:01:14.929> it<00:01:15.170> looked<00:01:15.830> absolutely

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
iron be scoped it looked absolutely

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.309 
iron be scoped it looked absolutely
horrible<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.209> can't<00:01:17.450> see<00:01:17.630> anything<00:01:17.869> at<00:01:18.020> range

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
horrible you can't see anything at range

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.680 
horrible you can't see anything at range
people<00:01:18.830> just<00:01:18.979> don't<00:01:19.069> pop<00:01:19.520> like<00:01:20.149> they<00:01:20.300> used<00:01:20.509> to

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
people just don't pop like they used to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.320 
people just don't pop like they used to
in<00:01:20.899> this<00:01:21.050> clip<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.340> i<00:01:22.610> don't<00:01:23.000> think<00:01:23.179> i'll<00:01:23.300> be

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
in this clip so i don't think i'll be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.150 
in this clip so i don't think i'll be
using<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.780> for<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.050> new<00:01:24.200> Chevy<00:01:24.560> combo<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.130> I

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
using it for the new Chevy combo have I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.359 
using it for the new Chevy combo have I
decided<00:01:25.640> what<00:01:25.819> that<00:01:25.970> will<00:01:26.090> be<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.450> guess<00:01:27.050> not

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
decided what that will be I guess not

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.589 
decided what that will be I guess not
maybe<00:01:28.369> I'll<00:01:28.670> just<00:01:28.819> go<00:01:29.000> with<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:29.240> red<00:01:29.390> dot

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:29.599 
maybe I'll just go with the red dot

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.660 
maybe I'll just go with the red dot
because<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.410> just<00:01:30.470> feels<00:01:30.770> like<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.220> pulls<00:01:31.520> up

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
because it just feels like it pulls up

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.550 
because it just feels like it pulls up
faster<00:01:32.149> when<00:01:32.270> you're<00:01:32.300> aiming<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.140> it's<00:01:33.380> more

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
faster when you're aiming and it's more

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.859 
faster when you're aiming and it's more
basic<00:01:34.009> yeah<00:01:34.190> people<00:01:34.580> like<00:01:34.610> therefore<00:01:35.360> X<00:01:35.569> or

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
basic yeah people like therefore X or

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.169 
basic yeah people like therefore X or
maybe<00:01:36.410> they're<00:01:36.590> 6<00:01:36.890> x<00:01:37.130> different<00:01:38.030> kind<00:01:38.149> of

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
maybe they're 6 x different kind of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.639 
maybe they're 6 x different kind of
things<00:01:38.390> with<00:01:38.569> our<00:01:38.630> cobra<00:01:39.080> but<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.319> just<00:01:39.470> like

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
things with our cobra but I just like

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.440 
things with our cobra but I just like
the<00:01:39.800> normal<00:01:40.009> dot<00:01:40.399> that's<00:01:40.910> definitely<00:01:41.330> my

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
the normal dot that's definitely my

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.999 
the normal dot that's definitely my
choice<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.990> wasn't<00:01:42.319> brink<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.709> pretty<00:01:42.950> much

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
choice it wasn't brink and pretty much

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.339 
choice it wasn't brink and pretty much
any<00:01:43.280> other<00:01:43.340> game<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.700> like<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.119> red<00:01:44.300> dot<00:01:44.509> in<00:01:45.200> the

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
any other game I like the red dot in the

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.650 
any other game I like the red dot in the
actual<00:01:45.619> patch<00:01:45.979> notes<00:01:46.280> I'm<00:01:46.550> not<00:01:46.789> sure<00:01:47.209> if<00:01:47.420> the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
actual patch notes I'm not sure if the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.499 
actual patch notes I'm not sure if the
sunlight<00:01:48.200> has<00:01:48.440> been<00:01:48.800> nerfed<00:01:49.190> yet<00:01:49.459> i<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:50.209> seen

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
sunlight has been nerfed yet i have seen

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.930 
sunlight has been nerfed yet i have seen
screenshots<00:01:51.110> from<00:01:51.349> demise<00:01:51.740> 99<00:01:52.310> once<00:01:52.580> again<00:01:52.819> on

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
screenshots from demise 99 once again on

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.510 
screenshots from demise 99 once again on
twitter<00:01:53.289> showing<00:01:54.289> that<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.950> brightness

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
twitter showing that the brightness

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.609 
twitter showing that the brightness
turned<00:01:56.000> down<00:01:56.300> from<00:01:56.660> about<00:01:56.869> one<00:01:57.500> hundred

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
turned down from about one hundred

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.820 
turned down from about one hundred
percent<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:58.220> say<00:01:58.429> forty<00:01:59.000> percent<00:01:59.300> it<00:02:00.170> looks<00:02:00.649> a

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
percent to say forty percent it looks a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.410 
percent to say forty percent it looks a
lot<00:02:01.009> better<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:01.640> I'm<00:02:01.789> excited<00:02:02.149> about<00:02:02.270> that

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
lot better so I'm excited about that

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.870 
lot better so I'm excited about that
hopefully<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:03.679> getting<00:02:04.160> implemented<00:02:04.610> in

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
hopefully that is getting implemented in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.510 
hopefully that is getting implemented in
the<00:02:05.000> gameplay<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.720> hopefully<00:02:06.250> frag<00:02:07.250> rounds

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
the gameplay and hopefully frag rounds

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.430 
the gameplay and hopefully frag rounds
on<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.149> USS<00:02:08.660> AKA<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:10.310> suck<00:02:10.700> at<00:02:10.940> shooting<00:02:11.239> i<00:02:11.599> I

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
on the USS AKA you suck at shooting i I

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.050 
on the USS AKA you suck at shooting i I
hope<00:02:12.709> that's<00:02:12.860> getting<00:02:13.190> patched<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.640> haven't

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
hope that's getting patched to I haven't

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.940 
hope that's getting patched to I haven't
seen<00:02:14.209> all<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> passion<00:02:14.720> notes<00:02:14.989> quite<00:02:15.230> yet<00:02:15.440> but

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
seen all the passion notes quite yet but

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.080 
seen all the passion notes quite yet but
hopefully<00:02:16.099> that's<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.550> there<00:02:16.670> as<00:02:16.730> well<00:02:16.760> it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
hopefully that's in there as well it

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.869 
hopefully that's in there as well it
still<00:02:17.780> seems<00:02:18.049> like<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.469> f2000<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.489> still<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
still seems like the f2000 is still the

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.850 
still seems like the f2000 is still the
best<00:02:19.909> assault<00:02:20.540> rifle<00:02:20.989> next<00:02:21.260> day

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
best assault rifle next day

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.360 
best assault rifle next day
k<00:02:22.300> 971<00:02:23.300> they're<00:02:24.020> basically<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.770> same<00:02:24.890> but<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
k 971 they're basically the same but I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.030 
k 971 they're basically the same but I
like<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.580> feel<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.720> f2000<00:02:27.560> better<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
like the feel of the f2000 better and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.580 
like the feel of the f2000 better and
the<00:02:28.490> reload<00:02:28.850> seems<00:02:29.180> faster<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.080> I'm<00:02:30.170> thinking

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
the reload seems faster so I'm thinking

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.610 
the reload seems faster so I'm thinking
red<00:02:30.860> dot<00:02:31.100> for<00:02:32.030> grip<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.480> maybe<00:02:32.900> suppressor

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
red dot for grip and maybe suppressor

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.860 
red dot for grip and maybe suppressor
that<00:02:34.280> will<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.640> new<00:02:35.000> hotness<00:02:35.300> because

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
that will be the new hotness because

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.050 
that will be the new hotness because
suppressor<00:02:36.500> yeah<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.190> says<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.640> dropped<00:02:37.940> a

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
suppressor yeah it says it dropped a

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.360 
suppressor yeah it says it dropped a
damage<00:02:38.390> at<00:02:38.540> range<00:02:38.570> but<00:02:39.050> really<00:02:39.530> it's<00:02:39.740> only<00:02:40.220> at

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
damage at range but really it's only at

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.150 
damage at range but really it's only at
I<00:02:40.700> don't<00:02:41.150> know<00:02:41.210> what<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.540> exact<00:02:41.870> meter<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.380> but

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
I don't know what the exact meter is but

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.950 
I don't know what the exact meter is but
it's<00:02:43.310> not<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:43.550> bad<00:02:43.970> it's<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:44.420> it's<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:44.870> a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
it's not that bad it's like it's like a

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.440 
it's not that bad it's like it's like a
damaged<00:02:45.500> or<00:02:45.710> two<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.550> really<00:02:46.970> not<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.150> much

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
damaged or two it's really not that much

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.420 
damaged or two it's really not that much
so<00:02:47.720> suppressor<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.440> really<00:02:48.800> where<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.100> at<00:02:49.220> in

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
so suppressor is really where it's at in

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.220 
so suppressor is really where it's at in
my<00:02:49.670> opinion<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.660> I'll<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.200> that

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
my opinion so I'll be going with that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.590 
my opinion so I'll be going with that
for<00:02:51.530> sure<00:02:51.560> for<00:02:52.430> actual<00:02:52.700> gameplay<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.300> reason

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
for sure for actual gameplay the reason

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.140 
for sure for actual gameplay the reason
why<00:02:53.720> I'm<00:02:53.840> using<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.350> m249<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.910> best

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
why I'm using the m249 it is the best

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.690 
why I'm using the m249 it is the best
support<00:02:56.840> weapon<00:02:56.990> I<00:02:57.320> have<00:02:57.500> unlocked<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.190> far<00:02:58.459> I

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
support weapon I have unlocked so far I

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.080 
support weapon I have unlocked so far I
also<00:02:59.209> want<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.510> try<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.190> m240b<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.760> believe

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
also want to try the m240b I believe

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.710 
also want to try the m240b I believe
it's<00:03:02.239> called<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.630> then<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.580> pkp<00:03:04.580> which<00:03:05.270> looks

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
it's called and then the pkp which looks

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.360 
it's called and then the pkp which looks
pretty<00:03:05.810> ridiculous<00:03:06.650> because<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.920> saw<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.250> has

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
pretty ridiculous because I saw it has

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.449 
pretty ridiculous because I saw it has
34<00:03:08.180> damage<00:03:08.600> up<00:03:08.780> close<00:03:08.989> which<00:03:09.890> means<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.370> would

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
34 damage up close which means it would

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.550 
34 damage up close which means it would
kill<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.940> three<00:03:11.270> shots<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:12.530> really

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
kill in three shots so that is really

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.190 
kill in three shots so that is really
good<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.190> depending<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.270> actual<00:03:14.450> recoil

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
good and depending on the actual recoil

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.660 
good and depending on the actual recoil
of<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.380> gun<00:03:15.470> with<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.920> foregrip<00:03:16.340> because

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
of the gun with the foregrip because

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.640 
of the gun with the foregrip because
foregrip<00:03:17.150> really<00:03:17.510> changes<00:03:17.870> everything<00:03:18.110> if

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
foregrip really changes everything if

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.710 
foregrip really changes everything if
you<00:03:18.800> guys<00:03:18.920> think<00:03:18.980> support<00:03:19.580> weapons<00:03:19.880> suck<00:03:20.120> use

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
you guys think support weapons suck use

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.930 
you guys think support weapons suck use
the<00:03:20.900> foregrip<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.800> completely<00:03:22.400> changes<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
the foregrip it completely changes the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.550 
the foregrip it completely changes the
saw<00:03:23.330> weapon<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.810> i'm<00:03:23.930> using<00:03:24.200> right<00:03:24.230> here

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
saw weapon that i'm using right here

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.009 
saw weapon that i'm using right here
that<00:03:24.709> once<00:03:24.860> again<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.220> m249<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.540> makes<00:03:26.840> it

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
that once again the m249 it makes it

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.600
