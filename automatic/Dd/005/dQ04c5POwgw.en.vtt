00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
in you have to tie this together you see

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.600 
in you have to tie this together you see
I've<00:02:11.489> evenly<00:02:12.239> laid<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:14.100> bed<00:02:14.280> sheet

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
I've evenly laid out the bed sheet

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.420 
I've evenly laid out the bed sheet
ribbon<00:02:15.330> now<00:02:15.540> here's<00:02:15.959> our<00:02:16.260> ribbon<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.950> green

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
ribbon now here's our ribbon the green

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.940

stripes<00:02:17.940> with<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> translucent<00:02:18.750> white<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.860> we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
stripes with a translucent white so we

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.590 
stripes with a translucent white so we
can<00:02:20.100> put<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.459> top<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.819> Sheep<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.510> you

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
can put this on top of the Sheep so you

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.120 
can put this on top of the Sheep so you
can<00:02:21.750> actually<00:02:21.780> see<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.530> give<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.800> more<00:02:23.069> of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
can actually see it and give it more of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.280 
can actually see it and give it more of
a<00:02:23.280> better<00:02:23.489> effect<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> do<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
a better effect so all you do is the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.370 
a better effect so all you do is the
same<00:02:25.500> thing<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:25.770> what<00:02:26.069> we<00:02:26.190> were<00:02:26.250> doing<00:02:30.380> I've

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
same thing as what we were doing I've

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.830 
same thing as what we were doing I've
got<00:02:31.560> these<00:02:31.769> big<00:02:32.160> go<00:02:32.820> balls<00:02:33.150> I've<00:02:33.450> got<00:02:33.630> enough

got these big go balls I've got enough

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
got these big go balls I've got enough
gold<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.410> green<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.769> there<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.580> think

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
gold and green on there and I think

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.310

small<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.950> white<00:02:38.220> balls<00:02:39.680> why<00:02:40.680> don't<00:02:40.860> we

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
small little white balls why don't we

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.479 
small little white balls why don't we
put<00:02:41.239> these<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.590> tree<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:43.950> pain<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.280> wine

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
put these on the tree and pain and wine

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.280 
put these on the tree and pain and wine
remember<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.209> got<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> wide<00:02:45.690> spray<00:02:46.019> paint
