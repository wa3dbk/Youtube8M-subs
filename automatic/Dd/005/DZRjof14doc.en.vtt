ear cushions and it has FSC wood and I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.600 
ear cushions and it has FSC wood and I
guess<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> FSC<00:00:50.820> wood<00:00:51.300> certified<00:00:52.610> basically

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
guess the FSC wood certified basically

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.060 
guess the FSC wood certified basically
means<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:55.110> made<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.649> recycled

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
means is it's made for recycled

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
means is it's made for recycled
materials<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.879> minimizes<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> impact<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
materials and minimizes the impact to

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
materials and minimizes the impact to
the<00:00:58.199> waste<00:00:58.350> system<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.340> whatever<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the waste system so whatever that is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.779 
the waste system so whatever that is
it's<00:01:00.239> harvested<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> special<00:01:01.410> way<00:01:01.609> it<00:01:02.609> comes

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
it's harvested in a special way it comes

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.789 
it's harvested in a special way it comes
to<00:01:02.879> recycling<00:01:03.180> packaging<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.260> kind<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.530> give

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
to recycling packaging to kind of give

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.289 
to recycling packaging to kind of give
you<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.040> same<00:01:05.309> feel<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.610> everything<00:01:05.909> they're
