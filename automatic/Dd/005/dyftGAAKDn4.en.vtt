00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
more than they do i forgit black coat

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.299 
more than they do i forgit black coat
then<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.730> will<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:43.070> quickscoping<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
then you will know that quickscoping is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.500 
then you will know that quickscoping is
a<00:00:44.340> major<00:00:44.850> major<00:00:45.360> part<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.940> project<00:00:47.940> locker<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
a major major part in project locker I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.819 
a major major part in project locker I
mean<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.410> vital<00:00:50.780> skill<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.620> have

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
mean it is like a vital skill to have

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.150 
mean it is like a vital skill to have
when<00:00:53.160> your<00:00:53.309> plane<00:00:54.020> because<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.890> priest

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
when your plane because you can priest

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.200 
when your plane because you can priest
it<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:57.260> don't<00:00:58.260> swap<00:01:02.239> ok<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:04.260> basically

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
it out don't swap ok so basically

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
it out don't swap ok so basically
quickscoping<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> were<00:01:06.619> instead<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.740> doing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
quickscoping is were instead of doing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
quickscoping is were instead of doing
this<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.939> know<00:01:09.030> should<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:09.840> hon<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.619> a
