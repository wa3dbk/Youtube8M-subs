 a detergent is suitable 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.980
 do not keep in mind that you can use various detergent dtp we will use an ohm 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 professional 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.610
 because we use every day we can use a voice of sopone to marry one 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.910
 demonic voice 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.630
 the important thing in used in minimal quantities 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.610
 otherwise 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 go to sleep the veto instead of cleaning it 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.360

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.720
 serafina 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.230
 we have 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.310
 you our 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 sandpaper that criminal consideration for today 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.500
 beautiful nice one particularly 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.970
 particularly sports and so successful 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.770
 to have an idea of ​​wind cleaning 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.730
 the beautiful 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.620
 very clean I recommend 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 we want the solution we have prepared on the agenda 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.010
 but let's pass on the glass 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.890
 we stay a moment and massage moby into the glass because 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.550
 we must have time to melt the dirt on the glass 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.230
 god be in a hurry to do with operation here 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.500
 keep in mind that it is an operator that you do when it is very hot and the glass is 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.320
 very hot you have to be 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.780
 if in that case instead it is very fast otherwise I get a clap 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.240
 the dirty corporation water on the glass 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.460
 after soaping we pass 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.380
 unipi wiper the part we treated with water 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.870
 also in this case 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.020
 if we have 2 solution 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.290
 oh we give you the squeegee from top to bottom 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.820
 or otherwise it is the solution that I advised I was the one in my opinion 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.799
 more appropriate, pull the squeegee 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.049
 from right to left. the other way around 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.049
 that we let the water run down at the bottom 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.069
 after this operation there will be no borders remaining 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.589
 slightly wet as soon as you pass with the cotton cloth 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.649
 and you will see that plane 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.009
 you have a perfectly clean glass 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.789
 without the need to have to intervene further 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.919
 did this 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 then this is it 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.609
 obviously repeat the operation 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.149
 inside and iron glass absolutely 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.949
 that perfectly clean 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.029
 this penis 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.669

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.489
