we<00:03:38.530> make<00:03:38.830> this<00:03:40.500> capsule

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.040 

I<00:03:45.700> like<00:03:46.360> them<00:03:46.510> all<00:03:46.830> boxes<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.980> think<00:03:48.510> rotate<00:03:49.510> 90

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
I like them all boxes I think rotate 90

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.920 
I like them all boxes I think rotate 90
degrees<00:03:52.620> looks<00:03:53.620> good

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.910 
degrees looks good
we<00:03:55.930> now<00:03:56.080> have<00:03:56.380> hair<00:03:56.710> physics<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.550> joints

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
we now have hair physics and joints

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.500 
we now have hair physics and joints
problem<00:03:59.920> is<00:04:00.070> we<00:04:00.370> need<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.670> assign<00:04:01.000> these

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
problem is we need to assign these

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.020 
problem is we need to assign these
joints<00:04:02.080> so<00:04:02.680> by<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.040> joint<00:04:03.490> tab<00:04:03.730> we're<00:04:03.910> going

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
joints so by the joint tab we're going

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.800 
joints so by the joint tab we're going
to<00:04:04.090> sign<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.750> first<00:04:05.020> one<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:06.130> head<00:04:06.540> body<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.690> to

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
to sign the first one to head body a to

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.070 
to sign the first one to head body a to
head<00:04:08.200> body<00:04:09.040> B<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.760> hair<00:04:09.940> one<00:04:10.240> and<00:04:10.660> that's

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
head body B to hair one and that's

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.660 
head body B to hair one and that's
really<00:04:11.320> all<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.590> need<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.800> do<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.250> when<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.490> go

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
really all you need to do so when you go

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.650 
really all you need to do so when you go

oh no that's probably didn't assign the
joints<00:04:20.470> or<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.890> bones<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.609> we<00:04:21.640> need<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.970> sign

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
what an idiot doll Dave what an idiot so

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.570 
what an idiot doll Dave what an idiot so
we<00:04:29.140> click<00:04:29.350> on<00:04:29.470> weight<00:04:29.740> we're<00:04:29.950> going<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.310> weigh

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
we click on weight we're going to weigh

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.510 
we click on weight we're going to weigh
the<00:04:30.910> hair<00:04:30.940> actually<00:04:31.930> before<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.230> do<00:04:32.410> that

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
the hair actually before we do that

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.780 
the hair actually before we do that
we're<00:04:33.520> going<00:04:33.640> to<00:04:33.730> weigh<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.150> head<00:04:34.510> bone<00:04:35.790> to

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
we're going to weigh the head bone to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.030 
we're going to weigh the head bone to
the<00:04:36.820> whole<00:04:37.419> hair<00:04:40.230> weight<00:04:41.230> a<00:04:41.260> head<00:04:41.560> bone<00:04:41.770> first

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
the whole hair weight a head bone first

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.890 
the whole hair weight a head bone first
I<00:04:42.310> always<00:04:42.850> remember<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.360> way<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.570> head<00:04:43.720> bone

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
I always remember the way the head bone

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.080 
I always remember the way the head bone
first<00:04:47.160> now<00:04:48.160> we're<00:04:48.280> gonna<00:04:48.370> weigh<00:04:48.580> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
first now we're gonna weigh the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.480 
first now we're gonna weigh the
ponytails

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
ponytails

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.980

now<00:04:51.490> it'll<00:04:52.090> see<00:04:52.570> physics<00:04:53.320> hooray<00:04:54.810> hooray<00:04:55.810> for

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
now it'll see physics hooray hooray for

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.580 
now it'll see physics hooray hooray for
physics<00:04:56.560> so<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.010> can<00:04:57.190> just<00:04:57.340> do<00:04:58.110> this<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.380> the

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
physics so I can just do this in the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.469 
physics so I can just do this in the
physics<00:04:59.979> go<00:05:00.220> oh<00:05:00.430> wait<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.970> physics<00:05:01.330> are

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
physics go oh wait the physics are

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.610 
physics go oh wait the physics are
messed<00:05:01.660> up

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.280 

yeah<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.340> physics<00:05:08.850> are<00:05:09.030> messed<00:05:09.270> up<00:05:09.480> word<00:05:09.750> used

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
yeah the physics are messed up word used

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.220 
yeah the physics are messed up word used
to<00:05:10.500> physics<00:05:10.890> messed<00:05:11.100> up<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.990> seems<00:05:12.990> we've

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
to physics messed up that seems we've

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:34.839 
to physics messed up that seems we've
bought<00:05:13.470> in<00:05:13.650> part<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.310> fix<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:15.300> real<00:05:15.480> quick

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:45.080 

tries<00:05:35.419> again

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.840 

no<00:05:45.690> it's<00:05:45.840> not<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.110> bottom<00:05:46.410> one<00:05:46.560> it's<00:05:46.740> there<00:05:47.700> we

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
no it's not the bottom one it's there we

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.629 
no it's not the bottom one it's there we
go<00:05:48.030> that<00:05:48.270> fixed<00:05:48.600> it<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:49.190> here<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.370> have<00:05:50.610> a

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
go that fixed it so here you have a

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.430 
go that fixed it so here you have a
ponytail<00:05:51.210> with<00:05:51.450> physics<00:05:52.139> hooray<00:05:54.410> took<00:05:55.410> a

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
ponytail with physics hooray took a

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.320 
ponytail with physics hooray took a
