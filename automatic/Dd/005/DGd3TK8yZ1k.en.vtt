when I'm all done with my makeup i
spritz<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.590> few<00:01:22.770> pumps<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.850> face

and I find that it really just locks my
makeup<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.600> keeps<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> from<00:01:28.259> smearing<00:01:28.770> or

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
makeup in and keeps it from smearing or
