00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
this will be delicious so first what we

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.370 
this will be delicious so first what we
do<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.100> cut<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.360> half<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.200> actually

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
do is cut this in half then you actually

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.880 
do is cut this in half then you actually
cut<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> icing<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.520> half<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> did<00:01:16.470> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
cut the icing in half so what I did is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
cut the icing in half so what I did is
to<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to take this and you're going to have to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990 
to take this and you're going to have to
have<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.930> cupcakes<00:01:19.320> rather<00:01:19.560> cold<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.850> do

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
have your cupcakes rather cold to do

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.810 
have your cupcakes rather cold to do
this<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:22.130> we<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.520> piece<00:01:23.790> there

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this so there we have that piece there

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.640 
this so there we have that piece there
what<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.960> take<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> spoon<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
what I'm going to do is take a spoon and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.310 
what I'm going to do is take a spoon and
just<00:01:25.970> gently<00:01:26.970> put<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:28.110> put<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
just gently put this actually put this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
just gently put this actually put this
piece<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.950> first<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.820> want<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
piece in first because you want the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.480 
piece in first because you want the
cream<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> middle<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
cream in the middle so we're going to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.730 
cream in the middle so we're going to
let<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> fall<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.450> there<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.560> do

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
let that fall into there and just do

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.359 
let that fall into there and just do
this<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.220> rather<00:01:35.460> carefully<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.369> I

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this you know rather carefully and I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.280 
this you know rather carefully and I
only<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.180> one<00:01:39.360> take<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
only get one take to do this so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.380 
only get one take to do this so
hopefully<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.740> works<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:42.030> sure<00:01:42.180> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
hopefully this works and make sure that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.970 
hopefully this works and make sure that
this<00:01:42.479> goes<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.020> bottom

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.510 

and<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.730> we<00:01:47.820> go<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.440> take<00:01:49.650> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and there we go so then we take the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.690 
and there we go so then we take the
second<00:01:50.880> piece<00:01:51.650> put<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.520> falls

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
second piece put that that just falls

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.790 
second piece put that that just falls
right<00:01:53.910> in<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.870> you<00:01:55.020> take<00:01:55.230> the<00:01:55.440> cream<00:01:55.740> on

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
right in and then you take the cream on

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.190 
right in and then you take the cream on
top<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.970> since<00:01:57.480> this<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:57.930> pretty

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200

on top and then you have your piece of
string<00:02:31.800> here<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.820> then<00:02:33.420> you're<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.720> to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
string here and then you're going to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.840 
string here and then you're going to
need<00:02:37.100> plastic<00:02:38.100> spoon<00:02:40.340> plastic<00:02:41.340> spoon<00:02:41.520> goes<00:02:41.700> on

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
right now I'm just going to not up for

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.949 
right now I'm just going to not up for
the<00:02:59.580> sake<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.790> ease<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.300> for<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.050> sake<00:03:01.260> of

the sake of ease and for the sake of
speed<00:03:04.489> because<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.580> know<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.790> don't<00:03:05.850> want<00:03:06.030> to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
speed because I know you don't want to

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.699 
speed because I know you don't want to
watch<00:03:06.150> me<00:03:06.360> fumbling<00:03:06.660> with<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:07.020> but<00:03:07.500> this

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
watch me fumbling with this but this

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.710 
watch me fumbling with this but this
does<00:03:07.920> go<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.730> does<00:03:08.880> get<00:03:09.060> easier<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.600> you

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
does go on and it does get easier as you

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.780 
does go on and it does get easier as you
go<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.560> first<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.160> actually<00:03:11.550> much

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
go so the first one was actually much

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.640 
go so the first one was actually much
harder<00:03:12.000> than<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.050> can<00:03:13.170> see<00:03:13.320> how<00:03:13.620> I

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
harder than this but you can see how I

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.960 
harder than this but you can see how I
tied<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.010> there<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.209> bow<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.730> this

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
tied it there then you bow it and this

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.590 
tied it there then you bow it and this
is<00:03:18.150> nice<00:03:18.360> actually<00:03:18.600> sort<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.110> wired<00:03:20.600> ribbon

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
is nice actually sort of wired ribbon

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.140 
is nice actually sort of wired ribbon
you'll<00:03:21.870> notice<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.830> wire

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
you'll notice that I like to have wire

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.699 
you'll notice that I like to have wire
in<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.390> lot<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> things<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.260> do<00:03:25.350> just

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
in a lot of the things that I do just

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.210 
in a lot of the things that I do just
because<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.980> think<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.459> has<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.970> lot<00:03:27.480> more<00:03:28.220> it

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
because I think it has a lot more it

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.190 
because I think it has a lot more it
sort<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.459> stands<00:03:29.940> up<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.750> has<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.959> lot<00:03:31.170> more

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
sort of stands up it has a lot more

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.670 
sort of stands up it has a lot more
integrity<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.870> sort<00:03:34.080> of<00:03:34.110> holds<00:03:34.320> its<00:03:34.590> form

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
integrity and it sort of holds its form

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.790 
integrity and it sort of holds its form
better<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.790> there<00:03:36.510> we<00:03:36.660> go<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:37.140> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.350> kind

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
better so there we go just going to kind

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.880 
better so there we go just going to kind
of<00:03:37.860> curl<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.190> ends<00:03:38.340> there<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.770> there<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.860> go

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
of curl the ends there and there you go

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.199 
of curl the ends there and there you go
you<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.730> layered<00:03:42.120> velvet<00:03:42.930> cupcake<00:03:43.380> a

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
you have a layered velvet cupcake a

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.790 
you have a layered velvet cupcake a
really<00:03:45.209> cute<00:03:45.360> container<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.320> if<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.650> have

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
really cute container and if you have

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.780 
really cute container and if you have
these<00:03:46.950> lined<00:03:47.250> up<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.610> table

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
these lined up on a table

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.580 
these lined up on a table
you'll<00:03:49.360> see<00:03:49.599> if<00:03:49.719> this<00:03:49.930> will<00:03:50.049> start<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.439> look

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
you'll see if this will start to look

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.209 
you'll see if this will start to look
very<00:03:50.860> very<00:03:51.400> cute<00:03:52.170> now<00:03:53.170> another<00:03:53.500> step<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.189> can

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
very very cute now another step you can

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.809 
very very cute now another step you can
take<00:03:54.400> is<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:56.200> put<00:03:56.349> a<00:03:56.379> label<00:03:56.620> on<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:56.980> front<00:03:57.310> so

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
take is to put a label on the front so

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.610 
take is to put a label on the front so
I've<00:03:57.909> made<00:03:58.090> these<00:03:58.299> labels<00:03:58.569> as<00:03:58.900> well<00:03:59.109> so<00:03:59.439> we

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
I've made these labels as well so we

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.699 
I've made these labels as well so we
have<00:03:59.739> an<00:03:59.829> oval<00:04:00.189> and<00:04:00.430> we<00:04:01.209> have<00:04:01.359> a<00:04:01.390> circle<00:04:01.900> if<00:04:02.200> you

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
have an oval and we have a circle if you

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.259 
have an oval and we have a circle if you
print<00:04:02.950> these<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.219> cardstock<00:04:03.549> you<00:04:03.909> will<00:04:04.060> have

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
print these on cardstock you will have

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.009 
print these on cardstock you will have
to<00:04:04.569> either<00:04:05.109> put<00:04:05.829> glue<00:04:06.069> dots<00:04:06.310> or<00:04:06.640> tape<00:04:07.359> to<00:04:07.810> fix

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
to either put glue dots or tape to fix
