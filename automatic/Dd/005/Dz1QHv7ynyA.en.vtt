the<00:01:45.670> day<00:01:45.880> after<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.570> one<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.990> morning<00:01:47.350> where

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
the day after this one the morning where

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.340 
the day after this one the morning where
you<00:01:47.619> work<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:49.330> get<00:01:49.509> bitten<00:01:49.780> by<00:01:49.990> one<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
you work you get bitten by one of the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.440 
you work you get bitten by one of the
animatronics<00:01:50.880> basically<00:01:51.880> because<00:01:52.180> one<00:01:52.360> of

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
animatronics basically because one of

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.570 
animatronics basically because one of
the<00:01:52.540> animatronics<00:01:53.250> while<00:01:54.250> all<00:01:54.430> the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
the animatronics while all the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.650 
the animatronics while all the
animatronics<00:01:54.880> are<00:01:55.210> linked<00:01:55.420> up<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
animatronics are linked up to the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.850 
animatronics are linked up to the
criminal<00:01:55.960> database<00:01:56.110> through<00:01:56.590> facial

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
criminal database through facial

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.779 
criminal database through facial
recognition

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
recognition

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.560 
recognition
so<00:01:58.570> therefore<00:01:59.280> if<00:02:00.280> they<00:02:00.789> see<00:02:00.850> your<00:02:01.090> face<00:02:01.300> they

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
so therefore if they see your face they

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.300 
so therefore if they see your face they
come<00:02:01.750> up<00:02:01.899> here<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.380> they're<00:02:02.920> trying<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.130> kill

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
come up here and they're trying to kill

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.460 
come up here and they're trying to kill
you<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.460> think<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.659> that's<00:02:04.930> why<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.170> have<00:02:05.350> to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
you I think so that's why you have to

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.750 
you I think so that's why you have to
put<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.740> friendly<00:02:05.979> mask<00:02:06.159> on<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.400> they<00:02:06.580> can't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
put the friendly mask on so they can't

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.940 
put the friendly mask on so they can't
see<00:02:06.880> your<00:02:06.970> face<00:02:07.180> but<00:02:07.540> tomorrow<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.530> morning

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
see your face but tomorrow the morning

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.440 
see your face but tomorrow the morning
after<00:02:09.130> this<00:02:09.310> one<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:12.640> see<00:02:13.060> your<00:02:13.209> face

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
after this one they see your face

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.449 
after this one they see your face
because<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.870> unrestricted<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:15.370> is

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
because it's unrestricted and that is

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.009 
because it's unrestricted and that is
why<00:02:15.640> where<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.390> bite<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.989> 87<00:02:17.230> happens

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
why where the bite of 87 happens

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.180 
why where the bite of 87 happens
supposedly<00:02:20.019> anyway<00:02:20.410> that's<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.830> theory<00:02:21.070> I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
supposedly anyway that's just a theory I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.380 
supposedly anyway that's just a theory I
don't<00:02:21.370> know<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.519> I'm<00:02:21.640> correct<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.209> one

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
don't know if I'm correct in that one

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.750 
don't know if I'm correct in that one
but<00:02:23.230> golden<00:02:23.680> freddy<00:02:23.890> itself<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.489> don't<00:02:24.670> know

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
but golden freddy itself I don't know

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.530 
but golden freddy itself I don't know
why<00:02:25.030> he<00:02:25.410> what<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.590> actual<00:02:27.010> purposes<00:02:27.700> if<00:02:28.239> I'm

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
why he what is actual purposes if I'm

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.380 
why he what is actual purposes if I'm

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
honest because I saw them at the ends of

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.070 
honest because I saw them at the ends of
the<00:02:31.450> hallway<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.110> one<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.190> videos<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:34.390> just

are there and it just looks at you and

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.770 
are there and it just looks at you and
if<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.250> put<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> mask<00:03:00.940> on<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.299> stuff<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.720> it

if you put a mask on and stuff and it

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.080 
if you put a mask on and stuff and it
goes<00:03:01.930> away<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:03.280> really<00:03:03.340> strange<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:03.910> don't

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
goes away it's really strange I don't

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.870 
goes away it's really strange I don't
know<00:03:04.180> why<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.040> meaning<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.579> is<00:03:06.640> I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
know why what the meaning of that is I

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.069 
know why what the meaning of that is I
don't<00:03:07.150> know<00:03:07.239> what<00:03:07.389> the<00:03:07.510> actual<00:03:07.720> meaning<00:03:07.900> of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
don't know what the actual meaning of

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.370 
don't know what the actual meaning of
the<00:03:08.290> balloon<00:03:08.530> boy<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:09.480> because

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
the balloon boy is because

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.760 
the balloon boy is because
as<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.560> known<00:03:12.570> but<00:03:13.570> also<00:03:13.780> as<00:03:14.230> always<00:03:14.350> plan<00:03:14.620> one

of<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.890> minigames<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:16.560> there's<00:03:17.560> one<00:03:17.740> way<00:03:17.770> you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
of the minigames and there's one way you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.110 
of the minigames and there's one way you
have<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.190> get<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.640> new<00:03:18.790> players<00:03:19.060> to

marionette and you have to give life to

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.410 
marionette and you have to give life to
each<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.780> animatronics<00:03:24.420> supposedly

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
each of the animatronics supposedly

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.620 
each of the animatronics supposedly
you're<00:03:25.960> injecting<00:03:26.940> children's<00:03:27.940> soul<00:03:28.330> was

into these animatronics and once its

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.480 
into these animatronics and once its
turn<00:03:31.000> golden<00:03:31.510> Freddy<00:03:31.810> appears<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:33.250> has<00:03:33.460> a

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
turn golden Freddy appears like has a

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.160 
turn golden Freddy appears like has a
little<00:03:33.820> jump<00:03:34.060> scare<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.590> don't<00:03:35.860> know<00:03:35.980> if

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
little jump scare so I don't know if

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.590 
little jump scare so I don't know if
golden<00:03:38.170> Freddy's<00:03:38.530> linked<00:03:39.160> in<00:03:39.670> with<00:03:39.730> all<00:03:40.390> this

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
golden Freddy's linked in with all this

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.690 
golden Freddy's linked in with all this
if<00:03:40.900> he's<00:03:41.110> actually<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.590> marionette<00:03:42.070> or<00:03:42.340> I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
if he's actually the marionette or I

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.360 
if he's actually the marionette or I
don't<00:03:43.660> know<00:03:43.780> it's<00:03:43.930> very<00:03:44.080> hard<00:03:44.440> very<00:03:44.770> hard<00:03:45.100> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
don't know it's very hard very hard to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.610 
don't know it's very hard very hard to
tell<00:03:45.580> it's<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:46.060> great<00:03:46.750> game<00:03:46.960> my<00:03:47.170> honesty<00:03:47.560> and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
tell it's a great game my honesty and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.520 
tell it's a great game my honesty and
great<00:03:48.220> theories<00:03:48.610> behind<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
great theories behind it and the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.170 
great theories behind it and the
newspaper<00:03:50.950> article<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.490> end<00:03:51.670> saying<00:03:51.970> how

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
newspaper article at the end saying how

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.850 
newspaper article at the end saying how
it's<00:03:52.330> going<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.510> be<00:03:52.600> closed<00:03:52.840> down<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.470> how

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
it's going to be closed down and how

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.960 
it's going to be closed down and how
they're<00:03:54.100> going<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.310> be<00:03:54.400> using<00:03:54.730> old

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
they're going to be using old

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.780 
they're going to be using old
animatronics<00:03:56.580> with<00:03:57.580> a<00:03:57.850> like<00:03:59.280> much<00:04:00.280> less<00:04:00.520> of<00:04:00.700> a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
animatronics with a like much less of a

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.050 
animatronics with a like much less of a
budget<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.630> that's<00:04:01.750> why<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:03.310> power<00:04:03.520> goes<00:04:03.850> out

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
budget so that's why the power goes out

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.270 
budget so that's why the power goes out
all<00:04:04.270> of<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.450> sudden<00:04:04.780> well<00:04:05.560> that's<00:04:05.770> why<00:04:05.920> you<00:04:05.980> use

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
all of a sudden well that's why you use

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.010 
all of a sudden well that's why you use
a<00:04:06.310> power<00:04:06.670> when<00:04:07.060> doing<00:04:07.330> stuff<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.870> whole

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
a power when doing stuff and the whole

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.020 
a power when doing stuff and the whole
building<00:04:08.200> shuts<00:04:08.500> down<00:04:08.650> in<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:08.920> first<00:04:09.130> one<00:04:09.400> so

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
building shuts down in the first one so

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.050 
building shuts down in the first one so
I<00:04:10.060> do<00:04:10.240> believe<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:10.750> this<00:04:10.930> game<00:04:11.410> is<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.680> prequel

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
I do believe that this game is a prequel

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.349 
I do believe that this game is a prequel
to<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.240> first<00:04:14.280> which<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.460> pretty<00:04:15.790> messed<00:04:16.120> up

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
to the first which is pretty messed up

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.260 
to the first which is pretty messed up
well<00:04:17.170> I<00:04:17.200> found<00:04:17.530> with<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.340> actual<00:04:18.700> strategy

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
well I found with the actual strategy

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.710 
well I found with the actual strategy
guide<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:20.230> this<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:21.580> you<00:04:22.150> get<00:04:22.390> yourself

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
guide to this is that you get yourself

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.930 
guide to this is that you get yourself
into<00:04:22.900> like<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.140> rhythm<00:04:23.470> where<00:04:23.830> first<00:04:24.610> off<00:04:24.820> I

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
into like a rhythm where first off I

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.620 
into like a rhythm where first off I
started<00:04:25.330> off<00:04:25.510> where<00:04:25.960> it's<00:04:26.650> just<00:04:27.240> foxy<00:04:28.270> at<00:04:28.480> the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
started off where it's just foxy at the

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.330 
started off where it's just foxy at the
end<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.870> hall<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.860> think<00:04:30.070> he<00:04:30.160> just

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
end of the hall so you think he just

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.920 
end of the hall so you think he just
flashed<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.640> lot<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.820> couple<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.180> times<00:04:31.360> at<00:04:31.540> him

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
flashed a lot a couple of times at him

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.500 
flashed a lot a couple of times at him
why<00:04:32.050> not<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.320> music<00:04:32.500> box<00:04:32.770> knew<00:04:33.100> fine<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:34.300> go

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
why not the music box knew fine you go

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.180 
why not the music box knew fine you go
back<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:35.050> at<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.500> very<00:04:35.590> stage<00:04:35.920> I<00:04:35.980> have<00:04:36.100> to

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
back and at the very stage I have to

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.470 
back and at the very stage I have to
worry<00:04:36.370> just<00:04:36.430> check<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:36.850> left<00:04:37.000> right<00:04:37.180> left

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480

animatronic and I don't know if and it

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.689 
animatronic and I don't know if and it
was<00:05:53.990> actually<00:05:54.289> done<00:05:54.469> that<00:05:54.680> yet<00:05:54.919> that<00:05:55.159> now
