perfectly jump at exactly above him and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.320 
perfectly jump at exactly above him and
then<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> cameras<00:00:14.910> going<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.120> do<00:00:15.240> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
then what the cameras going to do is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
then what the cameras going to do is
while<00:00:15.509> you're<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> air<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.020> gonna<00:00:16.109> try

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
while you're in the air it's gonna try

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.370 
to zoom behind you and show what's in
front<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.660> that's<00:00:18.750> bad<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.260> you

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
front of you but that's bad because you

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.750 
front of you but that's bad because you
want<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.710> below<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.340> able<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> land

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760

want to see below you to be able to land
on<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> grow<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.020> by<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> time<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.619> turn<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
on a grow so by the time you turn the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.109 
on a grow so by the time you turn the
camera<00:00:23.010> down<00:00:23.310> you're<00:00:23.550> not<00:00:23.640> gonna<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.939> much

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
camera down you're not gonna have much

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.910 
camera down you're not gonna have much
room<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> maneuver<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.350> better<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.740> hope

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
room to maneuver so you better just hope

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.500 
room to maneuver so you better just hope
you're<00:00:26.160> above<00:00:26.369> him<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.820> angled<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.269> right

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
you're above him and you angled it right

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.450 
you're above him and you angled it right
you<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.109> aimed<00:00:28.410> appropriately<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
you you know aimed appropriately and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.400 
you you know aimed appropriately and
then<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.570> got<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> try<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> aim<00:00:31.109> yourself

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
then you just got to try to aim yourself

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
then you just got to try to aim yourself
exactly<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.070> top<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> him<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> hard<00:00:33.000> cuz
