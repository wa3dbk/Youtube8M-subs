00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.100
 Hello, how are you doing today? 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.219
 I bring this nice denim skirt that 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.700
 I really loved it and it's super 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.610
 super easy to do remember that if not 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.949
 they want to make the patterns because the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.250
 can print directly from me 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.250
 Blog 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.080
 he only prints them, they cut them and they make the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 sewing procedure ok 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 I give you the two options we are going to do 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.579
 here the pattern and well what can 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 download tomorrow I will upload 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.850
 the video with the measurements and to do the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.010
 pattern of the monster high since I 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.850
 they ask of the two then I'll be 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 making the same clothes but for the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.719
 monsters and for barbie in videos 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.950
 separated then let's see how osseous ok 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.559
 let's start 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.320
 I'm going to trace a see so gu what's going to 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 to size 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.120
 5 centimeters and a half 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.630
 in the bottom 7 centimeters and 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.380
 medium 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.869
 since we made our rectangle let's 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 to mark in half what more or less 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 They are 38 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.700
 3.8 centimeters sorry 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.660
 let's trace is half until the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.420
 top part ok from the corner towards 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.010
 inside it's going to be an inch and what 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.050
 let's do on both sides 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.290
 from this corner down are two 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.650
 centimeters and a half and we mark this 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.930
 then of the centimeter that we put here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.360
 let's lower it to two 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.640
 centimeters and a half to form the curve 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.479
 and simply here 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.390
 mark this small curve simulating the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.070
 closure is more or less average means 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.890
 centimeter 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.100
 a little curve this would be our 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.270
 part of the front front for the part 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.539
 behind 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.250
 let's draw a rectangle that's going to 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:19.440
 do from here to here 3.8 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 centimeters and up the five 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.130
 points centimeters and a half equal let's 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 put a centimeter and go down to the two 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.069
 centimeters and a half and here we are going to 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.110
 add a centimeter from here to here 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.150
 because since it 's huge the patterns what 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.710
 only thing we need is to cut 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.890
 exactly to the extent that the neighbors 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.470
 for the back part that the fabric is 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.930
 against so 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.780
 so that the pieces go well ok 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.060
 I here marked with a soap for the part 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.769
 medium 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.349
 simulating the closing 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.700
 I'm going to pass a position on this side and 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.790
 over 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.140
 of what the closure is and I will own 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.140
 also by the sides 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.510
 If I stay well and also for 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.319
 this side first I make a posture 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.790
 normal and then happened over again the 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.400
 position so that it is these lists 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.180
 can do it also by hand would be a 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.489
 little more time 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.870
 because the one that follows is to make the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.609
 for the part of up here 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.609
 that will be the same means 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 hours 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.170
 same in the bottom 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.580
 here and the kitchen on all sides the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.040
 Bastilla and the top part now I'm going 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.250
 to use Velcro and have a little button 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.720
 what they have to close our skirt 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.940
 I'm going to put it on this sheet and I've already put 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.940
 on this side the green on this side and 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.130
 sewed part x 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.110
 on the one hand that was roughly 1 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.740
 centimeter and ready 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.140
 our lap and it was 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.140
 it was very easy and very simple 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.479
 let's see how it should be 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.990
 and 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.570
 but
