00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Juan Rodriguez because a report for the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.960
 diego castro calculation is not a man 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:11.429
 that was clearly that habitual position 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.049
 on a regular basis and that is not having 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.600
 problems to go to control the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.490
 match 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.490
 an authentic grant pedro leonel 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 in the right leg 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.710
 to that ball sent out by the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.349
 sea ​​and embraces that demand for the getafe 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.349
 to let freddy pass for Roberto Lake 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.850
 then how powerful that lights are 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.300
 they have seen the faces in the king's cup and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.480
 our two coaches in 30 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.489
 in the match of the first round in the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.150
 second day victory in getafe for 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.270
 the Madrid set 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.500
 along upstairs for the guard he has 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.780
 I saw little of Argentina until the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.570
 Must appear more than chin 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.740
 He was headed in completely 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.740
 only the Thai back and thong and me 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.690
 I think the ball was too high if 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.310
 we were commenting before fernando that 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.200
 if they are as we are seeing 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.510
 hitherto successful the central 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.340
 in this aerial game it will be very difficult 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.680
 that Almeria can make a goal 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.270
 because for the moment afterwards we are seeing 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.010
 clearly superior in all 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.220
 balloons hung to the players of the 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.220
 nose 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.420
 has not recovered from almería and was 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:31.600
 touching ramón thus of first 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.050
 shortened finally roberto lake brief 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.300
 using freddy silver 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.550
 I say Castro, he has left well 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.200
 sarabia the record of sarabia the opening 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.030
 of sarabia raising his head or out 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.980
 of the game I was breaking it just by 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.450
 the center by the cut of the property 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.400
 gorgeous freddy second cut out of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.040
 freddy trained too much with the 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.790
 ball the shot to transport in two 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:59.390
 times so much lack of magnificent play 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.590
 it seemed like it would have been something 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.660
 individualist freddy in that action with 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.980
 that second cut but what good saw 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.980
 back the arrival of his partner 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.810
 game time but I think the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.780
 The referee is wrong because the rope 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.700
 achievements of the player who comes is leaving x 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.079
 spectacular arabia sarabia makes it very 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.670
 well but then do and you have the 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.980
 second really you have leftover there is a line 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.079
 pass inside better than what 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.180
 I am looking for him, he did not lift his head 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.890
 it's not very good who breaks it from 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.700
 so far 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.700
 libranda from behind 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.030
 Diego Castro himself but the shot 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.170
 very potent that Julian 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.730
 cost 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.700
 Well, he had to attack her in two 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.379
 times and as I said, it gives me the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.000
 impression that the man who is going to 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.310
 to top it off is not the one that was on outside of 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.519
 game I do not think there are two three 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.580
 players of the getafense set in zone 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.740
 dangerous 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.520
 and at the end the green of an assistant 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.580
 raised the pennant 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.020
 good with the laundry now also 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.400
 there may be yellow flesh is followed 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.290
 Loading of yellow cards to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.600
 getafe third yellow card for 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.250
 the getafe that we have for the coast of 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.810
 castra average in what happens to 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.210
 fernando that you need to look for 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.790
 because he's not used to doing that 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.260
 work not to defend from there he mentioned 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.120
 it does not solve it in the best way when 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.770
 try for example now stop pears 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.630
 and langa there was another player another 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.340
 mate out there in that position but 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.740
 he goes away and makes a mistake that was 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.480
 clear and costs him the yellow cardboard 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.650
 has arrived a couple of times late 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.330
 it is doing well in general but 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.460
 sometimes speed is logical that it 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.280
 note is not usual in that position 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.020
 malone for the zeta was hurrying the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.910
 last moments of this first part 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.910
 we have already exceeded the 45 regulations 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.480
 protecting the ball to wellington silva 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.690
 wellington ball 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.159
 manet manes opening wrong way 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.180
 attention that may be the last one against 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:01.450
 for the getafe was finally Pedro 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.730
 Leonel who was pressing that 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.099
 tension through to julia poll 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.730
 and forceful also emiliano velázquez 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.489
 what danger spliced ​​the cadic ball or 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.310
 Álvaro Vázquez was down and he was 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.949
 surprise Julián costs good then 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.870
 three important opportunities by 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.419
 of the getafe at the end goes to 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.000
 I rest to see you guys, well, I'm lame 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.639
 well goes to rest with that 0 to 1 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.130
 the rhode in own holy door of 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.810
 person if he had the fortune in that action 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.669
 to set pieces of a player's mark 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.169
 of almería own door but it is true 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.699
 that the clearest occasions have 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.080
 had what we also do a 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.150
 small break right away we are with 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.590
 all of you for the moment incarnated 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.020
 this life match to inject yourself 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.050
 but will be 45 minutes bearing that 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.520
 present really exciting match 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.050
 of the round of 16 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.050
 almeria 0 getafe 1
