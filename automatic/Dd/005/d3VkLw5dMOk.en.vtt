00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.210 
Bull rock star monster they're loaded
with<00:00:43.430> what<00:00:43.790> caffeine<00:00:44.540> I<00:00:44.870> mean<00:00:45.680> yeah<00:00:45.860> they<00:00:46.040> may

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
with what caffeine I mean yeah they may

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.750 
with what caffeine I mean yeah they may
say<00:00:46.519> hey<00:00:46.699> we<00:00:47.390> got<00:00:47.570> b6<00:00:48.140> b12<00:00:48.610> sprinkled<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:49.730> little

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
say hey we got b6 b12 sprinkled a little

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.420 
say hey we got b6 b12 sprinkled a little
ginseng<00:00:50.300> or<00:00:50.690> taurine<00:00:51.110> some<00:00:51.680> even<00:00:51.949> position

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
ginseng or taurine some even position

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.939 
ginseng or taurine some even position
themselves<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:52.970> health<00:00:53.300> drinks<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.620> come<00:00:54.800> on

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
themselves as health drinks but come on

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.920 
themselves as health drinks but come on
I<00:00:55.219> mean<00:00:55.340> without<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.820> caffeine<00:00:56.000> they'd<00:00:56.690> be

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
I mean without the caffeine they'd be

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.139 
I mean without the caffeine they'd be
Hollow<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:58.250> what<00:00:58.399> happens<00:00:58.730> when<00:00:58.850> you<00:00:58.969> drink

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
Hollow so what happens when you drink

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.610 
Hollow so what happens when you drink
one<00:00:59.359> of<00:00:59.390> these<00:00:59.510> energy<00:01:00.019> drinks<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:00.500> all

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
one of these energy drinks it's all

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.439 
one of these energy drinks it's all
jacked<00:01:01.129> up<00:01:01.309> with<00:01:01.489> caffeine<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.149> you're<00:01:02.329> all

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
jacked up with caffeine and you're all

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.010 
jacked up with caffeine and you're all
jacked<00:01:02.809> up<00:01:03.729> caffeine<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.759> a<00:01:04.879> central<00:01:05.300> nervous

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
jacked up caffeine is a central nervous

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.290 
jacked up caffeine is a central nervous
system<00:01:06.500> simulator<00:01:07.070> your<00:01:07.670> body<00:01:07.880> processes

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
system simulator your body processes

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.320 
system simulator your body processes
that<00:01:08.960> like<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.560> toxin<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.729> when<00:01:10.940> it's<00:01:11.090> done

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
that like a toxin and when it's done

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.800 
that like a toxin and when it's done
processing<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.649> crash<00:01:13.330> now<00:01:14.330> if<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.600> want

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
processing it you crash now if you want

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.710 
processing it you crash now if you want
energy<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.830> lasts<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.820> doesn't<00:01:17.450> make<00:01:17.539> you

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
energy that lasts and doesn't make you

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.960 
energy that lasts and doesn't make you
crash<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:18.380> simply<00:01:18.890> have<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.190> supply<00:01:19.700> your

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
crash you simply have to supply your

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.160 
crash you simply have to supply your
body<00:01:20.030> with<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:21.170> right<00:01:21.380> types<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.100> ions<00:01:23.170> your

creates energy it's called ATP that's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.790 
creates energy it's called ATP that's
just<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.819> beginning<00:01:32.000> now<00:01:32.989> that<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:33.319> created

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
just the beginning now that it's created

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.330 
just the beginning now that it's created
it<00:01:34.039> has<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.489> be<00:01:34.640> conducted<00:01:35.770> negative<00:01:36.770> ions<00:01:37.130> or

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
it has to be conducted negative ions or

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.279 
it has to be conducted negative ions or

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
what conduct energy negative ions are

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.740 
what conduct energy negative ions are
what<00:01:42.440> conduct<00:01:42.800> energy<00:01:43.459> inside<00:01:43.970> your<00:01:44.119> body<00:01:44.300> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
what conduct energy inside your body and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.660 
what conduct energy inside your body and
when<00:01:44.989> you<00:01:45.140> load<00:01:45.590> your<00:01:45.619> body<00:01:46.099> with<00:01:46.340> negative

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
when you load your body with negative

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.499 
when you load your body with negative
ions<00:01:47.000> it's<00:01:47.569> like<00:01:47.840> turning<00:01:48.619> on<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.920> power<00:01:49.160> switch

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
ions it's like turning on a power switch

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.419 
ions it's like turning on a power switch
now<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.569> opposite<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.319> also<00:01:51.440> true<00:01:51.679> when<00:01:52.369> you

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
now the opposite is also true when you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.089 
now the opposite is also true when you
have<00:01:52.640> too<00:01:52.879> many<00:01:53.000> positive<00:01:53.660> charges<00:01:54.020> or<00:01:54.319> not

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
have too many positive charges or not

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.029 
have too many positive charges or not
enough<00:01:55.369> negative<00:01:56.030> ions<00:01:56.629> in<00:01:56.810> your<00:01:56.929> body<00:01:57.140> you're

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
enough negative ions in your body you're

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.010 
enough negative ions in your body you're
going<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.250> feel<00:01:58.429> tired<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.149> that's<00:01:59.840> what

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
going to feel tired and that's what

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.930 
going to feel tired and that's what
these<00:02:00.170> energy<00:02:00.830> drinks<00:02:00.860> are<00:02:01.369> they're<00:02:01.580> loaded

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
these energy drinks are they're loaded

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.570 
these energy drinks are they're loaded

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
when the caffeine wears out you crash

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.550 
when the caffeine wears out you crash
let<00:02:07.489> me<00:02:07.580> demonstrate<00:02:07.789> in<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.869> amp<00:02:09.080> challenge

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
let me demonstrate in the amp challenge

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.199 
let me demonstrate in the amp challenge
video<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:10.190> compared<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.700> lot<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.970> different

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
video we compared a lot of different

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.540 
video we compared a lot of different
waters<00:02:11.569> for<00:02:11.840> their<00:02:11.959> conductivity<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.040> their

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
waters for their conductivity and their

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.809 
waters for their conductivity and their
pH<00:02:13.879> and<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:14.989> learned<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.860> ph<00:02:16.220> booster

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
pH and we learned the ph booster

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.770 
pH and we learned the ph booster
literally<00:02:17.569> recharges<00:02:18.500> your<00:02:18.739> water<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.340> your

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
literally recharges your water and your

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.210 
literally recharges your water and your
body<00:02:20.780> well<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.530> want<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.860> take<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.190> step

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
body well I want to take it a step

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.490 
body well I want to take it a step
further<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.910> show<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.239> what<00:02:23.450> happens<00:02:23.840> when

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
further and show you what happens when

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.080 
further and show you what happens when
you<00:02:24.739> partake<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.640> pH<00:02:26.060> ion<00:02:26.750> energy<00:02:27.080> drink
