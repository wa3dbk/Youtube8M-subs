00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.680
 how about re very good night and roberto 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:07.200
 this one avoided a message that you posted on 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.179
 these days on facebook and good I wanted 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.759
 put your hand there so they can 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.379
 play the song of the redeemed this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.929
 I'll explain more or less the song 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.600
 is in D major the chord that we are going to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.820
 occupy is re f 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.590
 next agreed it will be lower if re fa 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.630
 sustained 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:36.460
 next I agreed return to D major 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.460
 we already have it we go to a greater sun 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.980
 and we end up in D major are older are 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.510
 close then first part I'm going to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.280
 do with and with left also because 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.180
 is there is an important part of the low in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:55.340
 the left I'm saying the letter would be 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.880
 nothing is like your love re major nothing like 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.450
 you have no minor 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.180
 so you can know here is the part 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.680
 that I was telling you about the left is re 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.120
 greater on the right but the left is 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.490
 very important that the bass do it with 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.530
 F sharp for that harmony are a 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.880
 little more complete just an ornament 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:21.050
 let's say I go to sun greater sun close the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.640
 salvation that is in your master and ended in 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.250
 let's say that this is the first 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.100
 part ok what follows is practically 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.650
 the same with a small variant 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.830
 begins the same with you the eternity of 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.509
 older with you I will always walk if younger 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.790
 here comes the variant now I'm going to a the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:46.360
 greater there is no other love equal 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.420
 to the C held to me the greatest 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.250
 I go again equal to sun author of 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.870
 life author of faith greater re practically 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.970
 those two parties are equal nothing else 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.400
 has the variation of the greatest the 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.770
 second time I'm going to a little 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.720
 bridge the redeemed will sing praise 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.720
 offers praise to our king he is 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.010
 our faith we would enter that part of the sun 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:17.060
 greater the redeemed will sing 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.330
 praise our king the greatest he is 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.170
 our faith comes the greater re again 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.170
 with low in F sharp 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.400
 makes an ornament in B minor if rev has 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:35.240
 sustained and repeats the redeemed 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:39.520
 will sing sun greater praise our king 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.450
 the greater that would be the bridge nothing else ok 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.500
 continues what would be a 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.320
 let's say the chorus 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.980
 we sing you glorious sir you saved us 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.980
 begins in D major that part of singing 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.580
 Senior sun buoy 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.030
 you saved us the most 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:15.320
 then honor and power if minor of bach 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.140
 they are again sun the older the father the 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.790
 higher 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.040
 he is a minor right now I am 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.130
 touching in the inversion the normal 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.000
 would be my sun if for comfort I touch 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.760
 they are me but it is the same chord 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.760
 my youngest is the answer 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.410
 if minor he is the answer and ends in 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.540
 greater sun 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.730
 and practically that's the whole song 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.310
 then repeat come with fire and with power 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.960
 is the first part if I was going to return 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.870
 again to the bridge of the redeemed 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.570
 they will sing praise to our king and come 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.760
 to the choir and finally the last one 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.440
 section is the part of redeemed you 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:10.130
 we sing you are holy the saint is 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.130
 redeemed if less 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.639
 we sing you re major with the bass in fa 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.750
 sharp left 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.450
 you are holy are less 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.860
 I still salt less salt majors at the close of 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.700
 holy and repeat and I repeat is the theme 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.100
 network section 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.090
 if minor the truth yes minor 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.810
 two 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.190
 you 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.190
 you are holy 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:49.879
 and well it's practically the whole song 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.949
 the buoy hum a little so that the 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.760
 listen from the beginning to make it a 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.850
 idea re major 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.850
 nothing is like your soul 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.110
 nothing 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.110
 what 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:15.949
 so you can know 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:20.240
 it is the salvation that is in your love 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:23.240
 repeat with the variant next to you the 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240
 eternity 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.360
 with you always walk 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.830
 do not 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.830
 and another is to die 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.110
 in thorax due to cuts 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:48.289
 bridge the redeemed will sing as they advance 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:51.520
 our 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.520
 it's ours 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:02.900
 it was from my two to sing praise our 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:07.729
 they sing to you 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:12.529
 his lord saves us 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:19.359
 power majesty to father 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:19.359

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:29.480
 and from there he will repeat the song and 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:31.750
 last the redeemed network

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.250
 of the repetitions those that are of 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.250
