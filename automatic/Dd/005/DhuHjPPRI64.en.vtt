from agriculture to hydroelectric power
we<00:01:00.710> use<00:01:00.740> water<00:01:01.310> in<00:01:01.850> a<00:01:01.970> million<00:01:02.510> different<00:01:02.780> ways

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.399 

it<00:01:07.829> acts<00:01:08.189> outside<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:09.210> known<00:01:09.509> physical<00:01:10.170> laws

of<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.090> amazing<00:01:15.539> element<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> what<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.960> did

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of this amazing element so what we did

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.139 
of this amazing element so what we did
was<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:24.020> always<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.039> do<00:01:26.700> very

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
was what we always do you do very

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.279 
was what we always do you do very
careful<00:01:28.110> work<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.130> narrow<00:01:29.460> field<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.140> we

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
careful work in a narrow field so we

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.940 
careful work in a narrow field so we
said<00:01:31.530> let<00:01:31.770> us<00:01:31.799> focus<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.759> water<00:01:33.590> but<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.740> will

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
said let us focus on water but we will

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.850 
said let us focus on water but we will
look<00:01:35.189> at<00:01:35.399> it<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:36.119> many<00:01:36.479> angles<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.500> else<00:01:37.710> we

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
look at it from many angles what else we

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.279 
look at it from many angles what else we
