00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
before this is how it works I have built

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.890 
before this is how it works I have built
and<00:00:38.440> set<00:00:38.770> up<00:00:38.920> this<00:00:39.370> Jeep<00:00:39.820> Wrangler<00:00:40.450> with

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
and set up this Jeep Wrangler with

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.290 
and set up this Jeep Wrangler with
rather<00:00:41.770> odd<00:00:42.070> suspension<00:00:42.880> is<00:00:42.970> probably<00:00:43.210> the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
rather odd suspension is probably the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.570 
rather odd suspension is probably the
fairest<00:00:43.690> way<00:00:43.840> but<00:00:44.350> very<00:00:44.380> hard<00:00:44.770> suspension<00:00:45.010> is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
fairest way but very hard suspension is

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.270

watched them studied it very precisely
and<00:01:24.610> saw<00:01:25.299> that<00:01:25.600> my<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.020> was<00:01:26.409> gonna<00:01:26.530> have<00:01:26.740> no

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
and saw that my I was gonna have no

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.399 
and saw that my I was gonna have no
chance<00:01:27.130> whatsoever<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:29.049> did<00:01:29.170> your<00:01:29.290> research

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
chance whatsoever you did your research

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.170 
chance whatsoever you did your research
then<00:01:29.890> before<00:01:30.310> I<00:01:30.670> did<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.390> took<00:01:31.630> notes<00:01:33.030> made<00:01:34.030> sure

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
then before I did I took notes made sure

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.000 
then before I did I took notes made sure
to<00:01:34.210> get<00:01:34.390> every<00:01:34.659> corners<00:01:35.049> line<00:01:35.229> exactly<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
to get every corners line exactly and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.149 
to get every corners line exactly and
and<00:01:36.280> none<00:01:36.700> of<00:01:36.729> that<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.920> cars

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
and none of that because the cars

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.030 
and none of that because the cars
absolutely<00:01:40.150> I<00:01:41.080> don't<00:01:41.500> know<00:01:41.560> what<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.860> like

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
absolutely I don't know what it is like

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.760 
absolutely I don't know what it is like
it's<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:43.270> think<00:01:43.510> it's<00:01:43.720> on<00:01:43.780> drag<00:01:44.080> tires<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.680> like

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
it's I think it's on drag tires and like

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.469 
it's I think it's on drag tires and like
the<00:01:44.860> suspension<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:45.430> really<00:01:45.640> soft<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.030> bounces

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the suspension is really soft it bounces

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.840 
the suspension is really soft it bounces
everywhere<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.170> then<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.710> think<00:01:48.220> on<00:01:48.340> direct<00:01:48.670> us

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
everywhere and then I think on direct us

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.480 
everywhere and then I think on direct us
know<00:01:49.540> in<00:01:50.080> my<00:01:50.200> film<00:01:50.439> race<00:01:50.619> I<00:01:50.770> can't<00:01:51.159> even<00:01:51.310> I

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
know in my film race I can't even I

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.160 
know in my film race I can't even I
built<00:01:51.760> this<00:01:51.880> car<00:01:52.060> in<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.240> car<00:01:52.420> I'm<00:01:52.570> always<00:01:52.750> on<00:01:52.960> I

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
built this car in a car I'm always on I

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.289 
built this car in a car I'm always on I
think<00:01:53.290> it's<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.680> racing<00:01:54.040> tires<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.520> anyway

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
think it's on racing tires and anyway

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.280 
think it's on racing tires and anyway
this<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.659> probably<00:01:55.960> one<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.170> most

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
this is probably one of the most

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.649 
this is probably one of the most
impressive<00:01:56.650> corners<00:01:57.159> I've<00:01:57.280> seen<00:01:57.520> yet<00:01:57.729> from

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
impressive corners I've seen yet from

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.929 
impressive corners I've seen yet from
anyone<00:01:59.020> driving<00:01:59.439> that<00:01:59.560> car<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.979> have<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> feeling

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
anyone driving that car I have a feeling

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.330 
anyone driving that car I have a feeling
that<00:02:01.090> probably<00:02:01.240> wasn't<00:02:01.630> intentional<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.560> I

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
that probably wasn't intentional and I

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.640 
that probably wasn't intentional and I
don't<00:02:03.729> think<00:02:03.850> anything<00:02:04.509> in<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:04.780> was

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
don't think anything in this was

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.040 
don't think anything in this was
intentional

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
intentional

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.410 
intentional
yeah<00:02:07.430> that's<00:02:08.430> fair<00:02:08.670> enough<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.240> you've

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
yeah that's fair enough so you've

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
yeah that's fair enough so you've
managed<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.870> get<00:02:10.050> about<00:02:10.620> a<00:02:10.680> lap<00:02:11.190> out<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.520> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
managed to get about a lap out of it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.680 
managed to get about a lap out of it
before<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.390> flipped<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:14.300> well<00:02:15.300> done<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.630> got

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
before it flipped so well done you got

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.390 
before it flipped so well done you got
further<00:02:15.930> than<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.200> Tomcat<00:02:16.530> did<00:02:16.740> before<00:02:17.280> you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
further than the Tomcat did before you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.350 
further than the Tomcat did before you
rolled<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.760> yes<00:02:18.890> it's<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.460> for<00:02:21.150> those<00:02:21.270> of

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
rolled it yes it's this is for those of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.220 
rolled it yes it's this is for those of
you<00:02:21.420> haven't<00:02:21.570> seen<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.780> before<00:02:21.840> again

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
you haven't seen this before again

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.620 
you haven't seen this before again
basically<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.270> remember<00:02:24.270> which<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
basically the remember which way on the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.210 
basically the remember which way on the
suspension<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.650> those<00:02:25.740> engines<00:02:25.980> is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
suspension is one of those engines is

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.980 
suspension is one of those engines is
really<00:02:26.460> softened<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> front<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.600> backs

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
really softened in the front the backs

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.270 
really softened in the front the backs
reefs<00:02:28.260> off<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> front<00:02:28.740> spruce<00:02:28.920> tip<00:02:29.130> which

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
reefs off the front spruce tip which

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.710 
reefs off the front spruce tip which
means<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.610> almost<00:02:29.790> perfectly<00:02:30.300> got<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> wheel

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
means it's almost perfectly got a wheel

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.630 
means it's almost perfectly got a wheel
in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> air<00:02:31.050> yeah<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.830> front<00:02:31.980> wheels<00:02:32.250> go<00:02:32.430> in

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
in the air yeah the front wheels go in

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.510 
in the air yeah the front wheels go in
the<00:02:32.730> air<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.810> can't<00:02:34.140> turn<00:02:34.410> yeah<00:02:35.220> every

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
the air and you can't turn yeah every

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.770 
the air and you can't turn yeah every
time<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> go<00:02:35.790> around<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> corner<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.420> does<00:02:36.570> that

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
time you go around a corner it does that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.930 
time you go around a corner it does that
that's<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.140> very<00:02:37.380> impressive<00:02:37.620> roll<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.190> mainly

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that's a very impressive roll and mainly

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.970 
that's a very impressive roll and mainly
Panos<00:02:39.300> knows<00:02:42.470> what<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> game<00:02:43.770> would<00:02:43.950> have

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
Panos knows what the game would have

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.970 
Panos knows what the game would have
done<00:02:47.960> never<00:02:48.960> seen<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.230> happen<00:02:49.260> before<00:02:49.440> you

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
done never seen it happen before you

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.470 
done never seen it happen before you
decide<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.520> go<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.700> take<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.940> cameraman<00:02:51.300> out

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
decide to go and take the cameraman out

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.850 
decide to go and take the cameraman out
look<00:02:51.690> out<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:54.270> then<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> wheelie<00:02:54.860> impressive

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
look out and then a wheelie impressive

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.210 
look out and then a wheelie impressive
really<00:02:56.690> really<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.530> think<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.860> cameraman

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
really really and I think the cameraman

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.960 
really really and I think the cameraman
might<00:02:59.460> have<00:02:59.610> had<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> little<00:02:59.910> poo<00:03:00.210> there

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
might have had a little poo there

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.030 
might have had a little poo there
clubbing<00:03:02.970> clothes<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:04.470> yeah<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.770> can<00:03:04.860> see

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
clubbing clothes and so yeah you can see

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.720 
clubbing clothes and so yeah you can see
this<00:03:05.250> car<00:03:05.460> is<00:03:05.670> pretty<00:03:06.570> insane<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:08.160> try<00:03:08.580> and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
this car is pretty insane to try and

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.700 
this car is pretty insane to try and
keep<00:03:08.850> under<00:03:09.150> control<00:03:09.270> you<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.410> for<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.590> get

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
keep under control you go for the get

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.199 
keep under control you go for the get
the<00:03:10.770> sliding<00:03:11.040> technique<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.580> well<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.790> see<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
the sliding technique as well I see I

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.240 
the sliding technique as well I see I
was<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:13.050> was<00:03:13.080> hand<00:03:13.500> breaking<00:03:13.860> around<00:03:14.070> some<00:03:14.220> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
was I was hand breaking around some of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.460 
was I was hand breaking around some of
the<00:03:14.370> coroner's<00:03:14.750> realized<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:16.020> didn't<00:03:16.320> work

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
the coroner's realized that didn't work

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.670 
the coroner's realized that didn't work
so<00:03:16.739> my<00:03:17.160> next<00:03:17.610> strategy<00:03:17.730> was<00:03:18.570> slow<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.380> steady

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
so my next strategy was slow and steady

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.370 
so my next strategy was slow and steady
it's<00:03:20.400> sort<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.760> work<00:03:20.940> who's<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.780> when<00:03:22.260> you

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
it's sort of work who's like when you

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.440 
it's sort of work who's like when you
drive<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.130> break<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.820> then<00:03:24.360> you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
drive this and you break and then you

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.340 
drive this and you break and then you
turn<00:03:25.220> your<00:03:26.220> wheel<00:03:26.610> lifts<00:03:26.910> off<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> ground<00:03:27.360> so

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
turn your wheel lifts off the ground so

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.840 
turn your wheel lifts off the ground so
your<00:03:28.500> car<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.739> not<00:03:28.950> slowing<00:03:29.190> down<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.580> much<00:03:29.670> as

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
your car is not slowing down as much as

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.449 
your car is not slowing down as much as
it<00:03:29.970> should<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:31.020> also<00:03:31.170> not<00:03:31.440> turning<00:03:31.890> so

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
it should and it's also not turning so

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.180 
it should and it's also not turning so
you're<00:03:33.300> going<00:03:33.540> into<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> wall<00:03:34.070> regardless<00:03:35.070> of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
you're going into the wall regardless of

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.770 
you're going into the wall regardless of
what<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.430> do<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:36.030> was<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:36.390> trying<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.690> take

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
what you do so I was just trying to take

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.430 
what you do so I was just trying to take
it<00:03:36.840> slow<00:03:36.959> into<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> corners<00:03:38.390> after<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.810> but

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
it slow into the corners after that but

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.120 
it slow into the corners after that but
still<00:03:41.690> insanely<00:03:42.690> hard<00:03:42.959> car<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.620> know<00:03:43.680> what

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
still insanely hard car I know what

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
speed you're going yeah there's been a

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.860 
speed you're going yeah there's been a
few<00:03:46.920> different<00:03:47.250> times<00:03:47.400> except<00:03:47.790> personally<00:03:48.570> my

few different times except personally my

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.570 
few different times except personally my
preference<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.709> 180<00:03:50.070> kind<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.520> to

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
preference for this 180 kind of have to

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.190 
preference for this 180 kind of have to
take<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.910> little<00:03:51.120> it's<00:03:51.209> like<00:03:51.420> sure<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.050> are

not<00:03:53.550> as<00:03:53.760> fast<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.480> kind<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.930> regain<00:03:55.140> a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
not as fast but you kind of regain a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.170 
not as fast but you kind of regain a
little<00:03:55.320> control<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:55.860> can<00:03:55.980> see<00:03:56.130> here<00:03:56.370> when

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
little control you can see here when

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.310 
little control you can see here when
you're<00:03:57.300> not<00:03:57.330> sliding<00:03:57.660> through<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.080> corner

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
you're not sliding through that corner

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.960 
you're not sliding through that corner
you<00:03:58.440> can<00:03:58.650> just<00:03:59.010> about<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.310> key<00:03:59.489> under<00:03:59.640> control

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
you can just about a key under control

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.630 
you can just about a key under control
and<00:04:00.330> even<00:04:00.450> then<00:04:00.720> at<00:04:00.900> slow<00:04:01.260> speeds<00:04:01.590> also<00:04:02.340> notice

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
and even then at slow speeds also notice

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.059 
and even then at slow speeds also notice
you<00:04:02.670> are<00:04:02.880> using<00:04:03.120> higher<00:04:03.390> gears<00:04:03.690> as<00:04:03.840> well

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
you are using higher gears as well

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.679 
you are using higher gears as well
points<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.610> try<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:05.909> stop<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.360> wheel<00:04:06.510> spin

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
points to try and stop the wheel spin

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.899 
points to try and stop the wheel spin
and<00:04:06.810> stuff<00:04:06.959> even<00:04:07.200> then<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.189> can<00:04:08.310> see<00:04:08.549> how<00:04:08.730> much

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
and stuff even then you can see how much

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
start and another fairly large jump over

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.080 
start and another fairly large jump over
there<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.680> have<00:05:19.979> to<00:05:20.159> say<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.340> reckon<00:05:20.729> this<00:05:20.880> bit

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
there I have to say I reckon this bit

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.520 
there I have to say I reckon this bit
down<00:05:21.210> here<00:05:21.479> is<00:05:21.570> probably<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.990> tribute<00:05:22.289> of<00:05:22.440> the

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
down here is probably the tribute of the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.040 
down here is probably the tribute of the
entire<00:05:22.800> track<00:05:23.099> it<00:05:23.789> gets<00:05:24.240> really<00:05:24.599> bouncy

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
entire track it gets really bouncy

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.480 
entire track it gets really bouncy
there's<00:05:25.229> like<00:05:25.349> little<00:05:25.530> little<00:05:25.919> bounces<00:05:26.400> in

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
there's like little little bounces in

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.250 
there's like little little bounces in
the<00:05:26.550> road<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:26.760> wouldn't<00:05:27.060> usually<00:05:27.210> notice<00:05:27.720> but

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
the road you wouldn't usually notice but

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.469 
the road you wouldn't usually notice but
when<00:05:28.409> you're<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.770> oh<00:05:29.039> yeah<00:05:29.789> you<00:05:30.180> notice

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
when you're in this oh yeah you notice

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.540 
when you're in this oh yeah you notice
them<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:30.900> you're<00:05:31.080> going<00:05:31.470> up<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.800> down<00:05:31.889> you

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
them and you're going up and down you

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.279 
them and you're going up and down you
notice<00:05:33.030> every<00:05:33.360> little<00:05:33.570> bump<00:05:33.659> in<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.810> road<00:05:33.870> you

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
notice every little bump in the road you

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.719 
notice every little bump in the road you
decide<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:34.979> go<00:05:35.099> for<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.250> slow<00:05:35.520> and<00:05:35.669> steady

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
decide to go for the slow and steady

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.670 
decide to go for the slow and steady
technique<00:05:36.510> around<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.930> long<00:05:37.139> corner<00:05:37.500> rather

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
technique around that long corner rather

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.409 
technique around that long corner rather
than<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.919> sideways<00:05:38.340> one<00:05:38.580> which<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.270> would

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
than the sideways one which I would

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.760 
than the sideways one which I would
still<00:05:39.690> maintain<00:05:39.870> is<00:05:40.169> probably<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.470> little<00:05:40.620> bit

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
still maintain is probably a little bit

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.040 
still maintain is probably a little bit
faster<00:05:41.280> but<00:05:41.970> it<00:05:42.120> camp<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.449> can<00:05:42.479> actually<00:05:42.930> have

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
faster but it camp you can actually have

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.170 
faster but it camp you can actually have
the<00:05:43.169> car<00:05:43.199> keys<00:05:43.380> stairs<00:05:43.770> or<00:05:43.979> too<00:05:44.250> much<00:05:44.460> it<00:05:44.880> will

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
the car keys stairs or too much it will

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.640 
the car keys stairs or too much it will
eventually<00:05:45.419> roll<00:05:45.810> over<00:05:46.050> on<00:05:46.139> his<00:05:46.260> own<00:05:46.349> accord

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
eventually roll over on his own accord

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.430 
eventually roll over on his own accord
no<00:05:47.520> part<00:05:47.729> of<00:05:47.760> his<00:05:47.909> own<00:05:48.030> but<00:05:48.510> that<00:05:48.840> was<00:05:49.050> again<00:05:49.320> of

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
no part of his own but that was again of

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.960 
no part of his own but that was again of
really<00:05:49.770> quite<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.039> big<00:05:50.250> wheelie<00:05:50.460> over<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:50.849> top

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
really quite a big wheelie over the top

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.730 
really quite a big wheelie over the top
of<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.120> hill<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.479> my<00:05:51.990> gosh<00:05:52.139> into<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.530> wall

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
of the hill and my gosh into that wall

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.710 
of the hill and my gosh into that wall
yeah<00:05:53.460> good<00:05:54.360> name<00:05:54.539> that<00:05:54.720> a<00:05:54.900> r-12<00:05:55.380> wall<00:05:55.710> down

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
yeah good name that a r-12 wall down

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.330 
yeah good name that a r-12 wall down
pretty<00:05:58.230> sure<00:05:58.380> you<00:05:58.530> found<00:05:58.740> out<00:05:58.890> most<00:05:59.010> laps

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
pretty sure you found out most laps

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.330 
pretty sure you found out most laps
again<00:06:00.060> through<00:06:00.390> here<00:06:00.570> this<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:01.050> not<00:06:01.770> too<00:06:02.310> bad

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
again through here this is not too bad

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.880 
again through here this is not too bad
around<00:06:03.330> here<00:06:03.480> some<00:06:03.750> not<00:06:03.900> as<00:06:03.990> bumpy<00:06:04.170> through

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
around here some not as bumpy through

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.770 
around here some not as bumpy through
this<00:06:04.980> section<00:06:05.280> it's<00:06:05.850> slightly<00:06:06.240> cambered

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
this section it's slightly cambered

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.330 
this section it's slightly cambered
which<00:06:07.050> can<00:06:07.260> kind<00:06:07.470> of<00:06:07.530> cash<00:06:07.680> cars<00:06:07.980> out<00:06:08.100> a<00:06:08.130> little

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
which can kind of cash cars out a little

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.580 
which can kind of cash cars out a little
bit<00:06:08.550> but<00:06:09.030> it's<00:06:09.390> not<00:06:09.420> -<00:06:09.720> not<00:06:09.960> too<00:06:10.170> bad

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
bit but it's not - not too bad

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.440 
bit but it's not - not too bad
this<00:06:10.770> we're<00:06:10.950> here<00:06:11.130> again<00:06:11.250> it<00:06:11.550> goes<00:06:11.610> over<00:06:12.330> a

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
this we're here again it goes over a

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.880 
this we're here again it goes over a
crest<00:06:12.630> of<00:06:12.780> a<00:06:12.840> hill<00:06:12.870> can<00:06:13.350> get<00:06:13.500> a<00:06:13.530> little<00:06:13.680> bit<00:06:13.830> of

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
crest of a hill can get a little bit of

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.060 
crest of a hill can get a little bit of
a<00:06:13.920> nasty<00:06:14.100> bump<00:06:14.370> as<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.640> found<00:06:14.850> there<00:06:15.090> yeah<00:06:16.070> at

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
a nasty bump as you found there yeah at

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.590 
a nasty bump as you found there yeah at
the<00:06:17.190> tail<00:06:17.430> in<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.670> air<00:06:17.760> that<00:06:17.880> is<00:06:18.240> a<00:06:18.300> new<00:06:18.480> one

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
the tail in the air that is a new one

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.050 
the tail in the air that is a new one
and<00:06:18.810> it's<00:06:19.230> around<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.890> final<00:06:20.190> corner<00:06:20.370> they

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
and it's around the final corner they

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.300 
and it's around the final corner they
can<00:06:21.180> help<00:06:21.480> you<00:06:21.690> knowit's<00:06:22.140> yeah<00:06:22.800> all<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.130> cones

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
can help you knowit's yeah all the cones

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.500 
can help you knowit's yeah all the cones
are<00:06:23.460> gone<00:06:23.580> all<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:23.850> boards<00:06:24.120> are<00:06:24.210> gone

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
are gone all the boards are gone

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.700 
are gone all the boards are gone
don't<00:06:24.870> worry<00:06:25.020> didn't<00:06:25.230> have<00:06:25.320> to<00:06:25.410> pick<00:06:25.500> them<00:06:25.620> up

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
don't worry didn't have to pick them up

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.520 
don't worry didn't have to pick them up
and<00:06:25.920> there<00:06:26.400> we<00:06:26.490> go<00:06:26.670> you<00:06:27.300> are<00:06:27.330> across<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.930> line

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
and there we go you are across the line

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.980 
and there we go you are across the line
so<00:06:29.460> how<00:06:30.060> do<00:06:30.120> you<00:06:30.210> think<00:06:30.330> my<00:06:30.450> lap<00:06:30.600> went<00:06:30.780> it<00:06:30.900> look

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
so how do you think my lap went it look

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.820 
so how do you think my lap went it look
pretty<00:06:31.200> good<00:06:31.320> actually

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
pretty good actually

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.560 
pretty good actually
I<00:06:31.860> think<00:06:32.250> it<00:06:32.310> went<00:06:32.400> pretty<00:06:32.490> well<00:06:32.700> but<00:06:33.330> I<00:06:33.360> did

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
I think it went pretty well but I did

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.390 
I think it went pretty well but I did
use<00:06:33.750> a<00:06:33.780> slow<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.170> steady<00:06:34.320> technique<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:35.190> it's

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
use a slow and steady technique and it's

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.810 
use a slow and steady technique and it's
very<00:06:35.910> interesting<00:06:36.560> what<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.590> think<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:37.830> got<00:06:38.010> well

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
very interesting what I think I got well

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.520 
very interesting what I think I got well
the<00:06:39.270> lap<00:06:39.540> time<00:06:39.840> for<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.560> r12<00:06:41.040> gaming<00:06:41.460> is<00:06:41.580> a<00:06:41.610> one

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
the lap time for a r12 gaming is a one

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.290 
the lap time for a r12 gaming is a one
23.2<00:06:43.530> which<00:06:44.160> puts<00:06:44.460> you<00:06:44.580> in<00:06:44.700> first<00:06:44.940> on<00:06:45.270> our

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
23.2 which puts you in first on our

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.150 
23.2 which puts you in first on our
leaderboard<00:06:45.720> we<00:06:46.080> have<00:06:46.230> a<00:06:46.260> new<00:06:46.440> leader<00:06:46.650> that's

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
leaderboard we have a new leader that's

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.730 
leaderboard we have a new leader that's
epic<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:48.060> really<00:06:48.960> don't<00:06:49.110> think<00:06:49.170> that<00:06:49.350> will<00:06:49.560> last

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
epic I really don't think that will last

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.970 
epic I really don't think that will last
very<00:06:50.040> long<00:06:50.280> but<00:06:50.850> I<00:06:51.480> have<00:06:52.380> to<00:06:52.440> say<00:06:52.560> I<00:06:52.710> think<00:06:52.770> the

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
very long but I have to say I think the

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.710 
very long but I have to say I think the
slowest<00:06:53.340> Eddy<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.910> technique<00:06:54.270> is<00:06:54.420> the<00:06:54.540> way<00:06:54.660> to

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
slowest Eddy the technique is the way to

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.080 
slowest Eddy the technique is the way to
go<00:06:54.930> I<00:06:55.380> think<00:06:55.620> so<00:06:56.040> that<00:06:56.730> is<00:06:56.850> a<00:06:56.880> pretty

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
go I think so that is a pretty

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.870 
go I think so that is a pretty
impressive<00:06:57.360> lap<00:06:57.690> time<00:06:58.280> admittedly<00:06:59.280> even<00:06:59.790> with

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
impressive lap time admittedly even with

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880 
impressive lap time admittedly even with
a<00:06:59.910> crash<00:07:00.150> into<00:07:00.360> the<00:07:00.450> wall<00:07:00.630> and<00:07:00.870> if<00:07:01.470> a<00:07:01.560> couple
