water resistant but like they're not a
full<00:00:54.989> specification<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.979> submerge

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
full specification so you can submerge

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.569

what's inside my fan box just watch

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.470 
what's inside my fan box just watch
wasn't<00:01:24.600> coming<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.840> easily<00:01:25.050> a<00:01:26.780> bit<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:29.480> so

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
wasn't coming out easily a bit up so

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.460 
wasn't coming out easily a bit up so
first<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> back

first the back

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.060 
first the back
that's<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.130> Quick<00:01:32.310> Start<00:01:32.580> manual<00:01:33.740> in<00:01:34.740> English

that's the Quick Start manual in English
I<00:01:35.540> believe<00:01:36.540> languages<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:38.010> we<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.590> USB

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
I believe languages then we have the USB

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.250 
I believe languages then we have the USB
cable<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.520> docking<00:01:41.970> clip<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:43.020> clocking

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
cable and docking clip just clocking

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.960 
cable and docking clip just clocking
clip<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:43.740> different<00:01:44.100> size<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.670> smaller

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
clip is different size to the smaller

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.360 
clip is different size to the smaller
watches<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.260> you've<00:01:46.380> got<00:01:46.530> two<00:01:46.770> watches<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
watches so if you've got two watches you

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.560 
watches so if you've got two watches you
