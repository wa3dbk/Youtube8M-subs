you<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.030> either<00:02:30.120> cut<00:02:30.420> them<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.690> half<00:02:30.900> or<00:02:31.110> if

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
you can either cut them in half or if

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.660 
you can either cut them in half or if
they're<00:02:31.410> large<00:02:31.650> cut<00:02:32.130> them<00:02:32.280> again<00:02:32.489> into

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
they're large cut them again into

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.300 
they're large cut them again into
quarters<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.930> think<00:02:34.170> Hef's<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:35.040> fine

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
quarters but I think Hef's is just fine

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.770 
quarters but I think Hef's is just fine
for<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:40.549> now<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.670> sweeten<00:02:42.209> these<00:02:42.360> berries

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
for this now to sweeten these berries

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.940 
for this now to sweeten these berries
because<00:02:43.110> sometimes<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:43.650> could<00:02:43.830> be<00:02:43.920> very

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
because sometimes they could be very

ok and then just give it a nice toss
just<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.180> get<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.200> cornstarch<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:29.220> start<00:03:29.489> to

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
just to get that cornstarch to start to

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.949 
just to get that cornstarch to start to
dissolve<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> little<00:03:30.450> bit<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.690> sugar

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
dissolve and a little bit of that sugar

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.800 
dissolve and a little bit of that sugar
to<00:03:31.200> dissolve<00:03:31.940> now<00:03:32.940> I'll<00:03:33.030> let<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.299> macerate

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
to dissolve now I'll let that macerate

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.180 
to dissolve now I'll let that macerate
while<00:03:33.989> we<00:03:34.140> roll<00:03:34.319> out<00:03:34.470> our<00:03:34.500> dough<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:34.890> then

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
while we roll out our dough and then

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.590 
while we roll out our dough and then
I'll<00:03:35.310> come<00:03:35.519> back<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.880> give<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.060> another<00:03:36.180> toss

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
I'll come back and give it another toss

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.039 
I'll come back and give it another toss
later<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:38.340> on<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.609> nice<00:03:39.359> flat<00:03:39.810> surface

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
later so then on a nice flat surface

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.699 
later so then on a nice flat surface
just<00:03:40.739> sprinkle<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.370> little<00:03:41.670> bit<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:42.120> flour<00:03:42.709> and

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
just sprinkle a little bit of flour and

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.440 
just sprinkle a little bit of flour and
we're<00:03:43.829> going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.069> make<00:03:44.280> 6<00:03:44.670> at<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.850> time<00:03:45.150> because

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
we're going to make 6 at a time because

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.099 
we're going to make 6 at a time because
it's<00:03:45.750> easier<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.200> handle<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.750> want<00:03:48.989> to

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
it's easier to handle and you want to

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.379 
it's easier to handle and you want to
roll<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.290> out<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.889> rectangle<00:03:50.700> that's<00:03:51.180> about

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
roll it out to a rectangle that's about

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.460 
roll it out to a rectangle that's about
12<00:03:51.780> by<00:03:52.019> 8<00:03:52.260> inches<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.950> little<00:03:53.819> flour<00:03:54.330> on<00:03:54.569> top

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
12 by 8 inches a little flour on top

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.740 
12 by 8 inches a little flour on top
and<00:03:56.560> remember<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.700> always<00:03:57.730> roll<00:03:58.300> in<00:03:58.570> one

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
and remember to always roll in one

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.370 
and remember to always roll in one
direction<00:03:59.340> you<00:04:00.340> can<00:04:00.490> just<00:04:00.700> use<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.910> rough

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
direction you can just use a rough

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.240 
direction you can just use a rough
measurement<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.530> don't<00:04:02.680> have<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:02.920> be<00:04:03.040> that

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
measurement you don't have to be that

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.990 
measurement you don't have to be that
exact<00:04:04.800> but<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:05.920> more<00:04:06.160> care<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.580> take<00:04:06.790> in

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
exact but the more care you take in

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.260 
exact but the more care you take in
rolling<00:04:07.300> these<00:04:07.420> out<00:04:08.100> into<00:04:09.120> squares

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
rolling these out into squares

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.610 
rolling these out into squares
the<00:04:10.540> nicer<00:04:10.930> they're<00:04:11.050> going<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.440> look

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
the nicer they're going to look

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.170 
the nicer they're going to look
especially<00:04:11.860> if<00:04:12.160> you're<00:04:12.310> serving<00:04:12.670> them<00:04:12.790> side

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
especially if you're serving them side

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.849 
especially if you're serving them side
by<00:04:13.210> side<00:04:17.280> okay<00:04:18.280> so<00:04:19.090> now<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.450> trim<00:04:20.109> it<00:04:20.140> ever<00:04:20.530> so

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
by side okay so now just trim it ever so

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.340 
by side okay so now just trim it ever so
slightly<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.670> I<00:04:22.300> like<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.570> use<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.750> pizza<00:04:23.020> wheel

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
slightly and I like to use a pizza wheel

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.070 
slightly and I like to use a pizza wheel
to<00:04:23.560> trim<00:04:23.830> my<00:04:23.860> dough<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:25.000> goes<00:04:25.210> very<00:04:25.420> quick<00:04:25.840> and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
to trim my dough it goes very quick and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.510 
to trim my dough it goes very quick and
it's<00:04:26.650> easy<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:27.010> use<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.460> then<00:04:29.190> right<00:04:30.190> down<00:04:30.220> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's easy to use and then right down the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.860 
it's easy to use and then right down the
middle<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:31.140> then<00:04:32.140> in<00:04:32.950> thirds<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.970> way<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
middle and then in thirds this way and

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.830 
middle and then in thirds this way and
you<00:04:35.800> roughly<00:04:36.220> have<00:04:36.550> six<00:04:37.420> four<00:04:37.750> inch<00:04:37.900> squares

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
you roughly have six four inch squares

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.200 
you roughly have six four inch squares
transfer<00:04:40.840> these<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.140> a<00:04:41.200> baking<00:04:41.650> sheet<00:04:41.680> now<00:04:42.220> so

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
transfer these to a baking sheet now so

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.610 
transfer these to a baking sheet now so
that<00:04:43.390> when<00:04:43.510> they're<00:04:43.690> filled<00:04:43.990> we<00:04:44.320> don't<00:04:44.470> have

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
that when they're filled we don't have

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.170

to<00:04:44.740> move<00:04:44.890> them<00:04:45.070> again<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:48.550> first<00:04:48.790> thing<00:04:49.000> I<00:04:49.120> do

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
to move them again the first thing I do

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.620 
to move them again the first thing I do
at<00:04:49.660> this<00:04:49.930> point<00:04:50.230> is<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:51.130> fill<00:04:51.400> them<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.790> you

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
at this point is to fill them and you

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.909 
at this point is to fill them and you
don't<00:04:52.750> want<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.020> put<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.290> too<00:04:53.470> much<00:04:53.680> because

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
don't want to put in too much because

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.240 
don't want to put in too much because

like to cut a little vent hole so when
those<00:05:54.880> berries<00:05:55.270> thought<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.720> steam<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.800> steam

those berries thought to steam the steam

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.430 
those berries thought to steam the steam
comes<00:05:57.370> out<00:05:57.580> if<00:05:57.820> steam<00:05:58.390> has<00:05:58.630> an<00:05:58.780> escape<00:05:59.200> route

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
comes out if steam has an escape route

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.980 
comes out if steam has an escape route
