00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
got interested in the engineering side

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.060 
got interested in the engineering side
and<00:00:38.860> didn't<00:00:39.730> really<00:00:40.270> drive<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.540> racecar<00:00:40.930> till<00:00:41.559> I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
was almost 40 years old engineering

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
really is where it came from and then as

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.189 
really is where it came from and then as
an<00:00:48.280> amateur<00:00:48.520> racer<00:00:48.820> myself<00:00:49.360> once<00:00:49.660> had<00:00:49.900> sort<00:00:50.140> of

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
an amateur racer myself once had sort of

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.090 
an amateur racer myself once had sort of
made<00:00:50.440> enough<00:00:50.680> money<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:51.010> go<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.699> go<00:00:51.850> racing

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
made enough money to go to go racing

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.549 
made enough money to go to go racing

started as an amateur racer and sort of

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.380 
started as an amateur racer and sort of
decided<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:57.129> nobody<00:00:57.610> had<00:00:57.729> actually<00:00:57.940> built

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
decided that nobody had actually built

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.000 
decided that nobody had actually built
the<00:00:58.570> car<00:00:58.750> that<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.019> really<00:00:59.379> wanted<00:00:59.589> to<00:00:59.650> behind

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
the car that I really wanted to behind

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.130 
the car that I really wanted to behind
so<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.780> lightweight<00:01:03.390> two-seater<00:01:04.390> which<00:01:04.900> gave

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
so a lightweight two-seater which gave

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.280 
so a lightweight two-seater which gave
good<00:01:05.320> performance<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.280> having<00:01:07.090> blown<00:01:07.330> up<00:01:07.630> a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
good performance and having blown up a

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.250 
good performance and having blown up a
dozen<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.580> pensions<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:10.870> on<00:01:11.020> with<00:01:11.229> the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
dozen in pensions and so on with the

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.250 
dozen in pensions and so on with the
genetic<00:01:12.570> motorcycle<00:01:13.570> engine<00:01:13.840> is<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.080> only

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
genetic motorcycle engine is the only

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.170 
genetic motorcycle engine is the only
way<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.409> go<00:01:14.650> because<00:01:14.860> it's<00:01:15.520> built<00:01:15.760> for<00:01:16.060> high

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
way to go because it's built for high

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.570 
way to go because it's built for high
revs<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.500> sort<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.799> vision<00:01:18.010> of<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.370> first

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
revs so the sort of vision of the first

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.270 
revs so the sort of vision of the first
race<00:01:18.820> car<00:01:19.090> became<00:01:19.450> Arum<00:01:19.990> our<00:01:20.409> club<00:01:20.650> sport<00:01:20.920> car

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
race car became Arum our club sport car

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.910 
race car became Arum our club sport car

chassis<00:01:29.500> nice<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.550> cheap<00:01:30.730> to<00:01:30.910> build<00:01:31.120> our

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
chassis nice and cheap to build our

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.180 
chassis nice and cheap to build our
original<00:01:32.290> goal<00:01:32.500> was<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.920> build<00:01:33.100> something

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
original goal was to build something

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.890 
original goal was to build something
that<00:01:34.120> weighed<00:01:34.270> 350<00:01:35.200> kilos<00:01:36.270> could<00:01:37.270> be<00:01:37.450> sold<00:01:37.720> at

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
that weighed 350 kilos could be sold at

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.570 
that weighed 350 kilos could be sold at
15,000<00:01:38.770> pounds<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.770> missed<00:01:42.010> both<00:01:42.280> goals

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
15,000 pounds and we missed both goals

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.270 
15,000 pounds and we missed both goals
by<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.880> good<00:01:43.120> margin<00:01:43.300> but<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.410> we<00:01:44.890> had<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.070> good

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
by a good margin but we we we had a good

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.120 
by a good margin but we we we had a good
time<00:01:45.490> trying<00:01:46.230> so<00:01:47.230> I<00:01:47.260> think<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.560> first<00:01:47.710> car<00:01:47.980> was

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
time trying so I think the first car was

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.450 
time trying so I think the first car was
around<00:01:48.400> 400<00:01:48.870> 420<00:01:49.870> kilos<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.680> we<00:01:51.040> had<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.280> sell

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
around 400 420 kilos and we had to sell

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.430 
around 400 420 kilos and we had to sell
it<00:01:51.490> at<00:01:51.640> 18,000<00:01:52.570> pounds<00:01:52.870> to<00:01:52.990> make<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.140> small

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
it at 18,000 pounds to make a small

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.920 
it at 18,000 pounds to make a small
margin<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.160> that<00:01:55.150> that<00:01:55.360> was<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.570> basis<00:01:55.900> of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
margin and that that was the basis of

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.480 
margin and that that was the basis of
radical<00:01:56.470> that's<00:01:56.590> really<00:01:56.920> where<00:01:57.070> we<00:01:57.130> started

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
radical that's really where we started

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
radical that's really where we started
the<00:01:57.610> radical<00:01:57.970> club<00:01:58.150> sport<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.920> we<00:02:00.010> started<00:02:00.520> on

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the radical club sport so we started on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.650 
the radical club sport so we started on
something<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.740> first<00:02:03.010> of<00:02:03.160> November<00:02:03.660> at

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
something like the first of November at

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.339 
something like the first of November at
96<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.710> we<00:02:06.670> started<00:02:06.940> drawing<00:02:07.180> parts<00:02:07.780> then<00:02:08.019> in

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
96 and we started drawing parts then in

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.859 
96 and we started drawing parts then in
November<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.459> we<00:02:09.670> cut<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:09.970> first<00:02:10.119> steel<00:02:10.509> on

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
November and we cut the first steel on

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.009 
November and we cut the first steel on
the<00:02:11.230> 3rd<00:02:11.409> of<00:02:11.440> January<00:02:12.099> at<00:02:12.819> 97<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:13.840> drove

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
the 3rd of January at 97 and we drove

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.860 
the 3rd of January at 97 and we drove
the<00:02:14.230> car<00:02:14.409> on<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.530> 29th<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.159> March<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:16.629> was

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the car on the 29th of March so it was

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.020 
the car on the 29th of March so it was
it<00:02:17.590> was<00:02:17.620> quite<00:02:17.950> an<00:02:18.040> impressive<00:02:18.310> timescale

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
it was quite an impressive timescale

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.020 
it was quite an impressive timescale
considering<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.019> was<00:02:20.050> an<00:02:20.680> after-work<00:02:21.010> job<00:02:21.489> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
considering it was an after-work job and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.339 
considering it was an after-work job and
that's<00:02:22.180> building<00:02:22.480> everything<00:02:22.780> else<00:02:23.050> building

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
that's building everything else building

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.949 
that's building everything else building
the<00:02:23.440> chassis<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.280> body<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.819> suspension<00:02:25.510> we

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
the chassis the body the suspension we

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.750 
the chassis the body the suspension we
made<00:02:26.170> everything<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:27.040> three<00:02:27.970> months

were<00:02:37.000> we're<00:02:37.420> really<00:02:37.750> booming<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.410> think<00:02:38.980> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
were we're really booming I think the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.460 
were we're really booming I think the
the<00:02:39.580> sort<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.510> core<00:02:42.270> design<00:02:43.270> features<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.290> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
the sort of core design features of the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.790 
the sort of core design features of the
car<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.490> have<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:46.150> full<00:02:46.510> two<00:02:46.720> seater<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.680> they

car is to have a full two seater so they

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.170 
car is to have a full two seater so they

you've got to have a reasonably designed
Aero<00:03:24.010> platform<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.990> good<00:03:25.990> suspension<00:03:26.650> which

Aero platform and good suspension which

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.190 
Aero platform and good suspension which
communicates<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.910> driver<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.990> two

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
communicates to the driver but the two

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.960 
communicates to the driver but the two
have<00:03:29.380> got<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.650> be<00:03:29.770> in<00:03:29.860> balance<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.400> arrows<00:03:30.730> got

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
have got to be in balance the arrows got

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.580 
have got to be in balance the arrows got
to<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.270> balance<00:03:31.420> with<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.350> chassis

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
to be in balance with with the chassis

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.320 
to be in balance with with the chassis
design<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.280> weight<00:03:33.430> distribution<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
design the weight distribution and the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.360 
design the weight distribution and the
suspension<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.980> long<00:03:36.100> as<00:03:36.160> you've<00:03:36.340> got

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
suspension so as long as you've got

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.250 
suspension so as long as you've got
everything<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.880> equal<00:03:37.570> measure<00:03:37.780> it's<00:03:38.050> it's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
everything in equal measure it's it's

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.560 
everything in equal measure it's it's
really<00:03:38.470> about<00:03:38.800> balance<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.580> everything<00:03:39.940> but

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
really about balance of everything but

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.380 
really about balance of everything but
also<00:03:40.750> usually<00:03:41.740> find<00:03:42.190> then<00:03:42.520> some<00:03:43.240> of<00:03:43.330> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
also usually find then some of the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.480 
also usually find then some of the
buffing<00:03:43.720> designers<00:03:44.410> get<00:03:44.590> carried<00:03:44.890> away<00:03:44.980> and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
buffing designers get carried away and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.630 
buffing designers get carried away and
they<00:03:46.000> put<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.360> lots<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:46.890> auntie's<00:03:47.890> anti-squat

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
they put in lots of auntie's anti-squat

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.790 
they put in lots of auntie's anti-squat
auntie<00:03:49.120> derive<00:03:49.450> all<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.260> kind<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.560> stuff

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
auntie derive all of this kind of stuff

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.770 
auntie derive all of this kind of stuff
which<00:03:51.220> actually<00:03:51.580> numbs<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:52.090> sensation<00:03:52.660> to

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
which actually numbs the sensation to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.710 
which actually numbs the sensation to
the<00:03:52.870> driver<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:54.010> we<00:03:54.040> keep<00:03:54.550> all<00:03:54.820> those<00:03:55.030> auntie's

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
the driver so we keep all those auntie's

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.810 
the driver so we keep all those auntie's
as<00:03:56.020> we<00:03:56.350> talked<00:03:56.590> about<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.370> minimum

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
as we talked about to to a minimum

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.570 
as we talked about to to a minimum
really<00:03:58.300> there's<00:03:58.750> very<00:03:58.870> little<00:03:59.290> anti<00:03:59.950> dive<00:04:00.160> on

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
really there's very little anti dive on

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.910 
really there's very little anti dive on
it<00:04:00.910> which<00:04:01.450> means<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:02.110> car<00:04:02.320> does<00:04:02.650> move

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
it which means that the car does move

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.620 
it which means that the car does move
when<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.400> when<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.730> jump<00:04:03.940> on<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.180> brakes<00:04:04.420> it

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
when you when you jump on the brakes it

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.720 
when you when you jump on the brakes it
does<00:04:04.959> give<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.260> response<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.280> does<00:04:06.489> no

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
does give that response that it does no

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.540 
does give that response that it does no
stop<00:04:07.060> over<00:04:07.239> little<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:08.220> which<00:04:09.220> if<00:04:09.400> you're

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
stop over little and which if you're

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.610 
stop over little and which if you're
just<00:04:09.760> looking<00:04:09.910> at<00:04:10.150> pure<00:04:10.480> performance<00:04:10.900> maybe

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
just looking at pure performance maybe

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.229 
just looking at pure performance maybe
maybe<00:04:12.010> that's<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.400> little<00:04:12.430> bit<00:04:12.640> detrimental

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
maybe that's a little bit detrimental

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.060 
maybe that's a little bit detrimental
but<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.510> does<00:04:13.810> communicate<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.770> driver

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
but it does communicate to the driver

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.140 
but it does communicate to the driver
that<00:04:15.610> you're<00:04:15.730> now<00:04:15.850> stopping<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:18.150> you

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
that you're now stopping and and you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.210 
that you're now stopping and and you
could<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.200> feedback<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:20.980> driver

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
could with that feedback to the driver

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.340 
could with that feedback to the driver
then<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.180> can<00:04:22.330> drive<00:04:22.540> it<00:04:22.750> really<00:04:22.990> well<00:04:23.140> and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
then you can drive it really well and

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.409 
then you can drive it really well and
that's<00:04:23.590> that's<00:04:24.040> why<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.220> think<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:25.000> radicle

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
that's that's why I think the radicle

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.030 
that's that's why I think the radicle
Championship<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:26.260> close<00:04:26.590> because<00:04:26.830> the

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
Championship is so close because the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.790 
Championship is so close because the
chassis<00:04:27.720> communicates<00:04:28.720> very<00:04:29.050> very<00:04:29.380> well<00:04:29.590> to

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
chassis communicates very very well to

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.500 
chassis communicates very very well to
the<00:04:29.890> driver<00:04:30.250> but<00:04:30.820> that's<00:04:30.910> by<00:04:31.120> design

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
the driver but that's by design

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.740 
the driver but that's by design
that's<00:04:31.840> not<00:04:31.990> by<00:04:32.080> accident

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
that's not by accident

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.620 
that's not by accident
I<00:04:32.830> think<00:04:33.830> we<00:04:34.010> will<00:04:34.160> always<00:04:34.670> build<00:04:34.940> racing<00:04:35.390> cars

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
I think we will always build racing cars

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.690 
I think we will always build racing cars
radical<00:04:36.140> will<00:04:36.290> always<00:04:36.680> be<00:04:36.830> for<00:04:37.070> racing<00:04:37.430> cars

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
radical will always be for racing cars

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.070 
radical will always be for racing cars
but<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:40.190> do<00:04:40.460> all<00:04:40.640> of<00:04:40.670> these<00:04:40.910> things<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.510> end<00:04:41.900> up

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
but to do all of these things you end up

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.100 
but to do all of these things you end up
with<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.350> very<00:04:42.740> good<00:04:43.240> very<00:04:44.240> skilled<00:04:44.630> workforce

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
with a very good very skilled workforce

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.920 
with a very good very skilled workforce
and<00:04:45.290> there's<00:04:45.410> 140<00:04:45.950> people<00:04:46.340> here<00:04:46.730> so<00:04:47.210> we<00:04:47.330> we<00:04:47.780> now

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
and there's 140 people here so we we now

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.080 
and there's 140 people here so we we now
have<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.620> sell<00:04:48.830> cars<00:04:49.070> we<00:04:49.280> started<00:04:49.670> off<00:04:49.760> wanting

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
have to sell cars we started off wanting

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.120 
have to sell cars we started off wanting
to<00:04:50.480> sell<00:04:50.660> cars<00:04:50.900> we<00:04:51.170> now<00:04:51.290> have<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.710> sell<00:04:51.890> cars

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
to sell cars we now have to sell cars

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.160 
to sell cars we now have to sell cars

cars<00:05:17.360> fabulous<00:05:18.140> piece<00:05:18.320> of<00:05:18.500> engineering<00:05:18.760> but

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
cars fabulous piece of engineering but

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.100 
cars fabulous piece of engineering but
in<00:05:19.880> a<00:05:19.940> track<00:05:20.150> day<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.390> can<00:05:20.660> wear<00:05:20.840> out<00:05:20.870> the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
in a track day you can wear out the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.010 
in a track day you can wear out the
brakes<00:05:21.320> completely<00:05:21.920> and<00:05:22.070> spend<00:05:22.850> 3,000<00:05:23.690> pounds

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020

brakes completely and spend 3,000 pounds
renewing<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:24.950> brakes<00:05:25.190> maybe<00:05:25.580> on<00:05:25.790> a<00:05:25.820> Porsche

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
renewing the brakes maybe on a Porsche

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.290 
renewing the brakes maybe on a Porsche
so<00:05:26.690> we're<00:05:27.110> looking<00:05:27.410> at<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.980> car<00:05:28.490> that<00:05:28.730> would<00:05:28.910> not

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
so we're looking at a car that would not

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.050 
so we're looking at a car that would not
replace<00:05:29.690> that<00:05:30.050> Porsche<00:05:30.410> but<00:05:31.070> perform<00:05:31.790> better

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
replace that Porsche but perform better

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.990 
replace that Porsche but perform better
for<00:05:32.600> less<00:05:32.750> money<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.460> continue<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.640> perform

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
for less money and continue to perform

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.340 
for less money and continue to perform
on<00:05:35.390> the<00:05:36.020> track<00:05:37.240> our<00:05:38.240> count<00:05:38.540> will<00:05:38.720> also<00:05:39.020> be<00:05:39.140> race

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
on the track our count will also be race

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.860 
on the track our count will also be race
cars<00:05:39.770> but<00:05:40.060> people<00:05:41.060> are<00:05:41.120> crazy<00:05:41.330> enough<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.690> put

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
cars but people are crazy enough to put

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.900 
cars but people are crazy enough to put
them<00:05:41.990> on<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.200> road<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:42.490> that<00:05:43.490> gives<00:05:43.790> us<00:05:43.850> a

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
them on the road and that gives us a

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.840 
them on the road and that gives us a
good<00:05:44.090> market<00:05:44.770> within<00:05:45.770> largely<00:05:46.190> enlarge<00:05:46.670> the

good market within largely enlarge the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.710 
good market within largely enlarge the
suzuki<00:05:47.300> hayabusa<00:05:47.480> to<00:05:48.260> 1500<00:05:49.100> CC<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.850> then<00:05:49.940> 1550

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
suzuki hayabusa to 1500 CC and then 1550

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:59.590 
suzuki hayabusa to 1500 CC and then 1550
and<00:05:54.100> 1650<00:05:56.710> winda<00:05:57.710> and<00:05:58.120> i<00:05:59.120> was<00:05:59.300> just<00:05:59.420> toying

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
and 1650 winda and i was just toying

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.120 
and 1650 winda and i was just toying
with<00:05:59.780> ideas<00:06:00.230> and<00:06:00.440> took<00:06:00.590> well<00:06:00.800> and<00:06:00.920> we<00:06:01.010> could

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
with ideas and took well and we could

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.360 
with ideas and took well and we could
use<00:06:01.310> two<00:06:01.550> of<00:06:01.580> those<00:06:01.820> and<00:06:02.470> two<00:06:03.470> top<00:06:03.680> ends<00:06:03.950> and

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
use two of those and two top ends and

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.260 
use two of those and two top ends and
make<00:06:05.300> a<00:06:05.330> v8<00:06:05.720> and<00:06:06.250> it<00:06:07.250> was<00:06:07.340> just<00:06:07.790> nothing<00:06:08.090> more

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
make a v8 and it was just nothing more

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.600 
make a v8 and it was just nothing more
than<00:06:08.690> looking<00:06:09.170> for<00:06:09.350> some<00:06:09.500> more<00:06:09.650> power<00:06:09.890> another

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
than looking for some more power another

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.750 
than looking for some more power another
another<00:06:11.540> power<00:06:11.840> source<00:06:12.230> with<00:06:13.160> that<00:06:13.460> feel

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
another power source with that feel

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.940 
another power source with that feel
because<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.390> all<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.870> radicals<00:06:15.200> with<00:06:15.560> a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
because the all the radicals with a

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.430 
because the all the radicals with a
lightweight<00:06:16.370> engine<00:06:17.080> everything's<00:06:18.080> in

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
lightweight engine everything's in

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.490 
lightweight engine everything's in
harmony<00:06:19.130> with<00:06:19.670> the<00:06:20.510> light<00:06:20.720> engine<00:06:21.350> but<00:06:21.470> also

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
harmony with the light engine but also

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.720 
harmony with the light engine but also
light<00:06:22.010> reciprocating<00:06:22.880> mass<00:06:23.090> and<00:06:23.450> so<00:06:24.380> we<00:06:24.770> came

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
light reciprocating mass and so we came

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.960 
light reciprocating mass and so we came
up<00:06:25.790> with<00:06:25.940> the<00:06:26.030> idea<00:06:26.300> of<00:06:26.390> building<00:06:26.570> a<00:06:26.780> v8<00:06:27.080> and

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
up with the idea of building a v8 and

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.820 
up with the idea of building a v8 and
spoke<00:06:28.970> to<00:06:29.000> one<00:06:29.150> or<00:06:29.360> two<00:06:29.510> engine<00:06:30.020> designers<00:06:30.590> and

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
spoke to one or two engine designers and

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.370 
spoke to one or two engine designers and
chose<00:06:31.550> somebody<00:06:32.120> to<00:06:32.420> help<00:06:32.630> us<00:06:32.840> do<00:06:33.080> the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
chose somebody to help us do the

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.350 
chose somebody to help us do the
architecture<00:06:34.280> all<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.730> structure<00:06:35.210> and

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
architecture all the structure and

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.960 
architecture all the structure and
basically<00:06:36.110> the<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:36.440> gas<00:06:36.950> exchange<00:06:37.250> side<00:06:37.790> of

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
basically the the gas exchange side of

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.580 
basically the the gas exchange side of
the<00:06:38.030> engine<00:06:38.180> cylinder<00:06:38.840> heads<00:06:39.050> the<00:06:39.230> cylinder

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
the engine cylinder heads the cylinder

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.550 
the engine cylinder heads the cylinder
blocks<00:06:39.860> Pistons<00:06:40.580> are<00:06:41.090> all<00:06:41.330> Suzuki<00:06:42.080> and<00:06:42.230> remain

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
blocks Pistons are all Suzuki and remain

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.360 
blocks Pistons are all Suzuki and remain
Suzuki

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
Suzuki

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.060 
Suzuki
and<00:06:43.460> then<00:06:44.449> we<00:06:44.870> manufacture<00:06:45.620> the<00:06:45.740> crankcase

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
and then we manufacture the crankcase

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.719 
and then we manufacture the crankcase
the<00:06:46.850> crankshaft<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.660> oil<00:06:47.900> system<00:06:48.199> and<00:06:48.710> all<00:06:49.669> of

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:49.729 
the crankshaft the oil system and all of

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.120 
the crankshaft the oil system and all of
the<00:06:49.970> other<00:06:50.120> bits<00:06:50.300> and<00:06:50.479> pieces<00:06:50.660> around<00:06:50.990> it<00:06:51.410> it's

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
the other bits and pieces around it it's

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.250 
the other bits and pieces around it it's
a<00:06:52.220> testament<00:06:52.669> to<00:06:52.790> the<00:06:53.030> to<00:06:53.389> the<00:06:53.510> quality<00:06:53.720> and

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
a testament to the to the quality and

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.100 
a testament to the to the quality and
the<00:06:54.830> skill<00:06:55.370> of<00:06:55.400> the<00:06:55.600> workforce<00:06:56.600> really<00:06:56.990> and

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
the skill of the workforce really and

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.740 
the skill of the workforce really and
how<00:06:57.260> we<00:06:57.320> can<00:06:57.740> just<00:06:58.280> motivate<00:06:58.820> them<00:06:59.060> to<00:06:59.419> all

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
how we can just motivate them to all

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.620 
how we can just motivate them to all
think<00:07:00.320> of<00:07:00.500> it<00:07:00.680> in<00:07:01.130> a<00:07:01.280> common<00:07:01.910> way<00:07:01.940> a<00:07:02.120> common

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
think of it in a common way a common

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.320 
think of it in a common way a common
goal<00:07:02.840> and<00:07:03.520> to<00:07:04.520> get<00:07:04.669> all<00:07:04.760> those<00:07:04.940> different

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
goal and to get all those different

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.430 
goal and to get all those different
skills<00:07:05.419> done<00:07:05.930> yeah<00:07:06.260> I<00:07:06.290> mean<00:07:06.880> you<00:07:07.880> know<00:07:08.000> we

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
skills done yeah I mean you know we

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.629 
skills done yeah I mean you know we
you've<00:07:09.440> seen<00:07:09.650> around<00:07:09.800> we<00:07:10.130> have<00:07:10.250> a<00:07:10.280> door<00:07:10.460> over

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639

you've seen around we have a door over
there<00:07:10.880> where<00:07:11.090> steel<00:07:11.300> tubes<00:07:11.630> come<00:07:11.930> in<00:07:12.020> one<00:07:12.199> door

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470 
there where steel tubes come in one door

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.340 
there where steel tubes come in one door
and<00:07:13.150> barrels<00:07:14.150> of<00:07:14.330> sticky<00:07:14.630> stuff<00:07:14.960> coming<00:07:15.260> the

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
and barrels of sticky stuff coming the

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.689 
and barrels of sticky stuff coming the
other<00:07:15.500> one<00:07:15.620> and<00:07:15.770> finished<00:07:16.039> race<00:07:16.220> cars<00:07:16.490> come

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:16.699 
other one and finished race cars come

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.430 
other one and finished race cars come
out<00:07:16.820> of<00:07:16.970> this<00:07:17.090> door<00:07:17.330> you<00:07:17.360> know<00:07:17.600> it<00:07:17.960> is<00:07:18.110> quite<00:07:18.350> a

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
out of this door you know it is quite a

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.860 
out of this door you know it is quite a
big<00:07:18.770> range<00:07:19.070> of<00:07:19.250> skills<00:07:19.580> which<00:07:19.970> was<00:07:20.210> just<00:07:20.720> sort

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
big range of skills which was just sort

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.390 
big range of skills which was just sort
of<00:07:20.930> developed<00:07:21.380> over<00:07:21.680> the<00:07:21.770> years<00:07:21.800> I<00:07:22.130> guess

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
of developed over the years I guess

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.090 
of developed over the years I guess
really<00:07:22.699> yeah<00:07:23.150> we<00:07:23.360> we<00:07:23.690> do<00:07:23.840> joke<00:07:24.530> a<00:07:24.560> bit<00:07:24.830> about

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100 
really yeah we we do joke a bit about

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.250 
really yeah we we do joke a bit about
what<00:07:25.310> we<00:07:25.430> do<00:07:25.610> but<00:07:25.820> it's<00:07:25.970> just<00:07:26.150> about<00:07:26.389> getting

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
what we do but it's just about getting

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.510 
what we do but it's just about getting
the<00:07:27.350> job<00:07:27.380> done<00:07:27.560> keeping<00:07:28.010> your<00:07:28.130> promises

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
the job done keeping your promises

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.980 
the job done keeping your promises
really<00:07:28.910> is<00:07:28.970> what<00:07:29.090> drives<00:07:29.300> you<00:07:29.600> the<00:07:29.750> fear<00:07:29.960> of

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
really is what drives you the fear of

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.469 
really is what drives you the fear of
failure<00:07:30.320> you<00:07:30.740> know<00:07:30.889> that<00:07:31.100> it<00:07:31.699> would<00:07:31.970> hate<00:07:32.240> to

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 
failure you know that it would hate to

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:33.879 
failure you know that it would hate to
say<00:07:32.660> I'm<00:07:32.720> going<00:07:32.870> to<00:07:32.930> do<00:07:33.110> something<00:07:33.380> and<00:07:33.620> fail

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:33.889 
say I'm going to do something and fail

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.680 
say I'm going to do something and fail
so<00:07:34.280> it's<00:07:34.430> that<00:07:34.639> it's<00:07:35.150> that<00:07:35.270> fear<00:07:35.539> of<00:07:35.660> failure

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 
so it's that it's that fear of failure

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.590 
so it's that it's that fear of failure
that<00:07:36.289> makes<00:07:36.530> you<00:07:37.060> complete<00:07:38.060> it<00:07:38.240> makes<00:07:38.479> you

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:38.600 
that makes you complete it makes you

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.050 
that makes you complete it makes you
complete<00:07:38.930> the<00:07:39.080> task<00:07:39.289> and<00:07:39.590> and<00:07:39.850> look<00:07:40.850> for<00:07:41.000> the

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.060 
complete the task and and look for the

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.719 
complete the task and and look for the
next<00:07:41.240> thing<00:07:41.510> that<00:07:41.810> people<00:07:42.020> are<00:07:42.610> expecting<00:07:43.610> to

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:43.729 
next thing that people are expecting to

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:49.150 
next thing that people are expecting to
come<00:07:43.910> from<00:07:44.300> from<00:07:44.600> radical

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.160 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.220
