with like trap cards I believe was

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930 
with like trap cards I believe was
kritis<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.410> then<00:02:59.890> how<00:03:00.040> else<00:03:00.070> was<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.730> can

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
kritis and then how else was like it can

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.610
