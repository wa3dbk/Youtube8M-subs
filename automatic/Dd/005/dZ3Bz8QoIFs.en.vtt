 videos because you do not have time to see it 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.379
 whole or finally not at the end of 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.330
 build in full then for these 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.510
 and for everyone who wants to know 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.519
 wheels with different champions 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.490
 we started with catarina and I'm going to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.519
 teach the most optimal build for this 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.669
 season 5 here we have we can start 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.180
 with speed boots and four pots or 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.309
 speed boots and four prostheses or 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.780
 cloth armor and five pots in which 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.940
 it will vary then if we face against 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.579
 pets or against this is a start 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 quite pretty good when we go to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.980
 base we must buy the boots of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 sorcerer or the first part of the clock 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.129
 of sonia sand or some part of the echo 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 of udd in these 33 items are objects 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.100
 indispensable for any player of 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.079
 katharina this because it provides you 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.860
 a lot of survival this because the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.810
 burst that brings you is pretty enough 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 powerful is really an item 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.180
 katharina as you see the objects 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.340
 essential costs 6000 plus 7 thousand 100 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.850
 approximately good approximately no 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.560
 because it's there you see it and good 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.399
 equal portions that you go buying 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.520
 the sale of about 7,500 flights a 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.399
 7.200 etc. etcetera in objects 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 valid for catalina I would put the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.560
 raval on is an item that you have to 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.780
 do yes or yes after these 2 rely 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.369
 It is very good for you because it offers you 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 so much and a little bit of slow that always 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.360
 goes well and with the new reel boom there is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.520
 as an object to take into account 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 really the empty cane for 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.450
 when it reaches the late game for 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.030
 magic penetration you see that here you 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 gives 80 then of skill and magic damage 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.200
 ignores 35 percent of the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.030
 Magical resistance of the target 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.659
 visual center are also very good item 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.700
 against characters up is in the middle that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.280
 it has a lot of magical damage like it could 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.770
 being leblanc could be a fit could be 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.690
 diana this is also a good item and what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.730
 we could change the watch area 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.810
 of sonia sand although the active 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.670
 hourglass by sonia 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.160
 It is very very good for last in faith so 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.599
 that I recommend this item 100% 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.040
 the torment of and andriy is not an item 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.140
 that I like a lot with catalina 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.420
 but it is a valid object since now 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.390
 gives us 80 of skill power and 300 of 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.000
 life plus the passive one that inflicts a mini 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.739
 turn on we already know situational objects 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 it is the will of the ancients for a 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.220
 little more of cult reduction ni 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.290
 that steal spell sucking and the saber 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.480
 gun that this is more of the same but 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.280
 gives us a little bit of a and an active 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.110
 that is a slow that comes pretty well 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.959
 although I do not usually do this item 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.260
 because there are a lot better like 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.790
 you see here this is the object 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.830
 the defensive objects that now 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 we will talk about them but an example of 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.720
 final wii would come to be the boots of 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.150
 sorcerer echo of ludden mortal hat 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.530
 of rabah don glass scepter of relive 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.299
 vacuum cane and hourglass 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.569
 zone this would be the standard build for 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.500
 You have it here pretty beautiful for 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.450
 You can pause the video and watch it 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.950
 is not an extremely expensive weed if the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.870
 we compare with other magicians you know 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.140
 it really is a very standard build in 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.310
 ap so it's the build that best suits you 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.110
 comes to this champion 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.910
 here we have defensive objects that 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.340
 we can also do well with the veil of 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.599
 fairy of death when they have enough 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.450
 etc that can go pretty well when it 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.069
 keep scc to stop you uti this 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.590
 fairy veil can save you from more than 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.350
 an angel of the guard for if you 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.540
 they are doing a lot of focus 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.280
 you die you die because the best 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.370
 they have an an and that you flash ya and you 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.250
 put the tiber if it flies because here is 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.960
 the guardian angel that is going to save you 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.630
 of more than one and if your damage is 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.370
 very much you can choose a randÃ­n or 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.590
 a layer of solar fire are objects that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.020
 they are rarely seen but they can be 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.180
 there and defensive objects are the ones that 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.160
 we are used to seeing are the veil 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.580
 of the death fairy and the angel 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.590
 guardian 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.450
 although with this build you do not have to 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.370
 we take care of these two because he connected 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.630
 niasse if we know how to finish it well no 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.850
 they are going to kill us, we are going to be 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.520
 indestructible we are going to be an interpreter 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.430
 you talk would be able to cause real 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.080
 havoc with this character that already 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.480
 you have seen on the channel more than once 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.780
