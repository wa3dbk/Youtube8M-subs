00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.839
 Guys, I'm with you and I hope so. 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.950
 today has a very boring news 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.710
 to give to you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 the news is that they took all my 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.060
 moments of video and audio in the last 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 Friday was stolen at home asleep 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.449
 after a night full of issues 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.810
 For those who know me, you know I work. 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.859
 at dawn one afternoon but I have to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.920
 me some kind and some land of the day 18 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.399
 at noon, but four hours average 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.120
 sleep happens at 11 o'clock 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.710
 punctually and was stolen led a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870
 equivalent 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.289
 I saw the person entering entering my 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.210
 home is when they went to the room for 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.219
 luck there has not been any kind of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.730
 violence or the person was disarmed 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.739
 and it was really that I woke up and saw 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.230
 that everything I had 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.030
 in my last nine years had been 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.630
 simply evaporated through theft 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 It's what happened last Friday. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 Friday had not left the computer 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 on here 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 addressing forgiveness is to make two 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.500
 processes first I had finished 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.290
 edit for 36 hours of front ten video 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.240
 minutes of video to finish the ball and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.130
 It's already publishing I was enjoying 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 this time in order to be able to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.189
 data synchronization with my the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.939
 head 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 I do it every time I know 39 months 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.689
 very committed to this plan but it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 so very seldom is a team 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.040
 total is not ours to do much 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.380
 synchronization because I already had problems 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 with synchronization because it is a capital and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 He left the place in the external EU body in 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.369
 two-door crash available 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.700
 notebook and then I'll spend all my 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.130
 files to these external hds had 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.400
 other castellan who leave aside her 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.120
 about your indication 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.850
 In case it happened to get you the red book 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.100
 have taken my external rules is 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.020
 have taken my whole history of 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 last nine years and I confess that 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.610
 I'm very upset about this, right? 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.430
 Are you honest with yourself, or am I? 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.120
 annoyed at the loss of all the material 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.520
 is in terms of physical material more 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.470
 virtual material or be my own 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.510
 ideas my notes 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.760
 I had a book that had 40 pages 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.300
 this book also by the farm and 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 simply turned to dust because the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.630
 material that contained this book was 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.370
 unfortunately stolen and people are I ask 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.370
 sorry for not having an equipment 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.980
 minimum for some preference for you 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.050
 something agitated I apologize for the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.000
 poor audio quality 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.160
 obviously due to the poor quality of the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.380
 video because the only thing left over 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.970
 It was the cell phone to record is whoever you want 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.480
 and also to those who can collaborate 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.950
 making available under these conditions 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.170

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.690
 free content placed in the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.620
 internet for everyone is to be 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.280

 accessed is now ninth in the session here of 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.220
 define the comments in the description of the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.100
 video because in the description come back

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.670
 video is reached that both conditions 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.310
 Mental or mental materials is 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.080
 rendered the situation I am better than 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.110
 I was last Friday 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.690

 to find again is not a computer because it is 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.290
 to at least have a minimum possible 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.160
 to start believing in my 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.639
 videos 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.400
 it is illogical that it is unfortunately as it exists 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.980
 a period in which the draft and the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.350
 final, I do not think they three 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.020
