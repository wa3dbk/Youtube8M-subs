00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
they start to float and when they're got

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.570 
they start to float and when they're got
doubled<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.300> size<00:02:52.560> okay<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:53.920> I'm<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.430> going

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.880 
doubled in size okay so I'm just going
to<00:02:54.640> lightly<00:02:55.000> oil<00:02:55.150> up<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.630> sheet<00:02:55.840> tray<00:02:55.989> that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
to lightly oil up the sheet tray that

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.680 
to lightly oil up the sheet tray that
gives<00:02:57.100> me<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> place<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.580> land<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.510> gnocchi

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
gives me a place to land the gnocchi

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.120 
gives me a place to land the gnocchi
when<00:02:58.989> they're<00:02:59.110> ready<00:02:59.290> keep<00:02:59.770> it<00:02:59.920> under<00:03:00.100> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
when they're ready keep it under the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.979 
when they're ready keep it under the
water<00:03:00.370> too<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.030> want<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.510> simmering

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
water too you want it to be simmering

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.110 
water too you want it to be simmering

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
but if it boils too hard yoki are going

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.640 
but if it boils too hard yoki are going
to<00:03:04.180> knock<00:03:04.360> together<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.140> split<00:03:05.380> each<00:03:05.470> other

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
to knock together and split each other

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.010 
to knock together and split each other
apart<00:03:06.040> she's<00:03:06.700> look<00:03:06.850> pretty<00:03:07.120> good<00:03:09.780> okay<00:03:10.780> good
