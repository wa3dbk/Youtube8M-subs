00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
part this isn't the supreme line so it's

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.660 
part this isn't the supreme line so it's
going<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.080> be<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> more<00:01:48.380> contoured<00:01:48.890> glove<00:01:49.250> you

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
going to be a more contoured glove you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.310 
going to be a more contoured glove you

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
that's going to reduce some of the

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.280 
that's going to reduce some of the
negative<00:01:52.700> space<00:01:53.030> above<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.720> really<00:01:54.170> make

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
negative space above and really make

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.289 
negative space above and really make

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
sure the glove moves with the hand and

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.760
