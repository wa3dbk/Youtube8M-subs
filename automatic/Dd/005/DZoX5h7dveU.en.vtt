well scientists say they've just found
the<00:00:03.330> best<00:00:03.600> evidence<00:00:03.870> yet<00:00:04.290> that<00:00:04.799> liquid<00:00:05.460> water

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the solar system and you know most

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.340 
the solar system and you know most
people<00:00:24.630> were<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.840> all<00:00:24.990> right<00:00:25.080> come<00:00:25.230> on

know when you you start to say that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
know when you you start to say that
you're<00:00:33.239> finding<00:00:33.630> water<00:00:33.930> everywhere<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.800> just

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you're finding water everywhere and just

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
you're finding water everywhere and just
ten<00:00:35.820> years<00:00:36.059> ago<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.329> was<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.510> wherever<00:00:36.989> we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
ten years ago it was like wherever we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.430 
ten years ago it was like wherever we
find<00:00:37.590> water<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.280> life<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:39.329> know<00:00:39.510> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
find water there's life you know it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
find water there's life you know it's
like<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:41.129> been<00:00:41.309> swept<00:00:41.700> into<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> back

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
like that's all been swept into the back

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.060 
like that's all been swept into the back
of<00:00:42.239> everyone's<00:00:42.660> brains<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.620> since<00:00:43.860> then

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
of everyone's brains and since then

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.470 
of everyone's brains and since then
they've<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.460> been<00:00:44.640> peppering<00:00:45.059> us<00:00:45.300> with

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
they've just been peppering us with

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.000 
they've just been peppering us with
little<00:00:45.719> bits<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> detail<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.860> right

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
little bits of detail like all right

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.450 
little bits of detail like all right
there<00:00:47.579> was<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> vast<00:00:48.180> ocean<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.930> Mars<00:00:49.309> where<00:00:50.309> did

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
there was a vast ocean on Mars where did

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.639 
there was a vast ocean on Mars where did
it<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:51.230> there's<00:00:52.520> massive<00:00:53.520> amounts<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.910> ice<00:00:54.210> in

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
it go there's massive amounts of ice in

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.750 
it go there's massive amounts of ice in
these<00:00:55.649> glacial<00:00:55.980> belts<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> polls<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
these glacial belts and in the polls and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.959 
these glacial belts and in the polls and
what<00:00:59.760> they're<00:00:59.910> talking<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.300> doing<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
what they're talking about doing now is

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.500 
what they're talking about doing now is
farming<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.390> water<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.989> Mars<00:01:04.700> our<00:01:05.700> curiosity

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
farming this water on Mars our curiosity

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960 
farming this water on Mars our curiosity
has<00:01:06.979> determined<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.070> tiny<00:01:08.430> amounts<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
has determined that tiny amounts of

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.679 
has determined that tiny amounts of
water<00:01:09.150> vapor<00:01:09.890> condenses<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> liquid<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
water vapor condenses as a liquid in the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.520 
water vapor condenses as a liquid in the
planets<00:01:13.140> oil<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.740> night<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:15.200> evaporates<00:01:16.200> away

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
planets oil at night and evaporates away

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
planets oil at night and evaporates away
in<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> morning<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> Sun<00:01:17.790> comes<00:01:17.939> around

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
in the morning when the Sun comes around

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.260 
in the morning when the Sun comes around
now<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> past<00:01:19.710> they<00:01:20.130> discovered<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.970> but

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
now in the past they discovered this but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
now in the past they discovered this but
they<00:01:21.390> wrote<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.930> thinking<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.740> it's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
they wrote it all thinking well it's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
they wrote it all thinking well it's
going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> evaporate<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:24.090> night<00:01:24.299> there's<00:01:24.630> no

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
going to evaporate at night there's no

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
going to evaporate at night there's no
way<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.250> ever<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.119> be

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
way that it's ever going to just be

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.569 
way that it's ever going to just be
sitting<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.860> water<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.549> they

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
sitting there you know water that they

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.289 
sitting there you know water that they
could<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.000> scoop<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:31.610> well<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:33.030> they're

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
could just scoop up well now they're

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
could just scoop up well now they're
saying<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.280> they<00:01:35.280> never<00:01:35.520> took<00:01:35.759> into<00:01:35.970> account

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
saying that they never took into account

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.830 
saying that they never took into account
back<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.049> how<00:01:37.740> salty<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:39.150> water<00:01:39.420> could<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
back then how salty the water could be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.429 
back then how salty the water could be
here<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.650> fact<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:42.150> water<00:01:42.420> has<00:01:43.170> more

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
here in the fact that the water has more

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.039 
here in the fact that the water has more
salt<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:45.240> means<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.840> takes

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
salt in it and that means that it takes

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.730 
salt in it and that means that it takes
longer<00:01:46.710> forward<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> evaporate<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:49.619> know

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
longer forward to evaporate and you know

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.819 
longer forward to evaporate and you know
as<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.310> talked<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> recent<00:01:51.840> video<00:01:52.079> about

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
as I talked in the recent video about

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.520 
as I talked in the recent video about
the<00:01:53.579> mountain<00:01:53.970> leaking<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.479> Mars<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.290> what

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the mountain leaking on Mars and what

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.490 
the mountain leaking on Mars and what
are<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:55.710> saying<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:56.820> water<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
are they saying it was it was water and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.810 
are they saying it was it was water and
you<00:01:58.500> start<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> look<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.159> darker<00:01:59.579> spots

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
you start to look at these darker spots

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.520 
you start to look at these darker spots
in<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> daytime<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.780> looked<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.140> water

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
in the daytime that looked like water

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
in the daytime that looked like water
was<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.040> there<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.640> maybe<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:05.119> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
was just there and maybe you know that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.080 
was just there and maybe you know that
is<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> case<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.990> mean<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.619> looks<00:02:07.829> like
