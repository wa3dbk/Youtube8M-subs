00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 the best weapon in the world in its class 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.170
 how many of them can not speak here 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 report from the secret division 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.650
 Able to visit terribly anyone 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.049
 no light anti missile 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.630
 crow can't knock him where 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.480
 placed on the Iskander rocket 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.579
 But about some sense as they say 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.310
 others are loudly viewed in 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.230
 specific cases for example ongoing 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.849
 construction of the same American pro in 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.740
 Europe on presidential 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.839
 press conferences on Thursday and we to her 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.580
 clearly come back today often 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.420
 Putin was asked about our missiles 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.940
 iskander 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.460
 supposedly already placed in Kaliningrad 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.059
 area be he reassured everyone decision 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.010
 This is but it is not yet accepted 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.350
 This recalled that our missiles Iskander 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.790
 The most effective weapon in the world in its 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.190
 segment about rockets and where they already 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.500
 posted report Nikolai Vasiliev but 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.869
 formerly one significant detail 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.080
 Iskander are only part of our complex 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:06.409
 defense since the threat is complex and 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.630
 the answer will be the same, this actually 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.320
 a thought was made recently and in 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.500
 message 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 we all understand we know that 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 you need and everything you need to answer is, 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 and now specifically searched holes 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.700
 iskander never appears anywhere in 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.020
 alone every missile complex 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.090
 necessarily accompany 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.120
 staff armored personnel carriers 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.440
 life support machines so 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.050
 intelligence group is coming 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.730
 first we come everywhere examined 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.240
 land mine 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.400
 yes or no insert labels not 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.800
 infected blowjob that 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.750
 where will one battery get up where 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.180
 other drive auxiliary machines 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.620
 Alex on by conscription conscript service in 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.690
 to get directly on 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.090
 Iskander need to serve six months and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.760
 show an excellent knowledge of the theory of technology 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.590
 difficult but if you understand anything difficult 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.780
 No, Mikhail first saw Iskander 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 a year and a half ago the fighting machine so its 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.100
 inspired that after the end of urgent 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.340
 Service signed a contract when I came 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.800
 serve the first time I saw the technique of me 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.400
 it was interesting to actually leave by 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.620
 anxiety part after on alert 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.570
 learning is interesting stayed by contract 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.370
 here and now iskander division 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:29.630
 conducts regular practical classes 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:31.550
 and what kind of anti missile 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.410
 its air defense cannot 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.850
 bring it down the mind of our designers this 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.190
 serious 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.810
 good weapon that comes on 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.880
 armament of the Russian army 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.340
 Iskander created to destroy any 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.230
 ground targets whether ammunition depot 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.330
 airfield or combat concentration 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.940
 technology absolute accuracy of destruction 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.520
 guaranteed in a radius of 50 to 500 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.600
 kilometers here it is operational tactical 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.700
 rocket complex 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.860
 Iskander is only one of the machines 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.000
 deployed in this part how many 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.519
 can not speak here 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.500
 military secret technology is very secret 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.360
 it is forbidden even to disclose exactly which 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.100
 the region of Russia we are now 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.830
 first Iskander entered service 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.900
 in 2006, as soon as it was established 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.370
 mass production of missile systems 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.350
 new generation have replaced 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.450
 obsolete technology throughout 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.769
 country 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.510
 in parallel with the rearmament of rockets 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.970
 part of the intensity change of presentation 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.650
 about the soldiers be and the amount of battery 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.030
 management of food intake amount 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.880
 16 people jim cheerfully running 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.100
 Auchan Strelnikov I really menu, of course 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.350
 far from the restaurant but the choice is in 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.720
 dining room fighters come to all ready 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.280
 kitchen chores from cleaning potatoes and 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.230
 the design of the buffet before washing 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.400
 dishes have long been given to civilians 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:52.790
 to specialists 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:55.280
 buy to all more 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.810
 we go to the traditional iron barracks 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.239
 beds are not visible mattresses too 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.220
 modern in the corner powerful expensive 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.829
 vacuums which houses you are far from 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.260
 each instead of a bath once a week now 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.420
 showers on each floor use when 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.760
 convenient here washing machines 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.840
 but such a picture is in almost every part of a 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.090
 vodka tea 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.950
 even the fighters themselves are not used though 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.930
 she appeared a couple of months ago 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.090
 nobody warned us came from 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.639
 discovery room we were all surprised to 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.949
 our happy afternoon tea party 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.740
 loading missiles and again on the march 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.419
 practical work continues 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.479
 Iskander mobile enough rocket 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.479
 complex 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.880
 just a car thanks to that car 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.340
 feels that not much protecting their homeland 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.780
 what is needed for the country what is it 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.420
 my profession to protect my homeland 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.830
 the very name of the missile complex 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.630
 Iskander-speaking ancient Arabs 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.850
 called the Macedonian king Alexander 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.730
 the great Alexander translated from 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.320
 Greek means defender nikolai 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.730
 Vasilev Evgeniy Kostin Dmitry 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.610
 Lukashevich lead the week 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.110
 Western Military District Sergey Shoigu 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.120
 stated today that next year 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.070
 will complete the deployment program 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.660
 troops on the ground of Franz Joseph and on the new 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.490
 earth this way according to the minister 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.890
 defense the whole arctic train will 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.750
 close besides step commented 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.190
 appeared in the western publication press 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.690
 about what our country has placed in 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.820
 Kaliningrad region missile 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.800
 Iskander complexes as some consider 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.330
 European experts is the answer to Moscow 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.970
 on ongoing construction 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.150
 American pro in Europe 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.930
 we don't sit we just don't look 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.969
 Our science is our designer factories 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.779
 believe me 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:40.100
 work very effectively and that weapon 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:44.270
 which has 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:48.140
 Russian army she is powerful she is mobile 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.270
 it is effective and we have something to answer 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.480
 a big uproar about us 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.680
 where iskander the wrong way 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.050
 the territory of the Russian Federation where 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.210
 we want to put rocket complexes there 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.550
 Iskander can be placed where 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.380
 the country's leadership will consider it necessary so 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.690
 Minister of Defense commented today 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.730
 European media reports about the Russian 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.710
 the threat of Sergei Shoigu today met with 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.900
 Moscow students besides defense 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.650
 Of course, they were interested in her service. 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.880
 other report 3 Petrova 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.890
 some are worried that along our 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.960
 western frontiers create and dense 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.880
 large missile defense ring 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.730
 the noise came up about the fact that we are not there somewhere 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.410
 there the territory to put the territory 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.870
 Russian Federation where do we want to go there 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.270
 we put it this way for a start and today from 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.550
 Russian Defense Ministry followed the comment 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.100
 topics that caused quite a stir in 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.770
 Europe on the eve of the German media reported 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.270
 that Moscow most likely placed in 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.340
 Kaliningrad region missile 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.780
 Iskander complexes representative 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.930
 of the military department Igor korashenkov 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.340
 declared that the Iskander act on the stand 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.830
 in service in the western military district 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.930
 but in which particular region and 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.540
 it remained unclear konashenkov only 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.730
 stressed that no agreements russia 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.800
 did not break and now the Europeans 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.290
 forced to guess exactly where Moscow 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.090
 deployed missiles capable of carrying nuclear 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.950
 weapon if really in 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.020
 Kaliningrad region then you radius them 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.450
 action theoretically hits the whole 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.810
 Baltic almost all of Poland and part 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.810
 germany 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.140
 we will never allow this west 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.450
 moved to the stage of self-excitation today 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.700
 German bild with reference to some 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.890
 secret satellite images with anxiety 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.510
 report new iskander who 

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.680
 Russia allegedly placed in 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.990
 Kaliningrad region 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.030
 but min-defense on this information in any way 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.890
 did not respond our help 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.020
 operational tactical missile system 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.400
 Iskander can be equipped with conventional and 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.130
 nuclear warheads 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.870
 range of damage to 500 kilometers he 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.820
 really able to easily 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.660
 intercept the US antimissile 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.910
 cm3 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.800
 which is so proud overseas so 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.340
 Russia will be able to strike back at 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.340
 any case
