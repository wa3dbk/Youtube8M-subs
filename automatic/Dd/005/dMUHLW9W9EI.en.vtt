00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
danger you might have taste is when you

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.699 
danger you might have taste is when you
got<00:03:30.760> overexcited<00:03:31.420> with<00:03:31.750> meshing<00:03:32.560> your

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
your combo and you got hit and you felt

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.120 
your combo and you got hit and you felt
like<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> total<00:03:37.780> dork<00:03:38.380> which<00:03:38.829> have<00:03:39.040> been
