don't play a lot of night games at home
but<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:02.970> don't<00:00:03.179> think<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.480> was<00:00:03.659> one<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.259> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
but I don't think that was one of the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.690 
but I don't think that was one of the
reasons<00:00:04.710> well<00:00:04.830> it<00:00:04.890> was<00:00:05.009> such<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> close<00:00:05.400> game

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
reasons well it was such a close game

reasons well it was such a close game
another<00:00:05.970> reason<00:00:06.509> we<00:00:06.600> almost<00:00:06.779> lost<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.560> think

another reason we almost lost I think

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and they didn't realize how hard they

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.980 
and they didn't realize how hard they
were<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> Sydney<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.099> hard<00:00:26.340> game

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
were and it was a Sydney very hard game

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.970 
were and it was a Sydney very hard game
there<00:00:27.990> wasn't<00:00:28.289> much<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.650> all<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> way

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
there wasn't much in it all the way

that<00:00:34.579> enable<00:00:35.579> us<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> win<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:38.690> think<00:00:39.690> we

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that enable us to win it I think we

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.420 
that enable us to win it I think we
played<00:00:40.200> reasonably<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:40.920> up<00:00:41.070> front

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
played reasonably well up front

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.760 
played reasonably well up front
we've<00:00:42.090> always<00:00:42.360> been<00:00:42.809> well<00:00:43.020> we're<00:00:43.200> older<00:00:43.559> more

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
we've always been well we're older more

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.860 
we've always been well we're older more
reason<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.190> well<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.510> think<00:00:45.600> we

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
reason we well I don't really think we

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.190 
reason we well I don't really think we
took<00:00:45.989> our<00:00:46.170> chances<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> backs<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:48.200> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
took our chances in the backs and you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.049 
took our chances in the backs and you
know<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> guess<00:00:49.860> those<00:00:50.250> sort<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.640> problems

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
know I guess those sort of problems

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
know I guess those sort of problems
happen<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.809> game<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.530> who<00:00:53.520> also

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
happen in the first game so who also

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
happen in the first game so who also
without<00:00:54.270> our<00:00:54.449> top<00:00:54.750> paid<00:00:54.960> players<00:00:55.260> who<00:00:55.500> were

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
without our top paid players who were

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
without our top paid players who were
still<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> UK<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
still in the UK or you know that you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.150 
still in the UK or you know that you
know<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.140> had<00:00:58.289> arrived<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.920> didn't

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
know they had arrived that we didn't

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.420 
know they had arrived that we didn't
consider<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.640> say<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.070> didn't

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
consider them say um you know we didn't

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.950 
consider them say um you know we didn't
we<00:01:02.550> weren't<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.000> full<00:01:03.390> strength<00:01:03.719> but

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
we weren't really full strength but

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.980 
we weren't really full strength but
that's<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.739> excuse<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.900> as

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that's not an excuse and I think it's as

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
that's not an excuse and I think it's as
one<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> those<00:01:07.350> first<00:01:08.040> game<00:01:08.340> matches<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.420> to
