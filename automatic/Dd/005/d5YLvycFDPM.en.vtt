snaps IQ will a loose-fish and be you
will<00:01:00.030> lose<00:01:00.180> baits<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.079> eventually

will lose baits like it will eventually
break<00:01:01.769> because<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.219> every<00:01:02.460> tug<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:03.300> an

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
break because with every tug there's an

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.150 
break because with every tug there's an
awful<00:01:03.570> lot<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.690> pressure<00:01:03.870> pressure<00:01:04.680> coming<00:01:05.010> on

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
awful lot of pressure pressure coming on

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.220 
awful lot of pressure pressure coming on
to<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.370> snap<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.910> holds<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> bait<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.170> it

to that snap that holds the bait so it

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.289 
to that snap that holds the bait so it
has<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:07.770> quality<00:01:08.100> snap<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> put

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
has to be a good quality snap so you put

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.420 
has to be a good quality snap so you put
that<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> eye<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> close<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that in the in the eye and you close the

and<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.140> put<00:01:44.000> again<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.150> good<00:01:45.390> quality<00:01:45.810> swivel

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and you put again a good quality swivel

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.930 
and you put again a good quality swivel
in<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.890> these<00:01:47.040> swivels<00:01:47.430> are<00:01:47.550> something<00:01:47.910> like

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
in it these swivels are something like

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.250 
in it these swivels are something like
like<00:01:48.360> 150<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:50.000> pound<00:01:51.000> breaking<00:01:51.360> strength<00:01:51.570> so

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
like 150 a pound breaking strength so

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.840 
like 150 a pound breaking strength so
that's<00:01:52.470> really<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.830> need<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.610> put<00:01:53.760> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that's really what you need you put it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.310 
that's really what you need you put it
in<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.030> eye<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.480> do<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.660> same<00:01:54.750> thing<00:01:54.900> as<00:01:55.170> with

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in the eye you do the same thing as with

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.760 
in the eye you do the same thing as with
it<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.650> snap<00:01:55.890> freely<00:01:56.190> again<00:01:57.120> a<00:01:57.770> couple

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it with the snap freely again a couple

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:10.639 
it with the snap freely again a couple
of<00:01:58.920> turns<00:02:02.479> that's<00:02:03.479> fine<00:02:07.970> now<00:02:09.410> that's<00:02:10.410> all

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
of turns that's fine now that's all

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280 
of turns that's fine now that's all
there's<00:02:11.160> only<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.580> little<00:02:11.730> detail<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.630> I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
there's only one little detail and I

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.990 
there's only one little detail and I
think<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:13.650> quite<00:02:13.830> important<00:02:14.310> there's

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
think that's quite important there's

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.280 
think that's quite important there's
always<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.240> little<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.690> steel<00:02:16.080> wires

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
always a little bit of steel wires

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.110 
always a little bit of steel wires
sticking<00:02:16.530> out<00:02:16.800> here<00:02:17.070> now<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.090> possible

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
sticking out here now it is possible

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
sticking out here now it is possible
that<00:02:18.540> you're<00:02:18.810> lying<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.380> braided<00:02:19.680> line<00:02:19.830> that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that you're lying your braided line that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.870 
that you're lying your braided line that
you<00:02:20.040> use<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.520> get<00:02:21.000> stuck<00:02:21.330> behind<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you use and get stuck behind that and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.130 
you use and get stuck behind that and
which<00:02:23.880> will<00:02:24.030> cause<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.360> line<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.660> break<00:02:24.900> and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
which will cause the line to break and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.050 
which will cause the line to break and
of<00:02:25.200> course<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.470> don't<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.980> want<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.490> so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
of course you don't want it want that so

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.900 
of course you don't want it want that so
what<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:28.310> there<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.400> there's<00:02:29.610> two<00:02:29.760> things

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
what I do there is there's two things

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.510 
what I do there is there's two things
you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.270> actually<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.720> put<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.900> bit<00:02:31.050> of

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
you can do actually you can put a bit of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.580 
you can do actually you can put a bit of
shrink<00:02:32.520> tube<00:02:32.700> over<00:02:33.060> its<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.420> know<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.720> tube

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
shrink tube over its you know the tube

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.229 
shrink tube over its you know the tube
that<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.830> put<00:02:35.040> over<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.370> heat<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.880> it

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
that you put over to heat it and it

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.740 
that you put over to heat it and it
shrinks<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:37.320> which<00:02:37.500> would<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> job<00:02:39.090> but

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
shrinks that which would do the job but

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.530 
shrinks that which would do the job but
what<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.930> even<00:02:40.020> nicer<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.709> I've<00:02:41.270> prepared<00:02:42.270> one

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
what is even nicer and I've prepared one

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.090 
what is even nicer and I've prepared one
here<00:02:43.730> what's<00:02:44.730> even<00:02:45.000> nicer<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.769> when<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.890> use<00:02:46.920> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
here what's even nicer is when you use a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.550 
here what's even nicer is when you use a
little<00:02:47.340> bit<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.580> araldite<00:02:48.030> two<00:02:48.750> components<00:02:49.350> or

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
little bit of araldite two components or

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.370 
little bit of araldite two components or
any<00:02:49.830> other<00:02:50.010> components<00:02:50.580> component<00:02:51.120> glue<00:02:51.380> and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
any other components component glue and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.509 
any other components component glue and
you<00:02:52.470> make<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> nice<00:02:53.030> little<00:02:54.049> smooth<00:02:55.049> blob<00:02:55.769> that

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
you make a nice little smooth blob that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.640 
you make a nice little smooth blob that
covers<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.209> little<00:02:57.540> little<00:02:57.930> sticky<00:02:58.530> out

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
covers that little little sticky out

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.270 
covers that little little sticky out
piece<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.459> line<00:02:59.730> now<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.799> if<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:02.040> do<00:03:02.160> it

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
piece of line now in this if you do it

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.580 
piece of line now in this if you do it
this<00:03:02.400> way<00:03:02.610> there's<00:03:03.120> no<00:03:03.480> way<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.930> line<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.290> can

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
this way there's no way the line it can

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.420 
this way there's no way the line it can
ever<00:03:04.799> get<00:03:05.010> stuck<00:03:05.700> behind<00:03:06.150> anything<00:03:06.720> at<00:03:06.810> all

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
ever get stuck behind anything at all

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.560 
ever get stuck behind anything at all
that's<00:03:08.430> for<00:03:08.820> me<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.030> any<00:03:09.150> way<00:03:09.209> that's<00:03:09.480> a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
that's for me in any way that's a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.699 
that's for me in any way that's a
perfect<00:03:09.930> jerkbait<00:03:10.410> trace<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:13.560> that

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
perfect jerkbait trace so it's that

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.970 
perfect jerkbait trace so it's that
simple<00:03:13.920> really<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.370> soup<00:03:14.580> you've<00:03:15.000> done<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.239> in

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
simple really it soup you've done it in

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.050 
simple really it soup you've done it in
what<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> minute<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:19.640> sometimes<00:03:20.640> after<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
what a minute and sometimes after the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.490 
what a minute and sometimes after the
after<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.540> caught<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> fish<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.170> might<00:03:22.350> be

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
after you caught a fish it might be

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500 
after you caught a fish it might be
slightly<00:03:23.190> bent<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.120> always<00:03:24.360> very

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
slightly bent but it's always very

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.900 
slightly bent but it's always very
simple<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.320> straighten<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.250> again<00:03:28.670> as<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.820> can

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
simple to straighten it again as you can

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.610 
simple to straighten it again as you can
see<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.269> video<00:03:30.360> i<00:03:30.570> was<00:03:30.840> using<00:03:31.080> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
see in the video i was using a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.310 
see in the video i was using a
fluorocarbon<00:03:32.610> trace<00:03:33.360> for<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.750> jerk<00:03:33.930> baton

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
fluorocarbon trace for the jerk baton

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.410 
fluorocarbon trace for the jerk baton
and<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:36.120> really<00:03:36.360> is<00:03:36.480> very<00:03:36.690> simple<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.049> make

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
and it really is very simple to make

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.060 
and it really is very simple to make
what<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.570> would<00:03:40.200> do<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.590> take<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> line

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
what you would do you take the line

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.710 
what you would do you take the line
through<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.489> true<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.150> snap<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:44.820> put<00:03:45.030> two

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
through the true to snap and you put two

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.970 
through the true to snap and you put two
sleeves<00:03:46.680> or<00:03:47.070> crimps<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:49.049> crimp<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.829> which

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
sleeves or crimps and you crimp it which

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.770 
sleeves or crimps and you crimp it which
either<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:50.519> pliers<00:03:51.000> like<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.480> not<00:03:51.660> too

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
either with pliers like this not too

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.640 
either with pliers like this not too
hard<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.109> course<00:03:52.139> you<00:03:52.410> don't

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
hard of course you don't

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.890 
hard of course you don't
to<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.950> don't<00:03:53.129> want<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.310> cut<00:03:53.459> through<00:03:53.610> it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
to you don't want to cut through it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.720 
to you don't want to cut through it
there<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.019> special<00:03:55.290> pliers<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.040> actually

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
there is a special pliers that actually

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.960 
there is a special pliers that actually
meant<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:57.900> use<00:03:58.530> for<00:03:58.769> crimps<00:03:59.099> it<00:03:59.549> works<00:03:59.790> like

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
meant to use for crimps it works like

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.330 
meant to use for crimps it works like
this<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:01.019> put<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.260> in<00:04:01.319> a<00:04:01.439> little<00:04:01.560> slot<00:04:02.069> here

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
this you put it in a little slot here

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.539 
this you put it in a little slot here
and<00:04:02.760> your<00:04:02.879> crimp<00:04:03.379> but<00:04:04.379> I<00:04:04.409> most<00:04:05.159> of<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.340> time<00:04:05.519> I

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
and your crimp but I most of the time I

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.619 
and your crimp but I most of the time I
just<00:04:05.640> use<00:04:05.909> that<00:04:05.939> one<00:04:07.069> on<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.370> other<00:04:08.489> side<00:04:08.760> just

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
just use that one on the other side just

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.690 
just use that one on the other side just
like<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:10.019> see<00:04:10.200> you've<00:04:10.439> seen<00:04:10.680> with<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.010> with

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
like you see you've seen with the with

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.429 
like you see you've seen with the with
the<00:04:11.819> metal<00:04:12.090> metal<00:04:12.510> trays<00:04:12.750> metal<00:04:13.109> jerkbait

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
the metal metal trays metal jerkbait

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.870 
the metal metal trays metal jerkbait
race<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.950> make<00:04:14.760> another<00:04:15.030> little<00:04:15.239> blob<00:04:15.840> of

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
race I make another little blob of

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.789 
race I make another little blob of
superglue<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.539> line<00:04:18.720> doesn't<00:04:18.900> get<00:04:19.139> caught

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
superglue so the line doesn't get caught

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.920 
superglue so the line doesn't get caught
behind<00:04:20.009> it<00:04:20.280> sticky<00:04:20.729> out<00:04:20.820> bit<00:04:21.030> there<00:04:21.239> so

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
behind it sticky out bit there so

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.120 
behind it sticky out bit there so
completely<00:04:22.350> smooth<00:04:22.710> same<00:04:23.580> ID<00:04:24.350> make<00:04:25.350> sure<00:04:25.590> you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
completely smooth same ID make sure you

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.770 
completely smooth same ID make sure you
use<00:04:26.160> very<00:04:26.580> good<00:04:26.760> components<00:04:27.360> very<00:04:27.570> good

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
use very good components very good

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.400 
use very good components very good
quality<00:04:28.380> snaps<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.419> very<00:04:30.419> good<00:04:30.570> quality<00:04:30.750> the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
quality snaps and very good quality the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.350 
quality snaps and very good quality the
swivels<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:32.039> really<00:04:32.370> really<00:04:32.610> vital<00:04:33.000> because

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
swivels it's really really vital because
