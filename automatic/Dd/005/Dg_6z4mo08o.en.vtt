00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
north is that you always got to be

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.820 
north is that you always got to be
careful<00:04:52.150> where<00:04:52.689> your<00:04:52.840> fuel<00:04:53.139> stops<00:04:53.469> are

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
careful where your fuel stops are

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.489 
careful where your fuel stops are
because<00:04:54.249> I<00:04:54.639> like<00:04:55.240> for<00:04:55.479> existence<00:04:56.080> here<00:04:56.289> I<00:04:56.409> just

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:56.499 
because I like for existence here I just

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.010 
because I like for existence here I just
want<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.830> test<00:04:57.009> my<00:04:57.189> range<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.699> my<00:04:57.819> vehicle<00:04:58.360> but

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
want to test my range of my vehicle but

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.739 
want to test my range of my vehicle but
fuel<00:04:59.650> stops<00:04:59.949> are<00:05:00.189> few<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.729> far<00:05:01.029> between<00:05:01.090> and

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:01.749 
fuel stops are few and far between and

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.589 
fuel stops are few and far between and
places<00:05:02.529> you<00:05:02.650> think<00:05:03.009> that<00:05:03.159> have<00:05:03.340> fuel<00:05:03.669> have

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
places you think that have fuel have

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.420 
places you think that have fuel have
been<00:05:04.870> closed<00:05:05.199> down<00:05:05.469> so<00:05:05.949> that's<00:05:06.129> why<00:05:06.279> it's

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
been closed down so that's why it's

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:18.019 
been closed down so that's why it's
always<00:05:06.639> good<00:05:06.999> to<00:05:07.029> carry<00:05:07.479> extra<00:05:07.749> fuel<00:05:08.259> with<00:05:08.469> you

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:20.820 

so<00:05:19.029> from<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.539> fuel<00:05:19.810> like<00:05:19.990> two<00:05:20.199> fuel<00:05:20.529> cans

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
so from the fuel like two fuel cans

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.089 
so from the fuel like two fuel cans
almost<00:05:21.430> gave<00:05:21.819> me<00:05:22.029> back<00:05:22.330> up<00:05:22.539> to<00:05:22.779> three<00:05:23.770> quarters

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
almost gave me back up to three quarters

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:39.910 
almost gave me back up to three quarters
almost<00:05:24.789> so<00:05:25.029> gives<00:05:25.960> me<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.139> pretty<00:05:26.379> good<00:05:26.529> range
