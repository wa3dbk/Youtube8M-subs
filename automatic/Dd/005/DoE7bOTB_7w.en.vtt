crack and grumpy bear within the app

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.750 
crack and grumpy bear within the app
they<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.610> thing<00:01:11.670> called<00:01:11.939> endpoint<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
they have this thing called endpoint and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.240 
they have this thing called endpoint and
I<00:01:14.760> guess<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.560> another<00:01:16.560> thing<00:01:17.009> within

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.090 

I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:54.610> it's<00:01:54.760> every<00:01:55.380> 200<00:01:56.380> points<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.070> a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
I think it's every 200 points is a

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.330 
I think it's every 200 points is a
dollar<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.880> can<00:02:01.270> trade<00:02:02.260> them<00:02:02.410> in<00:02:02.530> for<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.860> gift

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
dollar you can trade them in for a gift

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.710 
dollar you can trade them in for a gift
card<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:04.510> i<00:02:05.140> think<00:02:05.410> that's<00:02:06.030> 10,000<00:02:07.030> points<00:02:07.390> and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
card so i think that's 10,000 points and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.680 
card so i think that's 10,000 points and
up<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.760> enter<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:13.090> use<00:02:13.510> your
