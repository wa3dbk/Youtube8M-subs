actually let you see it and if I cut

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:07.010 
actually let you see it and if I cut
down<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.760> this<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.610> anyway<00:01:05.880> that's<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.869> major

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
down like this but anyway that's a major

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.399 
down like this but anyway that's a major
growth<00:01:07.350> I've<00:01:08.310> been<00:01:08.460> reading<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> couple<00:01:08.850> forums

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409

i<00:01:12.180> already<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.140> that'll<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:13.920> away<00:01:14.119> so

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
i already do that and that'll go away so

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that I bought this little mag float and

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.649 
that I bought this little mag float and
I<00:02:20.319> like<00:02:20.620> its<00:02:20.830> size<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:21.430> cute<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:21.879> but<00:02:21.909> it

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
I like its size it's cute and all but it

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.860 
I like its size it's cute and all but it
really<00:02:23.459> kind<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.549> sucks<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.090> know<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.480> magnet

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
really kind of sucks you know the magnet

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.339 
really kind of sucks you know the magnet
in<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.470> not<00:02:26.799> as<00:02:27.099> strong<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:28.330> guess<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
in it is not as strong as I guess the

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.530 
in it is not as strong as I guess the
medium-sized<00:02:30.220> one<00:02:30.519> then<00:02:30.970> I'm<00:02:31.090> used<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.330> use

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
medium-sized one then I'm used to use

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.960 
medium-sized one then I'm used to use
them<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.220> kind<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.519> little<00:02:33.819> bit

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
them so it's kind of a little bit
