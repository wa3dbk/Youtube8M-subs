this<00:00:19.109> particular<00:00:19.380> video<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.520> can

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
this particular video is how we can

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.660 
this particular video is how we can
insert<00:00:21.630> some<00:00:21.890> JavaScript<00:00:22.890> inside<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.550> our

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
insert some JavaScript inside of our

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
insert some JavaScript inside of our
sections<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> can<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.380> right<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:25.740> so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
sections as you can see right here so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
sections as you can see right here so
there's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> couple<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.269> things<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> want

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
there's a couple of things that I want

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.470 
there's a couple of things that I want
to<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.349> perhaps<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.119> right

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
to do perhaps what we can do is right

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600 
to do perhaps what we can do is right
underneath<00:00:30.810> these<00:00:31.410> links<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.340> add<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
underneath these links we can add a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
underneath these links we can add a
little<00:00:33.210> bit<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> content<00:00:34.140> down<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> bottom

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
little bit of content down at the bottom

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.580 
little bit of content down at the bottom
here<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.180> we're<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.840> cluttering<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.440> our

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
here so we're kind of cluttering up our

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.560 
here so we're kind of cluttering up our
page<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.550> hypothetically<00:00:39.090> speaking

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
page I know but hypothetically speaking

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.479 
page I know but hypothetically speaking
let's<00:00:39.870> imagine<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.710> did<00:00:41.010> have<00:00:41.250> this

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
let's imagine we did have this

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.819 
let's imagine we did have this
information<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.690> perhaps<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.620> could<00:00:43.770> have

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
information or perhaps we could have

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.000 
information or perhaps we could have
even<00:00:44.070> inserted<00:00:44.910> something<00:00:45.329> else<00:00:45.680> right<00:00:46.680> under

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
even inserted something else right under

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.420 
even inserted something else right under
here<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.610> wish<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.480> let's<00:00:49.289> say<00:00:49.710> perhaps<00:00:50.190> we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
here if we wish so let's say perhaps we

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.790 
here if we wish so let's say perhaps we
can<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.239> side<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.770> just

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
can do it on this side so here I'm just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.520 
can do it on this side so here I'm just
going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.370> insert<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.539> new<00:00:55.460> paragraph<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.530> once

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
going to insert a new paragraph and once

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
going to insert a new paragraph and once
we<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.920> paragraph<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.820> place<00:01:00.210> what

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
we have that paragraph in place what

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
we have that paragraph in place what
we're<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.379> doing<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
we're going to be doing with that is to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149 
we're going to be doing with that is to
have<00:01:03.449> our<00:01:03.570> cursor<00:01:03.960> embedded<00:01:04.409> right<00:01:04.680> over<00:01:04.949> here

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
have our cursor embedded right over here

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.570 
have our cursor embedded right over here
on<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.430> section<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.540> you'll<00:01:06.750> notice<00:01:06.990> that

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
JavaScript but it doesn't know where to

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.159 
JavaScript but it doesn't know where to
find<00:06:26.490> it<00:06:26.759> and<00:06:26.849> you'll<00:06:27.240> notice<00:06:27.630> we<00:06:27.779> need<00:06:27.990> the

your cursor right before the closing of
that<00:06:32.130> opening<00:06:32.610> tag<00:06:33.050> put<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.199> space<00:06:34.680> there<00:06:35.130> and

that opening tag put a space there and

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.649 
that opening tag put a space there and
you'll<00:06:35.399> see<00:06:35.550> the<00:06:35.669> little<00:06:35.849> drop<00:06:36.180> down<00:06:36.419> and

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.379 
you'll see the little drop down and
we'll<00:06:36.810> say<00:06:37.050> double-click<00:06:37.680> on<00:06:37.860> source<00:06:38.240> so<00:06:39.240> when

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
we'll say double-click on source so when

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.690 
we'll say double-click on source so when
you<00:06:39.509> do<00:06:39.690> that<00:06:39.960> it's<00:06:40.380> going<00:06:40.500> to

there we've reduced that to this one
simple<00:07:41.240> line<00:07:41.450> instead<00:07:42.050> of<00:07:42.110> like<00:07:42.350> 20<00:07:42.800> lines<00:07:43.040> of

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.220 
simple line instead of like 20 lines of

simple line instead of like 20 lines of

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 
code all of that code has been

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.250 
code all of that code has been

jeaious<00:07:48.980> file<00:07:49.400> isn't<00:07:50.000> that<00:07:50.180> great<00:07:50.360> so<00:07:50.680> that's

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 
jeaious file isn't that great so that's

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.530

Dreamweaver and when we come back we'll

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.580 
Dreamweaver and when we come back we'll
