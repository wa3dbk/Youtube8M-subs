00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
about this year is our jet diffusion so

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.170 
about this year is our jet diffusion so
jet<00:01:05.560> diffusion<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:06.160> our<00:01:06.280> ventilation<00:01:06.670> system

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
jet diffusion is our ventilation system

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.000 
jet diffusion is our ventilation system
which<00:01:07.750> as<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.080> air<00:01:08.230> travels<00:01:08.740> through<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
which as the air travels through the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.650 
which as the air travels through the
helmet<00:01:09.340> he'll<00:01:09.520> either<00:01:09.670> diffuse<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.240> air<00:01:10.360> down

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
helmet he'll either diffuse the air down

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.690 
helmet he'll either diffuse the air down
through<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.990> goggles<00:01:11.410> or<00:01:11.860> out<00:01:12.100> through<00:01:12.460> the
