on a video in the last couple of weeks

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.649 
on a video in the last couple of weeks
but<00:00:18.050> been<00:00:19.050> overhauling<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:23.119> rotary<00:00:24.119> table

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:24.659

indexer and control box I completely

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.840 
indexer and control box I completely
rebuilt<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.099> new<00:00:29.939> controller<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.730> worked<00:00:32.730> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
rebuilt it new controller and worked a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
rebuilt it new controller and worked a
bit<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.360> software<00:00:33.829> but<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:37.430> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
bit on the software but this is it the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.310 
bit on the software but this is it the
controller<00:00:38.850> everything's<00:00:39.480> inside<00:00:39.720> they've

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
controller everything's inside they've

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.790 
controller everything's inside they've
got<00:00:40.530> an<00:00:40.620> external<00:00:41.360> 24<00:00:42.360> volts<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.810> our<00:00:43.020> supply

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
got an external 24 volts of our supply

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
got an external 24 volts of our supply
that<00:00:44.100> supplies<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.590> power<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:48.260> stepper

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that supplies the power to the stepper

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.220 
that supplies the power to the stepper
and<00:00:51.380> you<00:00:52.380> can<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.740> the<00:00:53.510> stepper<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.900> and

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
and you can see the stepper there and

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.030 
and you can see the stepper there and
what<00:00:58.230> i'm<00:00:58.410> doing<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.130> is<00:00:59.750> i'm<00:01:00.750> setting<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
what i'm doing here is i'm setting up to

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.670 
what i'm doing here is i'm setting up to
do<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> camshaft<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:06.290> we're<00:01:07.290> pretty<00:01:07.439> well

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
do the camshaft and we're pretty well

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.270 
do the camshaft and we're pretty well
there<00:01:10.370> why<00:01:11.370> i<00:01:11.400> wanted<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.280> controller

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
there why i wanted to use the controller

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.260 
there why i wanted to use the controller
is<00:01:14.900> that<00:01:15.900> i<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.170> set<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.650> where<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.270> move

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
is that i can set it up where I move

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.540 
is that i can set it up where I move
this<00:01:18.480> one<00:01:18.780> degree<00:01:19.200> exactly<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:22.550> adjust

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
this one degree exactly and then adjust

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:36.039 
this one degree exactly and then adjust
the<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:30.140> knee<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:33.799> required<00:01:34.799> amount<00:01:35.040> of

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
the the knee the required amount of

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:44.980 
the the knee the required amount of
movement<00:01:39.620> from<00:01:42.229> from<00:01:43.229> his<00:01:43.380> zero<00:01:43.680> point<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
movement from from his zero point and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.690 
movement from from his zero point and
that<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.560> mill<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.070> lobes<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.670> these

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
that way I can mill the lobes on these

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.480 
that way I can mill the lobes on these
two<00:01:50.700> gear<00:01:51.210> blocks<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:52.310> actually<00:01:53.310> there's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
two gear blocks here actually there's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.990 
two gear blocks here actually there's
two<00:01:53.520> lobes<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.420> rod<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.280> attached

chart starts at 295 degrees and
increments<00:03:17.700> up<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:19.560> tells<00:03:19.950> how<00:03:20.310> far<00:03:21.299> I

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
increments up and it tells how far I

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.180 
increments up and it tells how far I
need<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.900> lift<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:24.359> cutter<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.410> or<00:03:25.739> drop<00:03:25.980> the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
need to lift the cutter and or drop the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:35.170 
need to lift the cutter and or drop the
table<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.690> first<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.840> first<00:03:33.840> three

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
table so first of all the first three

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.160 
table so first of all the first three
increments<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.329> just<00:03:37.280> go<00:03:38.280> straight<00:03:38.640> across

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
increments I just go straight across

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.949 
increments I just go straight across
I've<00:03:40.170> got<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.440> zero<00:03:41.010> down<00:03:41.370> here<00:03:41.640> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
I've got a zero down here on the on the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.039 
I've got a zero down here on the on the
flat<00:03:43.650> that's<00:03:44.370> zero<00:03:44.850> position<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:47.900> here<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.019> go

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.970 
ball on the end of it in polish that and
then

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
then

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.330 
then
i<00:06:33.100> scented<00:06:33.760> a<00:06:33.850> flat<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:35.620> this<00:06:35.860> little<00:06:36.160> set

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
i scented a flat so this little set

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:43.110 
i scented a flat so this little set
screw<00:06:36.370> here<00:06:36.880> would<00:06:39.750> have<00:06:40.750> a<00:06:40.840> place<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:42.120> grab

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
screw here would have a place to grab

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.390 
screw here would have a place to grab
the<00:06:43.480> feeler<00:06:44.230> and<00:06:44.970> I've<00:06:45.970> screwed<00:06:46.270> in<00:06:46.450> the<00:06:47.400> anti

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
the feeler and I've screwed in the anti

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:56.630 
the feeler and I've screwed in the anti
rotational<00:06:50.130> thing<00:06:51.130> in<00:06:51.340> nola<00:06:51.900> I'll<00:06:52.900> show<00:06:53.290> you

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.060 

that's<00:06:57.640> probably<00:06:58.120> moving<00:06:58.600> about<00:06:59.070> two-tenths

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
that's probably moving about two-tenths

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.530 
that's probably moving about two-tenths
maybe<00:07:01.110> over<00:07:02.110> 10<00:07:02.470> inches<00:07:02.500> which<00:07:03.070> is<00:07:03.280> i<00:07:03.550> think<00:07:04.150> is

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 
maybe over 10 inches which is i think is

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.410 
maybe over 10 inches which is i think is
excellent<00:07:05.020> and<00:07:05.280> as<00:07:06.280> you<00:07:06.430> can<00:07:06.640> see<00:07:07.440> just

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.420 
excellent and as you can see just

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.840 
excellent and as you can see just
travels<00:07:10.420> through<00:07:10.540> the<00:07:10.660> wall<00:07:11.310> and<00:07:12.310> that<00:07:12.490> way<00:07:12.670> is

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
travels through the wall and that way is

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:23.100 
travels through the wall and that way is
not<00:07:15.750> not<00:07:16.750> scraping<00:07:17.500> up<00:07:17.740> my<00:07:20.310> disc<00:07:21.310> brake<00:07:22.240> these

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
not not scraping up my disc brake these

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.410 
not not scraping up my disc brake these
things<00:07:23.380> are<00:07:23.680> mill<00:07:24.460> or<00:07:24.850> I<00:07:25.320> turned<00:07:26.320> and<00:07:27.420> ground

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420 
things are mill or I turned and ground

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.020 
things are mill or I turned and ground
where<00:07:28.900> they're<00:07:30.780> perfectly<00:07:31.780> flat<00:07:32.760> from<00:07:33.760> front

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
where they're perfectly flat from front

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.290 
where they're perfectly flat from front
to<00:07:34.090> back<00:07:34.150> and<00:07:34.690> so<00:07:35.670> you<00:07:36.670> pretty<00:07:36.910> well<00:07:37.090> be

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
to back and so you pretty well be

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.350 
to back and so you pretty well be
assured<00:07:38.100> this<00:07:39.100> thing<00:07:39.400> is<00:07:39.550> trimmed<00:07:39.940> in<00:07:40.150> both

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
assured this thing is trimmed in both

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.530 
assured this thing is trimmed in both
directions<00:07:41.160> within<00:07:42.160> two<00:07:42.610> or<00:07:42.640> three<00:07:42.760> tents<00:07:43.360> and

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:43.540 
directions within two or three tents and

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:50.400 
directions within two or three tents and
that's<00:07:43.720> just<00:07:44.710> a<00:07:44.860> matter<00:07:45.100> of<00:07:48.900> doing<00:07:49.900> the<00:07:50.080> bolts

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:50.410 
that's just a matter of doing the bolts

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.100 
that's just a matter of doing the bolts
until<00:07:50.560> you<00:07:50.800> get<00:07:51.040> what<00:07:51.220> what<00:07:51.730> you<00:07:51.880> want<00:07:52.120> and

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.110 
until you get what what you want and

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.590 
until you get what what you want and
just<00:07:53.140> running<00:07:53.650> it<00:07:53.860> and<00:07:54.730> build<00:07:55.060> on<00:07:55.300> the<00:07:55.420> real

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:55.600 
just running it and build on the real

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.750 
just running it and build on the real
slow<00:07:55.900> speed<00:07:56.290> here<00:07:57.150> so<00:07:58.740> that's<00:07:59.740> that's<00:08:00.550> how

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:00.760 
slow speed here so that's that's how

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.600 
slow speed here so that's that's how
I've<00:08:00.910> trim<00:08:01.150> a<00:08:01.330> mill<00:08:01.680> now<00:08:02.680> all<00:08:02.890> I<00:08:02.950> need<00:08:03.160> to<00:08:03.220> do<00:08:03.460> is

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:03.610 
I've trim a mill now all I need to do is

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.670 
I've trim a mill now all I need to do is
tighten<00:08:03.910> up<00:08:04.120> the<00:08:04.360> bolts<00:08:04.870> and<00:08:05.350> check<00:08:06.250> it<00:08:06.370> again
