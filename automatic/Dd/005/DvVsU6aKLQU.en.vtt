00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
mechanism I don't have a key for it so I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.109 
mechanism I don't have a key for it so I
can't<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.490> there<00:00:26.609> there's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.849> bunch<00:00:27.060> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's five cents let you take a look at

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's five cents let you take a look at
this<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.970> better<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.650> I've<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this little better here I've got the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.530 
this little better here I've got the
back<00:01:14.189> door<00:01:14.490> off<00:01:14.810> it'll<00:01:15.810> take<00:01:16.020> coins<00:01:17.479> but<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
back door off it'll take coins but I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.950 
back door off it'll take coins but I
can't<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> mechanism<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> spin<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.600> she

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
can't get the mechanism to spin but she

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.370 
can't get the mechanism to spin but she
doesn't<00:01:23.420> go<00:01:24.420> down<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:27.090> spend<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.080> see

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
doesn't go down and spend as you can see

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
doesn't go down and spend as you can see
I<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.579> looks<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.060> complete<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
I can so it looks to be complete it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.730 
I can so it looks to be complete it
don't<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> key<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.740> there's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
don't have a key for it and that there's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.649 
don't have a key for it and that there's
a<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:38.100> door<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:39.000> goes<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> back

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a back door here it goes on the back

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.039 
a back door here it goes on the back
obviously<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.909> goes<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
obviously this goes on here like that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.370 
obviously this goes on here like that
the<00:01:44.009> locks<00:01:44.250> already<00:01:44.610> been<00:01:44.759> taken<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.380> it's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the locks already been taken out it's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.010 
the locks already been taken out it's
got<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> little<00:01:46.770> peephole<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:48.990> on

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
got a little peephole here and then on

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.130 
got a little peephole here and then on
the<00:01:49.290> bottom<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> unit<00:01:50.659> we<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> number

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the bottom of the unit we have a number

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.859 
the bottom of the unit we have a number
that<00:01:52.619> says<00:01:54.200> 14<00:01:55.200> 0<00:01:55.710> 37<00:01:56.430> does<00:01:56.969> not<00:01:57.149> say<00:01:57.420> Duvall

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that says 14 0 37 does not say Duvall

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.539 
that says 14 0 37 does not say Duvall
but<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> does<00:01:59.040> say<00:01:59.280> Duvall<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:01.590> score<00:02:02.340> real

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
but it does say Duvall on the score real

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.940 
but it does say Duvall on the score real
so<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.060> made<00:02:03.299> by<00:02:03.479> Duvall<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.290> you

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
so we know it's made by Duvall and you

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.130 
so we know it's made by Duvall and you
get<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> good<00:02:05.340> view<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.450> internal<00:02:07.110> workings

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
get a good view of the internal workings

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.759 
get a good view of the internal workings
of<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
of this

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.670 
of this
and<00:02:09.769> that<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.549> does<00:02:10.849> accept<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.420> nickel<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.560> it's

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and that it does accept a nickel so it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.929 
and that it does accept a nickel so it's
going<00:02:12.799> to<00:02:12.889> need<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.159> be<00:02:13.280> serviced<00:02:13.670> if<00:02:13.819> you
