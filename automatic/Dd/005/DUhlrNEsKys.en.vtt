maybe<00:01:59.530> three<00:01:59.950> hours<00:02:00.100> we're<00:02:00.700> going<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.940> take

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
maybe three hours we're going to take

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.750 
maybe three hours we're going to take
one<00:02:01.510> cup<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.780> cream<00:02:02.790> into<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:04.000> saucepan<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:05.760> 25

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
one cup of cream into a saucepan and 25

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.999 
one cup of cream into a saucepan and 25
grams<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.330> superfine<00:02:07.930> sugar<00:02:07.990> that's<00:02:08.470> castor

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
grams of superfine sugar that's castor

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.660 
grams of superfine sugar that's castor
sugar<00:02:09.039> it's<00:02:10.000> about<00:02:10.179> one<00:02:10.450> ounce<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:12.310> start<00:02:12.520> to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
sugar it's about one ounce just start to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.480 
sugar it's about one ounce just start to
mix<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.030> through<00:02:13.270> over<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> heat<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.490> I'm

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
mix that through over a heat and I'm

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340 
mix that through over a heat and I'm
just<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.850> add<00:02:16.000> one<00:02:16.240> teaspoon<00:02:16.870> of

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
just going to add one teaspoon of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.230 
just going to add one teaspoon of
vanilla<00:02:17.410> extract<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:18.370> there<00:02:18.400> as<00:02:18.670> well<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
vanilla extract in there as well for a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.980 
vanilla extract in there as well for a
little<00:02:19.300> flavor<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.150> very<00:02:22.480> similar<00:02:22.870> to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
little flavor so this is very similar to

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.900 
little flavor so this is very similar to
the<00:02:23.140> way<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.290> make<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> panna<00:02:23.920> cotta<00:02:24.040> it's<00:02:24.580> not

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
the way you make a panna cotta it's not

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.370 
the way you make a panna cotta it's not
really<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> panna<00:02:25.720> cotta<00:02:25.780> because<00:02:26.170> I'm<00:02:26.260> going

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
really a panna cotta because I'm going

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.199 
really a panna cotta because I'm going
to<00:02:26.440> set<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.950> little<00:02:27.160> bit<00:02:27.340> firmer<00:02:27.610> with<00:02:27.880> extra

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
to set it a little bit firmer with extra

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.360 
to set it a little bit firmer with extra
gelatine<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:29.200> very<00:02:29.739> similar<00:02:30.010> than<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
gelatine but very similar than the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.729 
gelatine but very similar than the
principles<00:02:30.790> are<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:30.970> same<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:32.410> as<00:02:32.560> this

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
principles are the same now as this

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.400 
principles are the same now as this

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
when it's near a simmer I'm taking two

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.650 
when it's near a simmer I'm taking two
teaspoons<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.680> unflavored<00:02:39.180> gelatine<00:02:40.180> now<00:02:40.600> you

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
teaspoons of unflavored gelatine now you

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.610 
teaspoons of unflavored gelatine now you
could<00:02:40.959> use<00:02:41.550> two<00:02:42.550> of<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:42.820> gelatine<00:02:43.330> leaves<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
could use two of the gelatine leaves and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.830 
could use two of the gelatine leaves and
I'm<00:02:44.770> just<00:02:44.950> going<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.160> sprinkle<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:46.060> over<00:02:46.270> the

cool down but it's still runny and I

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.340 
cool down but it's still runny and I
poured<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.120> into<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.420> little<00:03:13.600> pouring<00:03:14.140> glass

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
poured it into a little pouring glass

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.050 
poured it into a little pouring glass
and<00:03:14.620> we've<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:14.890> got<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.070> very<00:03:15.280> carefully<00:03:15.880> now

pour it in on top of the blue and again
we're<00:03:18.940> looking<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.360> about<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:19.600> third<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
we're looking for about a third of the

we're looking for about a third of the
way<00:03:21.760> up<00:03:22.060> another<00:03:22.660> third

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.180 

and<00:03:31.300> now<00:03:31.840> they're<00:03:32.080> ready<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.410> go<00:03:32.620> back<00:03:32.890> in<00:03:33.070> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
and now they're ready to go back in the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.800 
and now they're ready to go back in the
fridge<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:33.400> another<00:03:33.670> two<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.270> three<00:03:34.510> hours

okay once your white jelly has set and

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.699 
okay once your white jelly has set and
that<00:03:40.970> takes<00:03:41.209> two<00:03:41.569> or<00:03:41.659> three<00:03:41.900> hours<00:03:42.290> we're
