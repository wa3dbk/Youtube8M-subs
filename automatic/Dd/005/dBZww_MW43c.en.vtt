00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.070
 one of the keys to success in 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.679
 plant breeding is the choice of a 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.329
 good substrate the substrate is nothing but 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.219
 a soil substitute that is to say the 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.619
 land of our garden that we can 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.339
 use on the one hand when we grow 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:24.099
 in container balcony sherds 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.900
 planters and we can also use it 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.339
 outside in this case what 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.249
 we should do is dig a hole 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.740
 generous to put as always stone in the 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.810
 basis to favor drainage and 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.700
 begin to place substrate after 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.110
 we will locate the plant and instead of 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.200
 fill with the soil of our garden 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.990
 what we will do is fill in with the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.970
 substrate in this way that we will win what 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.100
 that we will win will be the capacity of the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.110
 plant to adapt to your new 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.270
 location in the environment the roots are 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.680
 you will find a quality substrate that 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.380
 will make the success of the plantation 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.150
 much older with posar universal is 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.550
 a substrate based on black peat 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.500
 maximum quality and is ideal for 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.960
 development of all types of plants and 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.050
 crops another possible application of the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.470
 substrates is to use them to improve the 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.480
 texture 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.730
 soil structure which in this case 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.980
 we must do is to empty the envelope 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.230
 our garden and extend the once 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.270
 well extended we will proceed to till 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.070
 incorporate it to the ground most 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.080
 Field substrates are based on 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.730
 peat except substrates of 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.000
 orchids where elements are used 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.670
 like the pine bark and well that is the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 peat peat is the product of the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.050
 decomposition of plant remains of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.060
 plants like heather or mosses 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.050
 espanyol and it is a process that occurs 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.360
 natural way and in a few conditions 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.130
 determined of acidity and lack of 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.340
 oxygen 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.710
 this process is relatively slow and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.780
 It is therefore very important to extract the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.820
 peat in a balanced and sustainable way 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.280
 so that the impact on the environment 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.259
 environment be null because we use the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.570
 peat as a base in the substrates of 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.210
 Cultivation peat is a porous material 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.429
 It acts like a sponge and thanks to these 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.369
 pores is able to retain water and the 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.560
 air that are indispensable elements 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.220
 for the plant to grow and feed 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.040
 Correctly 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.140
 but also the peat to the being of 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.580
 organic origin is able to retain 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 well the nutrients that we 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.830
 we will add through fertilizers or 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.350
 fertilizers and two fundamental things its low 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.780
 content in salts and a ph also low 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.760
 these two elements are very very 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.340
 important for the correct development 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.640
 of the crops and what else contains the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.860
 substrates as well as black peat 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.350
 you find here elements like 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.110
 Perlite these little white balls that what 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.640
 they do is favor the drainage also 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.060
 we find other elements as you can 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.770
 be the agro sil that is a stimulator of 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.970
 the root formation this is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.850
 important because in moments of 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.670
 plantation or transplant will improve the 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.620
 ability of the plant to adapt or 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.080
 we also find elements like 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.410
 guano an organic fertilizer of animal origin 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.200
 which will enhance the emission of flowers 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.560
 fruits and the accumulation of aromas and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.989
 pleasures 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.239
 substrates with the passage of time 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.430
 losing those retention properties 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.590
 water and air therefore what 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.050
 you need to do is replace 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.569
 We recommend that the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.690
 change totally or partially every 2-3 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.690
 years
