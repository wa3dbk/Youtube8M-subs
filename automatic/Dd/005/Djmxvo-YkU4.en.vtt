00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.830
 hello all welcome one more day to the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.440
 youtube channel in new germany where 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.879
 Today we are going to analyze the sony xperia z 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.720
 1 , the latest smartphone from the company 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.720
 japanese 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.020
 when we get the sony xperia z 1 from his 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.420
 box the first thing that calls us the 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.640
 attention are its large dimensions and 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.169
 this is fundamentally due to the fact that in 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.599
 the lower part of the 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.030
 screen presents some very frames 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.980
 wide when we turn around the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.620
 terminal we find the camera 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.840
 main which is a 20.7 lens 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 megapixels with sony image sensor 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.079
 exmor for mobile 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.670
 on the sides is where we 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.559
 we find the only buttons 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.239
 physical of the terminal that would be the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.579
 On and off to go up and down 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.620
 the volume and to shoot photographs 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.870
 in these same laterals we 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.379
 we find with the different slots 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.379
 to introduce the micro sim the micro sd 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.960
 and the different connectors focusing 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.330
 already from the most technical data say that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 xperia z1 mounted a screen five 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.540
 inch tri luminous full hd with engine 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 of image and reality 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.570
 then already focusing on its interior 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.560
 and incorporates a snapdragon 800 processor 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.050
 that yields 22 gigahertz of power 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.790
 complemented by a ram of 2GB 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.619
 that will move without any problem 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.929
 the android operating system in its 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 version of living besides allowing us 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.290
 navigate through the various menus with 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
 very fluent 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.120
 then let's proceed to a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.000
 example so that you yourselves can 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.570
 to appreciate 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.570
 and 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.180
 with the analysis tell you that memory 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.340
 internal of the xperia z1 is 16 gigabytes 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.410
 although we are able to increase it 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.880
 thanks to the microsd card slot 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.160
 that incorporates on the side 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.190
 but without a doubt the section more 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.810
 highlight of the xperia z1 is the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.720
 photographic since on its reverse 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.200
 incorporates a 20 7 megapixel camera 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 with image sensor sony exmor rs that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.220
 will allow us to take contest photos and 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.750
 so that you see yourselves

 quality now let's make a 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.900

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.110
 and a lot 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.910

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.950
 weeks trying the experience is one 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.320
