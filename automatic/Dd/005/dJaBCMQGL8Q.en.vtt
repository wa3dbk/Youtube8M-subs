if<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:21.039> were<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.340> rate<00:04:21.489> this<00:04:21.729> saxophone<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.600> will

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
if I were to rate this saxophone I will

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.570 
if I were to rate this saxophone I will
give<00:04:23.080> this<00:04:23.410> saxophone<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:25.830> 7<00:04:26.830> point<00:04:27.010> 5<00:04:27.280> out<00:04:27.550> of

give this saxophone a 7 point 5 out of
10

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
10

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.240 
10
and<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:29.350> reason<00:04:29.740> being<00:04:29.860> is<00:04:30.250> because<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:33.070> low

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
and the reason being is because the low

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.600 
and the reason being is because the low
range<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.729> bold<00:04:34.660> as<00:04:34.990> they<00:04:35.110> maybe<00:04:35.320> they<00:04:35.740> don't

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
range is bold as they maybe they don't

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.299 
range is bold as they maybe they don't
they<00:04:37.570> don't<00:04:37.600> sing<00:04:38.560> like<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.950> want<00:04:39.130> them<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.340> sink

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:40.309 
they don't sing like I want them to sink

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.509 
they don't sing like I want them to sink
if<00:04:40.819> that<00:04:41.059> makes<00:04:41.179> sense<00:04:41.919> when<00:04:42.919> up<00:04:43.039> when<00:04:43.159> I<00:04:43.249> go<00:04:43.399> to

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:43.519 
if that makes sense when up when I go to

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.459 
if that makes sense when up when I go to
play<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.789> low<00:04:43.939> ranges<00:04:44.419> it's<00:04:44.869> really<00:04:45.229> really

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
play the low ranges it's really really

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.629 
play the low ranges it's really really
good<00:04:45.829> but<00:04:46.279> it's<00:04:47.269> not<00:04:47.599> as<00:04:47.929> rosy<00:04:48.499> as<00:04:48.829> I<00:04:49.309> want<00:04:49.549> it

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
good but it's not as rosy as I want it

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.309 
good but it's not as rosy as I want it
to<00:04:49.729> be<00:04:49.939> and<00:04:50.209> I<00:04:50.659> don't<00:04:50.719> really<00:04:50.929> know<00:04:51.109> how<00:04:51.289> to

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
to be and I don't really know how to

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.359 
to be and I don't really know how to
explain<00:04:52.039> that<00:04:52.099> adjective<00:04:52.879> but<00:04:54.009> when<00:04:55.009> I<00:04:55.039> play

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:55.369 
explain that adjective but when I play

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:59.319 
explain that adjective but when I play

saxophone and my cell MERS they tend to

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:05.169 
saxophone and my cell MERS they tend to
be<00:05:02.739> just<00:05:03.739> a<00:05:03.859> tad<00:05:04.429> bit<00:05:04.459> difference<00:05:04.999> it's<00:05:05.119> a

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:05.179 
be just a tad bit difference it's a

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:06.999 
be just a tad bit difference it's a
subtle<00:05:05.419> difference<00:05:05.929> but<00:05:05.989> it's<00:05:06.409> a<00:05:06.499> lot<00:05:06.679> better

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
subtle difference but it's a lot better

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:13.329 
subtle difference but it's a lot better
it's<00:05:07.279> a<00:05:08.529> more<00:05:09.529> fuller<00:05:10.219> sound<00:05:11.109> I<00:05:12.159> can<00:05:13.159> really

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:13.339 
it's a more fuller sound I can really

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.579 
it's a more fuller sound I can really
control<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.879> lower<00:05:14.089> ranges<00:05:14.539> so<00:05:14.779> I<00:05:14.809> like<00:05:15.469> to

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:15.589 
control the lower ranges so I like to

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:19.479 
control the lower ranges so I like to
play<00:05:15.769> in<00:05:15.889> the<00:05:15.979> lower<00:05:16.159> ranges<00:05:16.610> but<00:05:17.479> um<00:05:18.219> yeah<00:05:19.219> but

not deficiencies but my opinions of the
deficiencies<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.409> horn<00:05:30.679> really<00:05:31.579> deter

really good one

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:38.409 
really good one
I<00:05:35.529> don't<00:05:36.529> think<00:05:36.589> Jupiter<00:05:37.189> is<00:05:37.339> it<00:05:37.699> is<00:05:37.969> as<00:05:38.149> much

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
I don't think Jupiter is it is as much

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.709 
I don't think Jupiter is it is as much
or<00:05:38.899> sex<00:05:39.349> isn't<00:05:39.919> as<00:05:40.339> expensive<00:05:40.729> as<00:05:41.209> the<00:05:41.239> sell

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
or sex isn't as expensive as the sell

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.169 
or sex isn't as expensive as the sell
more<00:05:41.929> Yamaha<00:05:42.439> ones<00:05:42.769> are<00:05:43.099> so<00:05:43.639> if<00:05:43.849> you<00:05:43.879> really

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:44.179 
more Yamaha ones are so if you really

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:45.519 
more Yamaha ones are so if you really
really<00:05:44.419> are<00:05:44.509> looking<00:05:44.899> for<00:05:45.049> something<00:05:45.349> that

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
really are looking for something that

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.189 
really are looking for something that
you<00:05:45.709> want<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.339> spend<00:05:46.669> as<00:05:46.849> much<00:05:47.089> money<00:05:47.419> that<00:05:47.659> I

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
you want to spend as much money that I

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.229 
you want to spend as much money that I
think<00:05:48.499> Jupiter<00:05:48.979> is<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:49.159> way<00:05:49.279> to<00:05:49.339> go<00:05:49.610> for<00:05:50.029> this

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:50.239 
think Jupiter is the way to go for this

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.629 
think Jupiter is the way to go for this
particular<00:05:50.929> horn<00:05:51.499> now<00:05:51.649> Jupiter<00:05:52.159> has<00:05:52.339> made

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
particular horn now Jupiter has made

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.219 
particular horn now Jupiter has made
some<00:05:52.819> horns<00:05:53.179> that<00:05:53.239> really<00:05:53.979> aren't<00:05:54.979> my<00:05:56.110> cup<00:05:57.110> of

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
some horns that really aren't my cup of

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.949 
some horns that really aren't my cup of
tea<00:05:58.029> some<00:05:59.029> of<00:05:59.149> the<00:05:59.209> horns<00:05:59.719> they<00:06:00.619> really<00:06:01.009> are

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:01.959 
tea some of the horns they really are

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.079 
tea some of the horns they really are
the<00:06:02.959> lacquer<00:06:03.259> on<00:06:03.679> the<00:06:04.279> horns<00:06:04.639> they<00:06:04.759> wear

the lacquer on the horns they wear

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:07.600 
the lacquer on the horns they wear
faster<00:06:05.539> than<00:06:05.809> normal<00:06:05.959> lacquer<00:06:06.649> wood<00:06:07.009> I<00:06:07.249> don't

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
faster than normal lacquer wood I don't

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.329 
faster than normal lacquer wood I don't
I<00:06:07.909> don't<00:06:08.059> understand<00:06:08.599> why<00:06:09.339> the<00:06:10.339> coating<00:06:12.339> but

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:13.339

starts to peel off like a lot faster

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:24.219 
starts to peel off like a lot faster
than<00:06:18.860> regular<00:06:19.189> wood<00:06:21.039> but<00:06:22.039> yeah<00:06:22.699> this<00:06:23.329> song<00:06:24.079> is
