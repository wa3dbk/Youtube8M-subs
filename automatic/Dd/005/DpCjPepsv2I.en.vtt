I'm<00:01:39.740> not<00:01:39.950> too<00:01:40.100> sure<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.520> it's<00:01:41.270> been<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.420> very

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
I'm not too sure that it's been a very

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.160 
I'm not too sure that it's been a very
long<00:01:41.990> time<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.180> said<00:01:44.510> this<00:01:44.720> is<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.900> growing

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
long time and I said this is the growing

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.680 
long time and I said this is the growing
one<00:01:45.350> also<00:01:46.040> got<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.610> gray<00:01:46.790> one<00:01:47.000> because<00:01:47.360> my

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
one also got the gray one because my

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.420 
one also got the gray one because my
brother<00:01:47.930> has<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:49.580> lot<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.120> half<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.540> one<00:01:50.660> but<00:01:50.870> the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
brother has a lot of half of one but the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.270 
brother has a lot of half of one but the
gray<00:01:52.430> 379<00:01:53.300> with<00:01:53.600> an<00:01:53.720> elfin<00:01:54.020> ramp<00:01:54.230> and<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.830> think

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
gray 379 with an elfin ramp and I think

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.570 
gray 379 with an elfin ramp and I think
one<00:01:55.430> or<00:01:55.550> two<00:01:55.580> great<00:01:55.960> flatbeds<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:57.950> figured

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
one or two great flatbeds so I figured

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.030 
one or two great flatbeds so I figured
I'd<00:01:58.670> get<00:01:58.850> one<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.150> match<00:01:59.330> things<00:01:59.570> as<00:01:59.810> well<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:04.010> I

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
I'd get one to match things as well so I

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.860 
I'd get one to match things as well so I
hear<00:02:04.430> this<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.970> metallic<00:02:05.480> gray<00:02:05.630> also

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870
