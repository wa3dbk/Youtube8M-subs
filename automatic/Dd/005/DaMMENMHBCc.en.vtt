video now if you're going to build a
layout<00:00:05.370> then<00:00:05.790> good<00:00:06.120> planning<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.810> key<00:00:06.960> to

a great model railroad layout start off

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.089 
a great model railroad layout start off
by<00:00:10.920> deciding<00:00:11.490> what<00:00:11.639> scale<00:00:12.290> h/o<00:00:13.290> scale<00:00:13.710> that's

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
by deciding what scale h/o scale that's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.860 
by deciding what scale h/o scale that's
the<00:00:14.280> most<00:00:14.429> popular<00:00:14.940> because<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the most popular because it's a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.070 
the most popular because it's a
mid-sized<00:00:16.410> range<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.400> scale<00:00:18.000> train<00:00:18.750> layouts

you can create a town seen that can be a
lot<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> fun<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.869> I'd<00:01:37.200> suggest<00:01:37.590> maybe<00:01:37.799> when

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
lot of fun but I'd suggest maybe when

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
lot of fun but I'd suggest maybe when
you<00:01:38.460> getting<00:01:38.670> started<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.540> concentrate<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
you getting started just concentrate on

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
you getting started just concentrate on
getting<00:01:40.259> your<00:01:40.650> model<00:01:41.009> railroad<00:01:41.400> operational

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
getting your model railroad operational

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.819 
getting your model railroad operational
you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.540> always<00:01:42.689> build<00:01:43.049> those<00:01:43.320> things<00:01:43.590> later

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you can always build those things later

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.530 
you can always build those things later
but<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> lot<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> fun<00:01:44.970> building<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
but it can be a lot of fun building a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.590 
but it can be a lot of fun building a
