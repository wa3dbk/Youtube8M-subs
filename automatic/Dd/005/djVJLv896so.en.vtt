recently
it's<00:00:12.360> rather<00:00:12.840> rusty<00:00:13.380> especially<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
it's rather rusty especially on the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.269 
it's rather rusty especially on the
inside<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:16.109> want<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> repaint<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:16.980> well

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
inside and I want to repaint it as well

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.730 
inside and I want to repaint it as well
so<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.090> need<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> get<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> rust<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.380> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
so I need to get the rust off and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.550 
so I need to get the rust off and
ideally<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> paint<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.420> I'm<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.199> try

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
ideally the paint and I'm going to try

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.720 
ideally the paint and I'm going to try
to<00:00:22.590> accomplish<00:00:22.830> both<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.250> those<00:00:23.519> with

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
to accomplish both of those with

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.320 
to accomplish both of those with
electrolysis<00:00:25.519> so<00:00:26.519> I'm<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.090> filling

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
electrolysis so I'm going to be filling

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.300 
electrolysis so I'm going to be filling
up<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.570> tub<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:27.960> water<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.650> for

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
up this tub with water and for

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.880 
up this tub with water and for
electrolyte<00:00:30.150> I'm<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> use<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.109> Armand

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
electrolyte I'm going to use this Armand

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.459 
electrolyte I'm going to use this Armand

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
Hammer washing soda which is sodium

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.270 
Hammer washing soda which is sodium
carbonate<00:00:35.989> I'm<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> give<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.559> battery

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
carbonate I'm going to give this battery

charger<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.760> try<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.629> low<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.160> past<00:00:41.399> I've

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
charger a try on low in the past I've

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.389 
charger a try on low in the past I've
used<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.360> variable<00:00:42.600> power<00:00:42.870> supply<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:44.250> can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
used a variable power supply that can

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.180 
used a variable power supply that can
put<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:44.760> 1<00:00:45.120> amp<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.539> current<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.860> does

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
put out about 1 amp of current this does

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
put out about 1 amp of current this does
2<00:00:47.489> amps<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> slow<00:00:48.300> charge<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
2 amps in a slow charge so I think it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
2 amps in a slow charge so I think it
may<00:00:49.260> work<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.649> better<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.730> not

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
may work a little better but I have not

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.560 
may work a little better but I have not
fried<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.300> before<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.960> I'll<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.230> how<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.379> goes

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
fried it before so I'll see how it goes

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.869 
fried it before so I'll see how it goes
and<00:00:54.570> I'll<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.199> using<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.739> clean<00:00:56.070> chisel<00:00:56.640> for

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and I'll be using this clean chisel for

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.010 
and I'll be using this clean chisel for
my<00:00:57.030> sacrificial<00:00:58.730> iron<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.969> think<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.660> goes<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
my sacrificial iron I think this goes to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.820 
my sacrificial iron I think this goes to
the<00:01:01.109> anode<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.579> part<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.830> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the anode and the part to get the the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.469 
the anode and the part to get the the
rusty<00:01:05.100> part<00:01:05.369> goes<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> cathode<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> got

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
rusty part goes at the cathode but I got

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.910 
rusty part goes at the cathode but I got
to<00:01:06.540> double-check<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.260> line<00:01:07.470> before<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to double-check that on line before I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.630 
to double-check that on line before I
start<00:01:09.650> this<00:01:10.650> captain<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> comes<00:01:11.220> apart<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
start this captain it comes apart of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.920 
start this captain it comes apart of
course<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.570> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
course I'm not going to put it like this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
course I'm not going to put it like this
I<00:01:13.560> figured<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.310> back<00:01:14.490> panel<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.150> place

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
I figured the back panel to good place

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320 
I figured the back panel to good place
the<00:01:15.570> starts<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:17.310> pops<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.759> fairly<00:01:18.060> easily

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the starts this pops out fairly easily

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.380 
the starts this pops out fairly easily
and<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.590> think<00:01:20.100> it'll<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.490> good<00:01:20.640> test<00:01:20.850> before

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and I think it'll be a good test before

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.870 
and I think it'll be a good test before
I<00:01:21.450> submerge<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> whole<00:01:22.729> cabinet<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
I submerge the whole cabinet in the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.859 
I submerge the whole cabinet in the
water<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:27.860> checked<00:01:28.860> online<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:30.000> yes<00:01:30.659> indeed

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
water I checked online and yes indeed

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
water I checked online and yes indeed
the<00:01:31.590> positive<00:01:32.189> goes<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.700> sacrificial

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the positive goes to your sacrificial

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.249 
the positive goes to your sacrificial
iron<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> negative<00:01:35.880> goes<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.840> rusty

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
iron and the negative goes to your rusty

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.429 
iron and the negative goes to your rusty
part<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:39.180> water<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.600> that's<00:01:40.229> some

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
part so some water in here that's some

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.730 
part so some water in here that's some
of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.880> washing<00:01:41.880> soda<00:01:42.380> did<00:01:43.380> quite<00:01:43.590> all

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
of the washing soda did quite all

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.330 
of the washing soda did quite all
dissolved<00:01:44.280> yet<00:01:44.869> one<00:01:45.869> few<00:01:46.170> minutes<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.799> here's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
dissolved yet one few minutes and here's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
dissolved yet one few minutes and here's
the<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.860> rust

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the back so as you can see some rust

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.990 
the back so as you can see some rust
issues<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:52.369> hoping<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> paint<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.820> come

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
issues and hoping the paint will come

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
issues and hoping the paint will come
off<00:01:54.030> -<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.320> bit<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> reading<00:01:55.770> online

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
off - I'm a little bit of reading online

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.330 
off - I'm a little bit of reading online
and<00:01:56.719> some<00:01:57.719> guys<00:01:57.869> I've<00:01:58.079> had<00:01:58.110> luck<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:59.040> all

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
and some guys I've had luck with it all

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.660 
and some guys I've had luck with it all
coming<00:01:59.729> off<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.479> softening<00:02:01.020> up<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.320> bit<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.829> in

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
coming off it's softening up a bit or in

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.780 
coming off it's softening up a bit or in
some<00:02:02.850> cases<00:02:03.060> didn't<00:02:03.659> come<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.790> keep

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
some cases didn't come off at all keep

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.100 
some cases didn't come off at all keep
my<00:02:05.909> fingers<00:02:06.240> crossed<00:02:06.329> otherwise<00:02:06.869> I'll<00:02:07.079> have

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
my fingers crossed otherwise I'll have

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.330 
my fingers crossed otherwise I'll have
to<00:02:07.320> use<00:02:07.380> some<00:02:07.530> kind<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> paint<00:02:07.920> stripper<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
to use some kind of paint stripper I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.119 
to use some kind of paint stripper I
guess<00:02:09.530> so

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
guess so

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.000 
guess so
got<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.030> dig<00:02:12.209> up<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
got to dig up a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.800 
got to dig up a
lead<00:02:13.640> for<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:13.970> negative<00:02:14.390> because<00:02:14.599> I<00:02:14.659> don't

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
lead for the negative because I don't

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.229 
lead for the negative because I don't
want<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.019> put<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.129> clip<00:02:16.489> art<00:02:16.730> into<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:16.909> into

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
want to put this clip art into the into

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.809 
want to put this clip art into the into
the<00:02:17.330> solution<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.049> want<00:02:18.230> us<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.190> ruined

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
the solution and I want us to get ruined

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.690 
the solution and I want us to get ruined
so<00:02:20.569> all<00:02:20.840> come<00:02:21.590> out<00:02:21.739> for<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.069> clip<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.580> don't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
so all come out for a clip that I don't

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.259 
so all come out for a clip that I don't
care<00:02:22.940> about<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:25.190> tack<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.480> I

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
care about and just tack it on to that I

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.880 
care about and just tack it on to that I
took<00:02:29.269> advantage<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.989> an<00:02:30.110> existing<00:02:30.500> hole<00:02:30.709> in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
took advantage of an existing hole in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.979 
took advantage of an existing hole in
this<00:02:31.010> panel<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.640> attached<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.510> hunk<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.780> wire

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
this panel and attached a hunk of wire

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.650 
this panel and attached a hunk of wire
with<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.349> sheet<00:02:33.560> metal<00:02:33.799> screw<00:02:34.360> somehow<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.390> can

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
with a sheet metal screw somehow I can

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.100 
with a sheet metal screw somehow I can
talk<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.019> that<00:02:36.170> pop<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:38.030> my<00:02:38.209> battery<00:02:38.599> charger

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
talk of that pop to my battery charger

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.250 
talk of that pop to my battery charger
you<00:02:39.560> don't<00:02:39.769> have<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.069> really<00:02:40.459> click<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
you don't have to really click the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.190 
you don't have to really click the
sacrificial<00:02:43.099> anode<00:02:43.700> there<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.239> sticking<00:02:45.110> a

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
sacrificial anode there is sticking a

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.930 
sacrificial anode there is sticking a
bit<00:02:45.379> out<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.709> water<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.370> won't<00:02:46.730> get

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
bit out of the water so that won't get

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.599 
bit out of the water so that won't get
wet<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.730> hook<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.480> up<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:51.370> let's<00:02:52.370> see<00:02:52.489> what

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
wet so hook this up and let's see what

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.160 
wet so hook this up and let's see what
happens<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:55.390> had<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.480> running<00:02:56.660> about<00:02:56.930> 10

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
happens I had this running about 10

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.720 
happens I had this running about 10
minutes<00:02:57.379> and<00:02:57.620> pulled<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.280> chuck<00:02:58.519> on

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
minutes and pulled it out to chuck on

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.940 
minutes and pulled it out to chuck on
and<00:02:58.940> Wow<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.629> old<00:02:59.780> paint<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.410> bubbling<00:03:00.829> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and Wow the old paint is is bubbling and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.460 
and Wow the old paint is is bubbling and
falling<00:03:01.370> right<00:03:01.579> off<00:03:01.629> so<00:03:02.629> working<00:03:02.930> far<00:03:03.200> better

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
falling right off so working far better

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.479 
falling right off so working far better
than<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.650> ever<00:03:03.739> expected

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
than I ever expected

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.550 
than I ever expected
the<00:03:05.000> thicker<00:03:05.269> white<00:03:05.569> paint<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.170> ciders

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the thicker white paint on the ciders

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.520 
the thicker white paint on the ciders
coming<00:03:06.890> right<00:03:07.069> off<00:03:07.099> -<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.049> rusty<00:03:09.379> but

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
coming right off - it's the rusty but

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.839 
coming right off - it's the rusty but
then<00:03:09.650> again<00:03:09.769> I've<00:03:10.129> been<00:03:10.160> about<00:03:10.370> 10<00:03:10.609> minutes

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
then again I've been about 10 minutes

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.360 
then again I've been about 10 minutes
this<00:03:11.090> process<00:03:11.510> takes<00:03:11.720> hours<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.950> I'm<00:03:13.190> going<00:03:13.340> to

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
this process takes hours so I'm going to

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.339 
this process takes hours so I'm going to
set<00:03:13.579> it<00:03:13.670> back<00:03:13.849> up<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.450> I'll<00:03:14.930> let<00:03:15.079> it<00:03:15.109> run

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
set it back up and I'll let it run

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.970 
set it back up and I'll let it run
overnight<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:16.750> yeah<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:18.169> really<00:03:18.799> really

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
overnight and yeah I'm really really

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.100 
overnight and yeah I'm really really
happy<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.700> was<00:03:19.880> awesome<00:03:20.299> I<00:03:20.389> think

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.230 

here<00:03:25.740> we<00:03:25.860> are<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.100> next<00:03:26.250> day<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.880> things<00:03:27.060> are

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
here we are the next day and things are

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.900 
here we are the next day and things are
looking<00:03:27.270> pretty<00:03:27.750> good<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:29.400> paint<00:03:29.700> has

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
looking pretty good the paint has

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.610 
looking pretty good the paint has
definitely<00:03:30.420> loosened<00:03:30.840> up<00:03:30.930> especially<00:03:31.500> the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
definitely loosened up especially the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.410 
definitely loosened up especially the
white<00:03:31.800> paint<00:03:32.100> I'm<00:03:32.430> going<00:03:32.760> over<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.090> now<00:03:33.240> with

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
white paint I'm going over it now with

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.090 
white paint I'm going over it now with
the<00:03:33.510> wire<00:03:33.690> brushed<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:35.160> get<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.120> all<00:03:36.240> off<00:03:37.100> so

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
the wire brushed to get it all off so

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.460 
the wire brushed to get it all off so
with<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.460> gray<00:03:38.970> paint<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.720> back<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> bit

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
with the gray paint on the back is a bit

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.220 
with the gray paint on the back is a bit
more<00:03:40.620> stubborn<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.460> may<00:03:42.300> end<00:03:42.750> up<00:03:42.930> using<00:03:42.990> a

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
more stubborn I may end up using a

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.070 
more stubborn I may end up using a
little<00:03:43.320> bit<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.500> paint<00:03:43.710> stripper<00:03:43.890> on<00:03:45.080> general

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
little bit of paint stripper on general

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.720 
little bit of paint stripper on general
this<00:03:46.560> worked<00:03:46.830> out<00:03:46.920> really<00:03:46.980> well

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
this worked out really well

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.320 
this worked out really well
I<00:03:48.350> think<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> rust<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.800> all<00:03:49.950> gone<00:03:50.160> too<00:03:50.520> just<00:03:51.180> it

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
I think the rust is all gone too just it

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.000 
I think the rust is all gone too just it
kind<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.750> turns<00:03:51.930> blackish<00:03:52.560> when<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.830> use

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
kind of turns blackish when you use

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.640 
kind of turns blackish when you use
electrolytic<00:03:53.670> rust<00:03:53.880> removal<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:55.170> I'll<00:03:55.350> brush

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
electrolytic rust removal so I'll brush

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.350 
electrolytic rust removal so I'll brush
over<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> bit<00:03:56.490> maybe<00:03:56.790> do<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.120> can<00:03:57.240> do<00:03:57.330> a

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
over that a bit maybe do it you can do a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:07.190 
over that a bit maybe do it you can do a
little<00:03:57.600> like<00:03:57.750> sanding<00:03:58.320> I<00:04:06.020> spread<00:04:07.020> a<00:04:07.080> little

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
little like sanding I spread a little

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.350 
little like sanding I spread a little
paint<00:04:07.500> stripper<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.489> last<00:04:08.700> bits<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.090> paint

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
paint stripper on the last bits of paint

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.199 
paint stripper on the last bits of paint
left<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.870> back<00:04:10.170> piece<00:04:10.730> well<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.760> wait<00:04:12.000> for

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
left on that back piece well I wait for

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.330

this I'm going to use some red primer if
it'll<00:05:50.040> work<00:05:50.250> better<00:05:50.430> under<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:50.789> orange<00:05:51.150> paint

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
here we are the next day and it does

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.320 
here we are the next day and it does
seem<00:06:27.090> to<00:06:27.150> be<00:06:27.300> working<00:06:27.509> quite<00:06:27.990> well<00:06:29.090> maybe<00:06:30.090> even

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
seem to be working quite well maybe even

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.299 
seem to be working quite well maybe even
better<00:06:30.479> than<00:06:30.629> on<00:06:30.779> the<00:06:30.900> other<00:06:30.930> parses<00:06:31.860> paints

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:32.309 
better than on the other parses paints

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:36.469 
better than on the other parses paints
just<00:06:32.520> flowing<00:06:32.969> off<00:06:35.120> one<00:06:36.120> thing<00:06:36.150> I<00:06:36.300> have

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
just flowing off one thing I have

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.409 
just flowing off one thing I have
discovered<00:06:36.900> is<00:06:37.110> that<00:06:37.229> the<00:06:37.379> area<00:06:37.830> closest<00:06:38.580> to

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
discovered is that the area closest to

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.299 
discovered is that the area closest to
my<00:06:40.819> anode<00:06:41.819> over<00:06:42.210> there<00:06:42.389> bubbles<00:06:43.289> up<00:06:43.439> faster

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:44.309 
my anode over there bubbles up faster

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.860 
my anode over there bubbles up faster
for<00:06:44.460> the<00:06:44.520> paint<00:06:44.759> comes<00:06:44.939> off<00:06:45.089> fast<00:06:45.449> there<00:06:45.719> so

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
for the paint comes off fast there so

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.350 
for the paint comes off fast there so
I've<00:06:45.930> been<00:06:46.020> rotating<00:06:46.559> this<00:06:46.650> around<00:06:47.180> the<00:06:48.180> one

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
I've been rotating this around the one

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.869 
I've been rotating this around the one
area<00:06:48.599> left<00:06:48.990> this<00:06:49.169> hasn't<00:06:49.559> come<00:06:50.159> off<00:06:50.339> too<00:06:50.610> well

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
area left this hasn't come off too well
