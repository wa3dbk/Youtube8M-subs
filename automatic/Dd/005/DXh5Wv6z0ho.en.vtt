you will just continue to do this until
you<00:01:45.290> run<00:01:45.500> out<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.680> hair<00:01:45.979> now<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.119> any<00:01:47.390> other

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
you run out of hair now like any other

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.890 
you run out of hair now like any other
right<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.560> know<00:01:48.680> fishtail<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:50.150> more<00:01:50.630> hair

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
right you know fishtail the more hair

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.840 
right you know fishtail the more hair
you<00:01:50.930> take<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.619> bigger<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:51.979> chunks<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.580> less

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
you take the bigger the chunks the less

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.420 
you take the bigger the chunks the less
it<00:01:53.060> looks<00:01:53.240> fishtail<00:01:54.200> II<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.950> more<00:01:55.159> it<00:01:55.250> looks

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
it looks fishtail II the more it looks

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.030 
it looks fishtail II the more it looks
like<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.640> French<00:01:55.909> braid<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.590> smaller<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
like a French braid so the smaller the

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.940 
like a French braid so the smaller the
chunks<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.700> better<00:01:58.850> I'm<00:01:59.390> doing<00:01:59.950> medium

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
chunks the better I'm doing medium

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.170 
chunks the better I'm doing medium
chunks<00:02:01.400> just<00:02:01.460> because<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:03.520> am<00:02:04.520> trying<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.060> keep
