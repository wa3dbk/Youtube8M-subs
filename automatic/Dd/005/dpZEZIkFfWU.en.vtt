apparently<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> memory<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.530> must<00:00:10.769> have

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
apparently for a memory I must have

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.450 
apparently for a memory I must have
looked<00:00:11.250> at<00:00:11.370> some<00:00:11.519> point<00:00:12.889> and<00:00:13.889> its<00:00:14.250> problems

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
looked at some point and its problems

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.750 
looked at some point and its problems
with<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.960> DVD<00:00:15.960> drive<00:00:16.410> if<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.039> bump<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
with the DVD drive if you bump it it

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
with the DVD drive if you bump it it
works<00:00:18.740> sometimes

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.870 

it's<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> dashboard

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.850 

doesn't<00:00:45.880> check<00:00:46.030> though<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.530> that's<00:00:53.650> pretty

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
doesn't check though so that's pretty

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.510 
doesn't check though so that's pretty
stuck<00:00:54.160> in<00:00:54.310> there<00:00:54.489> at<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.640> moment<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:57.190> coming

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
stuck in there at the moment then coming

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.859 
stuck in there at the moment then coming
out<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.820> we're<00:01:03.940> going<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.119> try<00:01:04.300> fixing<00:01:04.660> it<00:01:04.780> up

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
out so we're going to try fixing it up

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.070 
out so we're going to try fixing it up
by<00:01:05.170> adding<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.340> little<00:01:06.460> bit<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.960> something<00:01:07.960> in

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
by adding a little bit of something in

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.480 
by adding a little bit of something in
between<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.590> attraction<00:01:09.070> plate<00:01:09.250> in<00:01:09.400> the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
between the attraction plate in the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.969 
between the attraction plate in the
magnet<00:01:09.820> inside<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.780> actual<00:01:11.020> drive<00:01:11.440> so<00:01:11.830> let's

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
magnet inside the actual drive so let's

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.780 
magnet inside the actual drive so let's
soak<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.580> depart<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:14.010> put<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.100> drive<00:01:15.369> out<00:01:15.580> and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
soak it depart I put the drive out and

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.719 
soak it depart I put the drive out and
it's<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.860> touch<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.070> LG<00:01:18.550> drop<00:01:19.800> model<00:01:20.800> GDR

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.270 

-<00:01:24.780> 805<00:01:25.780> oh<00:01:25.810> L<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.259> get<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.740> screws<00:01:29.950> out<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
- 805 oh L so get the screws out of the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.070 
- 805 oh L so get the screws out of the
base<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.280> there's<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.610> drive<00:01:33.850> in<00:01:34.030> pieces<00:01:34.540> as

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
base so there's the drive in pieces as

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.440 
base so there's the drive in pieces as
you<00:01:35.140> can<00:01:35.350> see<00:01:35.470> we've<00:01:35.619> got<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:36.330> magnet<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:37.390> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
you can see we've got the magnet on the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:47.690 
you can see we've got the magnet on the
hub<00:01:37.660> here<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.240> over<00:01:43.960> here<00:01:44.140> we<00:01:44.229> have<00:01:44.259> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:57.719 

stabilizer<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.850> guess<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.210> is<00:01:56.729> attraction

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
stabilizer I guess it is attraction

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.170 
stabilizer I guess it is attraction
plating<00:01:58.299> so<00:01:59.229> what<00:01:59.320> we're<00:01:59.409> going<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.560> do<00:01:59.710> is

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
plating so what we're going to do is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.090 
plating so what we're going to do is
grab<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.409> 25%<00:02:02.409> off<00:02:02.500> sticker<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:05.170> place<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.740> in

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
grab a 25% off sticker just place it in

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.719 
grab a 25% off sticker just place it in
the<00:02:06.220> middle<00:02:07.560> I've<00:02:08.560> had<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.769> think<00:02:09.040> about<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
the middle I've had a think about the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.850 
the middle I've had a think about the
most<00:02:09.880> ideal<00:02:10.119> stick<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.810> would<00:02:10.869> probably<00:02:11.080> be<00:02:11.350> am

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.670 

those<00:02:14.860> little<00:02:15.130> round<00:02:15.340> stickers<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:15.940> put<00:02:16.180> on

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.850 

this<00:02:44.480> drives<00:02:44.780> are<00:02:44.990> actually<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> slightly

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
this drives are actually a slightly

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.590 
this drives are actually a slightly
different<00:02:46.340> design<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.180> Samsung<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:50.480> was

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
different design to the Samsung I was

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.340 
different design to the Samsung I was
expecting<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.110> find<00:02:51.320> in<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:52.600> but<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:53.840> guess

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
expecting to find in here but I guess

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:07.440 
expecting to find in here but I guess
1.5<00:02:55.130> 1.6<00:02:55.910> bees<00:02:56.390> came<00:02:56.810> with<00:03:03.760> LG<00:03:04.760> hi<00:03:04.970> tart<00:03:05.240> cheese

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
1.5 1.6 bees came with LG hi tart cheese

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.440 
1.5 1.6 bees came with LG hi tart cheese
okay<00:03:09.640> see<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.820> camera<00:03:11.120> will<00:03:11.420> focus<00:03:13.450> and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
okay see this camera will focus and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.350 
okay see this camera will focus and
there<00:03:14.660> we<00:03:14.780> go

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
there we go

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.699 
there we go
pretty<00:03:17.360> good<00:03:17.570> job<00:03:20.050> so<00:03:21.050> pop<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.530> right<00:03:21.560> back

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
pretty good job so pop it right back

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.830 
pretty good job so pop it right back
together<00:03:22.010> let's<00:03:22.340> give<00:03:22.520> it<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.640> test<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:26.690> give

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
together let's give it a test just give

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:46.800 
together let's give it a test just give
it<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.930> quick<00:03:27.020> test<00:03:27.290> while<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:27.650> half<00:03:27.830> apart

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.990 

like<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.890> gears<00:03:48.160> could<00:03:48.490> use<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.670> bit<00:03:48.850> of<00:03:48.910> a

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
like the gears could use a bit of a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.020 
like the gears could use a bit of a
grease<00:03:50.130> apart<00:03:51.130> from<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:51.790> ejecting<00:03:54.030> so

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
grease apart from that it is ejecting so

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.570 
grease apart from that it is ejecting so
let's<00:03:55.210> get<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.450> back<00:03:55.570> in<00:03:55.690> one<00:03:55.960> piece<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:56.590> put<00:03:57.550> a

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
let's get it back in one piece and put a

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.690 
let's get it back in one piece and put a
final<00:03:57.820> test<00:03:59.190> all<00:04:00.190> right<00:04:00.340> we've<00:04:00.520> got<00:04:00.550> the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
final test all right we've got the

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.010 
final test all right we've got the
screws<00:04:00.910> back<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.330> nice<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.830> well<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.690> let's

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
screws back in nice and well so let's

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:38.400 
screws back in nice and well so let's
flip<00:04:05.800> it<00:04:05.980> back<00:04:06.280> over<00:04:06.490> and<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:12.390> power

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:45.700 

look<00:04:39.410> at<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:44.960> problem<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.410> is<00:04:45.470> that

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
look at that so the problem is is that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.580 
look at that so the problem is is that
the<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:47.240> magnet<00:04:47.690> can't<00:04:47.960> release<00:04:48.260> from<00:04:48.500> the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
the the magnet can't release from the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.980 
the the magnet can't release from the
attraction<00:04:49.040> plate<00:04:49.250> quick<00:04:49.520> enough<00:04:49.960> such<00:04:50.960> a

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
attraction plate quick enough such a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.270 
attraction plate quick enough such a
result<00:04:51.230> it<00:04:51.350> just<00:04:51.500> gets<00:04:51.680> sort<00:04:51.920> of<00:04:51.980> stuck<00:04:52.250> there

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
result it just gets sort of stuck there

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.750 
result it just gets sort of stuck there
and<00:04:52.520> can't<00:04:54.790> meet<00:04:55.790> a<00:04:55.820> tray<00:04:57.190> but<00:04:58.190> now<00:04:58.310> we're<00:04:58.520> good

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
and can't meet a tray but now we're good

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:07.540 
and can't meet a tray but now we're good
so<00:04:58.910> let's<00:04:59.090> place<00:04:59.300> an<00:04:59.480> MX<00:04:59.870> super<00:05:00.290> fly<00:05:04.420> and<00:05:06.550> the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
so let's place an MX super fly and the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.510 
so let's place an MX super fly and the
reason<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:09.080> can<00:05:09.350> sometimes<00:05:09.860> bump<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.430> it

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
reason you can sometimes bump it and it

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.100 
reason you can sometimes bump it and it
works<00:05:10.700> is<00:05:10.940> because<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.330> dislodges<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.990> magnet

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
works is because it dislodges the magnet

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.690 
works is because it dislodges the magnet
got<00:05:15.110> a<00:05:15.200> pretty<00:05:15.410> good<00:05:15.560> timing<00:05:15.770> though<00:05:16.070> fill<00:05:16.580> it

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
got a pretty good timing though fill it

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:26.410 
got a pretty good timing though fill it
once<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:24.160> that's<00:05:25.160> how<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.430> fix<00:05:25.640> up<00:05:25.820> your<00:05:25.850> xbox
