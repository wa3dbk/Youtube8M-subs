 can happen in the life of llanera face 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.810
 the biggest thing that could happen to you to see 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.519

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 who is the father, the one in the west with 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.390
 mayors in the corridors 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.099

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.859
 You will have to tell Carlos because 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.330
 you have the right to know this, never 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.250
 you have no right if you keep thinking 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.669
 that I am the one that was before does not have 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.669
 no right 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 Charles 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.560
 hello hello I see you distracted is all 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:53.020
 well yes perfect thank you you want a coffee 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.020
 I can ask what is clear 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.610
 or that is explained 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 I have a friend 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.640
 which in turn has a friend 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.790
 when if possible without her friend but 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.010
 Perez 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.020
 a life with rights you do not understand 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.630
 the one that maintains a sexual roll but of 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.420
 done she just does not have for that and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.490
 he got stuck and now he wants to commit 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.780
 and wants a family and no no no no no no 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.780
 no not at all 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.670
 that is, he wants to keep what he has 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.670
 with her 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.080
 commitments family issues ni 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.440
 marriages or anything of those things 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.060
 [Music] 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.910
 but then I do not understand what the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.800
 problem because if he does not want anything 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.900
 serious and she does not want anything serious 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.480
 then why are not they still friends 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.480
 with right and they are low 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.400
 okay 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.400
 two 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.130
 to the green you are already aware of the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.979
 responsibility that you are throwing 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.229
 over clear mother daughter because you're not 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.450
 Adopting a puppy or a kitten a son 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.190
 it is a much more responsibility 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.739
 big to have a pet and it lasts for 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.740
 whole life and the mother mother if someone 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.930
 knows how to give love to a son is from llanero 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.700
 I had not told you my friend but I 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.760
 I always had the big 25 mother 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 the day of the good self-sacrificing mothers 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.230
 I'm going to do for my little boy 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.360
 my daughter will be easy the task a son you 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.400
 It can bring many tears and many 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.769
 joys too and I'll be ready 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.590
 for what comes, I 'm glad to hear it 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.340
 daughter and a son represents the most love 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.980
 most unconditional beauty the most perfect 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.849
 and I see it every day with my fight 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.250
 it's that clear because also that 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.019
 little boy is going to be sanded and you will be my 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.019
 comadre and military 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.170
 the pink rose tell me what happened sra 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.220
 from home to the house because he has rest 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.500
 plus 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.560
 that it really fucks her belly 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:16.400

 [Music] 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.030

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.100
 I want to see if I already know 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.140
 I am clear that you and I are going to 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.550
 never come back and then you can know 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:35.370
 that you are here I come to see Carlos no 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.370
 it's like a patient I come from him 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.090
 also forgive me for real is that not 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.159
 exploiting the head you have a strong 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.159
 Ethyl poisoning that's all 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.900
 I'm going to look for the subway to check 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.900
 people 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.470
 with a good chicken stock I imagine that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.000
 there will be some times you know instead of 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.630
 chicken caldito I prefer a glass with 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.709
 milk helps me more stomach 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.020
 and because you did not ask it to pink or 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.730
 I have a wife who is a nurse who 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.770

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.870

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.410
 that then 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.080
 he is sure that his life runs 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.479
 danger looks though I did not have like 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.969
 enemies to very powerful people the fact 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.979
 to be there in jail with people who 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.870
 he locked himself in there is not a panorama 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.729

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.770
