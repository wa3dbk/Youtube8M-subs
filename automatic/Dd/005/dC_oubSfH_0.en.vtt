membership which is like 495 a month so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.440 
membership which is like 495 a month so
it's<00:02:19.980> relatively<00:02:20.310> cheap<00:02:20.730> compared<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it's relatively cheap compared to the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.950 
it's relatively cheap compared to the
other<00:02:21.630> services<00:02:22.260> out<00:02:22.440> there<00:02:23.450> also<00:02:24.450> one<00:02:24.930> last

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
other services out there also one last

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.380 
other services out there also one last
thing<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:25.920> these<00:02:26.040> dns<00:02:26.460> numbers<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:27.000> is

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
thing is what these dns numbers are is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.560 
thing is what these dns numbers are is
basically<00:02:28.700> once<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.820> enter<00:02:30.120> them<00:02:30.240> into<00:02:30.390> your

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
basically once you enter them into your

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.170 
basically once you enter them into your
computer<00:02:30.740> it's<00:02:31.740> gonna<00:02:31.920> reroute<00:02:32.430> your<00:02:32.670> Netflix

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
computer it's gonna reroute your Netflix

computer it's gonna reroute your Netflix
geolocation<00:02:33.630> which<00:02:34.500> will<00:02:34.920> basically

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
geolocation which will basically

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.580 
geolocation which will basically
disallow<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.150> view<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.480> u.s.<00:02:36.960> content<00:02:37.410> or
