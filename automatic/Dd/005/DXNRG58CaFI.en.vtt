octave<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:35.510> used<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:37.500> over<00:00:38.219> blue<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:39.719> four

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
octave I used the one over blue the four

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
octave I used the one over blue the four
over<00:00:40.320> blue<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.800> found<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.820> three

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
over blue and I found out that the three

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.200 
over blue and I found out that the three
over<00:00:42.570> blue<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:43.140> adds<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.250> color<00:00:44.579> it's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
over blue also adds a lot of color it's

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.049 
over blue also adds a lot of color it's
actually<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> same<00:00:46.170> note<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.039> four<00:00:47.610> blue

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
actually the same note as the four blue

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.470 
actually the same note as the four blue
four<00:00:48.360> blue<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.559> soft<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.760> number<00:00:51.180> three

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
four blue is soft and if number three

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
four blue is soft and if number three
over<00:00:51.870> blue<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.230> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> more<00:00:53.699> rough

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
over blue is kind of like a more rough

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
over blue is kind of like a more rough
on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> edges<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> sounds<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.890> example

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
on the edges so it sounds for example

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.290 
on the edges so it sounds for example
I'll<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.969> difference<00:00:57.300> between<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.780> four

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
I'll do the difference between the four

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.840 
I'll do the difference between the four
over<00:01:00.300> blue<00:01:00.649> excuse<00:01:01.649> me<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> four<00:01:02.070> blue<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
over blue excuse me the four blue and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:12.850 
over blue excuse me the four blue and
three<00:01:03.210> although<00:01:10.549> it's<00:01:11.549> more<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
three although it's more like a

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.340 
three although it's more like a
vibrating<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.729> when<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.450> put<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
vibrating and I like it when I I put it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:35.720 
vibrating and I like it when I I put it
within<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> lick

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:43.050 

what<00:01:38.280> me<00:01:39.690> much<00:01:40.690> moist<00:01:40.990> okay<00:01:41.920> so<00:01:42.190> at<00:01:42.730> the<00:01:42.910> first

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
what me much moist okay so at the first

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.910 
what me much moist okay so at the first
octave<00:01:43.480> there<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.500> one<00:01:44.680> over

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
octave there is the the one over

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.890 
octave there is the the one over
blasting<00:01:45.280> it's<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.520> very<00:01:45.850> very<00:01:46.180> important<00:01:46.720> note

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
blasting it's a very very important note

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.820 
blasting it's a very very important note
that's<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.720> slide<00:01:53.050> from<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.680> the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
that's I like to slide from it to the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.800 
that's I like to slide from it to the
two<00:01:54.690> blue<00:01:59.460> also<00:02:00.460> very<00:02:00.700> hard<00:02:01.000> note<00:02:01.330> for<00:02:01.630> me<00:02:01.720> at

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
two blue also very hard note for me at

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.710 
two blue also very hard note for me at
the<00:02:01.930> beginning<00:02:02.080> was<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.640> three<00:02:03.640> bend<00:02:04.030> down<00:02:04.300> I

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
the beginning was the three bend down I

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.250 
the beginning was the three bend down I
think<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.440> whole<00:02:05.619> step

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.770 

it<00:02:11.500> was<00:02:11.680> hard<00:02:11.920> for<00:02:12.100> me<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.370> get<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:12.780> accurate

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it was hard for me to get that accurate

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.490 
it was hard for me to get that accurate
at<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.020> beginning<00:02:14.500> especially<00:02:15.250> playing<00:02:15.910> that

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
at the beginning especially playing that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:26.400 
at the beginning especially playing that
as<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.680> first<00:02:17.950> note<00:02:23.489> also<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:25.360> for<00:02:25.930> verbal<00:02:26.320> is

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
as the first note also the for verbal is

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.650 
as the first note also the for verbal is
very<00:02:26.620> important<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.340> kind<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.180> complete

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
very important to kind of like complete

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.080 
very important to kind of like complete
the<00:02:28.900> licks<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.739> are<00:02:29.860> doing<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.850> first

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
the licks you are doing on the first

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:43.899 
the licks you are doing on the first
octave

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.030 

so<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.510> basically<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:47.510> first<00:02:48.510> octave

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
so so that basically the first octave

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.030 
so so that basically the first octave
the<00:02:50.040> street<00:02:50.370> blow<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.120> over<00:02:51.420> blow<00:02:51.739> I'm<00:02:52.739> still

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the street blow the over blow I'm still

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.690 
the street blow the over blow I'm still
not<00:02:53.189> doing<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:54.239> good<00:02:55.079> enough<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:56.430> my

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
not doing it good enough on my

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360 
not doing it good enough on my
perspective<00:02:57.239> but<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.019> really<00:02:58.709> want<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.010> note

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
perspective but I really want that note

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.000 
perspective but I really want that note
because<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.670> feel<00:02:59.879> it's<00:03:00.840> much<00:03:01.230> more<00:03:01.440> bluesier

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
because I feel it's much more bluesier

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.849 
because I feel it's much more bluesier
than<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.659> four<00:03:05.060> okay<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.560> middle

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
than the four okay now the the middle

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.380 
than the four okay now the the middle
octave<00:03:08.010> which<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.879> course<00:03:09.319> over<00:03:10.319> blow<00:03:10.530> hell

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
octave which is of course over blow hell

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.140 
octave which is of course over blow hell
in<00:03:12.390> terms<00:03:13.109> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.709> breathes<00:03:13.980> notes<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
in terms of the breathes notes it's the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
in terms of the breathes notes it's the
four<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.750> above<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.140> five<00:03:16.349> of<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.010> six<00:03:17.190> our

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
four of above the five of the six our

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.140 
four of above the five of the six our
bill<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.140> seven<00:03:19.769> blow<00:03:20.250> natural<00:03:20.849> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
bill you have a seven blow natural and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.849 
bill you have a seven blow natural and
then<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.989> have<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.560> eight<00:03:23.099> blow<00:03:24.030> Bend<00:03:24.859> which

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
then you have the eight blow Bend which

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.720

band<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.590> ain't<00:04:58.830> natural<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.580> it<00:05:00.120> gives<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.510> a

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
band and ain't natural so it gives the a

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:22.610 
band and ain't natural so it gives the a
bracket<00:05:20.029> it's<00:05:21.029> a<00:05:21.180> little<00:05:21.419> bit<00:05:21.510> high<00:05:21.840> for<00:05:21.870> me<00:05:22.289> so

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620
