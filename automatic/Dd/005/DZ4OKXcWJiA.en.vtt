assured of having diploid cells because

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.369 
assured of having diploid cells because

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the process of mitosis and cellular

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.440 
the process of mitosis and cellular

division produces cells genetically

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.910 
division produces cells genetically
identical<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.739> parent<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.520> each<00:00:47.850> other

thus a diploid cell reproducing through
mitosis<00:00:52.440> will<00:00:52.980> always<00:00:53.399> produce<00:00:53.610> two<00:00:54.120> diploid

mitosis will always produce two diploid
