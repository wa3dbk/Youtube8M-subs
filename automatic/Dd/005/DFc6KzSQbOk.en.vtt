used for turning the rest are used for
the<00:00:58.469> milling<00:00:58.859> operations<00:00:59.730> if<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.629> take<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the milling operations if we take a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
the milling operations if we take a
quick<00:01:01.170> look<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.070> turning<00:01:02.399> operation<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
quick look at the turning operation that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750 
quick look at the turning operation that
was<00:01:03.149> done<00:01:03.359> over<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
was done over here you can see that the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.260 
was done over here you can see that the
turning<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.299> done<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.610> area

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
turning was done just on this area

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.070 
turning was done just on this area
itself<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.070> round<00:01:11.580> area<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
itself to get this round area on the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.550 
itself to get this round area on the
part<00:01:13.350> itself<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.580> rest<00:01:15.000> other<00:01:15.479> machining<00:01:16.110> was

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
part itself the rest other machining was

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
part itself the rest other machining was
done<00:01:16.860> using<00:01:17.400> milling<00:01:18.180> operations<00:01:20.689> now<00:01:21.689> we'll

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
done using milling operations now we'll

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.770 
done using milling operations now we'll
start<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.470> our<00:01:22.619> milling<00:01:23.250> operations<00:01:23.970> first

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
start with our milling operations first

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.679 
start with our milling operations first
we're<00:01:25.290> gonna<00:01:25.350> mill<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.729> surfaces

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
we're gonna mill out these surfaces

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.819 
we're gonna mill out these surfaces
around<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.409> there

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
around over there

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.460 
around over there
and<00:01:28.979> I'll<00:01:29.100> actually<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.540> four

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and I'll actually do it on all four

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.270 
and I'll actually do it on all four
sides<00:01:31.549> by<00:01:32.549> using<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> option<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:34.280> transform

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
sides by using the option of transform

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.140 
sides by using the option of transform
rotate<00:01:35.939> around<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.780> fourth<00:01:37.140> axis<00:01:37.829> going<00:01:38.759> into

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
rotate around the fourth axis going into

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.960 
rotate around the fourth axis going into
the<00:01:39.240> operation<00:01:39.869> itself<00:01:40.350> you'll<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.790> my

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the operation itself you'll see that my

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.370 
the operation itself you'll see that my
geometry<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.950> line<00:01:44.250> over<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:46.020> tool

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
