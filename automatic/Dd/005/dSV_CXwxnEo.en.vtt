slide definitely a slide no he's taking
it<00:03:42.520> back<00:03:43.860> maybe<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:45.070> turn<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.670> much<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:47.500> a

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
it back maybe you turn so much you a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.180 
it back maybe you turn so much you a
king<00:03:48.450> British<00:03:49.450> piece<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.930> poo<00:03:50.200> till<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:50.980> clear

and<00:03:51.430> British<00:03:51.790> right<00:03:53.580> so<00:03:54.580> I<00:03:54.610> thought<00:03:54.850> from<00:03:55.000> the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
and British right so I thought from the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.450 
and British right so I thought from the
McLaren<00:03:55.390> 650s<00:03:56.550> it's<00:03:57.550> a<00:03:57.730> McLaren<00:03:58.150> 650s<00:03:59.460> not

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
McLaren 650s it's a McLaren 650s not

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.370 
McLaren 650s it's a McLaren 650s not
much<00:04:00.640> else<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.000> say<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.510> car<00:04:01.720> except<00:04:02.350> for

much else to say on the car except for

much else to say on the car except for
the<00:04:02.530> fact<00:04:02.740> then<00:04:03.280> I'd<00:04:03.400> probably<00:04:03.670> drive<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.360> if

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
the fact then I'd probably drive it if

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.140 
the fact then I'd probably drive it if
it<00:04:05.200> stays<00:04:05.500> dry<00:04:05.890> when<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.190> gets<00:04:06.400> wet<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:06.910> turns

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
it stays dry when it gets wet it turns

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.070 
it stays dry when it gets wet it turns
in<00:04:07.450> way<00:04:08.020> too<00:04:08.080> much<00:04:08.640> way<00:04:09.640> too<00:04:09.670> much<00:04:10.090> perform<00:04:10.990> you

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
in way too much way too much perform you
