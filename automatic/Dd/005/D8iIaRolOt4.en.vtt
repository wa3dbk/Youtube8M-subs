which we are currently not able to even
get<00:01:36.600> close<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.609> so<00:01:38.609> we<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.909> find<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.179> way<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
get close to so we have to find a way to

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.989 
get close to so we have to find a way to
get<00:01:39.570> close<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.109> that's<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.429> spy<00:01:41.789> I'm

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
get close to it that's not a spy I'm

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.060 
get close to it that's not a spy I'm
gonna<00:01:42.119> jump<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.840> oh<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.499> a<00:01:43.530> century

let's see what we can do against the

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.089 
let's see what we can do against the
spire<00:04:05.099> as<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.370> tries<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.579> go<00:04:05.760> around<00:04:07.099> these

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
spire as it tries to go around these

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.530 
spire as it tries to go around these
using<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.459> back<00:04:08.579> burners<00:04:08.879> i'm<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.150> gonna<00:04:09.329> go

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
using the back burners i'm not gonna go

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.140 
using the back burners i'm not gonna go
close<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.470> even<00:04:10.739> if<00:04:10.859> I'm<00:04:10.919> so<00:04:11.099> far<00:04:11.370> away<00:04:11.459> i<00:04:11.549> still

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
close so even if I'm so far away i still

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.369 
close so even if I'm so far away i still
get<00:04:12.389> blurred<00:04:12.659> it's<00:04:12.810> always<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> little<00:04:13.199> bit

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
get blurred it's always a little bit

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.860 
get blurred it's always a little bit
difficult<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.889> tell<00:04:14.099> sometimes<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:15.180> always

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
difficult to tell sometimes to always

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.390 
difficult to tell sometimes to always
sometimes<00:04:16.169> yeah<00:04:16.560> that's<00:04:16.739> that's<00:04:16.889> proper

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
sometimes yeah that's that's proper

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.370 
sometimes yeah that's that's proper
grammar<00:04:17.880> or<00:04:18.180> syntax<00:04:18.900> what<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.169> want<00:04:19.289> to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
grammar or syntax what if you want to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.140 
grammar or syntax what if you want to
call<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.530> my<00:04:20.400> overall<00:04:20.549> i<00:04:20.820> found<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.120> be

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
call it my overall i found it to be

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.820 
call it my overall i found it to be
rather<00:04:21.359> difficult<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.870> actually<00:04:22.229> element

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
rather difficult to actually element

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.379 
rather difficult to actually element
that<00:04:22.949> we're<00:04:23.099> going<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.280> die<00:04:23.400> now<00:04:23.580> can't<00:04:24.120> jump

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
that we're going to die now can't jump

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.969 
that we're going to die now can't jump
back<00:04:24.539> there<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:25.349> always<00:04:25.590> find<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.949> be

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
back there and I always find it to be

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.190 
back there and I always find it to be
rather<00:04:26.190> difficult<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.789> actually<00:04:27.720> estimate

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
rather difficult to actually estimate

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.580 
rather difficult to actually estimate
the<00:04:28.650> fires<00:04:28.969> because<00:04:29.969> for<00:04:30.240> some<00:04:30.360> reason

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
the fires because for some reason

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.530 
the fires because for some reason
sometimes<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:32.130> I'm

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
sometimes if I'm

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.770 
sometimes if I'm
if<00:04:33.320> I'm<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.070> far<00:04:34.310> away<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.880> don't<00:04:35.240> get<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.480> and

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
if I'm that far away I don't get it and

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.780 
if I'm that far away I don't get it and
sometimes<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.740> like<00:04:36.950> that<00:04:37.160> I<00:04:37.190> do<00:04:37.370> get<00:04:37.610> hit

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
sometimes just like that I do get hit

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.070 
sometimes just like that I do get hit
it's<00:04:38.240> always<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.450> little<00:04:38.510> bit<00:04:38.720> if<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:38.960> to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
it's always a little bit if you to

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.730 
it's always a little bit if you to
figure<00:04:39.260> out<00:04:39.470> what<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.490> actual<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:42.290> distance

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
figure out what the actual the distance

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.670 
figure out what the actual the distance
is<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:43.100> was<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.280> belief<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.610> depends<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.290> lag<00:04:45.290> some

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
is I was a belief it depends on lag some

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.110 
is I was a belief it depends on lag some
time<00:04:45.860> since<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.160> turn<00:04:46.310> on<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.550> server<00:04:46.760> all

time since you turn on the server all
kinds<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.390> weird<00:04:47.570> things<00:04:47.600> but<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.140> bread<00:04:48.290> is

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
kinds of weird things but the bread is

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.080 
kinds of weird things but the bread is
baking<00:04:48.590> up<00:04:48.770> that<00:04:48.920> point<00:04:49.190> as<00:04:49.850> we<00:04:50.000> are

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
baking up that point as we are

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.970 
baking up that point as we are
desperately<00:04:50.450> trying<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.750> hold<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:51.110> back<00:04:51.320> they
