 see what happened to him and well he is 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.160
 warm 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.610
 android from scratch 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.310
 the first that we have to do 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.520
 is to download these two things in the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.700

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.910

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.670
 which is to install the android to 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.230
 our note also I leave the link in 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.550
 the description 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.059
 we download the odin does not occupy 300 kb and 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.640
 good in the room the firmware 4.1.2 for 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.800
 the nose occupies a little more busy 808 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.730
 megas but good first thing you have 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.220
 what to do is download these two 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.830
 records 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.080
 or that there are once downloaded those two 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.810
 things we have all the files then 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 let's extract them 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.670
 with the right to extract here 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.130
 although she will not decompress two 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.750
 files and let's unzip now the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.500
 odin 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.500
 Foreign 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.340
 and that they will not decompress between 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.840
 records 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.570
 ok here for now let's open this 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.120

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.810
 mobile ok 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.180
 here on the mobile we will take the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.930
 battery a few seconds to stay 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.090

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.740
 and the micro sd to do the process and 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.409
 after a few seconds then we go back to 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.890
 put the battery only the battery the 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.260

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.010
 we keep pressing until we get out 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.850
 a menu like this 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.250
 in which tells us what 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.050
 if we want to continue press on 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.290
 volume up and if we want to cancel 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.760

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.760

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.640
 then now we are going to connect the mobile 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.640
 by usb to computer 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.730

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.560
 I added it 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.780
