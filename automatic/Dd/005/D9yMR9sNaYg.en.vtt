00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
a tipping point for the company we've

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.210 
a tipping point for the company we've

getting those amazing so is an electric
bike<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:37.900> really<00:00:38.200> have<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.380> be<00:00:38.829> able<00:00:38.920> to

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
bike to really have to be able to

you<00:00:41.050> set<00:00:41.260> out<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.710> feel<00:00:42.160> like<00:00:42.250> we've<00:00:42.460> done<00:00:42.610> that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
you set out I feel like we've done that

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.710 
you set out I feel like we've done that
this<00:00:43.060> bike<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:44.500> really<00:00:44.800> believe<00:00:45.130> that<00:00:45.160> at<00:00:46.149> this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
this bike we really believe that at this

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.990 
this bike we really believe that at this
point<00:00:47.020> a<00:00:47.410> lot<00:00:47.860> of<00:00:48.010> those<00:00:48.130> restrictions<00:00:48.610> are

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
point a lot of those restrictions are

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.320 
point a lot of those restrictions are
gone<00:00:49.150> and<00:00:49.710> part<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.890> is<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.130> gearbox<00:00:51.520> 02

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
gone and part of it is the gearbox 02

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.910 
gone and part of it is the gearbox 02
performance<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.080> feel<00:00:53.320> when<00:00:53.590> you<00:00:53.680> get<00:00:53.800> on

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
performance in the feel when you get on

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.730 
performance in the feel when you get on
this<00:00:54.070> bike<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.600> step<00:00:55.930> away<00:00:56.080> from<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:56.620> after

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
this bike you step away from it after

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.850 
this bike you step away from it after
the<00:00:56.950> ribbon<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:57.490> say<00:00:57.700> this<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.630> like<00:00:58.930> a<00:00:59.200> gas

the ribbon you say this is like a gas

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.610 
the ribbon you say this is like a gas
pipe<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:01.030> know<00:01:01.180> everybody<00:01:01.900> is<00:01:02.290> coming<00:01:02.470> up

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
pipe and you know everybody is coming up

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.020 
pipe and you know everybody is coming up
with<00:01:02.770> a<00:01:02.800> different<00:01:02.980> one<00:01:03.310> but<00:01:03.490> I<00:01:03.550> here<00:01:03.730> trying

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030

Triple I hear the body monster I hear
some<00:01:06.400> very<00:01:06.640> good<00:01:06.939> you<00:01:07.330> know<00:01:07.450> comparable<00:01:08.290> and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
some very good you know comparable and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.760 
some very good you know comparable and
at<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.369> same<00:01:09.549> time<00:01:09.750> there's<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.990> idea<00:01:11.259> of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
at the same time there's this idea of

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.160 
at the same time there's this idea of
being<00:01:12.390> indulgent<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.479> get<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.689> ride<00:01:13.840> my<00:01:13.990> bike

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
being indulgent I get to ride my bike

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.530 
being indulgent I get to ride my bike
all<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.380> time<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:15.280> I'm<00:01:15.520> not<00:01:15.729> using<00:01:16.240> any

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
all the time and I'm not using any

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.690 
all the time and I'm not using any
possible<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.560> know<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.860> bike<00:01:18.310> still<00:01:18.550> use

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
possible you know and bike still use

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.250 
possible you know and bike still use
that<00:01:18.730> much<00:01:19.090> but<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.360> ducati<00:01:19.720> monster<00:01:19.900> isn't

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
that much but a ducati monster isn't

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.740 
that much but a ducati monster isn't
exactly<00:01:20.890> you<00:01:21.490> know<00:01:21.610> gas<00:01:21.909> efficient<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.630> know

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
exactly you know gas efficient you know

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.230 
exactly you know gas efficient you know
it's<00:01:22.930> not<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.110> scooter<00:01:23.530> by

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it's not a scooter by

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.990 
it's not a scooter by
so<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.340> side<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.610> being<00:01:26.909> able

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
so I think from the side of being able

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.780 
so I think from the side of being able
to<00:01:27.149> ride<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> bike<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> lot<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> fun<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to ride a bike back have a lot of fun to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.880 
to ride a bike back have a lot of fun to
all<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> performance<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.649> feel<00:01:31.860> guilty

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
all the performance and not feel guilty

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.070 
all the performance and not feel guilty
about<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.580> think<00:01:32.640> that's<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.149> side<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
about it I think that's one side the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.420 
about it I think that's one side the
second<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> world<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
second one is in the world of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.279 
second one is in the world of
motorcycling<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.479> has<00:01:36.720> changed<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
motorcycling not much has changed in the

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.050 
motorcycling not much has changed in the
last<00:01:37.380> hundred<00:01:37.649> years<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.789> it's<00:01:38.939> got

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
last hundred years you know it's got

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.359 
last hundred years you know it's got
pistons<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.020> got<00:01:40.229> exhaust<00:01:40.710> pipes<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
pistons and it's got exhaust pipes and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.870 
pistons and it's got exhaust pipes and
you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.899> belt<00:01:43.200> drives<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.100> PFI

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you know that belt drives and that PFI

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.060 
you know that belt drives and that PFI
but<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.049> isn't<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> landmark

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
but you know there isn't like a landmark

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.429 
but you know there isn't like a landmark
change<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.909> power<00:01:48.060> train<00:01:48.539> or<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
change in power train or in the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
change in power train or in the
technology<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.610> what<00:01:50.789> we<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.090> we

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
technology and that's what we think we

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
technology and that's what we think we
have<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.929> we<00:01:52.530> believe<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> you're

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
what this bike is so this particular

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.210 
what this bike is so this particular
bike<00:02:24.480> could<00:02:24.840> go<00:02:25.049> racing<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.650> new<00:02:25.830> super

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
bike could go racing in the new super

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.620 
bike could go racing in the new super

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
stock and the TTX GP so we'll probably

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.030 
stock and the TTX GP so we'll probably
do<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.959> next<00:02:31.140> year<00:02:31.380> if<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.590> don't<00:02:31.739> get<00:02:31.920> them

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
do that next year if we don't get them

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.280 
do that next year if we don't get them
