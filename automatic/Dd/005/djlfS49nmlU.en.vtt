00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the same orthodontic appliance you know 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 because the same orthodontic appliance is 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.799
 considered the orthodontic appliance 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.660
 invisible 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.349
 I'm doctor paulo coelho and today I am 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.349

 then the same orthodontic appliance 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.840
 is considered the orthodontic appliance 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.189
 invisible 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 simply because when you look at the 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.250
 both front and side 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.590
 you do not notice any kind of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.140
 accessory 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.720
 then it is considered the true 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.610
 device is visible 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.769
 now when you look inside the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.530
 mouth 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.629
 In this angle you will see the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.430
 appliance 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.580
 this is the orthodontic appliance a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.129
 of the most modern and current there are several 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.760
 same devices but this is one of the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.260
 because it is too small or too 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.979
 either bother or less the language 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.560
 unlike appliances 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.140
 orthodontic lingual 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.510
 so looking inside the mouth you 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.070
 notes that there is a 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.640
 orthodontic 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.950
 but when you position it 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.219
 in the year that people see 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.630
 When you smile when you talk to him 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:40.609
 becomes completely invisible device 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.820
 more discreet market 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:47.609
 and his adaptation is very good because he 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.069
 it's a little device let's look 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.679
 again how is it a device? 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.409
 small and we observe that a device 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.390

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.740
 the orthodontic appliance that you do not need 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.069

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.069
 which accelerates and greatly 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.220
 orthodontic treatment then it is the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.440
 A comfortable device is a 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 sky to the small is a device that the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.800
 self-ligating system so it is 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.530
 and the device considered invisible 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.140
 invisible when you look at the an 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.980
 of talking with the other of the smile 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.540
