let's<00:00:56.620> get<00:00:56.800> right<00:00:57.039> into<00:00:57.100> it

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.010 

the<00:01:03.890> story<00:01:04.159> for<00:01:04.400> this<00:01:04.550> game<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:05.120> separated<00:01:05.900> by

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
the story for this game is separated by

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.710 
the story for this game is separated by
different<00:01:06.430> heroes<00:01:07.430> first<00:01:08.000> with<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.450> thing

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
different heroes first with the thing

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.219 
different heroes first with the thing
then<00:01:09.170> will<00:01:09.380> green<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:10.850> on<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.540> have<00:01:12.050> not

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
then will green and so on I have not

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.320 
then will green and so on I have not
gotten<00:01:12.470> far<00:01:12.890> because<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:13.369> fell<00:01:13.909> asleep

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
gotten far because I fell asleep

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.120 
gotten far because I fell asleep
twice<00:01:14.540> playing<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:14.990> game<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:16.070> think

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
twice playing this game and I think

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.370 
twice playing this game and I think
that's<00:01:16.490> just<00:01:16.640> really<00:01:16.760> a<00:01:17.000> bad<00:01:17.330> sign<00:01:17.630> why

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
that's just really a bad sign why

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.440 
that's just really a bad sign why
because<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:18.950> game<00:01:19.220> is<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.610> beat'em<00:01:20.060> up<00:01:20.180> game

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
because this game is a beat'em up game

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.010 
because this game is a beat'em up game
right<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:22.790> whole<00:01:23.000> point<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:23.750> game<00:01:23.960> i

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
right but the whole point of this game i

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.890 
right but the whole point of this game i
thought<00:01:24.410> was<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.100> make<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.759> fighter<00:01:26.420> not<00:01:26.840> a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
thought was to make it a fighter not a

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.660 
thought was to make it a fighter not a
beat'em<00:01:27.259> up<00:01:27.410> so<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.710> was<00:01:27.890> wrong<00:01:28.070> when<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.430> first

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
beat'em up so I was wrong when I first

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.140 
beat'em up so I was wrong when I first
picked<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.180> game<00:01:29.390> up<00:01:30.640> but<00:01:31.640> that's<00:01:31.880> where<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
picked the game up but that's where the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.330 
picked the game up but that's where the
game<00:01:32.300> played<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.659> story<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.290> basically<00:01:33.770> these

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
game played the story is basically these

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.190 
game played the story is basically these
guys<00:01:34.399> invaded<00:01:35.330> your<00:01:35.539> town<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.050> they're

bullshit<00:02:00.440> silly<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:02.090> story<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.479> really

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
bullshit silly so the story is really

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.419 
bullshit silly so the story is really
dumb<00:02:03.050> right<00:02:03.259> now<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:03.500> mean<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:03.920> could<00:02:04.070> get<00:02:04.250> that

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
dumb right now I mean it could get that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.760 
dumb right now I mean it could get that
as<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.729> goes<00:02:04.880> on<00:02:05.119> but<00:02:05.420> story<00:02:06.170> right<00:02:06.380> now<00:02:06.410> is

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
as it goes on but story right now is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.040 
as it goes on but story right now is
probably<00:02:07.099> just<00:02:07.550> kind<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.209> stupid<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:08.959> I

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
probably just kind of stupid and I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.290 
probably just kind of stupid and I
thought<00:02:09.229> Marvel<00:02:09.679> can<00:02:09.830> do<00:02:09.950> better<00:02:16.060> things<00:02:17.060> are

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
thought Marvel can do better things are

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.130 
thought Marvel can do better things are
decent<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:19.340> models<00:02:19.790> look<00:02:20.030> okay<00:02:20.569> there's<00:02:21.050> a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
decent the models look okay there's a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.860 
decent the models look okay there's a
new<00:02:21.290> look<00:02:21.530> for<00:02:21.560> them<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.910> usually<00:02:23.450> though

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
new look for them then usually though

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.440 
new look for them then usually though
some<00:02:24.560> obviously<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.610> always<00:02:26.000> spider-man

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
some obviously as always spider-man

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.720 
some obviously as always spider-man
looks<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.750> spider-man<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
looks like spider-man and so on the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.550 
looks like spider-man and so on the
actual<00:02:29.180> enemies<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.780> fight<00:02:29.989> in<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> story

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
actual enemies you fight in the story

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.460 
actual enemies you fight in the story
mode<00:02:30.770> are<00:02:31.099> retarded<00:02:31.700> looking<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.540> think<00:02:33.380> they

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
mode are retarded looking I think they

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.440 
mode are retarded looking I think they
have<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> shitty-ass<00:02:34.130> design<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.090> whatever

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
have a shitty-ass design but whatever

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.720 
have a shitty-ass design but whatever
I'm<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:35.720> fighting<00:02:36.319> actually<00:02:36.860> being<00:02:37.280> perfect

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
I'm not fighting actually being perfect

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.000 
I'm not fighting actually being perfect
these<00:02:38.450> guys<00:02:38.660> are<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.050> called<00:02:39.290> invaders<00:02:39.800> and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
these guys are just called invaders and

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.830 
these guys are just called invaders and
they<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:40.819> look<00:02:40.970> retarded<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.920> me<00:02:43.840> it's

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
they just look retarded so to me it's

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.900 
they just look retarded so to me it's
half<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.260> half<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.590> think<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.920> actual<00:02:46.310> Marvel

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.760 
half and half I think the actual Marvel
characters<00:02:47.360> look<00:02:47.540> good<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.200> everything<00:02:48.319> else

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
characters look good but everything else

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.960 
characters look good but everything else
looks<00:02:48.860> bad<00:02:49.569> well<00:02:50.569> not<00:02:50.720> bad<00:02:50.959> but<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.410> average

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
looks bad well not bad but just average

nothing<00:02:52.970> special

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
think EA rush this one in my opinion

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.640 
think EA rush this one in my opinion
because<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:04.450> all<00:04:04.659> know<00:04:04.689> I<00:04:04.870> actually<00:04:05.199> give<00:04:05.530> me

because you all know I actually give me

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.759 
because you all know I actually give me
a<00:04:05.680> chance<00:04:06.159> I'm<00:04:06.400> like<00:04:06.579> most<00:04:06.849> gamers<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:08.049> this

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
a chance I'm like most gamers but this

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.699 
a chance I'm like most gamers but this
one<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.129> just<00:04:09.310> pathetic<00:04:09.549> on<00:04:10.030> their<00:04:10.209> form<00:04:10.709> so

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
one is just pathetic on their form so

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.990 
one is just pathetic on their form so
the<00:04:12.069> gameplay<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.879> average<00:04:13.510> at<00:04:14.260> best<00:04:14.940> as<00:04:15.940> a

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
the gameplay is average at best as a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.420 
the gameplay is average at best as a
marvel<00:04:16.630> fan<00:04:16.810> I'm<00:04:16.989> a<00:04:17.019> huge<00:04:17.380> one<00:04:17.680> no<00:04:18.099> I<00:04:18.130> don't

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
marvel fan I'm a huge one no I don't

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.729 
marvel fan I'm a huge one no I don't
know<00:04:18.549> every<00:04:18.970> Marvel<00:04:19.389> counter<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:19.989> like<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.650> a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
know every Marvel counter I like it a

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.740 
know every Marvel counter I like it a
lot<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:21.729> half<00:04:22.060> answer<00:04:22.599> my

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
lot and this is just half answer my

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
lot and this is just half answer my
opinion<00:04:23.669> half<00:04:24.669> ass<00:04:25.000> home<00:04:25.300> game<00:04:25.510> for

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.730 

the<00:04:37.770> vs.<00:04:38.190> sauce<00:04:38.690> it's<00:04:39.690> basically<00:04:40.169> this<00:04:40.470> with

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
the vs. sauce it's basically this with

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.600 
the vs. sauce it's basically this with
two<00:04:40.889> characters

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
two characters

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.339 
two characters
I<00:04:41.639> think<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.360> vs.<00:04:42.720> might<00:04:42.900> have<00:04:43.050> been<00:04:43.169> better

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
I think the vs. might have been better

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.960 
I think the vs. might have been better
if<00:04:43.590> they<00:04:43.710> made<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.009> for<00:04:44.220> players<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:44.580> there's

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
if they made it for players but there's

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.969 
if they made it for players but there's
only<00:04:45.090> two<00:04:45.360> players<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:46.349> can<00:04:46.620> be<00:04:46.770> due<00:04:46.949> to

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
only two players this can be due to

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.430 
only two players this can be due to
being<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.789> ps2<00:04:48.300> version<00:04:48.330> maybe<00:04:48.840> Xbox<00:04:49.289> has

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
being the ps2 version maybe Xbox has

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.700 
being the ps2 version maybe Xbox has
more<00:04:49.710> but<00:04:49.889> I<00:04:49.919> doubt<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:51.150> feels<00:04:51.539> like<00:04:51.810> open

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
more but I doubt it it feels like open

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.760 
more but I doubt it it feels like open
world<00:04:52.949> almost<00:04:53.460> Power<00:04:53.880> Stone<00:04:54.270> like<00:04:54.630> but<00:04:55.500> with

world almost Power Stone like but with

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.100 
world almost Power Stone like but with
one<00:04:56.039> button<00:04:56.310> attack<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:57.270> special<00:04:57.930> that's

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
one button attack a special that's

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.339 
one button attack a special that's
really<00:04:58.590> retarded<00:04:59.570> they<00:05:00.570> usually<00:05:00.750> look<00:05:01.020> really

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
really retarded they usually look really
