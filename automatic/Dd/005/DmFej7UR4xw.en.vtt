screen<00:00:52.199> trying<00:00:53.199> tell<00:00:53.589> to<00:00:53.710> design<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.220> see

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
screen trying tell to design and see

00:00:54.369 --> 00:01:00.439 
screen trying tell to design and see
above<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.760> reflection<00:00:55.210> of<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.330> window<00:00:55.420> both

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

can<00:01:01.449> see<00:01:01.659> sound<00:01:01.960> works<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:02.350> everything<00:01:02.530> else

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
can see sound works and everything else

can see sound works and everything else
so<00:01:02.860> Sonic<00:01:03.129> 1<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.400> on<00:01:03.549> there<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.680> what<00:01:05.830> I'm

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
so Sonic 1 is on there and what I'm

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.590 
so Sonic 1 is on there and what I'm
going<00:01:06.010> to<00:01:06.040> do<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.310> I'm<00:01:06.460> going<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.640> start<00:01:07.360> Sonic

going to do is I'm going to start Sonic

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.910 
going to do is I'm going to start Sonic
1<00:01:07.720> under<00:01:07.869> that<00:01:07.960> at<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.350> same<00:01:08.530> time<00:01:08.590> I'm<00:01:08.830> going

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
1 under that at the same time I'm going

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.130 
1 under that at the same time I'm going
to<00:01:09.010> turn<00:01:09.160> this<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:09.880> missus<00:01:10.450> got<00:01:10.780> Sonic<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
to turn this on so missus got Sonic the

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.860 
to turn this on so missus got Sonic the
Hedgehog<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:11.800> as<00:01:12.190> well<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.540> we'll<00:01:13.660> see<00:01:13.780> the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
Hedgehog in as well so we'll see the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:33.060 
Hedgehog in as well so we'll see the
difference<00:01:30.660> you<00:01:31.660> can<00:01:31.810> see<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.110> straightaway

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
difference you can see the straightaway

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.370 
difference you can see the straightaway
the<00:01:33.220> vibrancy<00:01:33.760> in<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.880> colors<00:01:34.180> on<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.140> one<00:01:35.260> on

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
the vibrancy in the colors on the one on

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.050 
the vibrancy in the colors on the one on
the<00:01:35.530> left-hand<00:01:35.980> side<00:01:36.159> we<00:01:36.610> turn<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.909> volume

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
the left-hand side we turn the volume

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.000 
the left-hand side we turn the volume
down<00:01:37.240> visually<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:44.080> with<00:01:44.440> sunlight<00:01:44.770> coming

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
down visually so with sunlight coming

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.930 
down visually so with sunlight coming
down<00:01:45.220> directly<00:01:45.670> on<00:01:45.880> it

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.280 

the<00:01:51.940> difference<00:01:52.330> is<00:01:52.450> vast<00:01:52.690> with<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> screen

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
the difference is vast with the screen

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.000 
the difference is vast with the screen
Mod<00:01:54.990> image<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.080> a<00:01:56.110> lot<00:01:56.260> sharper<00:01:56.530> on<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
Mod image is a lot sharper on the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.380 
Mod image is a lot sharper on the
left-hand<00:01:57.370> side<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.790> doesn't<00:01:57.940> look<00:01:58.120> blurry

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
left-hand side it doesn't look blurry

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.910 
left-hand side it doesn't look blurry
compared<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.260> one<00:01:59.380> on<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.560> right<00:01:59.710> and

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
compared to the one on the right and

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.500 
compared to the one on the right and
obviously<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.580> contrast<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.210> hell<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.390> a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
obviously the contrast is a hell of a

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.730 
obviously the contrast is a hell of a
lot<00:02:01.630> higher<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.960> brightness<00:02:02.290> is<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.470> hell<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.620> a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
lot higher the brightness is a hell of a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.620 
lot higher the brightness is a hell of a
lot<00:02:02.830> higher<00:02:03.010> much<00:02:03.850> more<00:02:04.030> comfortable<00:02:04.420> on<00:02:04.540> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
lot higher much more comfortable on the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.940 
lot higher much more comfortable on the
eye<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.780> watch<00:02:05.050> I<00:02:06.420> kind<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.680> focus<00:02:08.680> in<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.860> little

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
eye to watch I kind of focus in a little

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:22.770 
eye to watch I kind of focus in a little
bit<00:02:09.160> more<00:02:18.420> press<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.600> one<00:02:21.570> really<00:02:22.570> see<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
bit more press this one really see the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.490 
bit more press this one really see the
difference<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.960> yeah<00:02:29.050> maybe<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.410> you're

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
difference so yeah maybe if you're

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.650 
difference so yeah maybe if you're
looking<00:02:29.710> for<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.890> second<00:02:30.430> Nomad<00:02:30.700> maybe<00:02:31.000> try<00:02:31.570> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
looking for a second Nomad maybe try and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.970 
looking for a second Nomad maybe try and
be<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:31.810> eBay<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.170> look<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.830> has<00:02:32.950> a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
be on eBay and look for a one that has a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.910 
be on eBay and look for a one that has a
screen<00:02:33.310> mode<00:02:33.520> on<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.670> already<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.270> can

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
screen mode on it already so you can

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.870 
screen mode on it already so you can
find<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.010> easier<00:02:36.280> probably<00:02:36.490> less<00:02:36.700> eye<00:02:36.850> strain

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
find it easier probably less eye strain

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.690 
find it easier probably less eye strain

more fun to play your games to they'll
be<00:02:39.850> as<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.090> probably<00:02:40.330> remember<00:02:40.480> them<00:02:40.810> rather

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
be as you probably remember them rather

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.670 
be as you probably remember them rather
than<00:02:41.170> being<00:02:41.320> kind<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> washed<00:02:41.800> out<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.220> and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
than being kind of washed out and and

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.050 
than being kind of washed out and and
blurry<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.860> what<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.130> can<00:02:45.250> see<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.640> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
blurry is what you can see on the the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.140 
blurry is what you can see on the the
old<00:02:46.210> Nomad<00:02:47.550> granted<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.670> screen<00:02:48.970> is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
old Nomad granted this screen is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.450 
old Nomad granted this screen is
probably<00:02:49.390> about<00:02:49.810> 15<00:02:50.170> or<00:02:50.560> more<00:02:50.680> years<00:02:50.830> old<00:02:51.070> so

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
probably about 15 or more years old so

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.140 
probably about 15 or more years old so
you<00:02:51.730> can't<00:02:52.480> fault<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.080> too<00:02:53.230> much<00:02:53.380> but<00:02:54.150> for

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
you can't fault it too much but for

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.670 
you can't fault it too much but for
playing<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.570> these<00:02:55.660> times<00:02:55.989> certainly<00:02:56.620> a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
playing in these times certainly a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.670 
playing in these times certainly a
screen<00:02:56.950> mode<00:02:57.100> certainly<00:02:57.430> helps<00:02:58.410> anyway<00:02:59.410> hope

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
screen mode certainly helps anyway hope

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.290 
screen mode certainly helps anyway hope
