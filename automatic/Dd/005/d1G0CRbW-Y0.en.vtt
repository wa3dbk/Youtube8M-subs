00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you that the silicon one is the same

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
you that the silicon one is the same
material<00:01:21.840> as<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> silicon<00:01:22.530> case<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
material as the silicon case for the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.820 
material as the silicon case for the
iPhone<00:01:23.369> 5c<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.570> thought<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.930> felt<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.350> lot

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
iPhone 5c and I thought it felt a lot

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
iPhone 5c and I thought it felt a lot
lot<00:01:26.100> better<00:01:26.369> than<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> leather<00:01:27.750> feel<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.380> don't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
lot better than the leather feel I don't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830 
lot better than the leather feel I don't
know<00:01:28.740> why<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.400> me<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:30.090> did<00:01:30.299> maybe<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> was

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
know why to me just did maybe it was

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.149 
know why to me just did maybe it was
because<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.170> ridiculously<00:01:31.680> early<00:01:31.770> who

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
because it was ridiculously early who

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.319 
because it was ridiculously early who
knows<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.329> go<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.200> iPhone<00:01:34.590> 6<00:01:35.329> now

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.690 
feel like the white lines look a bit
more<00:03:43.169> at<00:03:43.290> home<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.069> gold<00:03:44.280> weather<00:03:44.549> than

they do on the other ones very very thin

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.750 
they do on the other ones very very thin
as<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.940> can<00:03:48.090> see<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.620> rounded<00:03:50.010> edges<00:03:50.340> I'm<00:03:50.549> not

as you can see the rounded edges I'm not

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.460 
as you can see the rounded edges I'm not

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
too sure if I like any of this sort of

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.589 
too sure if I like any of this sort of
redesign<00:03:52.950> or<00:03:53.130> not<00:03:53.250> when<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:53.730> held<00:03:54.000> Dom<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.419> there

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
redesign or not when I held Dom it there

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.659 
the dummies that dog-boy over Mac mixing
I<00:03:57.329> wasn't<00:03:58.109> particularly<00:03:58.440> fond<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:58.980> them<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.430> I

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
I wasn't particularly fond of them so I

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.430 
I wasn't particularly fond of them so I
wanted<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.150> sort<00:04:00.359> of<00:04:00.480> reserve<00:04:00.810> judgment<00:04:01.319> for

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
wanted to sort of reserve judgment for

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.020

the height I'm not sure quite sure how

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.320 
the height I'm not sure quite sure how
well<00:04:27.449> this<00:04:28.169> will<00:04:28.379> come<00:04:28.560> out<00:04:28.819> if<00:04:29.819> I<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.150> hold

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
well this will come out if I just hold

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.219 
well this will come out if I just hold
that<00:04:30.449> up<00:04:30.569> there<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:32.360> bulge<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.020> rear

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
that up there is that bulge of the rear

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.860 
that up there is that bulge of the rear
facing<00:04:34.530> camera<00:04:35.099> it<00:04:35.520> really<00:04:36.000> does<00:04:36.180> look

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
facing camera it really does look

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.649 
facing camera it really does look
horrible<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.039> he's<00:04:38.550> very<00:04:38.789> impractical<00:04:39.180> when

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
horrible and he's very impractical when

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.290 
horrible and he's very impractical when
you<00:04:39.750> put<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.080> flat<00:04:40.830> on<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:41.099> surface<00:04:41.129> and<00:04:42.030> in<00:04:42.150> fact

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
you put it flat on a surface and in fact

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.570 
you put it flat on a surface and in fact
it<00:04:42.479> seems<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:43.050> come<00:04:43.080> out<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.409> lot<00:04:43.740> further<00:04:44.159> than

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
it seems to come out a lot further than

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.460 
it seems to come out a lot further than
I<00:04:44.909> had<00:04:45.360> originally<00:04:45.419> thought<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.080> wood<00:04:46.259> dough

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
I had originally thought in wood dough

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.589 
I had originally thought in wood dough
which<00:04:46.979> is<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.129> bit<00:04:47.490> disappointing<00:04:47.729> when<00:04:48.509> you

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
which is a bit disappointing when you

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.140 
which is a bit disappointing when you
lay<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.870> flat<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:49.530> not<00:04:49.680> gonna<00:04:49.800> sit<00:04:50.099> right<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
lay it flat it's not gonna sit right and

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.820 
lay it flat it's not gonna sit right and
it<00:04:51.240> just<00:04:51.419> looks<00:04:51.629> unappealing<00:04:52.199> as<00:04:52.349> well<00:04:52.530> so

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
it just looks unappealing as well so

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.020 
it just looks unappealing as well so
it's<00:04:52.949> a<00:04:52.979> shame<00:04:53.159> that<00:04:53.220> Apple<00:04:53.580> ever<00:04:53.699> managed<00:04:53.970> to

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
it's a shame that Apple ever managed to

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.839 
it's a shame that Apple ever managed to
do<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.830> my<00:04:56.009> first<00:04:56.250> impression

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
do that but that is my first impression

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.640 
do that but that is my first impression
I<00:04:57.000> will<00:04:57.690> go<00:04:57.840> through<00:04:58.020> what<00:04:58.229> else<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.500> get<00:04:58.620> in

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
I will go through what else you get in

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.930 
I will go through what else you get in
the<00:04:58.740> box<00:04:58.949> because<00:04:59.159> I<00:04:59.220> know<00:04:59.280> some<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.759> guys

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940

the box because I know some of you guys
are<00:05:00.120> very<00:05:00.240> very<00:05:00.599> particular<00:05:00.930> about<00:05:01.380> that<00:05:01.830> so

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
are very very particular about that so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.879 
are very very particular about that so
