try<00:00:19.400> it<00:00:19.460> out<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:19.700> go<00:00:19.820> first<00:00:23.680> yeah<00:00:24.680> that<00:00:24.950> was

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
try it out you go first yeah that was

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.300 
try it out you go first yeah that was
that<00:00:25.520> was<00:00:25.700> not<00:00:25.940> bad<00:00:26.150> I<00:00:26.450> have<00:00:26.660> DRS<00:00:27.020> DRS<00:00:27.770> look<00:00:28.100> I'm

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
that was not bad I have DRS DRS look I'm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.890 
that was not bad I have DRS DRS look I'm
putting<00:00:28.580> my<00:00:28.700> wings<00:00:28.940> up<00:00:29.150> that<00:00:29.570> doesn't<00:00:29.840> look

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
putting my wings up that doesn't look

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.130 
putting my wings up that doesn't look
that<00:00:29.960> great<00:00:30.170> check<00:00:30.620> it<00:00:30.710> out<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:34.750> paper<00:00:35.750> plane

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
that great check it out a paper plane

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.710 
that great check it out a paper plane
but<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.550> actually<00:00:37.700> tells<00:00:38.000> us<00:00:38.240> quite<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.450> bit<00:00:38.540> of

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
but it actually tells us quite a bit of

can see on this paper plane it has some

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.080 
can see on this paper plane it has some

can push a button in the cockpit and he

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.640 
can push a button in the cockpit and he
can<00:01:12.770> open<00:01:12.979> this<00:01:13.340> flap<00:01:13.550> which<00:01:14.510> reduces<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
can open this flap which reduces the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.219 
can open this flap which reduces the
drag<00:01:15.940> generated<00:01:16.940> by<00:01:17.120> the<00:01:17.180> rear<00:01:17.540> wing<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
drag generated by the rear wing on the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.649 
drag generated by the rear wing on the
car<00:01:18.560> significantly<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.000> point<00:01:20.299> where<00:01:20.570> it

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
car significantly to the point where it

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.570 
car significantly to the point where it
makes<00:01:20.870> overtaking<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.799> car<00:01:22.010> in<00:01:22.130> front<00:01:22.310> an

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
makes overtaking the car in front an

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.670 
makes overtaking the car in front an
awful<00:01:23.150> lot<00:01:23.240> easier<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.960> way<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.140> use<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.560> is

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
awful lot easier the way you use it is

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.039 
awful lot easier the way you use it is
that<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.400> get<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.580> beat<00:01:25.850> which<00:01:26.390> tells<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:26.930> that

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
that you get a beat which tells you that

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.510 
that you get a beat which tells you that
you<00:01:27.170> now<00:01:27.290> you're<00:01:27.530> allowed<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.920> activate<00:01:28.370> it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
you now you're allowed to activate it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.670 
you now you're allowed to activate it
when<00:01:29.030> you're<00:01:29.180> within<00:01:29.390> one<00:01:29.659> second<00:01:30.080> of<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.500> car

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
when you're within one second of the car

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.980 
when you're within one second of the car
in<00:01:30.740> front<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:31.790> then<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.090> wait<00:01:32.299> until<00:01:32.630> you

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
in front and so then you wait until you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.600 
in front and so then you wait until you
get<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.320> white<00:01:33.619> line<00:01:33.830> when<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.430> get<00:01:34.520> to

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
get to the white line when you get to

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.130 
get to the white line when you get to
the<00:01:34.700> white<00:01:34.850> line<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.330> can<00:01:35.510> push<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.810> button

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
the white line you can push the button

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.230 
the white line you can push the button
that<00:01:36.590> puts<00:01:36.830> down<00:01:37.010> your<00:01:37.190> rear<00:01:37.340> wing<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.790> gives

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
that puts down your rear wing and gives

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.760 
that puts down your rear wing and gives
you<00:01:38.330> extra<00:01:38.600> top<00:01:38.840> speed<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.290> overtake<00:01:39.590> the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
you extra top speed to overtake the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.890 
you extra top speed to overtake the
person<00:01:40.070> in<00:01:40.159> front<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.909> DRS<00:01:41.330> when<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.750> engage

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
person in front the DRS when you engage

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.140 
person in front the DRS when you engage
it<00:01:42.229> it's<00:01:42.380> like<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.560> boost<00:01:42.860> like<00:01:43.340> pressing<00:01:43.880> cuz

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
it it's like a boost like pressing cuz

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.510 
it it's like a boost like pressing cuz
it's<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.810> same<00:01:45.049> feeling<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:45.590> cuz<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.310> when<00:01:46.430> you

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it's the same feeling as cuz so when you

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.100 
it's the same feeling as cuz so when you
press<00:01:46.700> courage<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.180> get<00:01:47.330> one<00:01:47.570> boost<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.020> then

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
press courage you get one boost and then

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.750 
press courage you get one boost and then
you<00:01:48.170> press<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.470> DRS<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:48.979> get<00:01:49.100> another<00:01:49.340> one

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
you press the DRS you get another one

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
you press the DRS you get another one
almost<00:01:50.330> exactly<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.750> same<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:53.240> issue<00:01:53.420> of

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
almost exactly the same the issue of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.530 
almost exactly the same the issue of
reducing<00:01:54.290> drag<00:01:54.500> on<00:01:54.830> Formula<00:01:55.340> One<00:01:55.460> car<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:56.210> very

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
reducing drag on Formula One car is very

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.539 
reducing drag on Formula One car is very
relevant<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:57.170> reducing<00:01:57.530> drag<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:57.979> road<00:01:58.189> cars

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
relevant to reducing drag on road cars

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.330 
relevant to reducing drag on road cars
to<00:01:59.000> make<00:01:59.150> them<00:01:59.330> more<00:01:59.689> fuel-efficient<00:02:00.470> equally

can you still see minor mines gone so
far<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:10.789> can't<00:02:10.999> see<00:02:11.209> any
