it's all part of the whole thing I think

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.080 
it's all part of the whole thing I think
in<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.650> indie<00:02:40.920> landscape<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.549> we<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.879> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
in the indie landscape if we can get to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.759 
in the indie landscape if we can get to
the<00:02:42.209> point<00:02:42.450> where<00:02:42.690> filmmakers<00:02:43.049> can<00:02:43.470> kind<00:02:43.709> of

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
the point where filmmakers can kind of

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.069 
the point where filmmakers can kind of
create<00:02:43.980> their<00:02:44.280> own<00:02:44.310> body<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.329> work<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.930> be
