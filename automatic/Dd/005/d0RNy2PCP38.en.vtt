actually as far as advertisements go

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.900 
actually as far as advertisements go
it's<00:03:17.440> about<00:03:17.620> 2<00:03:17.830> minutes<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.190> 30<00:03:18.250> seconds<00:03:18.790> and

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
there's the dogs again and the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.330

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
and the reason for that is because of

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.250 
and the reason for that is because of
google<00:03:27.970> advertising<00:03:28.180> I've<00:03:28.870> been<00:03:29.079> using

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
Google AdWords because I believe this

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.650 
Google AdWords because I believe this
