have<00:02:15.150> something<00:02:15.329> special<00:02:15.450> inside<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.319> have

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
have something special inside so we have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.899 
have something special inside so we have
the<00:02:16.530> potential<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.519> when<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.670> see

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
the potential to do that and when I see

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.369 
the potential to do that and when I see
dancers<00:02:18.360> when<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.540> see<00:02:18.599> people<00:02:18.689> like<00:02:18.959> Chris<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
dancers when I see people like Chris and

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.250 
dancers when I see people like Chris and
Harry<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:19.980> all<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.489> b-boys<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
Harry and and all the b-boys and

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.569 
Harry and and all the b-boys and
triggers<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.220> realize<00:02:23.549> that

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
triggers that we have you realize that

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.250 
triggers that we have you realize that
actually<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.180> human<00:02:24.450> potential<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.989> greater

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
actually the human potential is greater

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.890 
actually the human potential is greater
and<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.189> think<00:02:26.220> that's<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.670> great<00:02:26.819> thing<00:02:27.659> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
and and I think that's a great thing and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.630 
and and I think that's a great thing and
inspiration<00:02:28.439> for<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> storytelling<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.519> we

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
inspiration for a storytelling so we

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.069 
inspiration for a storytelling so we
were<00:02:29.700> trying<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:29.970> take<00:02:30.090> dance<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.569> not<00:02:30.900> just

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
were trying to take dance and not just

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.599 
were trying to take dance and not just
make<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.290> spinning<00:02:32.040> on<00:02:32.220> your<00:02:32.370> head<00:02:32.579> or

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
make it spinning on your head or

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.490 
make it spinning on your head or
flipping<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.269> your<00:02:33.450> back<00:02:33.599> we<00:02:34.109> actually<00:02:34.230> try<00:02:34.470> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
flipping on your back we actually try to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.170 
flipping on your back we actually try to
push<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.799> into<00:02:35.040> what<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.670> means<00:02:35.909> to<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> human

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
push it into what it means to be a human

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.420 
push it into what it means to be a human
being<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.439> and<00:02:37.709> i<00:02:37.829> think<00:02:37.890> that's<00:02:38.189> that's

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
being and and and i think that's that's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.130 
being and and and i think that's that's
what<00:02:38.579> we're<00:02:38.670> gonna<00:02:38.760> play<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.480> sometimes
