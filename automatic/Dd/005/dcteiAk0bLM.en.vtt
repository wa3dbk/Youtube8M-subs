00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.970 
say a Lampson but if you're balancing
this<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:11.300> six<00:02:11.750> weight<00:02:11.959> rod<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:12.739> gonna<00:02:12.860> be

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
this on a six weight rod it's gonna be

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.680 
this on a six weight rod it's gonna be
no<00:02:13.099> problem<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.879> also<00:02:14.150> got<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:15.019> 1.6<00:02:15.709> inch

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
no problem it's also got a 1.6 inch

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.020 
no problem it's also got a 1.6 inch
diameter<00:02:17.690> Arbor<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> lot<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.640> people<00:02:19.879> talk

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
diameter Arbor so a lot of people talk

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.030 
diameter Arbor so a lot of people talk
about<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.300> real<00:02:20.540> diameter<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.680> three

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
about the real diameter this is three

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.530 
about the real diameter this is three
point<00:02:22.280> three<00:02:22.370> inches<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.239> really

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
point three inches but what really

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.000 
point three inches but what really
matters<00:02:23.959> when<00:02:24.140> you're<00:02:24.200> fighting<00:02:24.379> a<00:02:24.560> fish<00:02:24.769> is

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
matters when you're fighting a fish is

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.220 
matters when you're fighting a fish is
that<00:02:25.489> arbor<00:02:26.000> diameter<00:02:26.450> because<00:02:26.810> that's<00:02:27.019> going

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
that arbor diameter because that's going

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.289 
that arbor diameter because that's going
to<00:02:27.290> show<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.650> how<00:02:28.220> fast<00:02:28.580> you're<00:02:28.849> picking<00:02:29.180> up

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
to show you how fast you're picking up

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.660 
to show you how fast you're picking up
that<00:02:29.360> line<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.319> at<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.680> point<00:02:30.709> six<00:02:31.250> inches

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that line and at one point six inches

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.780 
that line and at one point six inches
this<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.480> gonna<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.170> fair<00:02:33.890> bit<00:02:34.099> smaller<00:02:34.519> than

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
this is gonna be a fair bit smaller than

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.940 
this is gonna be a fair bit smaller than
the<00:02:34.970> largest<00:02:35.330> arbors<00:02:35.840> out<00:02:35.989> there<00:02:36.230> which

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
the largest arbors out there which

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.860 
the largest arbors out there which
you're<00:02:37.340> gonna<00:02:37.400> find<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:37.940> reels<00:02:38.569> like<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
you're gonna find on reels like the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.289 
you're gonna find on reels like the
Lampson<00:02:39.200> speedster<00:02:39.769> or<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.430> hatch<00:02:40.579> four<00:02:41.000> plus

those are gonna be in the two plus inch
range<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:44.090> would<00:02:44.660> call<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.380> mid<00:02:46.040> arbor<00:02:46.640> reel

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970

maximum line pick up they may make this

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.780 
maximum line pick up they may make this
in<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.319> large<00:02:51.560> arbor<00:02:51.920> version<00:02:52.280> when<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.549> ready

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
in a large arbor version when it's ready

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.500 
in a large arbor version when it's ready
for<00:02:52.849> production

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
for production

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.860 
for production
the<00:02:54.260> really<00:02:54.680> reason<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.489> love<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.629> able

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
the really reason that we love this able

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.319 
the really reason that we love this able
SD<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:58.190> drag<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:58.730> we're<00:02:58.849> gonna<00:02:58.940> take<00:02:59.180> this

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
SD is the drag so we're gonna take this

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.479 
SD is the drag so we're gonna take this
apart<00:03:00.019> here<00:03:00.319> and<00:03:00.500> show<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.099> what<00:03:01.190> it's<00:03:01.400> all

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
apart here and show you what it's all

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.430 
apart here and show you what it's all
about

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
about

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.190 
about
first<00:03:03.440> off<00:03:03.879> super<00:03:04.879> quick<00:03:05.480> change<00:03:05.810> spool

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
first off super quick change spool

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.750 
first off super quick change spool
almost<00:03:07.190> another<00:03:07.459> first<00:03:07.819> for<00:03:07.910> able<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:10.459> comes

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
almost another first for able it comes

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.180 
almost another first for able it comes
off<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.239> couple<00:03:11.450> twists<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:13.040> can

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
off with a couple twists and you can

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.949 
off with a couple twists and you can
switch<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.430> spool<00:03:13.850> right<00:03:14.060> out<00:03:14.269> but<00:03:14.810> then

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
switch that spool right out but then

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.240 
switch that spool right out but then
you'll<00:03:15.109> notice<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:16.810> super<00:03:17.810> super<00:03:18.139> sealed<00:03:18.680> drag

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
you'll notice a super super sealed drag

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.420 
you'll notice a super super sealed drag
and<00:03:19.750> this<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:20.900> what<00:03:21.049> makes<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.530> SD<00:03:21.889> really

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
and this is what makes the SD really

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.210 
and this is what makes the SD really
special<00:03:22.880> in<00:03:23.000> our<00:03:23.090> opinion<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:24.739> drag<00:03:25.040> has

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
special in our opinion this drag has

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.270 
special in our opinion this drag has
been<00:03:25.340> tested<00:03:26.120> left<00:03:26.930> under<00:03:27.170> water<00:03:27.440> for<00:03:27.590> very

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
been tested left under water for very

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.580 
been tested left under water for very
very<00:03:28.579> long<00:03:28.849> periods<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.359> time<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:30.019> make<00:03:30.349> sure

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
very long periods of time to make sure

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.830 
very long periods of time to make sure
it<00:03:30.680> doesn't<00:03:30.859> fail<00:03:31.190> you're<00:03:32.180> getting<00:03:32.450> all<00:03:32.690> that

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
it doesn't fail you're getting all that

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.129 
it doesn't fail you're getting all that
same<00:03:33.109> able<00:03:33.470> quality<00:03:33.980> put<00:03:34.579> into<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.910> modern<00:03:35.599> drag

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
same able quality put into a modern drag

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.550 
same able quality put into a modern drag
and<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.609> this<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.540> super<00:03:38.930> maintenance-free

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
and so this is a super maintenance-free

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.360 
and so this is a super maintenance-free
drag<00:03:40.099> but<00:03:41.090> more<00:03:41.510> than<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.889> super

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
drag but more than that it's a super

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.379 
drag but more than that it's a super
smooth<00:03:43.760> drag<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:46.340> doesn't<00:03:46.669> take<00:03:46.819> long<00:03:47.090> to

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
smooth drag so it doesn't take long to

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.229 
smooth drag so it doesn't take long to
realize<00:03:47.739> that<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:49.099> can<00:03:49.430> crank<00:03:49.669> this<00:03:49.849> all<00:03:50.120> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
realize that you can crank this all the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.449 
realize that you can crank this all the
way<00:03:50.329> down<00:03:50.380> you're<00:03:51.380> got<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.769> fair<00:03:52.220> bit<00:03:52.430> of

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
way down you're got a fair bit of

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.400 
way down you're got a fair bit of
stopping<00:03:52.940> power<00:03:53.150> but<00:03:53.510> what's<00:03:54.200> really

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
stopping power but what's really

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.379 
stopping power but what's really
important<00:03:55.099> when<00:03:55.400> you're<00:03:55.579> out<00:03:55.760> trout<00:03:56.120> fishing

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
important when you're out trout fishing

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.599 
important when you're out trout fishing
when<00:03:57.169> you've<00:03:57.290> got<00:03:57.470> those<00:03:57.680> light<00:03:57.950> Tippit's<00:03:58.430> is

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
when you've got those light Tippit's is

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.690 
when you've got those light Tippit's is
that<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.150> drag<00:03:59.720> does<00:04:00.260> not<00:04:00.560> break<00:04:01.250> those

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
that this drag does not break those

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.229 
that this drag does not break those
Tippett's

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
Tippett's

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.009 
Tippett's
and<00:04:02.329> this<00:04:02.720> is<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:03.200> know<00:04:03.290> as<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.799> can<00:04:03.829> see<00:04:04.220> very

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
and this is you know as you can see very

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.460 
and this is you know as you can see very
low<00:04:06.019> startup<00:04:06.530> inertia<00:04:07.569> very<00:04:08.569> low<00:04:08.810> friction
