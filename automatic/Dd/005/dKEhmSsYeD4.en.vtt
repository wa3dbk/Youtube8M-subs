 Hello everyone, this is a review of 1000 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.090
 continue our origami heading today 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.520
 I'll show you how to make it easy quickly 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:19.529
 a steamer that can sail 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.830
 twin-tube twin-tube steamer for 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.510
 this we need a piece of paper 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 square initially find the center 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:33.600
 look until the end of the ends will be interesting 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.780
 And so I think someone has never seen such 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.890
 pass 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.890
 In order to find the center of both the Inguk corner 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.199
 all the center we found now these 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.199
 corners all four centered 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.240
 number and origami but others will 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.229
 review 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:31.890
 so that's what happened with us now 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:35.370
 turn over and now here these angles are 4 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.370
 also to the center 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:04.500
 write comments to me so now I 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:08.380
 what left us and turn over again and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.390
 once again all four corners to the center 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.390
 this is the last time 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.410
 Here is a blank from this side 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.410
 such is this side now 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.280
 turned and 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.180
 we need to make two pipes now 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.350
 in order to make two pipes we take 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:54.030
 some of the edges here and so and the top 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:58.170
 Raise and finger now 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.410
 the opposite side turns it 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.410
 in the same way 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.650
 this is not touching anything now 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.590
 interesting ship us almost 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.890
 the steamer is ready for these 2 little things 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:30.500
 neatly 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:34.750
 we pull in and here we go 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:41.439

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:43.879
