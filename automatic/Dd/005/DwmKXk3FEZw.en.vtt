00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.530
 a clip a little bit what the fuck who 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.390

 do not explode he shoots with his bullets 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.250
 and what happened was there was a 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.480

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.129
 Shields is dead then what 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.739

 past they shoot the gaffer the kiel 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.079
 bouncy look at the aerial view 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.400
