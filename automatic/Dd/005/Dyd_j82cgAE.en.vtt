is sheer force for bagon so that's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.100 
is sheer force for bagon so that's
pretty<00:01:12.510> interesting

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pretty interesting

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.690 
pretty interesting
so<00:01:13.500> let's<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:13.799> ahead<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.010> try<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> catch<00:01:14.460> this

gonna start throwing pokeballs here
because<00:02:07.240> I'm<00:02:07.360> afraid<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:08.020> if<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:09.600> weakened<00:02:10.600> it

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
because I'm afraid that if I weakened it

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.240 
because I'm afraid that if I weakened it
too<00:02:10.899> much<00:02:11.080> it'll<00:02:11.320> take<00:02:11.560> itself<00:02:11.860> out<00:02:11.980> on<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
too much it'll take itself out on a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.790 
too much it'll take itself out on a
double<00:02:12.370> edge<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:12.910> did<00:02:13.150> save<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.590> case
