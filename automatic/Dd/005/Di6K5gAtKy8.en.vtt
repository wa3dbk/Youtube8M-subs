play on the show at some point I'm just

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:49.999 
play on the show at some point I'm just
working<00:06:48.750> at<00:06:48.840> the<00:06:48.900> best<00:06:49.050> way<00:06:49.169> of<00:06:49.379> doing<00:06:49.440> it<00:06:49.889> I

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
working at the best way of doing it I

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.469 
working at the best way of doing it I
think<00:06:50.190> the<00:06:50.250> best<00:06:50.370> way<00:06:50.460> of<00:06:50.580> doing<00:06:50.699> it<00:06:50.969> might<00:06:51.360> be

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
think the best way of doing it might be

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.559 
think the best way of doing it might be
filming<00:06:52.409> us<00:06:52.560> while<00:06:52.860> playing<00:06:53.159> it<00:06:53.370> so<00:06:54.360> you<00:06:54.449> can
