see<00:03:52.300> how<00:03:52.360> far<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:52.630> can<00:03:52.660> get<00:03:52.930> into<00:03:53.080> this<00:03:53.230> cutscene

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
see how far I can get into this cutscene

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:18.689 
see how far I can get into this cutscene
hopefully<00:03:56.530> I'll<00:03:56.650> see<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:56.920> don't<00:03:57.190> think

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.400 

so<00:04:19.699> the<00:04:19.790> reason<00:04:19.910> I<00:04:20.090> did<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.449> sound<00:04:20.630> thing<00:04:21.229> that

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
so the reason I did the sound thing that

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.080 
so the reason I did the sound thing that
I've<00:04:21.500> explained<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.550> reason<00:04:22.610> I<00:04:22.910> did

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
I've explained that the reason I did

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.110 
I've explained that the reason I did
this<00:04:23.120> was<00:04:23.449> because<00:04:23.479> earlier<00:04:24.080> today<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.440> was

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
this was because earlier today I was

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.390 
this was because earlier today I was
just<00:04:26.120> thinking<00:04:26.600> about<00:04:26.660> how<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.949> used<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.220> watch

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
just thinking about how I used to watch

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.189 
just thinking about how I used to watch
videos<00:04:28.910> back<00:04:29.150> in<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.449> two<00:04:29.630> thousand<00:04:30.050> eight

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
videos back in like two thousand eight

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.469 
videos back in like two thousand eight
and<00:04:30.260> nine<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.800> people<00:04:31.160> attempting<00:04:31.790> this<00:04:31.940> and

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
and nine of people attempting this and

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.600 
and nine of people attempting this and
back<00:04:32.960> then<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:36.020> strats<00:04:36.320> weren't<00:04:36.590> as<00:04:36.710> fast<00:04:36.949> so

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
back then the strats weren't as fast so

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.420 
back then the strats weren't as fast so
i<00:04:37.639> can<00:04:38.030> get<00:04:38.180> way<00:04:39.050> further<00:04:39.350> into<00:04:39.860> this<00:04:40.010> cutscene

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
i can get way further into this cutscene

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.360 
i can get way further into this cutscene
then<00:04:40.699> they<00:04:41.030> cut<00:04:41.210> back<00:04:41.240> them<00:04:42.040> like<00:04:43.040> they

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
then they cut back them like they

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.530 
then they cut back them like they
couldn't<00:04:43.610> get<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:44.060> far<00:04:44.300> out<00:04:46.330> there<00:04:47.330> was<00:04:47.479> a

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
couldn't get this far out there was a

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.790 
couldn't get this far out there was a
different<00:04:47.840> way<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:47.990> escape<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.560> forest<00:04:48.950> and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
different way to escape the forest and

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.529 
I don't think I can do this much faster
than<00:05:32.770> out<00:05:35.430> at<00:05:36.430> least<00:05:36.639> not<00:05:36.789> fast<00:05:37.090> enough<00:05:37.210> to

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
than out at least not fast enough to

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.779 
than out at least not fast enough to
where<00:05:37.569> i<00:05:38.020> could<00:05:38.259> get<00:05:38.469> a<00:05:38.800> text<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.460> link<00:05:41.789> okay
