00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
see so we'll jump into it and let's do

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.130 

alright<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.609> I'm<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.240> map<00:02:06.420> called<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
alright so I'm here in a map called the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
alright so I'm here in a map called the
build<00:02:07.469> order<00:02:07.799> tester<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.459> actually<00:02:08.759> made

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
build order tester it was actually made

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
going to go through the build and I just

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.520 
going to go through the build and I just
want<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.790> definitely<00:02:18.269> be<00:02:18.480> watching<00:02:18.780> my

up really well like it basically as soon
as<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.319> get<00:02:28.379> enough<00:02:28.680> minerals<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.400> something

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
as I get enough minerals to do something

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.330 
as I get enough minerals to do something
I<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.420> make<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.110> while<00:02:31.530> still<00:02:31.799> continuing

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
I can make it and while still continuing

I can make it and while still continuing
my<00:02:32.489> constant<00:02:33.480> SCV<00:02:33.959> idea<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.310> let's<00:02:35.580> go<00:02:35.700> ahead

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
my constant SCV idea so let's go ahead

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.050 
my constant SCV idea so let's go ahead
and<00:02:35.849> start<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.950> building<00:02:37.950> my<00:02:38.069> first<00:02:38.430> SCV

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and start this and building my first SCV

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.539 
and start this and building my first SCV
and<00:02:39.349> what<00:02:40.349> I'm<00:02:40.440> doing<00:02:40.739> here<00:02:40.950> at<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> beginning

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
and what I'm doing here at the beginning

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.979 
and what I'm doing here at the beginning
this<00:02:41.730> isn't<00:02:42.060> hugely<00:02:42.299> important<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:42.900> I'm

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
this isn't hugely important but I'm

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.740 
this isn't hugely important but I'm
rallying<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.980> mineral<00:02:44.940> patch<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.329> hasn't

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
rallying to a mineral patch that hasn't

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.210 
rallying to a mineral patch that hasn't
been<00:02:45.810> mined<00:02:46.110> from<00:02:46.319> yet<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:49.220> only

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
been mined from yet just because only

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.460 
been mined from yet just because only
two<00:02:50.760> SUVs<00:02:51.239> can<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.569> mining<00:02:51.900> from<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.260> mineral

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
two SUVs can be mining from one mineral

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.559 
two SUVs can be mining from one mineral
patch<00:02:52.799> at<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.040> time<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.150> spread<00:02:54.420> them

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
patch at a time so if you spread them

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.690 
patch at a time so if you spread them
out<00:02:54.690> among<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.049> mineral<00:02:55.470> patches<00:02:55.890> manually

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
out among the mineral patches manually

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.580 
out among the mineral patches manually
rather<00:02:56.910> than<00:02:57.150> force<00:02:57.810> them<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.049> kind<00:02:58.470> of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
rather than force them to kind of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.250 
rather than force them to kind of
compete<00:02:58.890> for<00:02:59.099> minerals<00:02:59.540> it<00:03:00.540> helps<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:00.959> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
compete for minerals it helps you out a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.960 
compete for minerals it helps you out a
little<00:03:01.530> bit<00:03:01.739> by<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.069> little<00:03:02.400> bit<00:03:02.519> i<00:03:02.549> mean<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
really small amount but there's nothing

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.900 
really small amount but there's nothing
else<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.950> do<00:03:05.129> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> beginning<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.790> game

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.270 
I've still got enough money to be
continually<00:03:54.120> making<00:03:54.419> these<00:03:54.630> SUVs<00:03:55.099> looks<00:03:56.099> like

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
continually making these SUVs looks like

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.819 
continually making these SUVs looks like
now<00:03:56.459> oh<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:57.209> could<00:03:57.480> be<00:03:57.630> making<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.169> refinery

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
now oh I could be making a refinery

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.360 
now oh I could be making a refinery
right<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.549> still<00:04:00.030> continue<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.660> SUV

right now and still continue this SUV

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.979 
right now and still continue this SUV
constant<00:04:02.370> SUV<00:04:02.700> production<00:04:03.120> because<00:04:03.299> now<00:04:03.480> and

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
constant SUV production because now and

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.050 
constant SUV production because now and
fifty<00:04:04.590> minerals<00:04:04.950> I've<00:04:05.069> still<00:04:05.430> got<00:04:05.609> enough<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
fifty minerals I've still got enough to

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.900 
fifty minerals I've still got enough to
make<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.329> SUV<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.340> barracks<00:04:08.730> is

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
make that SUV so this barracks is

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.000 
make that SUV so this barracks is
finishing<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:10.079> barracks<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.590> required

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
finishing and a barracks is required

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.550 
finishing and a barracks is required
before<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.579> make<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.000> orbital<00:04:12.540> command<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.109> I

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
before you make a orbital command and I

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.020 
before you make a orbital command and I
would<00:04:13.739> almost<00:04:13.979> always<00:04:14.160> recommend<00:04:14.880> getting

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
would almost always recommend getting

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.920 
would almost always recommend getting
your<00:04:15.180> orbital

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
your orbital

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.590 
your orbital
as<00:04:16.019> fast<00:04:16.320> as<00:04:16.560> possible<00:04:16.699> because<00:04:17.699> it<00:04:18.150> just<00:04:18.359> pays

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
as fast as possible because it just pays

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.670 
as fast as possible because it just pays
for<00:04:18.810> itself<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.320> fast<00:04:19.560> when<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:21.410> gas<00:04:22.410> geyser

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
for itself so fast when this gas geyser

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.379 
for itself so fast when this gas geyser
comes<00:04:23.009> up<00:04:23.190> always<00:04:23.639> be<00:04:23.759> sure<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:24.060> put<00:04:24.240> those

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
comes up always be sure to put those

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.540 
comes up always be sure to put those
SUVs<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:25.560> there<00:04:25.680> as<00:04:25.740> soon<00:04:25.860> as<00:04:25.979> possible<00:04:26.400> and

perfectly and I'll instantly be able to
get<00:04:31.440> an<00:04:31.650> orbital<00:04:32.009> command<00:04:32.280> going<00:04:32.580> down<00:04:32.759> also

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
get an orbital command going down also

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.170 
get an orbital command going down also
