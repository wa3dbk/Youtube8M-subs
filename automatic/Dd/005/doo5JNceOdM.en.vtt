00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
there is a report about harmonization a

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.830 
there is a report about harmonization a
scientific<00:03:21.489> report<00:03:21.910> about<00:03:22.150> what<00:03:22.390> HAARP<00:03:22.660> is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
scientific report about what HAARP is

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.660 
scientific report about what HAARP is
and<00:03:23.170> what<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:23.440> was<00:03:23.680> designed<00:03:23.829> for<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.400> what<00:03:24.549> it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
and what it was designed for and what it

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.729 
and what it was designed for and what it
can<00:03:24.790> do<00:03:25.000> that's<00:03:25.660> brilliant<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.410> these<00:03:26.530> are

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
can do that's brilliant so these are

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.160 
can do that's brilliant so these are
really<00:03:26.890> good<00:03:27.220> basic<00:03:27.790> scientific<00:03:28.269> facts<00:03:28.930> we

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
really good basic scientific facts we

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.750 
really good basic scientific facts we
can<00:03:29.350> see<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.560> lot<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.010> stuff<00:03:30.070> banded

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
can see a lot of this stuff banded

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.960 
can see a lot of this stuff banded
across<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.269> internet<00:03:31.750> don't<00:03:31.989> we<00:03:32.200> write<00:03:32.650> and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
across the internet don't we write and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.410 
across the internet don't we write and
horror<00:03:33.970> stories<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.840> conjectures<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.420> you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
horror stories and conjectures and you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.479 
horror stories and conjectures and you
know<00:03:37.570> we<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:37.989> tell<00:03:38.230> this<00:03:38.380> is<00:03:38.590> truth<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.250> but

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
know we can tell this is truth in it but

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.100 
know we can tell this is truth in it but
this<00:03:39.700> is<00:03:39.880> really<00:03:40.060> good<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.660> some<00:03:40.900> solid

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
this is really good to have some solid

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110 
this is really good to have some solid
grounding<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:42.040> write<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.640> one<00:03:42.820> thing<00:03:42.970> my

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
grounding to write the one thing my

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.819 
grounding to write the one thing my
husband<00:03:43.450> does<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.870> mean<00:03:43.959> he's<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> consummate

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
husband does I mean he's a consummate

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.910 
husband does I mean he's a consummate
researcher<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.150> he<00:03:46.750> has<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> lot<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.290> help<00:03:47.680> and

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
researcher so he has a lot of help and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.920 
researcher so he has a lot of help and
he<00:03:48.519> knows<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.820> lot<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.209> stuff<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.720> he<00:03:49.810> was

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
he knows a lot of stuff and he was

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.780 
he knows a lot of stuff and he was
involved<00:03:50.140> with<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.380> lot<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.739> stuff<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.280> so

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
involved with a lot of this stuff and so

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.430 
involved with a lot of this stuff and so
he<00:03:51.910> backs<00:03:52.120> everything<00:03:52.600> up<00:03:52.750> with<00:03:52.930> history<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
he backs everything up with history and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.280 
he backs everything up with history and
science<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.340> lots<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.700> footnotes<00:03:55.209> so<00:03:56.140> it's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
science and lots of footnotes so it's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.890 
science and lots of footnotes so it's
