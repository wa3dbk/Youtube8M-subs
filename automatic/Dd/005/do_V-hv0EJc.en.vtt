00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.180
 how was this match in my opinion 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.820
 it was very very hard and without thinking 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.320
 a genius it was very hard i had alain 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.359
 very difficult garcia by also doing 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.720
 it's true that I believe that the public 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.660
 was happy today and you ben 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.010
 yes we are in France 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.230
 no I think that we could not 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.020
 maybe give as much of as many 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.090
 things like michael and julien but hey 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.210
 we did as we could the cedh shows 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.210
 with our tennis here are our talents 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.879
 michael and has in his genes him a 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.260
 comic talent so here we are not 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.579
 like that we try to do what we 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 can 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.460
 we also tried to make the public 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.579
 happy to come here and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.199
 and that's yes I think that 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.400
 audience saw beautiful tennis this is what 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.890
 we are able to 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.110
 of iron on the wta circuit it's true 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.540
 than at the warm level as said aravane 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.850
 we did what we could I think 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.920
 people had a good time with 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.450
 history with the left hand in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 we both decided to do it 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.060
 and then also beautiful points that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.040
 tonight at twenty two months with shots 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 tennis that we are used to 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.409
 do during our respective matches so 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.369
 we are very happy to have been able 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.289
 make a nice final 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.509
 today is that the public has 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.610
 feasted you guys put the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.100
 pressure a little bit before a little bit yes 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.560
 yes but hey that's saying we should have 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.180
 play before because I would not go that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.789
 looked ridiculous no but still 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.700
 here we felt to rise to the height 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.720
 boys and we did well 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.940
 to laugh is still the most 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.869
 important and I hope we will come back 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.490
 next year 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.869
 and frankly I think we have not 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.119
 was ridiculous at all because we had 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.909
 today makes a nice final 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.560
 the people had a lot of fun 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.440
 feast while in any case it was 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.430

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.350

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.660

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.040
 anyway we really feel that 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.800
 this year there was really a 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.990
 really nicer atmosphere yes so 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.090
 it is true that I was back I was 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.760
 came to two years with a ranking 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.709
 different and a different status but 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.600
 today I am really happy to 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.209
 to reach the final and to be able to 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.920
 to share at here monteyne it's with the 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.330
 public 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.209

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.060
 years good stuff there are players who 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.120
 play very well and have a beautiful 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.599
 tennis too and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.519

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.060
 deserves to have good players and 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.480

 thanks to the sponsors and the public this 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.030
 tournament there can happen and I hope 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.409
 that there will be so many passionate people 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.810
