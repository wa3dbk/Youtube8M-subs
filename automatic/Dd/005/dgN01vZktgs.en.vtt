one if it's already checked that means

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.969 
one if it's already checked that means
the<00:01:03.030> size<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> canvas<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.229> coordinated<00:01:04.890> to

when<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.369> drawing<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.939> some<00:01:27.060> reason<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
when you're drawing for some reason it's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.230 
when you're drawing for some reason it's
like<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.320> Jaggi<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.100> Ziggy<00:01:29.520> zaggy<00:01:30.030> and

like going all Jaggi and Ziggy zaggy and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
like going all Jaggi and Ziggy zaggy and
stuff<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> size<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.400> your

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
stuff it's because of the size of your

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
stuff it's because of the size of your
canvas<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.240> resolution<00:01:33.780> let<00:01:34.380> me<00:01:34.439> just

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
canvas and the resolution let me just

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.140 
canvas and the resolution let me just
quickly<00:01:34.799> add<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> sketcher

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
quickly add a sketcher

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.609 
quickly add a sketcher
let<00:01:36.659> me<00:01:36.720> demonstrate<00:01:36.810> by<00:01:37.200> sketching<00:01:37.409> an

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
let me demonstrate by sketching an

right so I'll even add some colors or

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.030 
right so I'll even add some colors or
why<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.659> add<00:02:03.780> color<00:02:04.079> all

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
why not because I like to add color all

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.430 
why not because I like to add color all
right<00:02:05.360> now<00:02:06.360> I'll<00:02:06.479> flatten<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
right now I'll flatten that so

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.940 
right now I'll flatten that so
if<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.250> look<00:02:09.550> here<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.120> I<00:02:10.210> buy<00:02:10.360> zoom<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.990> look

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
if you look here and I buy zoom in look

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.210 
if you look here and I buy zoom in look
how<00:02:12.180> blurry<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.680> pixelated<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.010> this

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
how blurry and pixelated that is this

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.910 
how blurry and pixelated that is this
you<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.300> me<00:02:16.480> zoom<00:02:16.900> into<00:02:17.110> my<00:02:17.320> work<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.710> really

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you see me zoom into my work and really

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.610 
you see me zoom into my work and really
work<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.400> my<00:02:18.580> line<00:02:18.820> art<00:02:19.060> right<00:02:19.270> well<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
work on my line art right well the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.840 
work on my line art right well the
reason<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:20.920> can't<00:02:21.100> do<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.520> cause<00:02:21.730> of

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
reason you can't do it here is cause of

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.880 
reason you can't do it here is cause of
the<00:02:21.940> canvas<00:02:22.180> size<00:02:22.510> too<00:02:22.840> small<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
the canvas size too small and the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.040 
the canvas size too small and the
resolution<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.400> very<00:02:24.610> low<00:02:24.820> okay<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.390> if<00:02:25.900> you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
resolution is very low okay so if you

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.230 
resolution is very low okay so if you
were<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.230> finish<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.470> piece<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:27.220> go<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.030> print

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
were to finish a piece and go and print

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.480 
were to finish a piece and go and print
it<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.600> cannot<00:02:28.930> really<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.650> much<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.160> so

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
it you cannot really do much with it so

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.840 
it you cannot really do much with it so
yeah<00:02:31.480> let's<00:02:31.960> fix<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.320> okay<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:32.860> go<00:02:33.700> up<00:02:33.730> to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
yeah let's fix that okay so go up to

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.290 
yeah let's fix that okay so go up to
edit<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:35.040> preferences<00:02:36.040> hit<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> canvas

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
edit and preferences hit the canvas

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.620 
edit and preferences hit the canvas
again<00:02:37.540> now<00:02:37.960> boost<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.790> 70<00:02:39.790> part<00:02:40.210> here<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
again now boost this 70 part here the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.350 
again now boost this 70 part here the
resolution<00:02:41.110> boost<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.710> baby<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.160> 300<00:02:42.670> boom

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
resolution boost that baby to 300 boom

if<00:03:29.050> i<00:03:29.140> zoom<00:03:29.170> out<00:03:29.650> watch<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.310> watch<00:03:30.760> this

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
if i zoom out watch this watch this

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.460 
if i zoom out watch this watch this
watch<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.510> took<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.870> look<00:03:32.110> at<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.320> look

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
watch just took it out look at that look

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.740 
watch just took it out look at that look
at<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.590> that's<00:03:33.310> how<00:03:33.520> big<00:03:33.910> this<00:03:34.090> canvas<00:03:34.480> is

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
at that that's how big this canvas is

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.610 
at that that's how big this canvas is
yeah<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.790> means<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.360> could<00:03:37.900> zoom<00:03:38.140> in<00:03:38.320> so

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
yeah so that means I could zoom in so

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.850 
yeah so that means I could zoom in so
far<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.310> start<00:03:40.000> working<00:03:40.209> on<00:03:40.420> my<00:03:40.600> line<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.080> OK

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
far and start working on my line on OK

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.030 
far and start working on my line on OK
the<00:03:42.750> previous<00:03:43.750> one<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:44.170> could<00:03:44.440> just<00:03:44.590> about<00:03:44.739> zoom

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
the previous one I could just about zoom

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.130 
the previous one I could just about zoom
in<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.340> see<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.760> thing<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.510> know<00:03:46.630> that's
