throughout<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:19.580> too<00:03:20.629> you<00:03:21.629> can<00:03:21.840> only<00:03:22.019> have

so<00:03:30.030> how<00:03:30.360> many<00:03:30.420> possible<00:03:31.290> electrons<00:03:32.069> does<00:03:32.430> us

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
so how many possible electrons does us

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:47.380 
so how many possible electrons does us
give<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.209> each<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.930> these<00:03:34.230> L<00:03:35.480> quantum<00:03:36.480> numbers

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
six possibilities one x 22 possibilities

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:13.850 
six possibilities one x 22 possibilities
so<00:04:03.710> the<00:04:04.710> total<00:04:05.070> number<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:10.370> electrons<00:04:12.560> with<00:04:13.560> N

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
so the total number of electrons with N

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:26.560 
so the total number of electrons with N
equals<00:04:14.670> 4<00:04:17.959> could<00:04:18.959> be<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:22.350> sum<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:23.070> all<00:04:23.280> these

but<00:04:59.640> this<00:04:59.850> is<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.330> possible<00:05:00.960> number<00:05:01.440> of

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
but this is the possible number of

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.510 
but this is the possible number of
electrons<00:05:02.550> with<00:05:03.210> principal<00:05:03.870> quantum<00:05:04.260> number

electrons with principal quantum number
for<00:05:05.930> this<00:05:06.930> problem<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.500> good<00:05:07.740> test<00:05:08.040> of

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
for this problem is a good test of

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.430 
for this problem is a good test of
whether<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.640> understand<00:05:09.330> as<00:05:09.750> we<00:05:10.169> said<00:05:10.410> right

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
whether you understand as we said right

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.430 
whether you understand as we said right
at<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.830> beginning<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:12.080> relationships<00:05:13.080> among

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
at the beginning the relationships among

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.730 
at the beginning the relationships among
the<00:05:14.220> different<00:05:14.400> quantum<00:05:15.120> numbers<00:05:15.540> and<00:05:15.780> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
the different quantum numbers and the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.090 
the different quantum numbers and the
meaning<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.850> poly<00:05:18.450> exclusion<00:05:19.100> principle

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
meaning of the poly exclusion principle

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.960 
meaning of the poly exclusion principle
which<00:05:20.610> is<00:05:20.880> no<00:05:21.750> two<00:05:21.810> electrons<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:23.250> any<00:05:23.580> one
