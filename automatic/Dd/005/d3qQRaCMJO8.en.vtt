00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.750
 hello nasser or we're here again 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.790
 in his day already explain how to see a 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.920
 movie through place one 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.309
 playstation 4 but it was a way a 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.900
 little provisional through the browser 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.730
 as you have already read in many places 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.400
 now place is already available for 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.050
 playstation 3 and playstation 4 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.330
 It has been a great as you will have read in 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.530
 many forums and in many plex sites 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.650
 now it's available for both 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.670
 playstation 3 as for playstation 4 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.100
 alexis a media center that lately 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.720
 is taking a lot of force then 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.579
 let's see how it is configured and how 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.620
 it works the first thing that I have to 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.420
 to clarify is that this system plays 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.590
 for playstation is only available to 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.080
 through flex pass 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.210
 although plex is free I should know 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 what place pass is for payment is a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.440
 monthly subscription that we will have to pay 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.360
 that will give us the right to several services 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.610
 that has flex pass that the normal place 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.110
 to understand we have not said this 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.030
 let's see how it is installed you are going to see 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.860
 that is very simple here is my 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.950
 playstation really good my 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.539
 son I never play and we go to the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.240
 television and video section 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.580
 we give it to you below and as we see here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.170
 we have flex as we see in the part of 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.610
 below play a little arrow towards 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.659
 down that means we can 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.179
 to download 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.179
 we access it and we give it to download 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.869
 flex and added to downloads and now it's 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.280
 is downloading something else that also 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.560
 you have to keep in mind is that flex 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.020
 you need a server consists of a 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.550
 server part and a client part 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.920
 all this explain it already in its day in 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.630
 two videotutoriales of nasser I'm going to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.229
 pause the recording and once you have 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.050
 finished 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.409
 we come back it's already installed we give it to 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.409
 Start 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.870
 is starting 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.579
 as I explained in his day at the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.470
 nasser tutorial we can activate it 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.939
 through a thing called a pin is 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.409
 very simple so we just have to go to 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:26.849
 our browser introduce this 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:29.700
 address http bar flex point tv bar 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.730
 ping we put this code that appears in 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.569
 screen and it will be added let's go to the computer 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.569
 and let's do it 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.620
 we are already in the computer we are going to a 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.069
 browser we open it and access to place 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.069
 TV 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.800
 finish 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.990
 we have to achieve with our 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.930
 user and our password 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.040
 we see it and now it asks for the code 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.170
 that appears on the screen of the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.170
 playstation 4 we put it 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.670
 and we connect 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.060
 as we see and appears here the series the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.940
 movies and home videos with videos 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.010
 would be the domestic videos here we see 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.060
 the two servers that I have I give you 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:26.940
 up the conap 269 l which is a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.700
 disgusting an intel processor and the kun up 412 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.680
 I forgot to say that newly moment 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.840
 released we do not have music or 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.700
 the photographs we can only see series 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.470
 and movies in later 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.540
 updates will incorporate the 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.040
 photographs and music for now only 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.189
 we have the video 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.349
 in series if I give a series we're going to 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.700
 give a series of any by 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:54.520
 example to home land this chapter 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.310
 we give x and here we see the 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.819
 movie data as we see is a 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.780
 movie that is at 720p with dolby 5.1 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.569
 Sound 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.569
 we give to play the buffer starts 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.790
 in previous episodes I'm in the 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.519
 airport is supervised in works and in 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.079
 this instant the additional quality is 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.079
 very good I give it back 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.350
 let's put a movie on high 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.350
 1080p definition 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.580
 here is gravity 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.150
 as we can see below gravity is a 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.120
 movie that is in 1080p and with sound 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.220
 dolby 5.1 let's see how the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.350
 reproduces if you have lag and if on the beach 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.350
 is able to do well we give to play 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.889
 here we have it 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.949
 download very fast I will give it to 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.949
 ahead 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.100
 and this one 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.700
 I take it off 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.360
 and now let's see one thing very 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.460
 important as we've already seen there are two 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.340
 requirements one have plex pas and other 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.300
 they have a flex server installed 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.160
 but let's see what the first 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.590
 version that they have taken out of place for 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.590
 playstation and let's see what happens if 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.320
 used an ace that has an arm11 processor 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.060
 an app 412 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.760
 just like before I have the series and 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.030
 the movies we go to series 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.250
 here I have the series and we will see how 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.140
 is not able to transcode that is 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.600
 in which used before has a 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.550
 intel processor for which he was capable 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.590
 of after encoding in real time and from 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.510
 send the format you need the 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.570
 playstation to play but with 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.280
 some with processor arm9 do because of 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.920
 moment this version of plexus does not support 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.990
 transcoding let's see it we give it 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.560
 a chapter any true detective 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.690
 we see that it is at 720p with 5.1 sound 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.340
 we give to play and you see tells us that 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.969
 there was a problem we give it again 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.909
 try traiguÃ©n 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:16.889
 and it remains the same there is no way it tells us that 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.889
 the server can not go back 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.650
 let's go to movies here are the 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.840
 films 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.449
 and I'm going to put a movie that is not in 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.780
 high definition for example is super 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.780
 vadis
