good nutrition and exercise wasn't as

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.709 
good nutrition and exercise wasn't as
important<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.649> got<00:00:34.860> older<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.520> body<00:00:36.239> started

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
important as I got older my body started

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
important as I got older my body started
slowing<00:00:37.200> down<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.950> started<00:00:38.190> slowing

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
slowing down and as it started slowing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.700 
slowing down and as it started slowing
down<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.670> had<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> work<00:00:39.149> harder<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.320> keep<00:00:40.500> my

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
down I had to work harder to keep my

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.979 
down I had to work harder to keep my
body<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.070> shape<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.180> theory<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.870> if

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
body in shape but the theory is is if

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
body in shape but the theory is is if
your<00:00:43.110> body<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.649> shape<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.040> brain<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.399> in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
your body is in shape your brain is in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
your body is in shape your brain is in
shape<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.940> you're<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.390> you've<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.780> good

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
shape if you're if you've got good

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.500 
shape if you're if you've got good
circulation<00:00:46.350> good<00:00:46.950> blood<00:00:47.219> flow<00:00:47.270> more<00:00:48.270> blood

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
circulation good blood flow more blood

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
circulation good blood flow more blood
more<00:00:48.870> oxygen<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> your

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
more oxygen is going to be going to your

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
more oxygen is going to be going to your
brain<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> keep<00:00:50.940> your

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
brain and that's going to keep your

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
brain and that's going to keep your
brain<00:00:51.300> more<00:00:51.539> alert<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> alive<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.739> that's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
brain more alert and alive and that's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
brain more alert and alive and that's
what<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> those<00:00:53.760> pills<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.360> gingko

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
what a lot of those pills do like gingko
