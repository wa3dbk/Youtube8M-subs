hello and welcome to gizmo guru this

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.610 
hello and welcome to gizmo guru this
week<00:00:08.460> we're<00:00:08.670> looking<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.150> HP<00:00:09.630> Slate<00:00:09.840> 21

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
week we're looking at the HP Slate 21

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.370 
week we're looking at the HP Slate 21
now<00:00:10.860> that's<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.790> 21<00:00:12.240> inch<00:00:12.269> android<00:00:12.929> tablet

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
now that's a 21 inch android tablet

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.740 
now that's a 21 inch android tablet
which<00:00:13.710> sounds<00:00:14.219> very<00:00:14.370> odd<00:00:14.610> but<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.389> actually

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
which sounds very odd but it's actually

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.900 
which sounds very odd but it's actually
pretty<00:00:15.900> smart<00:00:16.139> move<00:00:16.440> because<00:00:17.130> basically<00:00:17.550> what

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
pretty smart move because basically what

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.790 
pretty smart move because basically what
HP<00:00:18.119> Hermine<00:00:18.539> should<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.500> they've<00:00:19.770> put

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
HP Hermine should do is they've put

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.910 
HP Hermine should do is they've put
together<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.369> relatively<00:00:21.109> low<00:00:22.109> cost<00:00:22.410> computer

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
together a relatively low cost computer

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.060 
together a relatively low cost computer
with<00:00:23.189> relatively<00:00:24.150> low<00:00:24.840> hard<00:00:25.199> parts<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
with relatively low hard parts but it

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.470 
with relatively low hard parts but it
still<00:00:26.279> performs<00:00:26.609> smoothly<00:00:26.939> because<00:00:27.269> instead

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
still performs smoothly because instead

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.769 
still performs smoothly because instead
of<00:00:27.570> having<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.930> run<00:00:28.590> Windows<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.340> Android

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
of having to run Windows it's on Android

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.749 
of having to run Windows it's on Android
let<00:00:30.779> me<00:00:30.869> explain

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
let me explain

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.069 
let me explain
since<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.910> running<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.210> Android<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> OS

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
since it's running on Android the OS

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.200 
since it's running on Android the OS
isn't<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.590> taking<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.000> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
isn't really taking that much out of it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.470 
isn't really taking that much out of it
so<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.590> twenty<00:00:37.829> four<00:00:37.950> thousand<00:00:38.340> ninety<00:00:38.910> you

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
so for twenty four thousand ninety you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
so for twenty four thousand ninety you
get<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> computer<00:00:40.050> that's<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.710> smooth<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
get a computer that's pretty smooth and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.569 
get a computer that's pretty smooth and
the<00:00:42.149> 1.9<00:00:42.899> gigahertz<00:00:43.200> quad-core<00:00:43.710> CPU<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the 1.9 gigahertz quad-core CPU which is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.450 
the 1.9 gigahertz quad-core CPU which is
in<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.910> while<00:00:45.600> let's<00:00:45.870> barely<00:00:46.800> average<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.430> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
in this while let's barely average for a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.180 
in this while let's barely average for a
laptop<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> desktop<00:00:48.469> for<00:00:49.469> an<00:00:49.829> Android

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
laptop or a desktop for an Android

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.369 
laptop or a desktop for an Android
tablet<00:00:50.340> that's<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.030> good<00:00:51.239> now

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
tablet that's really good now

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.500 
tablet that's really good now
couple<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:52.980> 1gb<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> RAM<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> you've

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
couple that with 1gb of RAM and you've

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
couple that with 1gb of RAM and you've
got<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.020> nice<00:00:55.260> machine<00:00:55.579> which<00:00:56.579> doesn't

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
got a really nice machine which doesn't

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.869 
got a really nice machine which doesn't
cost<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.449> earth<00:00:57.629> plus<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.739> handy<00:00:59.670> enough

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
cost the earth plus it's handy enough

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.209 
cost the earth plus it's handy enough
for<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.629> tasks<00:01:01.050> which<00:01:01.230> most<00:01:01.949> people

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
for the kind of tasks which most people

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.340 
for the kind of tasks which most people
actually<00:01:02.370> use<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> computers<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.809> internet

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
actually use the computers for internet

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.749 
thing by the way comes with a keyboard
and<00:01:57.899> mouse<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.320> well<00:01:58.380> or<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.369> use<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and mouse as well or you can use the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.370 
and mouse as well or you can use the
touchscreen<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.600> admittedly

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
touchscreen which is admittedly

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.880 
touchscreen which is admittedly
convenient<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.969> downside<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.740> does

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
convenient the downside is that it does

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.639 
convenient the downside is that it does
not<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> battery<00:02:05.909> built<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.229> you're

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
not have a battery built in so you're

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
not have a battery built in so you're
going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.369> plug<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.700> into<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.479> power

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
going to have to plug it into the power

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
going to have to plug it into the power
at<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.229> points<00:02:10.790> also<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.150> unplug<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.660> from

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
at all points also if you unplug it from

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.850 
at all points also if you unplug it from
the<00:02:12.840> electricity<00:02:13.410> then<00:02:13.560> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the electricity then it

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.190 
the electricity then it
switch<00:02:14.250> off<00:02:14.430> right<00:02:14.610> away<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.210> can<00:02:15.960> be<00:02:16.170> a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
switch off right away that that can be a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.470 
switch off right away that that can be a
little<00:02:16.400> unusual<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.700> someone<00:02:17.850> who's<00:02:18.060> used<00:02:18.330> to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
little unusual for someone who's used to
