00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
okay now put the let's get close-up of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.690 
okay now put the let's get close-up of
this<00:00:08.820> corner<00:00:09.330> here<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:13.250> close<00:00:14.250> up<00:00:14.309> with<00:00:14.670> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
this corner here so close up with a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.189 
this corner here so close up with a
corner<00:00:15.150> there<00:00:15.710> and<00:00:16.850> there<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:20.000> there<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.539> all

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
corner there and there and there and all

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
corner there and there and there and all
four<00:00:22.560> corners<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:23.930> we

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
four corners you can see there all we

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.859 
four corners you can see there all we
want<00:00:25.170> check<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.680> square<00:00:26.449> there's<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.660> level

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
want check for square there's the level

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.630 
want check for square there's the level
you<00:00:28.140> see<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> torpedo<00:00:28.830> well<00:00:29.279> let's<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.580> if

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
you see the torpedo well let's see if

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.080 
you see the torpedo well let's see if
it's<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.980> it<00:00:31.980> happens<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.579> pretty<00:00:32.850> close

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it's on it happens to be pretty close

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.400 
it's on it happens to be pretty close
right<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.739> but<00:00:34.739> that's<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.460> side<00:00:39.410> one

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
right there but that's one side one

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
right there but that's one side one
thing<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> check<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.820> square

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
thing we have to do is check for square

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.060 
thing we have to do is check for square
and<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:45.710> measure<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.010> distance

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and to do that you measure this distance

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.970 
and to do that you measure this distance
we<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.940> 37<00:00:48.809> inches<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:55.379> measure<00:00:55.649> this

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
we have 37 inches and you measure this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.299 
we have 37 inches and you measure this
way

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.670 

36<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.460> 5/8<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.739> little<00:01:01.739> bit<00:01:02.719> off<00:01:03.719> square<00:01:04.320> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
36 and 5/8 so a little bit off square so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.499 
36 and 5/8 so a little bit off square so
we<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.040> correct<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.640> by<00:01:10.909> check<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> again

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.620 

here<00:01:15.509> six<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> five<00:01:16.140> eighths<00:01:17.299> all<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.420> went

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
here six and five eighths all right went

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.410 
here six and five eighths all right went
too<00:01:18.810> far<00:01:19.049> our<00:01:19.229> guests

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.040 

thirty<00:01:23.930> six<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.650> seven-eighths<00:01:26.560> about

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
thirty six and seven-eighths about

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.550 
thirty six and seven-eighths about
almost<00:01:30.050> there

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
almost there

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.320 
almost there
I<00:01:30.940> brought<00:01:31.940> some<00:01:32.210> shims<00:01:33.100> these<00:01:34.100> are<00:01:34.369> four<00:01:34.670> and

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
I brought some shims these are four and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.980 
I brought some shims these are four and
this<00:01:36.290> this<00:01:36.619> piece<00:01:36.920> here<00:01:37.300> these<00:01:38.300> are<00:01:38.540> all<00:01:38.690> for

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
this this piece here these are all for

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.940 
this this piece here these are all for
propping<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.590> up<00:01:39.740> as<00:01:40.690> needed<00:01:41.690> for<00:01:42.259> getting<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
propping it up as needed for getting the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.440 
propping it up as needed for getting the
level<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.420> let's<00:01:44.450> do<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.990> right<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:46.479> and

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
level so let's do that right now and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.440 
level so let's do that right now and
that<00:01:50.450> weighs<00:01:50.690> pretty<00:01:51.110> close<00:01:52.150> one<00:01:53.150> on<00:01:53.300> that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
that weighs pretty close one on that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.100 
that weighs pretty close one on that
side<00:01:53.509> well<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:56.770> don't<00:01:57.770> want<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.920> take<00:01:58.100> much

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
side well I don't want to take much

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.510 
side well I don't want to take much
anyway

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:18.110 

maybe<00:02:08.520> even<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.910> stick<00:02:09.180> like<00:02:09.240> this<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:17.120> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
maybe even a stick like this one and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:28.610 
maybe even a stick like this one and
there<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.200> level<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.860> way

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.449 

come<00:02:29.220> up<00:02:29.400> from<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> back<00:02:30.409> so<00:02:31.409> we'll<00:02:31.560> put<00:02:32.430> a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
come up from the back so we'll put a

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:54.760 
come up from the back so we'll put a
piece<00:02:32.700> under<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> back<00:02:33.360> here

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:12.820 

yep<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:56.360> don't<00:02:56.510> need<00:02:56.720> much<00:02:57.490> almost<00:02:58.490> level<00:02:58.760> here

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.800 

good

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.699 

it's<00:03:17.110> good<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.620> way<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.810> check<00:03:20.200> all<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.620> way

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
it's good that way you check all the way

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.640 
it's good that way you check all the way
around<00:03:22.230> good<00:03:23.230> idea

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.680 

using<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> piece<00:03:27.550> of<00:03:27.730> particle<00:03:28.540> board<00:03:28.750> here

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
using a piece of particle board here

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.960 
using a piece of particle board here
okay<00:03:31.050> that's<00:03:31.260> pretty<00:03:31.500> good<00:03:31.710> not<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.580> levels

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
okay that's pretty good not the levels

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.110 
okay that's pretty good not the levels
not<00:03:33.090> particularly<00:03:34.280> critical<00:03:35.280> at<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:35.760> point

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
not particularly critical at this point

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.780 
not particularly critical at this point
but<00:03:36.300> once<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.690> once<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.230> get<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.220> organ<00:03:38.610> all

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
but once you once you get the organ all

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.910 
but once you once you get the organ all
placed<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:40.400> that's<00:03:41.400> when<00:03:41.640> it's<00:03:41.790> critical

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
placed and that's when it's critical

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.630 
placed and that's when it's critical
next<00:03:43.920> thing<00:03:45.350> what<00:03:46.350> jb<00:03:46.740> weld<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.220> corners

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.340 

and<00:03:52.880> we're<00:03:53.880> going<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.060> glue<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.540> JB<00:03:54.990> well

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.270 

fairly<00:03:58.350> consistent<00:03:59.070> almost<00:03:59.460> touching<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.210> the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
fairly consistent almost touching on the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.530 
fairly consistent almost touching on the
top<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.550> apex<00:04:03.030> poles<00:04:03.450> there<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:09.270> reason

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
top of the apex poles there the reason

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.890 
top of the apex poles there the reason
why<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.690> put<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.050> bevel<00:04:10.440> in<00:04:11.090> on<00:04:12.090> all<00:04:12.330> these<00:04:12.570> is

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
why I put the bevel in on all these is

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.470 
why I put the bevel in on all these is
because<00:04:13.290> we're<00:04:13.710> going<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.890> have<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.480> fully

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
because we're going to have a fully

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.510 
because we're going to have a fully
orgone<00:04:16.250> corner<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.430> each<00:04:17.489> corner<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:23.130> point

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
orgone corner on each corner this point

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.040 
orgone corner on each corner this point
right<00:04:24.060> here<00:04:25.160> even<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.310> little<00:04:26.490> bit<00:04:26.820> that

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
right here even that little bit that

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.770 
right here even that little bit that
sort<00:04:28.050> little<00:04:28.230> energy<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:30.360> going<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.630> make<00:04:30.750> a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
sort little energy is going to make a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.220 
sort little energy is going to make a
big<00:04:31.050> difference<00:04:31.230> being<00:04:31.830> orgone<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.840> that's

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230
