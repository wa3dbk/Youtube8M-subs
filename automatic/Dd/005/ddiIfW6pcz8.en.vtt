00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:17.359
 Eros wants to go second here and today with the promised ultimate 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:25.279
 night studio of mine and it is about 2 4 1 below the process seer 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.219
 hotly anticipated game for the listener best mood we have 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.420
 around 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 Schirmer, for a short time, I'm probably outrageous, I'm not a humane person 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.830
 Controllers and Controllers 2 0 2 -done 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.370
 to have 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.950
 Dr I do of course with 2 0 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.050
 Euro then that's the great menu 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.960
 LÃ¼nen, how does my figure look on the side of what he had set 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.350
 I'll show you what you can do in this figure 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.260
 we have here 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.660
 few shoes are digital Porth ultimately 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.020
 Pants that do not look really good 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.240
 since the gloves are already better our confidence Robert Eile dpa 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.880
 are 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.210
 Years the hairstyle the hair color can change the face the partners have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.150
 the architect must design 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.370
 Japan come for the first negative you can believe 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.159
 Do not Just Guarantee Percent Percent Make This Face As You Want It 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.420
 but a face always belongs to a certain body of the West 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.240
 Weather different partly better faces than lower bung 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730
 They have 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.950
 really shit 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.380
 the next one here you can become your intro cars and provocations 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.970
 also not exactly what it costs you can go there 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.190
 unlock a lot over time though 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.180
 year 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.030
 it is not possible that brought 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.260
 Percent positive what you can say to the game is the graphics 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
 But being completely safe is good 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.980
 there 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.029
 critical of me then but a small price jump 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.909
 that the video card is now has 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.109
 Dr four times 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.299
 Fitness ranks of you can see how many calories in the percent 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.230
 last session is dismantled and so on and so forth 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.510
 very few you can improve in our tribute 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.259
 Pastor in different ways 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:32.009
 yes also at events shows you the good Danny Trejo yes I will 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.009
 a few people 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.539
 70 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.899
 but now fished 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.669
 can 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.879
 unfortunately he was a bit quiet the guy did not have to go to her account 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.069
 understand 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.629
 Danny Trejo needs to sync well right by shit 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.219
 I really say 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.239
 Probably percent will not be right now but I have a fight show 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.930
 but a fight I took here you can me 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.859
 or repetition 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.039
 we save 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:05.200
 which also influence the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.820
 just so we have a few things under slides of the topics 12 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:10.529
 Yes 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.529
 then I'll see you in gameplay right now 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.429
 that is really bad a lot 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:23.179
 defensiveness 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.049
 only you have the defensive attitude so before 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.049
 With their hands in front of their faces, the team sees nothing 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.839
 which is very unrealistic because no boxer behaves so high 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.119
 then yes 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.029
 You see how my figure moves around 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.810
 the slag of course as wild as possible on him for the Cape Verdean 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.210
 normally 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.210
 but we have 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:50.700
 I'll tell you how to win Whistler 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.599
 if you look at it 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.219
 he strikes 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.590
 like if he has weighted data on the hands 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.029
 and St closures is 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.029
 with small fine grabs give 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.059
 So to beat up from the controller 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.579
 or in the stomach at all hitting underworld we will soon see or have you 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.869
 maybe already noticed that the movements extremely obstructed the view 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.550
 always a bit energetic 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.779
 Press the safe not exactly 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.299
 that he is fully out 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.620
 here, less of course, a nice success has that looks great 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.620
 they have the same thing here 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.279
 Watzke in laughter 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.630
 And of course, a real winner looks like the joy 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.099
 his face is not happy about this victory that he won 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 from which I too come to prevent 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.059
 Way great landmark I quiet right back government second 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.059
 has sealed 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.919
 RWE is also happy to see how great the village looks like 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.919
 Percent less to sleep 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.940
 Waltz percent try because he protected his face the whole time and into 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.289
 to beat the stomach 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.770
 but you see 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.610
 from 1 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.800
 Euro 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.309
 this one had in the lot 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:28.740
 that is growing 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.020
 finally say 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.500
 you have liked it too we are with the ball so in any case if 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.949
 you become obsolete in a brawl so definitely 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.139
 so they wanted to fight to be as funny as possible 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.520
 dropbox 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.479
 turns to help you a lot 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.419
 since I also Leszek Krowicki a robot 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.360
 that looks 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.689
 Of course we can not go in front of our fleet 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:54.770
 and that is not percent but 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.400
 ARD profits for the title fights 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 Also we certainly glad member in the posture dropped 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.619
 extreme 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.449
 unrealistic 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.449
 it was so hotly anticipated game everyone has Weidenfeller the museums as 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:12.139
 thought 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.180
 Rottweil 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.229
 it became feelings that she was the officer for 10 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.870
 Natalie Portman 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.499
 approving percent 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:22.509
 Wojtyla moderately beat someone with his elbow 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:24.969
 Tanks more 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.050
 in the end, all that polluted soil is for at least two buttons 

00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:31.289
 have to hold and then 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.490
 For example, we move forward with our arms and we do this 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.630
 the bunk can not just left left right left and Porsche 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.309
 Elbow and head and foot nothing 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:42.719
 nothing works anymore 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.289
 and here, of course, the seal face her friend Yves 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.849
 I cried 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.189
 see here 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.050
 so I definitely can not miss the game any further back percent 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.409
 It was actually the reason why I can get on with a word 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:01.099
 have 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.569
 while the duo cut the game is cool because I myself a big Annemarie 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.339
 open around Easter 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:08.849
 yes more and then 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.379
 to get something presented here so Wrede 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.289
 So there they could still have left themselves time since percent 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:19.149
 for the development of the player further 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.669
 if I'm sorry the couple does not do any of this 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:29.180
 So from my side are definitely not a buy recommendation 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.270
 I have to say that I am very disappointed with the experience 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.610
 not that put on the ground so something is really promised 

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:42.029
 a great pity 

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:44.469
 what can you say 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:48.689
 yes of course you percent like to sign a commentator what you 

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:52.669
 from the game you might have that and you have a different opinion 

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:55.360
 maybe you are totally excited again 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.899
 Aaron 

00:07:56.899 --> 00:08:00.719
 instead of just plain income, tell me what he think of Stockton's what she said 

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:04.039
 of course I'm happy if you keep your fingers crossed 

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:08.279
 set high if similar though he does and yes then I say until next time 

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:08.539
 looks
