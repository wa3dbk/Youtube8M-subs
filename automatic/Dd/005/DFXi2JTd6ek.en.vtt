00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.440
 this video aims to show 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.720
 the final presentation of the project 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 organic chemistry 2 of the second cycle of 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.269
 2013 year of the University of the Valley of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.730
 Guatemala 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.099
 then the synthesis will be shown 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.379
 of monosodium glutamate performed by 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.050
 josé fuentes and marilis españa el 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.999
 monosodium glutamate abbreviated msg by 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 its acronym in English is the adjective more 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.919
 used to season and enhance the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 flavor of the meals this sauce here 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.149
 it is derived from the non-essential amino acid 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.279
 glutamic acid which is a component 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.660
 structural of proteins and so 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.120
 so much of it is in 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.880
 natural form in all living beings and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 in almost all foods is like 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.230
 they found food like chickens 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.720
 sausages dressings ranch soy sauce and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.490
 especially in processed foods and 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.170
 fast food restaurants 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.880
 have this molecule industrially 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.470
 the fermentation of the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.810
 Korean bacterium bacteria a glutamic 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.700
 of residual sugars from industry 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.740
 agrifood 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.940
 summarizing a bit of history the 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.190
 German scientist 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.730
 carol reed hasting discovered for the first 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.380
 glutamic acid in 1866 to the 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.200
 carry out studies on the protein of 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.330
 wheat however at that time you are not 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.570
 related as the person responsible for the taste 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.310
 umami until 1912 when the doctor kiko 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.890
 nike was a professor at the university 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.270
 Imperial of Tokyo identified the acid 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.880
 glutamic acid as one of the elements 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.350
 fundamental responsible for the taste 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.659
 human 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.750
 the word uma mix is ​​derived from Japanese 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.159
 whose meaning of pleasant taste this 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.409
 name was established by the doctor and 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.110
 that merged the terms a mike that is 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.970
 delicious and neither that is taste very few 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.280
 people know that this is one of the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.220
 five essential favors along with the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.930
 sweet salty sour and bitter 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.030
 The doctor's investigations were 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.070
 also the first ones that showed that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.170
 the same taste could be obtained by 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.810
 the extraction of glutamic acid from the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 animal or vegetable protein hydrolyzed and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.670
 neutralized with a dica sauce 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.190
 Panela was used as materials 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.530
 yeast urea lime and wheat flour 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.110
 the reagents used were acid 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.110
 hydrochloric sodium hydroxide and ice 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.920
 the first step before performing the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.050
 synthesis is the fermentation of the flour 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.430
 of wheat for a week to obtain 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.799
 glutamine 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 after fermenting the product is filtered 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.269
 desired and the flour is discarded 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.819
 finish filtering this is 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.730
 acidifies to pass acid glutamine 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.620
 glutamic then neutralizes with excess 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.950
 of sodium hydroxide to pass from 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.480
 glutamic acid to monosodium glutamate 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.189
 It is important to mention that at the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.439
 industrial a purification is performed 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.970
 in which the strong smell is eliminated and 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.830
 characteristic color of this molecule 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.180
 analysis to check the result is 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.240
 could do by means of chromatography 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.280
 of gases tlc mass chromatography and 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.380
 melting point however the 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.910
 thin layer chromatography because 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.010
 you wanted to compare the sample with 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.600
 pure crystals the other methods 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.890
 they had problems that did not 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.170
 they took into account when making the 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.850
 procedure for example debating 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.080
 the sample for mass analysis 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.820
 the methods that are found 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.070
 available to synthesize glutamate 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.630
 monosodium are made by means of the 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.490
 fermentation of choline bacteria 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.770
 bacteria a glutamic obtained from 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.480
 sugars however in this project it 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.220
 did differently with the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.960
 fermentation of wheat flour and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.410
 then with nine organic syntheses 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.240
 we tried to get to the product 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.430
 the yield of obtained was very low 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.530
 but this was because we worked with 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.510
 very small quantities and during the 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.340
 synthesis was divided into two parts for 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.870
 try different routes 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.580
 in this procedure they were given 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.950
 different methods and they were used 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.180
 different articles as a reference and 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.040
 that an article was not found 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.330
 specific that the method followed 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.330
 raised in this project
