center of the skein of yarn and you want

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.910 
center of the skein of yarn and you want
to<00:00:35.520> find<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> inside<00:00:36.690> through<00:00:37.620> here

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to find the inside through here

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.830 
to find the inside through here
sometimes<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.700> kind<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> messy<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
sometimes it's kind of messy but you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380 
sometimes it's kind of messy but you
it's<00:00:40.320> best<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> work<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> inside<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it's best to work from the inside and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.049 
it's best to work from the inside and
then<00:00:43.110> it'll<00:00:43.290> come<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.940> it's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
then it'll come out like this and it's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.540 
then it'll come out like this and it's
kind<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.660> wadded<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.430> if

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
kind of like wadded up like this but if

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
kind of like wadded up like this but if
you<00:00:47.670> open<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.360> you'll<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.200> there's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you open it up you'll see that there's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.950 
you open it up you'll see that there's
kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.100> band<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.210> side<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.870> then

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
kind of like a band on one side and then

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
kind of like a band on one side and then
these<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.940> loose<00:00:54.140> like<00:00:55.140> fine<00:00:55.620> boxes<00:00:56.309> on

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
these little loose like fine boxes on

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
these little loose like fine boxes on
the<00:00:56.610> top<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.120> that's<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> edge<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> want

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the top so that's the edge that you want

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.310 
the top so that's the edge that you want
to<00:00:58.800> work<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> find<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> first

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
to work on there so you find the first

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.770 
to work on there so you find the first
three<00:01:01.500> boxes<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> fold<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.239> over<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
three boxes and you fold it over the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.010 
three boxes and you fold it over the
next<00:01:04.350> three<00:01:04.650> boxes<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.580> then<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.750> take<00:01:06.990> your

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
next three boxes and then you take your

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
next three boxes and then you take your
crochet<00:01:07.320> hook<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> insert<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
crochet hook and you insert it in the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.530 
crochet hook and you insert it in the
first<00:01:09.750> set<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> boxes<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> line<00:01:12.510> up

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
first set of boxes and then you line up

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
first set of boxes and then you line up
the<00:01:12.780> next<00:01:13.290> set<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.860> assert<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.610> front<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the next set and assert from front to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.800 
the next set and assert from front to
back<00:01:15.119> through<00:01:15.630> there<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.439> then<00:01:17.450> through<00:01:18.450> here

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
back through there and then through here

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.490 
back through there and then through here
so<00:01:19.439> I've<00:01:19.530> got<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.860> three<00:01:19.890> boxes<00:01:20.990> for<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.110> start

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
so I've got my three boxes for my start

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.100 
so I've got my three boxes for my start
you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.060> scissors<00:01:24.600> very

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you can go in there with scissors very

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
you can go in there with scissors very
carefully<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> cut<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.369> edge<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.180> not

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
carefully and cut that edge so it's not

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.890 
carefully and cut that edge so it's not
so<00:01:27.810> jagged<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
so jagged like that so now this is a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 
so jagged like that so now this is a
series<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> nine<00:01:32.549> loops<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.270> going

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
series of nine loops that you're going

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170 
series of nine loops that you're going
to<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.540> picking<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> skip<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to be picking up so you skip one and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
to be picking up so you skip one and
then<00:01:36.329> pick<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> other<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.490> first

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
then pick up the other one so the first

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.370 
then pick up the other one so the first
three<00:01:39.060> boxes<00:01:39.750> that'll<00:01:40.740> count<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:43.700> my<00:01:44.700> first

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
three boxes that'll count as my first

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.840 
three boxes that'll count as my first
three<00:01:46.380> loops<00:01:47.329> so<00:01:48.329> there's<00:01:48.600> four<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.610> then

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
three loops so there's four and then

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.929 
three loops so there's four and then
five<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.729> six<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.390> seven<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:57.079> eight<00:01:58.939> I'm

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
five and six and seven and eight I'm

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
five and six and seven and eight I'm
skipping<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.719> box<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.969> there's<00:02:02.969> nine<00:02:03.439> okay

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
skipping a box and there's nine okay

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.520 
skipping a box and there's nine okay
once<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.920> picked<00:02:05.189> up<00:02:05.369> nine<00:02:05.729> new<00:02:06.719> loops<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.469> my

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
once I picked up nine new loops on my

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.490 
once I picked up nine new loops on my
hook<00:02:07.910> I'm<00:02:08.910> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.330> leave<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.899> very<00:02:10.080> last

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
hook I'm going to leave the very last

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.309 
hook I'm going to leave the very last
loop<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.250> hook<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.390> using<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.900> dream

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
loop on my hook I like using the dream

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.989 
loop on my hook I like using the dream
hook<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.859> it<00:02:14.040> doesn't<00:02:14.370> really<00:02:14.489> matter<00:02:14.700> what

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:14.999 
hook and it doesn't really matter what

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.929 
hook and it doesn't really matter what
size<00:02:15.329> you<00:02:15.629> use<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> J<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.370> wouldn't<00:02:17.849> go

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
size you use this is a J I wouldn't go

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.479 
size you use this is a J I wouldn't go
any<00:02:18.090> bigger<00:02:18.329> than<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:19.280> actually<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
any bigger than that and actually a

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.580 
any bigger than that and actually a
little<00:02:20.700> bit<00:02:20.879> smaller<00:02:21.209> works<00:02:21.629> good<00:02:21.989> too

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
little bit smaller works good too

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.580 
little bit smaller works good too
like<00:02:22.739> maybe<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.159> a<00:02:23.430> or<00:02:23.459> F<00:02:23.909> or<00:02:24.329> G<00:02:24.930> any<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.469> those

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
like maybe a a or F or G any of those

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.190 
like maybe a a or F or G any of those
sizes<00:02:25.859> would<00:02:26.219> be<00:02:26.310> great<00:02:26.549> so<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.269> like<00:02:27.719> this<00:02:27.959> hook

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
sizes would be great so I like this hook

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.140 
sizes would be great so I like this hook
because<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.920> cut<00:02:29.159> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.579> head<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:29.969> hook

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
because the cut in the head of the hook

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.990 
because the cut in the head of the hook
is<00:02:30.359> really<00:02:30.659> deep<00:02:31.019> see<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.889> there<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:32.969> I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
is really deep see that there so when I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
is really deep see that there so when I
push<00:02:33.389> the<00:02:33.750> last<00:02:33.959> loop<00:02:34.349> down<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.889> there<00:02:35.099> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
push the last loop down in there it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.399 
push the last loop down in there it
stays<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:35.879> good<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.930> want<00:02:37.079> to<00:02:37.139> push

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
stays in there good so you want to push

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.379 
stays in there good so you want to push
that<00:02:37.680> last<00:02:37.920> loop<00:02:38.219> into<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.819> head<00:02:38.969> of<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.209> hook

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
that last loop into the head of the hook

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.020 
that last loop into the head of the hook
and<00:02:39.659> insert<00:02:40.169> your<00:02:40.469> finger<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.549> your

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
and insert your finger here and your

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.360 
and insert your finger here and your
thumb<00:02:42.359> on<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.749> side<00:02:43.109> then<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.739> turn<00:02:44.159> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
thumb on this side then you turn the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.459 
thumb on this side then you turn the
head<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.639> your<00:02:44.790> hook<00:02:44.999> down<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.200> bring

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
head of your hook down and you bring

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.890 
head of your hook down and you bring
that<00:02:46.709> last<00:02:47.010> loop<00:02:47.370> through<00:02:47.730> all<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.540> remaining

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that last loop through all the remaining

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.509 
that last loop through all the remaining
loops<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:49.500> your<00:02:49.530> hook<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:51.230> and

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
loops on your hook like that and

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.250 
loops on your hook like that and
especially<00:02:53.519> if<00:02:54.060> you're<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> beginner<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:54.989> think

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
especially if you're a beginner I think

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.800 
especially if you're a beginner I think
you<00:02:55.409> should<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.799> two<00:02:56.189> stitch<00:02:56.730> markers<00:02:57.269> handy

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
you should have two stitch markers handy

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.390 
you should have two stitch markers handy
and<00:02:58.049> I'm<00:02:58.590> going<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.829> put<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> stitch<00:02:59.370> marker

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and I'm going to put a stitch marker

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.159 
and I'm going to put a stitch marker
right<00:03:00.090> here<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:02.419> then<00:03:03.419> I'm<00:03:03.689> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:04.019> my

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
right here and then I'm going to do my

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.770 
right here and then I'm going to do my
next<00:03:04.469> set<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.799> 9<00:03:06.409> so<00:03:07.409> I'm<00:03:07.500> going<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.680> skip<00:03:08.069> one

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
next set of 9 so I'm going to skip one

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.909 
next set of 9 so I'm going to skip one
insert<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.989> hook<00:03:10.019> from<00:03:10.409> front<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.799> back

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
insert my hook from front to back

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.589 
insert my hook from front to back
through<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> next<00:03:11.669> one<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.989> there's<00:03:13.230> two

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
through the next one and there's two

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:23.899 
through the next one and there's two
there's<00:03:15.599> three<00:03:19.159> and<00:03:20.159> there's<00:03:20.609> four<00:03:22.909> and

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
there's three and there's four and

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:35.050 
there's three and there's four and
there's<00:03:24.150> five<00:03:24.599> there's<00:03:28.459> six

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.150 

okay<00:03:36.020> so<00:03:36.380> when<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:36.620> get<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.800> a<00:03:36.980> hole<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.640> this

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
okay so when you get to a hole like this

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.770 
okay so when you get to a hole like this
basically<00:03:40.160> what<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.459> want<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.760> do<00:03:40.940> is<00:03:41.300> just

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
basically what you want to do is just

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.170 
basically what you want to do is just
ignore<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.560> because<00:03:43.069> this<00:03:43.580> isn't<00:03:43.850> going<00:03:44.030> to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
ignore it because this isn't going to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.480 
ignore it because this isn't going to
show<00:03:44.240> it's<00:03:45.140> not<00:03:45.350> going<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.560> come<00:03:45.800> out<00:03:45.950> anymore

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
show it's not going to come out anymore

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.880 
show it's not going to come out anymore
so<00:03:47.150> I'm<00:03:47.240> just<00:03:47.390> going<00:03:47.569> to<00:03:47.630> skip<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.440> section

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
so I'm just going to skip that section

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.270 
so I'm just going to skip that section
and<00:03:49.459> I'm<00:03:49.550> just<00:03:49.790> going<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.060> keep<00:03:50.270> going<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:52.190> I

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
and I'm just going to keep going so I

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.820 
and I'm just going to keep going so I
think<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:53.000> was<00:03:53.300> now<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:53.780> need<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.050> count<00:03:54.230> that

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
think that was now I need to count that

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.390 
think that was now I need to count that
was<00:03:55.010> seven<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.880> there's<00:03:59.090> eight<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:01.190> there's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
was seven and there's eight and there's

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.020 
was seven and there's eight and there's
nine

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
nine

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.500 
nine
okay<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:02.810> last<00:04:03.200> loop<00:04:03.620> here<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.310> then<00:04:05.150> pull

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
okay so last loop here and then pull

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.930 
okay so last loop here and then pull
these<00:04:05.870> through<00:04:06.560> all<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:07.100> remaining<00:04:07.430> loops<00:04:07.730> on

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
these through all the remaining loops on

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.500 
these through all the remaining loops on
my<00:04:07.970> hook

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
my hook

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.630 
my hook
then<00:04:09.019> I<00:04:09.110> place<00:04:09.380> another<00:04:09.709> stitch<00:04:10.070> marker<00:04:10.459> right

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
then I place another stitch marker right

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.420 
then I place another stitch marker right
here<00:04:10.670> now<00:04:11.510> one<00:04:11.750> skein<00:04:12.110> of<00:04:12.140> yarn<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.769> plenty<00:04:13.220> to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
here now one skein of yarn is plenty to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.550 
here now one skein of yarn is plenty to
make<00:04:13.700> one<00:04:13.940> scarf<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.980> could<00:04:16.370> do<00:04:17.209> less<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:18.380> pick

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
make one scarf you could do less to pick

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.250 
make one scarf you could do less to pick
up<00:04:18.680> less<00:04:18.919> loops<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.700> I've<00:04:20.090> seen<00:04:20.390> scarfs<00:04:21.019> done

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
up less loops and I've seen scarfs done

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.440 
up less loops and I've seen scarfs done
with<00:04:21.470> just<00:04:21.739> five<00:04:22.100> or<00:04:22.520> four<00:04:22.790> loops<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.360> they

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
with just five or four loops and they

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.780 
with just five or four loops and they
look<00:04:23.630> really<00:04:23.990> really<00:04:24.230> pretty

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
look really really pretty

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.670 
look really really pretty
or<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:26.120> could<00:04:26.270> pick<00:04:26.419> up<00:04:26.570> more<00:04:26.870> loops<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.500> get

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
or you could pick up more loops and get

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.950 
or you could pick up more loops and get
it<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:28.040> be<00:04:28.220> fuller

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
it to be fuller

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.719 
it to be fuller
but<00:04:29.960> keep<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.500> mind<00:04:30.530> that<00:04:30.950> if<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.220> do<00:04:31.460> more

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
but keep in mind that if you do more

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.219 
but keep in mind that if you do more
loops<00:04:32.030> you're<00:04:32.270> going<00:04:32.390> to<00:04:32.450> have<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> shorter

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
loops you're going to have a shorter

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.270 
loops you're going to have a shorter
scarf<00:04:34.300> so<00:04:35.300> here<00:04:35.750> is<00:04:36.110> I'm<00:04:36.710> going<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.919> skip<00:04:37.100> this

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
scarf so here is I'm going to skip this

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:53.540 
scarf so here is I'm going to skip this
one<00:04:37.340> one<00:04:38.560> two<00:04:40.990> three<00:04:43.660> four<00:04:48.310> five

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.510 

six

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.770 

seven

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.340 

eight

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
eight

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.140 
eight
and<00:05:09.800> nine<00:05:10.810> okay<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.610> again<00:05:13.610> I'm<00:05:13.820> going<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:13.970> put

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
and nine okay so again I'm going to put

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.600 
and nine okay so again I'm going to put
that<00:05:14.330> last<00:05:14.540> loop<00:05:14.840> in<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.140> head<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.250> my<00:05:16.370> hook

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
that last loop in the head of my hook

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.180 
that last loop in the head of my hook
and<00:05:16.850> I<00:05:16.970> put<00:05:17.330> my<00:05:17.510> fingers<00:05:17.900> on<00:05:18.080> each<00:05:18.290> side<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.830> the

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
and I put my fingers on each side of the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.150 
and I put my fingers on each side of the
remaining<00:05:19.760> hooks<00:05:20.120> turn<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.260> head<00:05:21.470> down<00:05:21.740> and

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
remaining hooks turn the head down and

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.400 
remaining hooks turn the head down and
bring<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:22.730> through<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.750> remaining<00:05:24.200> loops

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
bring that through the remaining loops

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.150 
bring that through the remaining loops
on<00:05:24.620> my<00:05:24.650> hook

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
on my hook

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.000 
on my hook
so<00:05:25.670> now<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:25.880> would<00:05:26.330> move<00:05:26.510> my<00:05:26.840> take<00:05:27.230> my<00:05:27.440> first

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
so now I would move my take my first

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.510 
so now I would move my take my first
stitch<00:05:28.370> marker<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:30.040> take<00:05:31.040> it<00:05:31.190> out<00:05:31.340> because

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
stitch marker and take it out because

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.310 
stitch marker and take it out because
it's<00:05:31.790> safe<00:05:32.120> because<00:05:32.540> it's<00:05:32.690> got<00:05:32.870> this<00:05:33.050> one

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
it's safe because it's got this one

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.190 
it's safe because it's got this one
above<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:34.040> then<00:05:34.640> move<00:05:34.910> this<00:05:35.180> one<00:05:35.420> up<00:05:35.600> like

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
above it and then move this one up like

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.890 
above it and then move this one up like
with<00:05:36.410> that<00:05:36.560> right<00:05:36.950> there<00:05:37.220> so<00:05:38.090> just<00:05:38.330> continue

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
with that right there so just continue

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.500 
with that right there so just continue
working<00:05:39.170> like<00:05:39.560> that<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.190> end<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.880> now

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
working like that to the end and now

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.150 
working like that to the end and now
I'll<00:05:41.660> show<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.870> how<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:42.200> finish<00:05:42.470> off<00:05:42.830> on<00:05:43.070> the

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
I'll show you how to finish off on the

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.400 
I'll show you how to finish off on the
other<00:05:43.310> end<00:05:43.610> this<00:05:44.120> one<00:05:44.420> is<00:05:44.690> ready<00:05:45.080> to<00:05:45.200> be

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
other end this one is ready to be

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.010 
other end this one is ready to be
finished<00:05:45.650> off<00:05:46.010> over<00:05:46.310> here<00:05:46.670> and<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.570> is<00:05:47.780> how

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
finished off over here and this is how

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.200 
finished off over here and this is how
much<00:05:48.260> this<00:05:48.710> is<00:05:48.920> a<00:05:48.950> really<00:05:49.430> nice<00:05:49.610> length<00:05:49.940> of

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
much this is a really nice length of

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.930 
much this is a really nice length of
scarf<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:50.950> this<00:05:51.950> is<00:05:52.100> how<00:05:52.250> much<00:05:52.400> I<00:05:52.550> hit<00:05:52.730> left

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
scarf and this is how much I hit left

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.510 
scarf and this is how much I hit left
over<00:05:53.300> so<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:53.570> can<00:05:53.900> on<00:05:54.350> this<00:05:54.560> one<00:05:54.860> pick<00:05:55.130> up<00:05:55.310> more

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
over so you can on this one pick up more

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.320 
over so you can on this one pick up more
loops<00:05:57.850> okay<00:05:58.850> so<00:05:59.510> actually<00:06:00.520> this<00:06:01.520> was<00:06:01.850> done

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
loops okay so actually this was done

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.600 
loops okay so actually this was done
with<00:06:02.510> eight<00:06:02.780> so<00:06:03.140> I<00:06:03.200> want<00:06:03.440> you<00:06:03.590> to<00:06:03.650> at<00:06:04.370> least

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
with eight so I want you to at least

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.640 
with eight so I want you to at least
pick<00:06:04.820> up<00:06:04.970> nine<00:06:05.240> and<00:06:05.690> then<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.080> might<00:06:06.260> not<00:06:06.440> have

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
pick up nine and then you might not have

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.970 
pick up nine and then you might not have
that<00:06:06.980> all<00:06:07.190> this<00:06:07.460> left<00:06:07.790> over<00:06:08.180> so<00:06:08.840> I<00:06:09.290> would<00:06:09.410> say

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
that all this left over so I would say

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.940 
that all this left over so I would say
your<00:06:10.280> max<00:06:10.600> for<00:06:11.600> picking<00:06:11.870> up<00:06:11.990> is<00:06:12.140> nine<00:06:12.410> or<00:06:12.770> maybe

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
your max for picking up is nine or maybe

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.600 
your max for picking up is nine or maybe
ten<00:06:14.110> but<00:06:15.110> these<00:06:15.290> are<00:06:15.440> so<00:06:15.620> easy<00:06:15.920> to<00:06:16.220> do<00:06:16.400> you

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
ten but these are so easy to do you

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.490 
ten but these are so easy to do you
could<00:06:16.760> always<00:06:16.940> pull<00:06:17.360> back<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:17.990> it's<00:06:18.170> you<00:06:18.470> know

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
could always pull back and it's you know

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.730 
could always pull back and it's you know
try<00:06:18.980> it<00:06:19.010> a<00:06:19.220> different<00:06:19.580> way<00:06:19.610> I<00:06:20.090> think<00:06:20.840> max<00:06:21.380> it

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
try it a different way I think max it

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.320 
try it a different way I think max it
would<00:06:21.860> take<00:06:22.010> about<00:06:22.130> a<00:06:22.280> half<00:06:22.580> hour<00:06:22.760> to<00:06:23.000> do<00:06:23.150> these

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
would take about a half hour to do these

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.580 
would take about a half hour to do these
okay<00:06:24.260> so<00:06:24.320> this<00:06:25.100> was<00:06:25.760> ready<00:06:26.600> to<00:06:26.720> finish<00:06:26.900> off<00:06:27.290> so

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
okay so this was ready to finish off so

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.710 
okay so this was ready to finish off so
I<00:06:27.620> had<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:27.860> stitch<00:06:28.130> marker<00:06:28.160> on<00:06:28.640> here<00:06:28.940> so<00:06:29.600> to

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
I had a stitch marker on here so to

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.690 
I had a stitch marker on here so to
finish<00:06:29.990> off<00:06:30.350> all<00:06:30.800> I<00:06:30.860> need<00:06:31.160> to<00:06:31.310> do<00:06:31.550> is<00:06:33.220> yarn<00:06:34.220> over

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
finish off all I need to do is yarn over

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.990 
finish off all I need to do is yarn over
with<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.270> entire<00:06:35.690> strand<00:06:36.320> of<00:06:36.560> yarn<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.250> then

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
with the entire strand of yarn and then

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.060 
with the entire strand of yarn and then
bring<00:06:38.390> that<00:06:38.420> through<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.170> last<00:06:39.380> loop<00:06:39.650> on<00:06:40.040> my

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
bring that through the last loop on my

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.400 
bring that through the last loop on my
hook<00:06:40.220> like<00:06:40.670> that<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:42.070> then<00:06:43.070> cut<00:06:43.490> this<00:06:44.410> about

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
hook like that and then cut this about

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.490 
hook like that and then cut this about
five<00:06:45.980> inches<00:06:46.370> out<00:06:46.580> here<00:06:48.340> and<00:06:49.630> then<00:06:50.630> pull<00:06:51.320> that

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
five inches out here and then pull that

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.320 
five inches out here and then pull that
loop<00:06:51.770> all<00:06:52.040> the<00:06:52.100> way<00:06:52.370> through<00:06:52.850> and<00:06:53.180> that's

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
loop all the way through and that's

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.900 
loop all the way through and that's
pretty<00:06:53.690> much<00:06:53.900> locked<00:06:54.260> right<00:06:54.530> there<00:06:54.910> except

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
pretty much locked right there except

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.750 
pretty much locked right there except
for<00:06:56.120> added<00:06:56.600> security<00:06:56.810> I<00:06:57.620> recommend<00:06:58.490> that<00:06:58.700> you

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
for added security I recommend that you

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.950 
for added security I recommend that you
take<00:06:59.150> this<00:06:59.450> and<00:07:00.220> you<00:07:01.220> make<00:07:02.210> a<00:07:02.240> knot<00:07:02.570> at<00:07:02.900> the

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
take this and you make a knot at the

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.700 
take this and you make a knot at the
very<00:07:03.110> bottom<00:07:04.060> like<00:07:05.060> that<00:07:05.360> and<00:07:05.840> you<00:07:06.170> push<00:07:06.470> that

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
very bottom like that and you push that

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.640 
very bottom like that and you push that
nut<00:07:07.010> towards<00:07:07.760> the<00:07:08.030> last<00:07:08.270> ruffle<00:07:09.140> that<00:07:09.500> you

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
nut towards the last ruffle that you

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.760 
nut towards the last ruffle that you
made<00:07:09.860> the<00:07:10.550> last<00:07:10.760> gathering<00:07:11.390> and<00:07:11.990> you<00:07:12.350> make

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
made the last gathering and you make
