00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
question after the Tony Thompson losses

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.969 
question after the Tony Thompson losses
and<00:01:15.270> David<00:01:15.659> Price<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.080> knows<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.770> ten

rounds<00:01:17.600> okay<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.759> personally<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.820> think<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
rounds okay so personally I think this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.390 
rounds okay so personally I think this
was<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> good<00:01:21.479> experience<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.530> David<00:01:22.890> Price<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
was a good experience for David Price I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
was a good experience for David Price I
think<00:01:23.850> he<00:01:23.939> needed<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> rounds<00:01:24.869> he<00:01:25.320> needed<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
think he needed the rounds he needed to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
think he needed the rounds he needed to
have<00:01:25.890> confidence<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.580> his<00:01:26.729> own<00:01:26.820> ability<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.299> go

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
have confidence in his own ability to go

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
have confidence in his own ability to go
10<00:01:27.840> rounds<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.439> his<00:01:28.590> stamina<00:01:28.829> and
