what this is about so screw it let's
let's<00:02:34.640> look<00:02:34.880> at<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.239> actual<00:02:35.390> VMAs<00:02:35.989> for

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
let's look at the actual VMAs for

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.009 
let's look at the actual VMAs for
ourselves<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.330> see<00:02:38.330> what's<00:02:38.510> going<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.810> with

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
ourselves and see what's going on with

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.280 
ourselves and see what's going on with
them<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.130> as<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.459> VMA<00:02:40.790> start<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.840> immediately

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
them so as the VMA start we immediately

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.180 
them so as the VMA start we immediately
see<00:02:42.739> this<00:02:43.100> triangle<00:02:43.519> shape<00:02:44.530> spaceship<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.769> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
see this triangle shape spaceship on the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.880 
see this triangle shape spaceship on the
stage<00:02:46.459> where<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.480> first<00:02:47.810> singer<00:02:48.110> steps<00:02:48.709> out

that<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.840> very<00:03:09.080> beginning<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.799> have<00:03:10.480> six

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
that in the very beginning we have six

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.680 
that in the very beginning we have six
beams<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.620> light<00:03:13.420> coming<00:03:14.420> off<00:03:14.600> of<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.930> space

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
beams of light coming off of the space

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.340 
beams of light coming off of the space
we<00:03:15.990> have<00:03:16.290> six<00:03:17.130> rocks<00:03:18.230> surrounding<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
we have six rocks surrounding the

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.880 
we have six rocks surrounding the
spaceship<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:20.040> we<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.670> six<00:03:21.330> steps<00:03:22.170> leading

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
spaceship and we have six steps leading

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.120 
spaceship and we have six steps leading
up<00:03:23.130> into<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.850> spaceship<00:03:24.270> or<00:03:24.480> down<00:03:24.690> out<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
up into the spaceship or down out of the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.890 
up into the spaceship or down out of the
spaceship<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:27.330> what<00:03:27.510> does<00:03:27.600> this<00:03:27.690> represent

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
spaceship so what does this represent

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.010 
spaceship so what does this represent
well<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.460> six<00:03:29.730> beams<00:03:29.970> of<00:03:30.180> light<00:03:30.330> represents

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
well the six beams of light represents

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.820 
well the six beams of light represents
the<00:03:31.170> heavens<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.550> six<00:03:33.210> rocks<00:03:33.900> represent<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
the heavens the six rocks represent the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.940 
the heavens the six rocks represent the
earth<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:36.420> spaceship<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.590> six

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
earth and the spaceship with the six

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.900 
earth and the spaceship with the six
steps<00:03:38.430> coming<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.080> represents<00:03:41.070> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
steps coming out of it represents the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.010 
steps coming out of it represents the
merging<00:03:42.210> of<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.690> two

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
merging of the two

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.120 
merging of the two
let's<00:03:43.830> let's<00:03:44.190> count<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.790> make<00:03:44.910> sure<00:03:46.130> one

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
let's let's count just to make sure one

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.750 
let's let's count just to make sure one
two<00:03:47.940> three<00:03:48.690> four<00:03:49.290> five<00:03:50.120> six<00:03:51.120> yep<00:03:51.660> six<00:03:52.440> steps<00:03:53.220> so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
two three four five six yep six steps so

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.640 
two three four five six yep six steps so
what<00:03:53.940> do<00:03:54.000> we<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.300> we<00:03:54.720> have<00:03:55.140> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
what do we have we have the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.370 
what do we have we have the
representation<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.580> moving<00:03:57.390> from<00:03:57.630> this<00:03:58.020> earth

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
representation of moving from this earth

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.450 
representation of moving from this earth
to<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.460> next<00:04:00.000> through<00:04:00.750> six<00:04:01.650> sixty-six

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
to the next through six sixty-six

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.370 
to the next through six sixty-six
all<00:04:02.640> right<00:04:02.790> now<00:04:02.940> jumping<00:04:03.300> back<00:04:03.510> again<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
all right now jumping back again to the

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.610 
all right now jumping back again to the
original<00:04:04.860> opening<00:04:05.040> scene<00:04:05.730> we<00:04:06.720> see<00:04:06.990> that<00:04:07.290> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
original opening scene we see that the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.010 
original opening scene we see that the
spaceship<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.490> of<00:04:08.790> course<00:04:09.060> in<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.450> shape<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.840> a

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
spaceship is of course in the shape of a

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.180 
spaceship is of course in the shape of a
triangle<00:04:10.410> but<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.850> also<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.810> base<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.350> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
triangle but it is also the base of the

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
actually the makeup of the stage and how

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.450 
actually the makeup of the stage and how
everyone<00:06:22.380> keeps<00:06:22.620> talking<00:06:22.919> about<00:06:22.949> how<00:06:23.280> it

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
everyone keeps talking about how it

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.450 
everyone keeps talking about how it
forms<00:06:24.000> sixes<00:06:24.930> well<00:06:25.590> that's<00:06:25.800> true<00:06:26.070> it

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
forms sixes well that's true it

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.300 
forms sixes well that's true it
obviously<00:06:26.940> forms<00:06:27.419> sixes<00:06:27.960> but<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:29.160> other

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
obviously forms sixes but the other

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.159 
obviously forms sixes but the other
thing<00:06:29.580> to<00:06:29.669> take<00:06:29.820> into<00:06:30.150> account<00:06:30.419> is<00:06:30.660> that<00:06:30.840> it<00:06:31.020> is

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
thing to take into account is that it is
