00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.000
 last Thursday we are from the agricultural technical college accompanying 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.950
 a practical lesson in cholera and culture of the agricultural course we will check 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.269
 how is the step-by-step planting of some vegetables and greenery 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.049
 the first house 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.560
 fhc rule out anything 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.310
 experiments and knowledge in case the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.419
 cucumber but could also be done with other arias even the people 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.669
 sow when christmas has a phase that everything that is better 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.580
 Are you in the first year? 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.620
 You're already getting a legal notion. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 The truth is, this is very good. 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.980
 And even though we have to be legal. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.790
 teach you the lessons you take to your house but already prepare a material 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.360
 not yet 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.829
 we always have her, right after we did not know 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.989
 with the people you learn to irritate the proceedings against 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.579
 people at home the first step was already accomplished now we are in the greenhouse 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.800
 that the senate because now the greenhouse how about it stays here 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.370
 the question will be about 25 days 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.100
 this due to the temperature and when giving me this country wanted to leave field duck 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.030
 fully 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.830
 never had another environment would be worse from the accident 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.640
 so surely I think that here already has name in the city the temperature 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.050
 the right humidity for those who need it 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.450
 now the next step 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.850
 the campus 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.760
 I'll talk to the proposal the seedlings greenhouse 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.310
 as the planting process 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.920
 but to make the outflow 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.040
 20 by 20 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.990
 we do the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.840
 and we put the post-planting modes mainly for how long 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.869
 until harvest sixty days ilana I'm staying in tunnels 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.749
