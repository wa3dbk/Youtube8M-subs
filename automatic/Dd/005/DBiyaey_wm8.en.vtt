00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.729
 good morning all the guys are scared 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.490
 that deserves back with another video 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.910
 tutorial on how to make believe that buys 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.710
 sales on si spits fifteen last estimates 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.080
 since you asked me in Perugia 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.949
 mind to do it but he doesn't really have you 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.499
 I speak today to make a video tutorial 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.699
 yet on how to use city is already in 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:28.339
 this case on how to use it to go 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.640
 to the five hundredth page of the actions 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.890
 players in short to find in 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.720
 last the first few minutes when the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.790
 player put up for auction but still 59 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.560
 less sense melli than you find the prices 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.630
 more lower, however, for contracts 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.220
 a good thing is today i will do it for i 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.440
 ham detectors 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.420
 one thing is that I tried it anyway 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.090
 do these minutes and I don't know why 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.130
 that is, I go to the car hundredth page e 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.610
 I don't know why there's still 5 I don't know if a 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.520
 I also vaguely do something yesterday I have 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.020
 tested and works so maybe you can 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.820
 be comfortable everyday or a thing 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.710
 momentary what we have to do 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.790
 first of all we must unfortunately have 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.500
 that shit of wind internet explorer 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.970
 Click on the computer is usually 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.520
 the last one to run if not 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.440
 you are sure try with sto methods 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.700
 doing me if it tells you that it doesn't work 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.110
 click that other but it's very simple 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.020
 I advise you to put the players 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.869
 of gold and with 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.750
 minimum price I buy 200 gold and price 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.020
 maximum bought 5000 and what we have to 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.460
 do we have to do search and let's go 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.759
 go to the third page 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:54.060
 ok ok then let's do so new scan which 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.939
 we have to put three 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.729
 then slide another page while 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.250
 four ex kahn don't come back in 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.130
 news cannes because otherwise where it was done 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.869
 mexcal boss is right now instead 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.160
 he has already found it because I usually have it 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.989
 found at 5 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.750
 you find it at 6 which is usually found 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.560
 always twice 5 I even have to 7 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.540
 what we need to do change world 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.380
 by changing of xvi 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.090
 I put 499 we don't do anything anymore 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.590
 first snack happens gianni click 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.470
 back because if we click forward not 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.620
 will work here we are at 44 cents a 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:42.030
 498 page of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.830
 of everything and then see then we can 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.440
 however, go very well forward 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.599
 see I don't know why there is this if I am 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.110
 five minutes apart I don't know why 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.599
 and in any case yesterday emilia worked 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.670
 perfectly I went out I speak my own 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.319
 because today is in short we redo the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.450
 procedure for those who have not understood 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.549
 then we have to put this right 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.349
 could put it like that 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.150
 we aim for gold players because we don't 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:17.099
 believe driven buy players of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:19.260
 bronze to do search and we must do 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.950
 scroll the pages up to 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.150
 third 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:29.620
 let's put three first then forget 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.390
 4 we forget 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.390
 5 scroll 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.100
 6 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.250
 here you see here instead we are put up 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.800
 badoo 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.760
 even the mild test now type city 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.430
 hundred we put ok let's go back 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.040
 and dad pages 600 out of 700 you don't see that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.299
 however this method does everything 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.390
 unpublished mind 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.599
 I recommend it highly because anyway 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.959
 on the last few last pages 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:06.239
 seven hundred are really good 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.250
 offered players like these TVs 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.590
 that there were 90 speeds that maybe 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.739
 they are worth also on the thousand creeds if I didn't see 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.900
 which are worth 10 thousand but are worth a 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.539
 little bit and you can buy the 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.430
 very well to sell them at 900 bar from 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.970
 thousand doing this more 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.400
 sometimes you earn a lot of credits 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.350
 so saw this tutorial face to 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.250
 be one of the first unitary having done 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.440
 this video tutorial because in english 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.389
 they are already there but I think it is there 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.919
 so much color they do not understand and do not 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.190
 they want to understand even if those 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.990
 figures you understand very well for i 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.720
 details and even looking at you should 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.190
 understand but they basically have to then 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.680
 also follow speeches 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.120
