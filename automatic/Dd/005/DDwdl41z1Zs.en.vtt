of<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.690> some<00:04:16.079> point<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.739> rains<00:04:16.949> going<00:04:17.070> to

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
of it some point this the rains going to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.460 
of it some point this the rains going to
wrap<00:04:17.430> around<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.150> sarbs<00:04:18.510> here<00:04:18.690> i<00:04:18.930> think<00:04:19.410> is

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
wrap around and sarbs here i think is

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.680 
wrap around and sarbs here i think is
kind<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.829> slowed<00:04:20.190> down<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.639> there<00:04:20.820> too<00:04:21.030> yeah<00:04:21.449> it

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
kind of slowed down in there too yeah it

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.119 
kind of slowed down in there too yeah it
might<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:22.019> including<00:04:23.120> its

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
might be including its

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.399

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
can we back up a little and get the sign

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.159 
can we back up a little and get the sign
out<00:04:29.650> of<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.830> way<00:04:29.979> I<00:04:31.530> actually<00:04:32.530> kind<00:04:33.370> of<00:04:33.490> like<00:04:33.550> a

that's moving almost east so you know
this<00:05:10.419> East<00:05:10.750> option<00:05:11.229> might<00:05:11.380> not<00:05:11.560> be<00:05:11.710> bad<00:05:11.949> to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
this East option might not be bad to

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.530 
this East option might not be bad to
stay<00:05:12.430> up<00:05:12.580> with<00:05:12.759> it<00:05:12.910> let<00:05:13.030> me<00:05:13.060> see<00:05:13.120> if<00:05:13.389> it's

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.480 

that's<00:05:26.150> moving<00:05:26.450> this<00:05:26.780> way<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:27.620> 40<00:05:28.040> northeast

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
that's moving this way so 40 northeast

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.150 
that's moving this way so 40 northeast
they<00:05:28.760> could<00:05:28.970> go<00:05:29.120> right<00:05:29.480> over<00:05:29.510> our<00:05:30.200> highway<00:05:30.890> 9

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
they could go right over our highway 9

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.230 
they could go right over our highway 9
options<00:05:32.060> so<00:05:32.330> again<00:05:32.810> so<00:05:33.140> let's<00:05:33.320> not<00:05:33.500> do<00:05:33.680> that

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240
