00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.660
 number 3 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.910
 an urban legend ensures that the original name of the first platforms of the

 in bad taste that the protagonists had to face girls in 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.480
 a fight 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.670

 Pemán is known as Kumán in Japan but it was his entry into the market 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.800
 which is conducive to its name change due to the similarities in the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.770
 Anglo-Saxon language of the words putis funk 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.450

 it is said that in the super mario bros game for month there is a trick of level -1 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.040
 This is undoubtedly one of the rarest tricks in the history of videogames 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.390
 since you can reach a new level using a game failure 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.380
 It is commented that this strange for sale has been used by developers to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.839
 test the game 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:14.310
 it is a water phase at first sight completely normal like any other 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.699
 however, it has something that makes it special 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.009
 once you enter it these as in the event that the head porters to 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.810
 beginning of the screen with the time that you had left 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.899
 how to get 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:28.919
 most people who have played Super Mario will know the trick of the 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.769
 secret area of ​​selection of 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.010
 in the second phase 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.729
 number 7 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:38.149
 there is a mysterious legend around this game which appeared in about 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:42.189
 few portman oregon sites in the early 80s 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.689
 attributed to a company 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.949
 a call simes the Libyan time is a puzzle game whose legend tells 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.890
 that can cause nightmares and memory loss to players 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.899
 unfortunately there is no unit of this arcade machine 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:59.799
 it is rumored that there is some rom with the game but it has not been 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:00.899
 localized 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.509
 Number 8 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.119
 who mario 64 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.599
 and we do not talk about the nintendo ds version of course 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.359
 where Luigi appeared as a playable character but the Nintendo 64 at 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.700
 get 120 stars we could meet with them and and many 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.909
 they thought that luigi could also be unlocked to the point of being a 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.019
 urban legend 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.549
 sadly and although the version to test the game had him never 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.459
 happened from there 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.729
 since miyamoto at a conference said that luigi could not be used in 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.040
 Mario 64 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.989
 number 9 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.499
 play with the doll details in sony that he raised is a terrible curse 

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:44.459
 the community of fans of sonic must be pretty crazy we assume that because of 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.220
 the latest games it turns out that while sony that erre unlocked as 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.469
 character to the tahir doll if we play with him we will receive threatening calls 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.819
 and even the hand death of a life-size doll details the worst 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.819
 is that there are people who are capable of believing that this is true 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.689
 you have to be very stupid number 10 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.679
 we start with a game of the mado corn mat tyson puncha aut 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.659
 the legend tells that if you press the button be when there is one minute left and 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.309
 30 seconds in the second round Mario appears with a gun and shoots at 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.789
 tyson in the face obviously this rumor is false 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.990
 nintendo would never allow something like this to see the light as it would entail 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.949
 the image of your pet good friends that's all for today I hope you qualify 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.439

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.629
 and by the way, let me know that today I'm two years old on YouTube 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.050
