mutilate sink if they're not micro
properly<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.370> here<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.550> need<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.149> keep

in on that metrics pension or a Texas
Clark<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.770> think<00:00:55.949> actually<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.430> point<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
Clark I think actually at this point a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.369 
Clark I think actually at this point a
six<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.059> our<00:00:57.149> would<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> much<00:00:57.629> better<00:00:57.690> target

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
six of our would be a much better target

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.779 
six of our would be a much better target
for<00:00:58.530> light<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> net<00:00:59.070> r<00:00:59.100> expansion<00:00:59.609> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
for light because the net r expansion is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.970 
for light because the net r expansion is
has<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.660> where<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:01.890> bit

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
has the where up it's a little bit

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.200 
has the where up it's a little bit
damaged<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.430> point<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.670> still<00:01:02.730> wire<00:01:03.030> has

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
damaged at this point but still wire has

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.630 
damaged at this point but still wire has
quite<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> few<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:03.960> head<00:01:04.170> hit<00:01:04.470> points<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
quite a few more head hit points then a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.020 
quite a few more head hit points then a
hatchery<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.590> I<00:01:07.590> think<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.010> where<00:01:08.250> he<00:01:08.970> was

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
hatchery and I think that's where he was

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.460 
hatchery and I think that's where he was
going<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.330> expecting<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:09.990> attack<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.320> most

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
going to be expecting an attack so most

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
going to be expecting an attack so most
likely<00:01:10.500> probably<00:01:11.250> gonna<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.580> dead<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.970> setting

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
likely probably gonna be dead is setting

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
likely probably gonna be dead is setting
up<00:01:12.869> static<00:01:13.350> defenses<00:01:13.680> they're<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> lot<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
up static defenses they're a lot more a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
up static defenses they're a lot more a
lot<00:01:14.820> more<00:01:14.939> set<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> Defense's<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
lot more set of Defense's there but it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.840 
lot more set of Defense's there but it
means<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.070> weapons<00:01:17.340> won't<00:01:17.430> upgrade<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
means do have weapons won't upgrade this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.859 
means do have weapons won't upgrade this

off and let me adjust feel comfortable
to<00:02:39.550> tack<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.150> want<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.300> get<00:02:40.420> to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
to tack up but I want to get to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.120 
to tack up but I want to get to
starboard<00:02:41.110> up<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.470> we're<00:02:41.590> probably<00:02:41.800> going<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
starboard up so we're probably going to

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.830 
starboard up so we're probably going to
be<00:02:42.190> seeing<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.940> didn't<00:02:43.180> add<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> machine<00:02:43.660> shop

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
be seeing you didn't add a machine shop

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.390 
be seeing you didn't add a machine shop
so<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.050> probably<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.590> go<00:02:44.739> for<00:02:44.890> tanks<00:02:45.250> this

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
so we probably can go for tanks this

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.949 
so we probably can go for tanks this
time<00:02:46.140> rather<00:02:47.140> than<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.610> pyramid<00:02:48.610> pier<00:02:49.600> bio

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959

I<00:03:04.840> really<00:03:05.140> think<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.530> should<00:03:05.620> attack<00:03:06.310> up<00:03:06.489> at

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
I really think you should attack up at

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.240 
I really think you should attack up at
the<00:03:06.700> moment<00:03:06.820> not<00:03:07.390> go<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:07.959> guardians<00:03:08.350> because

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the moment not go for guardians because

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.430 
the moment not go for guardians because
with<00:03:10.000> what<00:03:10.420> white<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.870> going<00:03:11.110> for<00:03:11.320> AI<00:03:11.350> think

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
with what white is going for AI think

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.259 
with what white is going for AI think
Guardians<00:03:11.950> especially<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> amount<00:03:13.209> of

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
Guardians especially with the amount of

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.490 
Guardians especially with the amount of
mules<00:03:13.570> damage<00:03:13.840> has<00:03:13.930> been<00:03:13.959> done<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.260> him<00:03:14.470> I

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
mules damage has been done to him I

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.509 
mules damage has been done to him I
think<00:03:14.560> lights<00:03:14.860> can<00:03:14.980> be<00:03:15.010> with<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.220> counter

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
think lights can be with a counter

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.910 
think lights can be with a counter
Guardians<00:03:15.970> fairly<00:03:16.450> soon<00:03:16.720> pretty<00:03:17.320> easily<00:03:17.470> also

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
Guardians fairly soon pretty easily also

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.560 
Guardians fairly soon pretty easily also
forgetting<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.459> be<00:03:18.700> able<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:18.910> get<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> scan<00:03:19.360> off

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
forgetting it be able to get a scan off

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.310 
forgetting it be able to get a scan off
of<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:19.989> we<00:03:20.260> read<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.680> coming<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.110> think

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
of that and we read it coming so I think

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.210 
of that and we read it coming so I think
actually<00:03:23.410> here<00:03:23.650> we<00:03:23.709> should<00:03:23.829> go<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.040> something

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
actually here we should go for something

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.770 
actually here we should go for something
