stick down here well she which down here
let's<00:04:41.780> make<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.139> accessible<00:04:43.720> and<00:04:45.940> yeah<00:04:46.940> the

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
let's make that accessible and yeah the

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.420 
let's make that accessible and yeah the
thing<00:04:47.240> about<00:04:47.419> it<00:04:47.600> they<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:48.290> items<00:04:48.740> don't<00:04:48.919> jump

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
thing about it they the items don't jump

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.159 
thing about it they the items don't jump
to<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:50.300> actually<00:04:50.450> have<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.810> walk<00:04:50.990> over

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
to you you actually have to walk over

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.320 
to you you actually have to walk over
them<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.590> there's<00:04:52.400> like<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.610> glitch<00:04:53.030> or

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
them and there's like a glitch or

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.990 
them and there's like a glitch or
something<00:04:53.720> that<00:04:54.440> if<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.190> like<00:04:55.340> falls<00:04:55.610> right<00:04:55.850> on

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
something that if it like falls right on

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.300 
something that if it like falls right on
the<00:04:56.090> outer<00:04:56.389> edge<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:57.350> can't<00:04:57.590> pick<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:57.770> up<00:04:57.950> for

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
the outer edge you can't pick it up for

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.900 
the outer edge you can't pick it up for
some<00:04:58.430> reason<00:04:59.020> it's<00:05:00.020> kind<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.290> weird<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:01.610> you

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
some reason it's kind of weird so you

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.820 
some reason it's kind of weird so you
have<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.150> like<00:05:02.270> break<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.600> block<00:05:02.750> under<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.050> to

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
have to like break the block under it to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.320 
have to like break the block under it to
get<00:05:03.919> it<00:05:03.979> to<00:05:04.070> follow<00:05:04.280> like<00:05:04.610> in<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.940> middle<00:05:05.060> of<00:05:05.180> a

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
get it to follow like in the middle of a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.550 
get it to follow like in the middle of a
flat<00:05:05.540> place<00:05:05.780> or<00:05:05.930> something<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.260> then<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.470> can

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
flat place or something and then you can

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.120 
flat place or something and then you can
pick<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.770> up<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:08.330> that's<00:05:08.479> odd<00:05:08.630> but<00:05:08.870> oh<00:05:09.020> well<00:05:09.289> you

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
pick it up so that's odd but oh well you

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.690 
pick it up so that's odd but oh well you
ought<00:05:10.160> to<00:05:10.220> expect<00:05:10.430> bugs<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:11.060> stuff<00:05:11.380> happens

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
ought to expect bugs and stuff happens

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.200 
ought to expect bugs and stuff happens
show<00:05:13.700> let's<00:05:14.680> do<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:15.830> diagonal<00:05:16.580> tunnel<00:05:17.030> down

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
show let's do it diagonal tunnel down

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.650 
show let's do it diagonal tunnel down
here<00:05:17.800> yeah<00:05:18.800> these<00:05:18.979> torches<00:05:19.370> don't<00:05:19.729> give<00:05:20.510> off

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
here yeah these torches don't give off

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.620 
here yeah these torches don't give off
much<00:05:20.900> light<00:05:21.190> with<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.220> little<00:05:22.430> section<00:05:23.060> some<00:05:23.330> I

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
much light with a little section some I

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.320 
much light with a little section some I
