00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.590 
problem with this knot pulling out
so<00:02:23.370> until<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.520> do<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> little<00:02:24.880> demonstration<00:02:25.060> on

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
so until we do a little demonstration on

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
so until we do a little demonstration on
how<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.750> tie<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.170> alright<00:02:27.630> first<00:02:28.630> step<00:02:28.960> we

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
how to tie that alright first step we

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.650 
how to tie that alright first step we
have<00:02:29.800> our<00:02:30.390> braid<00:02:31.530> going<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.800> real<00:02:33.660> peel

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
have our braid going to the real peel

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.050 
have our braid going to the real peel
this<00:02:34.870> down<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:37.210> I<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.510> loop<00:02:37.780> here<00:02:38.790> about<00:02:39.790> 6

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
this down so I have a loop here about 6

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.930 
this down so I have a loop here about 6
inches<00:02:40.240> long<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.340> double<00:02:42.340> overhand<00:02:42.700> knot

this is 50 pound 50 pound big game just
simple<00:03:10.450> monofilament<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.790> we're<00:03:12.790> going<00:03:13.030> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
simple monofilament and we're going to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.020 
simple monofilament and we're going to
just<00:03:14.470> cross<00:03:14.800> them<00:03:15.040> over<00:03:17.400> wrap<00:03:18.400> away<00:03:18.700> from<00:03:18.910> the

ten<00:03:38.180> now

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.580 

want<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.970> keep<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.600> right<00:03:43.780> way<00:03:43.990> I'm

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
want to keep this the right way I'm

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.380 
want to keep this the right way I'm
going<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.860> spread<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.370> loop<00:03:45.610> out<00:03:45.850> here

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
going to spread this loop out here

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.430 
going to spread this loop out here
I<00:03:48.000> hope<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:49.210> shows<00:03:49.480> up<00:03:49.660> on<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> pool<00:03:50.110> table

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
I hope this shows up on the pool table

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680 
I hope this shows up on the pool table
and<00:03:50.560> pull<00:03:51.460> the<00:03:51.550> tag<00:03:51.760> into<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.210> mono<00:03:52.390> right

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
and pull the tag into the mono right

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.400 
and pull the tag into the mono right
through<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.050> loop<00:03:53.850> like<00:03:54.850> so<00:03:55.110> till<00:03:56.110> we're<00:03:56.290> in

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
through that loop like so till we're in

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
through that loop like so till we're in
this<00:03:56.530> fashion<00:03:56.860> here<00:03:58.350> now<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.380> little<00:03:59.710> saliva<00:04:00.040> on

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
this fashion here now a little saliva on

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.420 
this fashion here now a little saliva on
where<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.820> wraps<00:04:01.030> off<00:04:04.740> now<00:04:05.740> you<00:04:05.800> start<00:04:06.160> pulling

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
where to wraps off now you start pulling

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.420 
where to wraps off now you start pulling
this<00:04:06.700> down<00:04:07.200> until<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.260> see<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.620> braid<00:04:08.920> start

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
this down until you see that braid start

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.670 
this down until you see that braid start
snugging<00:04:09.730> up<00:04:10.090> once<00:04:10.870> we<00:04:11.020> get<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.440> point

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
snugging up once we get to that point

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.620 
snugging up once we get to that point
the<00:04:11.980> loop<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.730> tail<00:04:13.000> again<00:04:13.360> -<00:04:13.540> the

the loop and the tail again - the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.370 
the loop and the tail again - the
monofilament<00:04:14.190> take<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.430> off<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.380> we're

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
monofilament take that off and we're

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.630 
monofilament take that off and we're
just<00:04:17.530> going<00:04:17.770> to<00:04:17.799> start<00:04:18.280> pulling<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.940> down

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
just going to start pulling this down

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.570 
just going to start pulling this down
until<00:04:21.640> it<00:04:21.790> all<00:04:21.880> sets<00:04:22.300> up<00:04:22.480> nice<00:04:23.340> you'll<00:04:24.340> see

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
until it all sets up nice you'll see

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.370 
until it all sets up nice you'll see
you'll<00:04:24.970> know<00:04:25.180> you'll<00:04:25.450> see<00:04:25.630> that<00:04:25.750> mono<00:04:26.020> see

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
you'll know you'll see that mono see

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.320 
you'll know you'll see that mono see
that<00:04:26.670> this<00:04:27.670> mono<00:04:29.340> starts<00:04:30.340> jumping<00:04:30.820> out<00:04:30.970> at<00:04:31.180> you

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
that this mono starts jumping out at you

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.290
