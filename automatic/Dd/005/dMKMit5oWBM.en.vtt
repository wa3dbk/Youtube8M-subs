00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
inline kit that was a video I did a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
inline kit that was a video I did a
couple<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.650> days<00:00:22.859> ago<00:00:23.039> about<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.670> inline<00:00:24.060> kit

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
couple of days ago about this inline kit

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
couple of days ago about this inline kit
that<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> found<00:00:24.900> over<00:00:25.470> at<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:25.680> army-navy<00:00:26.189> store

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
that I found over at my army-navy store

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.509 
that I found over at my army-navy store
anyway<00:00:27.240> he<00:00:28.170> said<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> looks<00:00:28.680> pretty<00:00:28.920> cool<00:00:29.160> I'm

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
anyway he said it looks pretty cool I'm

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.339 
anyway he said it looks pretty cool I'm
planning<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:29.970> use<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.539> standards

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
planning to use the standards

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.819 
planning to use the standards
Sawyer<00:00:31.980> squeeze<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.260> wish<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> better

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
Sawyer squeeze I wish there was a better

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
Sawyer squeeze I wish there was a better
way<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.040> squeeze<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.730> water<00:00:35.940> directly<00:00:36.270> into<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
way to squeeze the water directly into a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
way to squeeze the water directly into a
bottle<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> thought<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.670> tornado

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
bottle then I thought about the tornado

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.260 
bottle then I thought about the tornado
tube<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.719> an<00:00:39.870> adapter<00:00:40.489> he<00:00:41.489> said<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.120> goes

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
tube as an adapter he said that he goes

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.520 
tube as an adapter he said that he goes
on<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> say<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.809> seems<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> should<00:00:43.440> be

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
on to say it seems that you should be

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
on to say it seems that you should be
able<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.829> screw<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> outlets

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
able to screw it on to the outlets

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.779 
able to screw it on to the outlets
threads<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.440> screw<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> bottle<00:00:47.370> into<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
threads and then screw a bottle into the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.420 
threads and then screw a bottle into the
adapter<00:00:48.059> he<00:00:49.050> saw<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> video<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.829> somebody's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
adapter he saw a video that somebody's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610 
adapter he saw a video that somebody's
putting<00:00:50.700> out<00:00:50.940> where<00:00:51.239> they're<00:00:52.170> making<00:00:52.379> an

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
putting out where they're making an

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.569 
putting out where they're making an
adapter<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.390> $15<00:00:54.829> but<00:00:55.829> when<00:00:56.039> he<00:00:56.129> asked<00:00:56.460> him

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
adapter for $15 but when he asked him

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
adapter for $15 but when he asked him
about<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.030> he<00:00:57.270> said<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.020> tornado<00:00:58.320> tube

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
about it he said that the tornado tube

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
about it he said that the tornado tube
had<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> wrong<00:00:59.340> threads<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.199> thought<00:01:01.469> I'd

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
had the wrong threads so I thought I'd

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.930 
had the wrong threads so I thought I'd
check<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> doesn't<00:01:02.730> make

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
check that out because it doesn't make

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.210 
check that out because it doesn't make
any<00:01:03.120> sense<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> Sawyer<00:01:06.060> squeeze

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
any sense the this is the Sawyer squeeze

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.510 
any sense the this is the Sawyer squeeze
this<00:01:08.220> comes<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.820> bags<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:11.310> onto

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
this comes with bags that you put onto

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.440 
this comes with bags that you put onto
this<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.409> threads<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.939> then<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> also<00:01:15.180> has

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this in threads in and then it also has

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.210 
this in threads in and then it also has
threads<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> other<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.979> are<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
threads on the other side that are the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.240 
threads on the other side that are the
same<00:01:17.430> size<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> soda<00:01:18.509> bottle<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:20.009> I'll

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
same size as a soda bottle you can I'll

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.710 
same size as a soda bottle you can I'll
have<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.970> put<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> soda<00:01:21.570> bottle

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
have one here you can put a soda bottle

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
have one here you can put a soda bottle
cap<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.430> works

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
cap on here so if that works

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
cap on here so if that works
I<00:01:24.090> thought<00:01:24.360> something<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.020> tornado

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I thought something like this tornado

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.999 
I thought something like this tornado
tube<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.490> John<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.630> saying<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
tube just like John was saying this is a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
tube just like John was saying this is a
tornado<00:01:29.670> tube<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> kids<00:01:30.479> used<00:01:30.810> where<00:01:31.110> they

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
tornado tube that kids used where they

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.670 
tornado tube that kids used where they
put<00:01:32.100> 2-liter<00:01:33.060> bottles<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.720> either<00:01:33.750> end<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.560> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
put 2-liter bottles on either end one of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
put 2-liter bottles on either end one of
them<00:01:34.799> full<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.040> water<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.329> put<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
them full of water then when you put it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.719 
them full of water then when you put it
upside<00:01:36.869> down<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.409> water<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> top<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
upside down with the water on the top it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
upside down with the water on the top it
makes<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> tornado<00:01:39.780> going<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.350> here

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
makes like a tornado going in here

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.039 
makes like a tornado going in here
anyway<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.790> made<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.150> screw<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.540> two

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
anyway it's made to screw on two

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.870 
anyway it's made to screw on two
two-liter<00:01:43.590> bottles<00:01:44.100> which<00:01:44.310> should<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
two-liter bottles which should be the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.020 
two-liter bottles which should be the
same<00:01:45.119> thread<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.670> problem<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
same thread as this the one problem that

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.719 
same thread as this the one problem that
comes<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.290> support<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.670> if

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
comes in is for support I don't know if

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.249 
comes in is for support I don't know if
you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.450> there's<00:01:51.659> an<00:01:51.780> extra

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you can see it here but there's an extra

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
you can see it here but there's an extra
long<00:01:52.560> lip<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.200> won't<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:57.060> way

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
long lip here so it won't go on that way

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.209 
long lip here so it won't go on that way
it's<00:01:57.450> too<00:01:57.689> deep<00:01:58.049> hopefully<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.829> showing<00:01:59.189> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it's too deep hopefully I'm showing you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's too deep hopefully I'm showing you
this<00:01:59.450> but<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.710> cut<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> ring<00:02:02.310> off<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:03.479> I

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
this but if you cut a ring off like I

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.830 
this but if you cut a ring off like I
did<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.079> side<00:02:04.140> cut<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.630> that's<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
did on this side cut a that's about a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
did on this side cut a that's about a
quarter-inch<00:02:07.229> ring<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.220> depend<00:02:08.459> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
quarter-inch ring it would depend on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.190 
quarter-inch ring it would depend on
your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500 
your
Tornado<00:02:11.100> tube<00:02:11.460> -<00:02:11.730> I'm<00:02:11.880> sure<00:02:12.060> they're<00:02:12.210> all<00:02:12.330> made

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
Tornado tube - I'm sure they're all made

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.660 
Tornado tube - I'm sure they're all made
differently<00:02:12.960> but<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.740> just<00:02:13.980> cut<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> ring<00:02:14.490> off

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
differently but I just cut a ring off

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.570 
differently but I just cut a ring off
and<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:18.120> fits<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.580> now

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and then it fits on just like that now

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.520 
and then it fits on just like that now
from<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.450> put<00:02:21.690> any<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.200> bottle

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
from here you can put any kind of bottle

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.490 
from here you can put any kind of bottle
on<00:02:22.709> that'll<00:02:23.160> fit<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
on that'll fit the one that was on the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.000 
on that'll fit the one that was on the
thing<00:02:25.709> was<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> platypus<00:02:26.640> platypus<00:02:27.150> bottle<00:02:28.010> now

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
thing was a platypus platypus bottle now

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.580 
thing was a platypus platypus bottle now
this<00:02:29.310> one<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.730> has<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.630> standard<00:02:31.230> soda

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
this one that I have has a standard soda

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.449 
this one that I have has a standard soda
bottle<00:02:32.240> neck<00:02:33.240> on<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.050> that'll<00:02:34.440> fit<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.770> here

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.540 

one<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.900> platypus<00:02:40.430> doesn't<00:02:41.430> it

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
one like this this platypus doesn't it

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.080 
one like this this platypus doesn't it
has<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> wide<00:02:42.690> open<00:02:43.110> top<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.670> could

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
has a wide open top on it so you could

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.760 
has a wide open top on it so you could
still<00:02:45.360> feed<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.870> there<00:02:46.050> I'm<00:02:46.140> using<00:02:46.410> this

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
still feed it in there I'm using this

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.680 
still feed it in there I'm using this
for<00:02:46.920> something<00:02:47.100> else<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.520> want<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> make<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> dual

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
for something else I want to make a dual

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.720 
for something else I want to make a dual
system<00:02:49.019> where<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.590> Sawyer<00:02:49.860> goes<00:02:50.220> into<00:02:50.610> this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
system where the Sawyer goes into this

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.240 
system where the Sawyer goes into this
part<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.870> anyway<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.769> couldn't<00:02:53.100> use<00:02:53.220> a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
part but anyway you couldn't use a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.100 
part but anyway you couldn't use a
platypus<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.239> but<00:02:54.480> there's<00:02:54.630> all<00:02:54.780> kinds

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
platypus like that but there's all kinds

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.300 
platypus like that but there's all kinds
of<00:02:55.170> other<00:02:55.290> ones<00:02:55.560> these<00:02:55.800> are<00:02:55.950> ones<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.220> you

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
of other ones these are ones that you

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.660 
of other ones these are ones that you
can<00:02:56.400> get<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.910> off<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:58.290> supply<00:02:58.620> places<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.430> as

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
can get it off of supply places this as

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.030 
can get it off of supply places this as
a<00:02:59.700> soda<00:03:00.120> bottle<00:03:00.330> top<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.650> would<00:03:01.830> fit

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
a soda bottle top on it that would fit

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.190 
a soda bottle top on it that would fit
in<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:03.300> in<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.540> case<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:04.019> going<00:03:04.140> to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
in there but in this case I'm going to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.580 
in there but in this case I'm going to
use<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.530> platypus<00:03:05.130> just<00:03:06.080> thread<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.380> like

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
use the platypus just thread it on like

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.280 
use the platypus just thread it on like
so<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.840> unfortunately<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:09.900> won't<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.080> able<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
so and unfortunately we won't be able to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.729 
so and unfortunately we won't be able to
see<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> whole<00:03:10.680> thing<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:11.730> does<00:03:12.090> fit<00:03:12.590> now<00:03:13.590> what

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
see the whole thing it does fit now what

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.630 
see the whole thing it does fit now what
I'll<00:03:13.860> do<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.160> I'll<00:03:14.310> set<00:03:14.519> up<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.760> camera<00:03:15.209> and

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
I'll do is I'll set up the camera and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.120 
I'll do is I'll set up the camera and
fill<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.180> squeeze<00:03:18.959> part<00:03:19.320> up<00:03:19.470> with<00:03:19.620> water<00:03:19.920> and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
fill the squeeze part up with water and

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.520 
fill the squeeze part up with water and
hang<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.329> then<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.600> becomes<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.049> gravity

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
hang it and then it becomes a gravity

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.789 
hang it and then it becomes a gravity
filter<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.880> let<00:03:24.299> me<00:03:24.390> set<00:03:24.570> up<00:03:24.690> my<00:03:24.810> camera<00:03:25.140> move

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
filter so let me set up my camera move

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.069 
filter so let me set up my camera move
it<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.130> we'll<00:03:27.000> be<00:03:27.180> right<00:03:27.360> back<00:03:27.600> for<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.930> little

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
it and we'll be right back for a little

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.110 
it and we'll be right back for a little
demo<00:03:28.410> okay<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.220> don't<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.489> if<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.670> can<00:03:29.850> see

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
demo okay I don't know if you can see

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.240 
demo okay I don't know if you can see
that<00:03:30.299> but<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:31.530> see<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.950> water<00:03:32.130> is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
that but I can see that the water is

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.240 
that but I can see that the water is
going<00:03:32.579> in<00:03:32.730> pretty<00:03:33.060> well<00:03:33.680> without<00:03:34.680> even<00:03:35.130> having

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
going in pretty well without even having

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.130 
going in pretty well without even having
to<00:03:35.459> squeeze<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.970> it's<00:03:36.120> just<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.450> gravity<00:03:36.930> type

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
to squeeze it it's just a gravity type

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.640 
to squeeze it it's just a gravity type
feed<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:38.370> dirty<00:03:38.640> water<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.630> on<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.110> top<00:03:40.350> in

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
feed the dirty water is on the top in

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.390 
feed the dirty water is on the top in
the<00:03:41.180> Sawyer<00:03:42.180> bag<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.810> use<00:03:43.560> other<00:03:43.799> bags<00:03:44.100> usually

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the Sawyer bag I use other bags usually

the Sawyer bag I use other bags usually
these<00:03:44.820> I've<00:03:45.060> just<00:03:45.510> been<00:03:45.630> keeping<00:03:45.870> for<00:03:46.260> using

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
these I've just been keeping for using

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.420 
these I've just been keeping for using
demos<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.730> goes<00:03:48.000> through<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.950> Sawyer<00:03:49.950> squeeze

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
demos it goes through the Sawyer squeeze

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.960 
demos it goes through the Sawyer squeeze
filter<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.660> direction<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.290> arrow<00:03:52.500> and

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
filter in the direction of the arrow and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.800 
filter in the direction of the arrow and
then<00:03:53.970> there's<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:55.010> tornado<00:03:56.010> tube<00:03:56.660> which<00:03:57.660> I

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
then there's the tornado tube which I

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.300 
then there's the tornado tube which I
should<00:03:58.019> have<00:03:58.110> cut<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.410> down<00:03:58.560> on<00:03:58.769> both<00:03:58.980> sides

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
should have cut it down on both sides

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.460 
should have cut it down on both sides
and<00:03:59.640> the<00:04:00.180> Platypus<00:04:00.540> bag<00:04:00.959> would<00:04:01.170> have<00:04:01.260> fit<00:04:01.440> in

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
and the Platypus bag would have fit in

to<00:05:23.830> about<00:05:24.039> here<00:05:24.310> already<00:05:24.699> hopefully<00:05:25.330> it'll

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
to about here already hopefully it'll

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.950 
to about here already hopefully it'll
show<00:05:25.960> up<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.889> camera<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.520> water<00:05:28.389> there<00:05:28.750> I

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
show up on the camera the water there I

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.469 
show up on the camera the water there I
could<00:05:29.889> have<00:05:30.010> used<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.310> larger<00:05:30.729> bag<00:05:30.940> on<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.270> top

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
could have used a larger bag on the top

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.010 
could have used a larger bag on the top
I<00:05:31.659> guess<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.970> with<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.150> gravity<00:05:34.449> thing<00:05:34.840> like

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
I guess so with a gravity thing like

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.689 
I guess so with a gravity thing like
this<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.320> don't<00:05:35.409> even<00:05:35.590> need<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.860> squeeze<00:05:36.310> just

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
this you don't even need to squeeze just

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.580 
this you don't even need to squeeze just
let<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.060> hang<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:37.539> do<00:05:37.840> something<00:05:38.229> else<00:05:38.320> while

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590
