00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:13.440 

I<00:00:09.090> mean<00:00:10.090> design<00:00:10.450> is<00:00:10.780> a<00:00:11.469> really<00:00:12.040> an<00:00:12.299> outcome<00:00:13.299> of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
I mean design is a really an outcome of

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.439 
I mean design is a really an outcome of
architecture

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.970 

maybe<00:00:18.449> 20<00:00:18.900> years<00:00:19.020> ago<00:00:19.460> realized<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:21.199> I<00:00:22.199> mean

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
maybe 20 years ago realized that I mean

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.159 
maybe 20 years ago realized that I mean
at<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:24.060> had<00:00:24.210> questions<00:00:24.660> all

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
at the time we had questions all

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.480 
at the time we had questions all
typologies<00:00:26.009> and<00:00:27.289> what<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:28.500> typology<00:00:29.009> was<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
typologies and what one typology was to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.569 
typologies and what one typology was to
do<00:00:29.640> with<00:00:29.849> very<00:00:30.090> large<00:00:30.329> buildings<00:00:30.930> or<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:32.099> idea

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
do with very large buildings or the idea

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.360 
do with very large buildings or the idea
of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.879> podium<00:00:33.269> is<00:00:33.720> in<00:00:33.870> modernism<00:00:34.350> podium<00:00:35.309> in

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
of the podium is in modernism podium in

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.390 
of the podium is in modernism podium in
a<00:00:35.460> slab<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.230> looked<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.589> this<00:00:37.769> idea<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
a slab so we looked at this idea of

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.119 
a slab so we looked at this idea of
topography<00:00:39.089> and<00:00:39.180> landscape<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.890> could

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
topography and landscape now that could

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
topography and landscape now that could
become<00:00:41.580> also<00:00:42.110> seamless<00:00:43.519> and<00:00:44.519> that's<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:45.239> we

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
become also seamless and that's how we

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.039 
become also seamless and that's how we
began<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> look<00:00:46.500> at<00:00:46.650> idea<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.780> landscape<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
began to look at idea of landscape and

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.500 
began to look at idea of landscape and
then<00:00:49.470> I<00:00:49.500> think<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.699> began<00:00:51.089> to<00:00:51.239> look<00:00:51.390> at

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
then I think they began to look at

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.780 
then I think they began to look at
erosion<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:53.390> striation<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.780> strata<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
erosion on striation on strata so I

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.969 
erosion on striation on strata so I
think<00:00:56.970> that<00:00:57.269> began<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.170> look<00:00:58.290> all<00:00:58.530> these<00:00:58.739> kind

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
think that began to look all these kind

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.460 
think that began to look all these kind
of<00:00:59.180> you<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.299> they<00:01:00.510> mean<00:01:00.629> life<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.019> a<00:01:01.049> sea

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
of you know they mean life with a sea

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.240 
of you know they mean life with a sea
life<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.900> quarrying<00:01:03.900> or<00:01:04.290> whatever<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> think

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
life or quarrying or whatever so I think

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.000 
life or quarrying or whatever so I think
that<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> literal

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that they but it's not really a literal

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.670 
that they but it's not really a literal
translation<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:11.630> natural<00:01:12.630> forms<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
translation of of natural forms it's so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.380 
translation of of natural forms it's so
I<00:01:14.810> mean<00:01:15.810> yeah<00:01:15.930> these<00:01:16.200> were<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.710> also

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
I mean yeah these were you is also

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.490 
I mean yeah these were you is also
hysterically<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> idea<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
hysterically like you know the idea the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.720 
hysterically like you know the idea the
Paisley<00:01:20.090> form<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:22.500> know<00:01:22.620> so<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
Paisley form and you know so that you

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.150 
Paisley form and you know so that you
know<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.140> began<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> look<00:01:26.010> at

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
know one can one can began to look at

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.510 
know one can one can began to look at
these<00:01:26.280> things<00:01:26.460> again

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.960 

oh<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:32.200> god<00:01:32.350> thinking<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.799> think<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.340> hotel

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
oh my god thinking I think the hotel

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.590 
oh my god thinking I think the hotel
should<00:01:34.270> give<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.750> apart<00:01:35.320> from<00:01:35.470> comfort<00:01:36.070> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
should give you apart from comfort a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.910 
should give you apart from comfort a
different<00:01:37.600> experience<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.259> new<00:01:38.409> one<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.590> have

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
different experience a new one you have

should also be comfortable but but it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.090 
should also be comfortable but but it
should<00:01:47.920> gives<00:01:48.909> you<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.119> window<00:01:49.450> into<00:01:50.140> what

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
could also be possible it could it could

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.460 
could also be possible it could it could
it<00:01:53.860> could<00:01:54.130> become<00:01:54.700> like<00:01:54.909> a<00:01:54.939> cave<00:01:55.270> or<00:01:55.570> nothing

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
it could become like a cave or nothing

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.770 
it could become like a cave or nothing
and<00:01:56.590> also<00:01:57.009> like<00:01:57.220> like<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.460> melted<00:01:57.909> ice<00:01:58.179> or

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
and also like like a melted ice or

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.410 
and also like like a melted ice or
whatever<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.979> with<00:02:00.310> them<00:02:00.429> within<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:01.299> know

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
whatever so with them within you know

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.630 
whatever so with them within you know
this<00:02:01.539> idea<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.140> especially<00:02:02.470> now<00:02:02.830> you<00:02:03.459> can

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
this idea and especially now you can

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.359 
this idea and especially now you can
have<00:02:03.759> materiality<00:02:04.390> where<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:04.990> can<00:02:05.140> have

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
have materiality where you can have

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.550 
have materiality where you can have
something<00:02:06.369> completely<00:02:06.810> continuous<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.049> with

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
something completely continuous and with

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.009 
something completely continuous and with
no<00:02:08.799> lines<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.670> no<00:02:10.060> dressing<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.509> from<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.720> nicer

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
no lines and no dressing is from a nicer

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.990 
no lines and no dressing is from a nicer
flow<00:02:11.350> especially<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.459> very<00:02:12.640> confined<00:02:13.230> space

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
flow especially in a very confined space

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.229 
flow especially in a very confined space
you<00:02:16.000> find<00:02:16.360> there's<00:02:17.200> too<00:02:17.410> many<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:18.549> cupboards

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
you find there's too many like cupboards

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.410 
you find there's too many like cupboards
which<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.350> have<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> door

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
which then you have to have a door

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
which then you have to have a door
opening<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.690> animals<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.709> much<00:02:23.980> nice<00:02:24.220> that

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
opening and animals it's much nice that

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.970 
opening and animals it's much nice that
you<00:02:24.549> have<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.930> feeling<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.019> spaciousness<00:02:26.319> I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
you have a feeling of spaciousness I

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.740 
you have a feeling of spaciousness I
mean<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> whole<00:02:27.910> idea<00:02:27.940> was<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.450> kind<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
mean the whole idea was to kind of

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.080 
mean the whole idea was to kind of
really<00:02:28.989> make<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.440> make<00:02:30.340> one<00:02:30.519> feel<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:31.060> a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
really make you make one feel have a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.570 
really make you make one feel have a
bigger<00:02:31.599> space<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.380> have<00:02:32.620> well<00:02:33.099> I<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.430> I

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
think because it was using in a kind of

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.490 
think because it was using in a kind of
this<00:02:36.549> whole<00:02:36.820> idea<00:02:37.329> of<00:02:37.660> using<00:02:37.840> kind<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.200> seat

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
this whole idea of using kind of seat

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.390 
this whole idea of using kind of seat
with<00:02:38.739> seamless<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.329> continuous

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
with seamless so it's a continuous
