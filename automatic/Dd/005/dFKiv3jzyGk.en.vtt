the coming year I'm not talking about
new<00:01:13.830> year's<00:01:14.010> resolutions<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
new year's resolutions I do a little of

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
new year's resolutions I do a little of
that<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.770> some<00:01:16.920> reason<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.280> year's<00:01:17.520> put

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that but for some reason this year's put

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
that but for some reason this year's put
me<00:01:17.820> off<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> little<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:19.430> one<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
me off a little and I think one of the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.300 
me off a little and I think one of the
reasons<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.650> economy<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.130> most

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
reasons for that as the economy in most

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
reasons for that as the economy in most
countries<00:01:23.490> has<00:01:23.790> been<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.150> bad<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.570> year

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
countries has been pretty bad all year

artist to be remarkable and I think

that's what how I felt tonight that this

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.600 
that's what how I felt tonight that this
was<00:03:09.260> good<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.680> was<00:03:09.800> reflective<00:03:10.280> there<00:03:10.520> was

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
was good it was reflective there was

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.710 
was good it was reflective there was
nothing<00:03:10.850> wrong<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.120> service<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:11.600> it

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
nothing wrong with the service but it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.480 
nothing wrong with the service but it
wasn't<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.650> didn't<00:03:12.920> have<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.040> elements<00:03:13.400> that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
wasn't it didn't have the elements that

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.370 
wasn't it didn't have the elements that
made<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.760> remarkable<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.960> thought<00:03:15.170> well

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
made it remarkable and I thought well

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.320 
made it remarkable and I thought well
it's<00:03:15.680> it's<00:03:16.010> kind<00:03:16.310> of<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.459> shame<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
it's it's kind of a shame that the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.750 
it's it's kind of a shame that the
economy<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.740> kind<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.160> thing<00:03:19.220> has<00:03:19.610> an

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
economy and that kind of thing has an

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.510 
economy and that kind of thing has an
impact<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.380> your<00:03:21.380> ability<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.770> be<00:03:21.950> remarkable

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
impact on your ability to be remarkable

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.280 
impact on your ability to be remarkable
but<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.060> doesn't<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.810> think<00:03:24.020> that's<00:03:24.200> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
but it doesn't and I think that's the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.810 
but it doesn't and I think that's the
interesting<00:03:24.620> thing<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.400> thing<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.670> take

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
interesting thing and the thing to take

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.010 
interesting thing and the thing to take
away<00:03:25.880> from<00:03:26.270> this<00:03:26.420> at<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.690> end<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:26.990> year

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
away from this at the end of the year

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.440 
away from this at the end of the year
because<00:03:27.410> if<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:28.280> certainly<00:03:28.670> affected<00:03:29.240> how

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
because if it's certainly affected how

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.970 
because if it's certainly affected how
I'm<00:03:29.600> going<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.840> think<00:03:29.930> about<00:03:30.080> my<00:03:30.350> own<00:03:30.380> work<00:03:30.530> and

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
I'm going to think about my own work and

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.860 
I'm going to think about my own work and
thinks<00:03:31.250> its<00:03:31.400> next<00:03:31.670> year<00:03:31.820> but<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.600> is<00:03:32.690> our

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
thinks its next year but it is our

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.199 
thinks its next year but it is our

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
you've got to figure out how you can get

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
that other people can't do and that's a

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.270 
that other people can't do and that's a
gift<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.600> we<00:03:44.720> all<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.070> tough

gift that we all have and it's a tough
one<00:03:46.489> because<00:03:46.610> we<00:03:46.880> have<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.150> develop<00:03:47.420> that

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
one because we have to develop that

there's<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.850> number<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.120> resources<00:03:53.450> out<00:03:53.780> there

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
there's a number of resources out there

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
all of them being photography based you

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.670 
all of them being photography based you
know<00:03:58.430> anything<00:03:58.790> that's<00:03:58.940> creative<00:03:59.300> based<00:03:59.680> but

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
i think it's really important sometimes

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.750 
i think it's really important sometimes
to<00:04:02.270> be<00:04:03.110> able<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.650> use<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.130> gift<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.730> be

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
remarkable and use it as a gift for

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.280 
remarkable and use it as a gift for
somebody<00:04:07.190> else<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:07.760> this<00:04:08.630> kind<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.930> includes

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
somebody else and this kind of includes

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.050 
somebody else and this kind of includes
