00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 I n but nothing 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 brown 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.710
 in short he returns with three groups 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.180
 in the peak period 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.810
 it moves more then the technique 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.830
 even advantage 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.720
 this 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.069
 we are now undertaking to develop for oven 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:26.189
 but she has a disadvantage 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.159
 that the power in place 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.780
 a chance to plunge into oblivion on the counter that's why and we had 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.159
 still a report on the market this version 1 because lo 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.080
 who exist 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.560
 who have small teeth like that and that allow us to rise 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.380
 the film 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.640
 be it with thomas 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.990
 sunny spells 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.800
 points on the road that's done 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.020
 indeed he was a victim 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.270
 so three years ago 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 at ps will come out divided 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.090
 on the other hand the parliamentary press 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.330
 without anything 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.140
 the sgs and 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.690
 forty minutes after 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.420
 to do this a result 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.070
 why my father was telling me 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.929
 but with tonight in this cabin to facilitate peeling 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.270
 why lock them in a bag 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.360
 plastic explosive 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.850
 to work at 200 degrees 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.580
 must still wait a quarter of an hour but now five years that the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.460
 situation is more than 30% 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.660
 % for non-smokers 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.940
 what to do simple 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.260
 and she proved it again 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.410
 this same ticket 3 80 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.660
 what is the return 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.150
 the advantage of this technique is that we will really have a poivrot then 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.600
 Photo 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.659
 and that will allow us to make such elements 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.760
 because we can not do better 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.390
 as soon as I did not have much stronger spent three hours to turn them 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.970
 inch 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.970
 like his father and his three children 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.170
 most affected 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 so that's ours 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.700
 it's really perfect 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.169
 this ad falls that's what you want to taste was 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.840
 after that the retail separating them from forgotten command 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.580
 according to the constant exchange rate
