00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
click login and it will go into the main

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.040 
click login and it will go into the main
menu<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:18.029> all<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.420> choices<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
menu where you see all the choices the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410 
menu where you see all the choices the
user<00:00:19.230> has<00:00:19.400> here<00:00:20.400> let's<00:00:20.640> say<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.029> display<00:00:21.390> our

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
user has here let's say we display our

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.560 
user has here let's say we display our
meters<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.680> asks<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.640> list<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.420> all

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
meters so it asks for the list of all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.380 
meters so it asks for the list of all
the<00:00:24.810> mirrors<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.320> would<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.730> if<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the mirrors I would have if you have the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.720 
the mirrors I would have if you have the
readwrite<00:00:27.750> access<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> certain<00:00:29.310> meter<00:00:29.460> you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
readwrite access to a certain meter you

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089 
readwrite access to a certain meter you
have<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.179> edit<00:00:30.660> icon<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.320> which<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
have this edit icon right here which you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
have this edit icon right here which you
can<00:00:32.250> click<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.759> then<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.420> rename<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
can click and then you can rename the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.069 
can click and then you can rename the
meter<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.649> change<00:00:35.370> its<00:00:35.730> location<00:00:36.270> providing

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
meter or change its location providing

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.930 
meter or change its location providing
like<00:00:37.380> longitude<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:37.980> latitude<00:00:38.040> yourself<00:00:38.730> or

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
like longitude and latitude yourself or

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.369 
like longitude and latitude yourself or
just<00:00:38.969> selecting<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> map<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.320> here

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
just selecting it on the map right here

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.479 
just selecting it on the map right here
then<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.180> also<00:00:42.860> let's<00:00:43.860> come<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> fun

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
then you can also let's come to the fun

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
then you can also let's come to the fun
part<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.239> select<00:00:45.450> several<00:00:46.370> meters<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
part we can select several meters and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.450 
part we can select several meters and
then<00:00:48.149> say<00:00:48.420> generate<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> tree<00:00:49.469> map<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.250> what

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
then say generate a tree map so what

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
then say generate a tree map so what
will<00:00:50.550> happen<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.059> will<00:00:51.090> show<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> something

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
will happen it will show you something

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.459 
will happen it will show you something
like<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.590> where<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.879> relative

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
like this where this is a relative

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
like this where this is a relative
energy<00:00:55.469> consumption<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> those<00:00:56.399> three<00:00:56.789> meters

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
energy consumption of those three meters

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.229 
energy consumption of those three meters
here<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.140> top<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.309> scroller<00:00:59.760> where

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
here on top you have a scroller where

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479 
here on top you have a scroller where
you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.989> select<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.559> time<00:01:01.859> interval<00:01:02.160> from

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
you can select the time interval from

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
you can select the time interval from
which<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.180> select<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.080> data<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.589> for

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which you can select the data so for

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710 
which you can select the data so for
instance<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.280> i<00:01:05.430> want<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:06.030> only<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.510> week

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
instance if i want to have only one week

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.039 
instance if i want to have only one week
data<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> will<00:01:09.390> give<00:01:09.990> me

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
data so like that and it will give me

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
data so like that and it will give me
well<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.220> looks<00:01:11.250> exactly<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.820> same<00:01:11.909> because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
well it looks exactly the same because

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.130 
well it looks exactly the same because
relatively<00:01:12.810> day<00:01:13.200> looks<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> same<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.900> if<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
relatively day looks the same but if you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.740 
relatively day looks the same but if you
want<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.770> it'll<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> more<00:01:17.670> etc<00:01:17.820> etc<00:01:18.180> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
want more it'll go to more etc etc and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
want more it'll go to more etc etc and
now<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.860> else<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> can

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
now what else you can do is you can

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.880 
now what else you can do is you can
select<00:01:21.330> several<00:01:21.799> meters<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.700> about<00:01:24.630> i

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
select several meters and say about i

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.560 
select several meters and say about i
look<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.430> graph<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.619> it'll<00:01:28.619> generate<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
look at on the graph so it'll generate a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.819 
look at on the graph so it'll generate a
graph<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.079> now<00:01:31.110> looks<00:01:31.439> messy<00:01:31.650> this

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
graph which right now looks messy this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
graph which right now looks messy this
is<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.400> photograph<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
is just the time photograph to make it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.719 
is just the time photograph to make it
look<00:01:34.200> prettier<00:01:34.650> how<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.549> have

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
look prettier how about this will have

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.810 
look prettier how about this will have
only<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.240> week<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.720> data<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.670> also

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
only one week of data here you can also

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.359 
only one week of data here you can also
change<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.009> settings

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
change the you can go to the settings

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
change the you can go to the settings
and<00:01:41.520> change<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.909> spinner<00:01:42.150> control<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> one

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and change the spinner control the one

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780 
and change the spinner control the one
that<00:01:42.990> i<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.320> top<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> date<00:01:44.610> picker

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that i was on top to the date picker

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
that i was on top to the date picker
which<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.290> looks<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
which is more like which looks like a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.399 
which is more like which looks like a
calendar<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:48.090> set<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.540> start<00:01:49.200> date<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
calendar we can set the start date and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.940 
calendar we can set the start date and
end<00:01:49.950> date<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.030> want<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.899> instance<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
end date so if you want for instance to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.670 
end date so if you want for instance to
see<00:01:53.159> even<00:01:53.579> less<00:01:53.610> data<00:01:54.140> we<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.590> instance

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
see even less data we can for instance

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.270 
see even less data we can for instance
go<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> last<00:01:57.090> week<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.630> something<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.280> check

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
go to last week or something and check

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.730 
go to last week or something and check
on<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> this<00:02:00.600> time<00:02:00.840> period<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.590> see

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
on the this time period which you see

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.980 
on the this time period which you see
has<00:02:02.040> unless<00:02:02.430> data<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.329> whole<00:02:03.540> thing<00:02:03.570> runs

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
has unless data so the whole thing runs

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.859 
has unless data so the whole thing runs
over<00:02:04.229> ipv6<00:02:04.759> well<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.090> fact<00:02:06.240> ballistics<00:02:06.719> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
over ipv6 well in fact ballistics is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.809 
over ipv6 well in fact ballistics is
available<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.009> you're<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.250> Wi-Fi<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
available so if you're on Wi-Fi and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.730 
available so if you're on Wi-Fi and
there's<00:02:09.030> ipv6<00:02:09.450> address<00:02:09.899> then

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
there's ipv6 address then

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.550 
there's ipv6 address then
run<00:02:10.950> over<00:02:11.190> IP<00:02:11.430> 06<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.210> can<00:02:12.360> also<00:02:12.480> use<00:02:12.840> mdns<00:02:13.350> in

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
run over IP 06 you can also use mdns in

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.210 
run over IP 06 you can also use mdns in
order<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.540> order<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:16.040> find<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
order to so in order to find the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.220 
order to so in order to find the
collectors<00:02:18.090> which<00:02:18.480> are<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:18.870> your<00:02:19.020> local

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
collectors which are in your local

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.470 
collectors which are in your local
network<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.370> connect<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.330> them

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
network and then you can connect to them

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
network and then you can connect to them
and<00:02:22.850> access<00:02:23.850> request<00:02:24.390> access<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:25.110> permissions

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and access request access of permissions

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
and access request access of permissions
and<00:02:26.220> then<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.640> are<00:02:26.760> random<00:02:27.210> texts<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.720> can

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
and then if you are random texts you can

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.630 
and then if you are random texts you can
do<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.410> meters<00:02:28.860> as<00:02:29.010> there<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:29.280> well<00:02:29.460> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
do the meters as there as well and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.510 
do the meters as there as well and
that's<00:02:29.820> what's<00:02:30.240> app
