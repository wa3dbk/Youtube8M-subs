00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
make inference to what we think they're

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.460 
make inference to what we think they're
going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.300> based<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.779> grantham<00:00:19.170> didn't

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
going to do based on my grantham didn't

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.950

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.660 
in what they do well so we're trying to
notice<00:00:22.350> some<00:00:22.500> guessing<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.279> there<00:00:23.490> for

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
notice some guessing going on there for

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.220 
notice some guessing going on there for
sure<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.029> obviously<00:00:24.210> coach<00:00:24.960> does<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
sure and then obviously coach does a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.130 
sure and then obviously coach does a
great<00:00:25.439> job<00:00:26.269> out<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> three<00:00:27.660> four<00:00:27.930> and

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
subsided and

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.910 
subsided and
I'll<00:01:32.940> kind<00:01:33.120> of<00:01:33.210> MIT<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.480> late<00:01:33.630> season<00:01:33.920> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I'll kind of MIT the late season you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
I'll kind of MIT the late season you
know<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.220> Shawn<00:01:35.430> running<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.540> ov<00:01:37.260> back

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

Tucker<00:02:07.280> will<00:02:07.640> get<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:07.820> fullback<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:08.390> how<00:02:08.570> much

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
Tucker will get a fullback and how much

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.760 
Tucker will get a fullback and how much
at<00:02:09.760> my<00:02:10.760> back<00:02:10.970> well<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.720> think<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.080> order<00:02:12.470> for

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
at my back well I think the order for

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.410 
at my back well I think the order for
him<00:02:12.890> will<00:02:13.070> be<00:02:13.160> fullback<00:02:13.550> special<00:02:13.970> teams<00:02:14.180> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
him will be fullback special teams and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.370 
him will be fullback special teams and
then<00:02:14.510> defense<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.200> think<00:02:15.490> we<00:02:16.490> can

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
then defense so I think we can

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.130 
then defense so I think we can
definitely<00:02:18.380> see<00:02:18.770> action<00:02:19.960> offense<00:02:20.960> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
definitely see action offense and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.100 
definitely see action offense and
special<00:02:21.440> teams<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.330> he's<00:02:23.330> close<00:02:23.540> on<00:02:23.750> defense

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
special teams and he's close on defense

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.450 
special teams and he's close on defense

our<00:04:15.640> culture<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.269> it's<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.470> lot<00:04:17.799> easier<00:04:17.830> when

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
our culture and it's a lot easier when

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.220 
our culture and it's a lot easier when
the<00:04:18.370> seniors<00:04:18.670> teach<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.090> freshmen<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:20.140> know
