Neil<00:00:36.190> blender<00:00:36.460> best<00:00:36.640> inverts<00:00:37.059> ever<00:00:37.800> that's<00:00:38.800> my

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
Neil blender best inverts ever that's my

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.830 
Neil blender best inverts ever that's my
inspiration<00:00:39.309> so<00:00:40.239> I<00:00:40.269> tend<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.600> think<00:00:40.720> of

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
inspiration so I tend to think of

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.200 
inspiration so I tend to think of
inverts<00:00:41.260> as<00:00:41.440> an<00:00:41.830> aerial<00:00:42.280> dirt<00:00:42.580> and<00:00:42.879> that's<00:00:42.970> a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
inverts as an aerial dirt and that's a

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.540 
inverts as an aerial dirt and that's a
bird<00:00:43.540> as<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.690> hand<00:00:44.080> down<00:00:44.290> slide<00:00:44.920> you<00:00:45.250> just<00:00:45.280> kind

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
bird as a hand down slide you just kind

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.100 
bird as a hand down slide you just kind
of<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:46.059> can<00:00:46.180> do<00:00:46.269> it<00:00:46.330> on<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.449> bank<00:00:46.720> you<00:00:46.870> do<00:00:46.989> one

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
of you can do it on a bank you do one

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.540 
of you can do it on a bank you do one
flat<00:00:47.350> ground<00:00:47.590> just<00:00:47.739> put<00:00:47.890> your<00:00:48.010> hand<00:00:48.160> down<00:00:48.250> and

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
flat ground just put your hand down and

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.200 
flat ground just put your hand down and
turn<00:00:48.870> usually<00:00:49.870> back<00:00:50.019> side<00:00:50.970> so<00:00:51.970> that<00:00:52.120> your

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
turn usually back side so that your

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.880 
turn usually back side so that your
board<00:00:52.420> comes<00:00:52.629> back<00:00:52.809> towards<00:00:53.170> your<00:00:53.260> hand<00:00:53.440> so

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
board comes back towards your hand so

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.439 
board comes back towards your hand so
it's<00:00:54.100> easiest<00:00:54.400> on<00:00:54.580> a<00:00:54.610> bank<00:00:54.909> or<00:00:55.150> a<00:00:55.180> small

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
it's easiest on a bank or a small

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.759 
it's easiest on a bank or a small
transition<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.080> kind<00:00:56.229> of<00:00:56.260> get<00:00:56.409> used<00:00:56.559> to<00:00:56.680> the

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
transition to kind of get used to the

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.969 
transition to kind of get used to the
feeling<00:00:56.979> and<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:59.019> work<00:00:59.170> your<00:00:59.320> way<00:00:59.379> up<00:00:59.470> it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
feeling and as you work your way up it

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.250 
feeling and as you work your way up it
just<00:01:00.190> becomes<00:01:00.519> more<00:01:00.610> upside<00:01:01.180> down<00:01:01.420> but<00:01:01.989> pretty

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
just becomes more upside down but pretty

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.590 
just becomes more upside down but pretty
much<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.530> same<00:01:02.710> motion<00:01:03.479> eventually<00:01:04.479> as<00:01:04.570> you

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
much the same motion eventually as you

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.170 
much the same motion eventually as you
pull<00:01:04.809> off<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:04.960> coping<00:01:05.440> it's<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:06.119> kind<00:01:07.119> of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
pull off the coping it's a kind of

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.880 
pull off the coping it's a kind of
different<00:01:07.390> experience<00:01:07.960> but<00:01:08.080> it's<00:01:08.229> all<00:01:08.650> based

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
different experience but it's all based

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.560 
different experience but it's all based
on<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.159> principle<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.640> getting<00:01:10.360> used<00:01:10.479> to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
on the principle of getting used to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.880 
on the principle of getting used to
putting<00:01:10.780> your<00:01:10.869> hand<00:01:11.080> down<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.590> make<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.710> an

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
putting your hand down and make it an

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.560 
putting your hand down and make it an
arc<00:01:12.070> around<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.610> hand<00:01:12.820> on<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.210> pivot<00:01:13.420> point

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
arc around that hand on that pivot point

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.510 
arc around that hand on that pivot point
you're<00:01:14.229> going<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.409> work<00:01:14.530> your<00:01:14.680> way<00:01:14.770> up<00:01:14.950> slowly

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
you're going to work your way up slowly

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.340 
you're going to work your way up slowly
from<00:01:16.150> somewhere<00:01:16.720> about<00:01:16.840> halfway<00:01:16.990> up<00:01:17.260> the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
from somewhere about halfway up the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.690 
from somewhere about halfway up the
transition<00:01:17.830> just<00:01:17.860> get<00:01:18.220> putting<00:01:18.490> your<00:01:18.580> hand

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
transition just get putting your hand

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.010 
transition just get putting your hand
down<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:18.880> getting<00:01:19.060> used<00:01:19.299> to<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.720> as<00:01:19.869> you

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
down and getting used to it and as you

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.700 
down and getting used to it and as you
get<00:01:20.979> closer<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.549> top<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.930> idea<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.470> to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
get closer to the top the idea is to

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.410 
get closer to the top the idea is to
reach<00:01:23.920> down<00:01:24.250> for<00:01:24.490> your<00:01:24.550> board<00:01:24.820> at<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.150> same

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
reach down for your board at the same

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.480 
reach down for your board at the same
time<00:01:25.810> as<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.380> reach<00:01:26.620> down<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.130> plant<00:01:27.370> your

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
time as you reach down to plant your

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.110 
time as you reach down to plant your
hand<00:01:27.760> and<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:29.410> pop<00:01:29.680> off<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.040> coping<00:01:30.430> put<00:01:30.970> your

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
hand and you pop off the coping put your

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.780 
hand and you pop off the coping put your
hand<00:01:31.300> on<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.420> coping<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.340> point<00:01:33.340> your<00:01:33.430> board

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
hand on the coping and point your board

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.900 
hand on the coping and point your board
back<00:01:34.000> down<00:01:34.300> at<00:01:34.540> your<00:01:34.840> hand<00:01:35.670> basically<00:01:36.670> it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
back down at your hand basically it's

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.820 
back down at your hand basically it's
like<00:01:37.090> throwing<00:01:37.630> your<00:01:37.900> weight<00:01:38.110> back<00:01:38.320> in<00:01:38.530> over

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
like throwing your weight back in over

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.560 
like throwing your weight back in over
the<00:01:38.860> board<00:01:39.190> if<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.820> slo-mo<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.360> invert

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
the board if you slo-mo and invert

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.610 
the board if you slo-mo and invert
you'll<00:01:40.690> actually<00:01:40.840> see<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.380> there's<00:01:41.560> a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
you'll actually see that there's a

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.440 
you'll actually see that there's a
moment<00:01:42.160> we<00:01:42.250> were<00:01:42.310> doing<00:01:42.520> like<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.730> mute<00:01:43.030> air<00:01:43.210> as

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
moment we were doing like a mute air as

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.570 
moment we were doing like a mute air as
you<00:01:43.600> come<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:43.900> for<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.140> landing<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:45.340> thing<00:01:45.520> to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
you come in for the landing one thing to

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.920 
you come in for the landing one thing to
remember<00:01:45.640> about<00:01:45.850> inverts<00:01:46.330> especially<00:01:46.810> when

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
remember about inverts especially when

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.540 
remember about inverts especially when
you're<00:01:47.020> trying<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.260> get<00:01:47.320> them<00:01:47.440> on<00:01:47.560> top<00:01:47.800> stalled

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
you're trying to get them on top stalled

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.280 
you're trying to get them on top stalled
out<00:01:48.760> is<00:01:49.030> it's<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.420> momentum<00:01:49.870> trick<00:01:50.080> it's<00:01:50.230> not

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
out is it's a momentum trick it's not

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.680 
out is it's a momentum trick it's not
about<00:01:50.530> how<00:01:50.680> strong<00:01:50.710> your<00:01:51.250> arm<00:01:51.400> is<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:52.570> don't

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
about how strong your arm is you don't

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.330 
about how strong your arm is you don't
want<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.870> go<00:01:52.960> too<00:01:53.020> fast<00:01:53.380> or<00:01:53.710> too<00:01:53.770> slow<00:01:53.890> you're

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
want to go too fast or too slow you're

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.890 
want to go too fast or too slow you're
not<00:01:54.460> going<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:54.670> push<00:01:55.000> up<00:01:55.210> into<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.510> invert<00:01:55.750> and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
not going to push up into the invert and

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.720 
not going to push up into the invert and
if<00:01:56.200> you're<00:01:56.320> going<00:01:56.440> too<00:01:56.680> fast<00:01:56.890> you're<00:01:57.460> never

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
if you're going too fast you're never

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.770 
if you're going too fast you're never
going<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:57.940> control<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> speed<00:01:58.600> you're<00:01:58.750> going

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
going to control the speed you're going

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.649 
going to control the speed you're going
to<00:01:58.960> flip<00:01:59.140> over<00:01:59.260> or<00:01:59.590> miss<00:02:00.430> your<00:02:00.580> hand<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.510> it's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
to flip over or miss your hand so it's

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.120 
to flip over or miss your hand so it's
about<00:02:01.780> getting<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.140> right<00:02:02.350> pump<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.950> get<00:02:03.070> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
about getting the right pump to get the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.700 
about getting the right pump to get the
exact<00:02:03.490> right<00:02:03.670> speed<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.120> push<00:02:04.300> your<00:02:04.450> arm<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:05.560> a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
exact right speed to push your arm in a

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.860 
exact right speed to push your arm in a
lock<00:02:05.950> position<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:07.120> push<00:02:07.330> your<00:02:07.450> weight<00:02:07.659> up

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
lock position and push your weight up

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.670 
lock position and push your weight up
over<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.349> deck<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:10.450> long<00:02:10.690> enough<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:11.200> get<00:02:11.620> a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
over the deck just long enough to get a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.740 
over the deck just long enough to get a
proper<00:02:12.069> stall<00:02:12.310> invert<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.819> then<00:02:12.970> fall<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.629> on

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
proper stall invert and then fall in on

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.790 
proper stall invert and then fall in on
that<00:02:13.870> arm<00:02:14.080> push<00:02:14.590> away<00:02:14.739> from<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.129> wall

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
that arm push away from the wall

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.580 
that arm push away from the wall
I<00:02:15.830> you're<00:02:16.310> planning<00:02:16.700> hand<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.120> pull<00:02:17.840> hard<00:02:18.290> on

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
I you're planning hand and pull hard on

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.920 
I you're planning hand and pull hard on
the<00:02:18.650> board<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.160> your<00:02:19.370> you're<00:02:20.330> grabbing<00:02:20.720> hand

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
the board with your you're grabbing hand

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.570 
the board with your you're grabbing hand
so<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.470> learn<00:02:21.680> invert<00:02:22.040> it's<00:02:22.220> going<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.430> take<00:02:22.550> a

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
so to learn invert it's going to take a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.100 
so to learn invert it's going to take a
million<00:02:22.940> bales<00:02:23.150> at<00:02:23.390> least<00:02:23.540> for<00:02:23.690> most<00:02:23.810> people

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
million bales at least for most people

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.720 
million bales at least for most people
you<00:02:24.230> can't<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.070> go<00:02:25.160> up<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.400> go<00:02:25.490> I'm<00:02:25.550> going<00:02:25.670> to

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you can't just go up a go I'm going to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.010 
you can't just go up a go I'm going to
do<00:02:25.790> an<00:02:25.880> invert<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.240> throw<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.720> land<00:02:26.870> it

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
do an invert and throw it in and land it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.450 
do an invert and throw it in and land it
it<00:02:27.140> takes<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.620> while<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.800> get<00:02:28.010> used<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.400> you

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
it takes a while to get used to it you

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.640 
it takes a while to get used to it you
got<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.640> be<00:02:28.700> willing<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.120> try<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> bunch<00:02:30.140> all<00:02:30.620> a
