00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.819
 somehow found solaris how 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.740
 plan the mountains don't know yes but to 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.290
 Unfortunately, not on standard wheels 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.010
 the car here we are 17 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.519
 wheels 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:19.500
 205 by 40 r17 wide enough 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:28.170
 roughly standard black 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 certainly looks under the hood under 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:39.510
 the hood here we have is standard 16 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.670
 You see here for a long time did not open to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.780
 the fruit that is the killer that is in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.300
 the catalyst is in place everything is in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 Basically, too, the usual standard 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.559
 Standard car but Andrew, let's all 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.550
 worked you look hope for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.289
 you voted 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.289
 I think you should not fail 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.450

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.650
 two people here I am the second in the prior 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.650
 let's start the motors 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.110
 politics I'm still in shock I can't yet 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.970
 I remember now let's try 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:11.460
 loaded we will do perry check in 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.440
 without passengers what are you doing cars 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.190
 Parma turned on you soon need to go 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.650
 turn off the headlights 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:24.120
 This is the secret of Dmitry Bragin before his way 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.120
 let's grish out a disassembled race of communication with 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:38.950
 let's say that he is also a couple leading 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:51.989
 just let it go all the way to 12 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:51.989
 let's get to the count of three blocks 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.590
 super Andrew about the fact that you are well done 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.879

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.800
 the food is neater there 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.620
 although I donâ€™t have to say 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.739
 due that solaris 18 wheels 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.959
 Well, put the body of the case 2, he soon 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:06.030
