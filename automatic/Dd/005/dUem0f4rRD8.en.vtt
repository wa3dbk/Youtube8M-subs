00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
here bedliner material it's a slight

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.589 
here bedliner material it's a slight
difference<00:00:24.740> again<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.310> enough<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.390> make<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
difference again is it enough to make a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.209 
difference again is it enough to make a
difference<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.289> don't<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:30.800> but<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.759> gun<00:00:33.059> was

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
difference I don't know but the gun was

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.250 
difference I don't know but the gun was
with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> lid<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.059> hose<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.570> everything<00:00:36.960> for

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
with the lid the hose and everything for

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.430 
with the lid the hose and everything for
it<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.829> 60<00:00:38.190> bucks<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.290> use<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it it was 60 bucks and I think I use a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.100 
it it was 60 bucks and I think I use a
coupon<00:00:40.710> code<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.670> Pep<00:00:42.300> Boys<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.930> got<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
coupon code from Pep Boys and I got a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.319 
coupon code from Pep Boys and I got a
deal<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.370> think<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> ended<00:00:45.270> up

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
deal on it and so I think I ended up

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.000 
deal on it and so I think I ended up
paying<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.690> 40<00:00:46.079> bucks<00:00:46.230> board<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.649> something

video description so you guys can order

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.289 
video description so you guys can order
it<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.880> want<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:08.510> now<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:10.400> run<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:13.049> gun<00:01:14.299> up

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it if you want it now I run the gun up

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:24.710 
it if you want it now I run the gun up
40<00:01:15.689> psi<00:01:17.570> residual<00:01:18.570> pressure

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.180 

start<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:26.210> 60<00:01:29.750> residual<00:01:30.750> means<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.200> after

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
start at 60 residual means that's after

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.430 
start at 60 residual means that's after
the<00:01:32.610> nozzle<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.690> what's<00:01:33.990> left<00:01:34.260> in<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
the nozzle is going what's left in the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:02:02.510 
the nozzle is going what's left in the
line<00:01:34.680> so<00:02:00.770> basically<00:02:01.770> what<00:02:01.980> that<00:02:02.010> means<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.370> if

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
line so basically what that means is if

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.730 
line so basically what that means is if
you<00:02:02.640> say<00:02:02.880> you're<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.090> your<00:02:03.480> regulator<00:02:04.020> at<00:02:04.290> 40

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
you say you're not your regulator at 40

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.180 
you say you're not your regulator at 40
and<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.960> open<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.080> trigger<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:08.040> not

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and you open your trigger you're not

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.919 
and you open your trigger you're not
gonna<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.490> 40<00:02:08.790> at<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> tip<00:02:09.240> you're<00:02:09.510> gonna<00:02:09.660> get

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
gonna get 40 at the tip you're gonna get

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.500 
gonna get 40 at the tip you're gonna get
maybe<00:02:10.320> 30<00:02:11.100> 25<00:02:12.030> psi<00:02:12.570> so<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> run<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.180> whatever<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
maybe 30 25 psi so I run it whatever it

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:27.110 
maybe 30 25 psi so I run it whatever it
takes

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440 

to<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.750> me<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.440> 40<00:02:28.799> psi

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.740 

let's<00:02:31.599> all<00:02:32.020> set<00:02:32.260> up

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
let's all set up

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
let's all set up
they<00:02:34.350> want<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> go<00:02:34.950> down<00:02:35.700> into<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.120> can

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.800 

so<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.880> feel<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:41.170> host<00:02:41.800> hit<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.610> bottom<00:02:42.970> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
so you feel the host hit the bottom and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.449 
so you feel the host hit the bottom and
then<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.960> lift<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.410> up<00:02:45.150> about<00:02:46.150> half<00:02:46.900> an<00:02:47.140> inch

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
then I lift it up about half an inch

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.780 
then I lift it up about half an inch
that's<00:02:48.879> our<00:02:49.060> way<00:02:49.269> when

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.610 

I<00:02:52.819> still<00:02:53.239> got<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.810> still<00:02:54.050> picking<00:02:54.349> up<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
I still got it still picking up the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.830 
I still got it still picking up the
truth

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
