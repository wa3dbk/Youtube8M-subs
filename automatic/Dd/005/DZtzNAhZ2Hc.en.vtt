get<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.780> some<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> new<00:01:55.200> field<00:01:55.439> runners

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
get to see some of the new field runners

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
get to see some of the new field runners
hopefully<00:01:56.189> you'll<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> hear<00:01:56.610> some<00:01:57.000> of

your side effects so this click start
now<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.880> doesn't<00:02:00.210> load<00:02:00.329> though<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
now it doesn't load though because it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130 
now it doesn't load though because it
does<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.590> lot<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.009> load<00:02:02.780> via<00:02:03.780> sound

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
does have a lot more to load via sound

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.889 
does have a lot more to load via sound
effects<00:02:04.439> better<00:02:04.799> graphics<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.579> new<00:02:05.759> map<00:02:05.969> so

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
effects better graphics and new map so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.510 
effects better graphics and new map so
listen<00:02:07.170> I'll<00:02:07.530> buy<00:02:07.680> something

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
