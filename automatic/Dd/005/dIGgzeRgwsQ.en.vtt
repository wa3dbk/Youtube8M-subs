every now and then you do a project

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.100 
every now and then you do a project
where<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> pieces<00:00:56.059> come<00:00:57.059> together<00:00:57.239> every

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.960 
the cylinders fired at the same time
this<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> team<00:01:04.500> effort<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> put

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
this was a team effort I got to put

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149 
this was a team effort I got to put
pencil<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> paper<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.990> every<00:01:07.409> single<00:01:07.650> person

here left their thumbprint on the music
for<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.390> game<00:01:12.470> one<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.649> things<00:01:13.890> Greg's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
for this game one of the things Greg's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.180 
for this game one of the things Greg's
done<00:01:14.690> in<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.380> games<00:01:16.530> he's<00:01:16.800> worked<00:01:17.040> on

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
done in the two games he's worked on

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.830 
done in the two games he's worked on
with<00:01:17.340> us<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.729> he's<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.180> changed<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> way

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
with us is he's actually changed the way

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.620 
with us is he's actually changed the way
we<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.290> about<00:01:19.550> writing<00:01:20.550> music<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.420> games

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
we think about writing music for games

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.389 
we think about writing music for games
when<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.259> commissioned<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.920> piece<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> music

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
when we commissioned a piece of music

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.120 
when we commissioned a piece of music
for<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> game<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> brick<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> piece

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
for a game we get a brick we get a piece

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.300 
for a game we get a brick we get a piece
of<00:01:26.280> music<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.479> non-stop<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.590> what

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of music that's just non-stop and what

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.639 
of music that's just non-stop and what
Greg<00:01:29.580> does<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.210> he<00:01:30.539> breaks<00:01:30.780> his<00:01:30.929> music<00:01:31.289> up<00:01:31.440> so

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
Greg does is he breaks his music up so

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.469 
Greg does is he breaks his music up so
he<00:01:31.740> writes<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.100> sections<00:01:32.550> and<00:01:32.789> we<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> all

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
he writes in sections and we have all

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.210 
he writes in sections and we have all
these<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.810> cool<00:01:33.990> pauses<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.590> stuff<00:01:34.830> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
these like cool pauses and stuff the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.190 
these like cool pauses and stuff the
more<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:36.030> drop<00:01:36.330> those<00:01:36.570> things<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.020> game

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
more we drop those things in the game

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
more we drop those things in the game
and<00:01:37.530> saw<00:01:37.679> them<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.950> action<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.580> was<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.850> like

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and saw them in action it was just like

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:54.140 
and saw them in action it was just like
a<00:01:39.179> constant<00:01:39.690> happy<00:01:40.020> accident

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.110 

I<00:01:54.650> mean<00:01:55.650> that's<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:56.010> really<00:01:56.370> unique<00:01:56.580> thing

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
I mean that's the really unique thing

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.720 
I mean that's the really unique thing
about<00:01:57.150> scoring<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.110> video<00:01:58.410> games<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:59.310> films

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
about scoring for video games with films

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.460 
about scoring for video games with films
that<00:01:59.880> might<00:02:00.120> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.870> might<00:02:01.050> be<00:02:01.080> looking

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
that might you know you might be looking

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.830 
that might you know you might be looking
at<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> rough<00:02:02.250> cut<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:02.580> you'll<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> final

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
at a rough cut and you'll get the final

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
at a rough cut and you'll get the final
hopefully<00:02:04.320> by<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.040> scoring<00:02:05.460> but

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
hopefully by the time you're scoring but

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.980 
hopefully by the time you're scoring but
still<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.240> some<00:02:06.450> sense<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:06.840> what

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
still you have some sense of what

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
still you have some sense of what
storyline<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.740> or<00:02:07.890> where<00:02:08.009> things<00:02:08.160> are<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.580> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
storyline is or where things are going I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.660 
storyline is or where things are going I
mean<00:02:09.240> you're<00:02:09.360> pretty<00:02:09.570> much<00:02:09.750> working<00:02:10.110> blind

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
mean you're pretty much working blind

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.890 
mean you're pretty much working blind
it's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.030> plus<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> minus

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it's a it's a plus and a minus

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.420 
it's a it's a plus and a minus
yeah<00:02:13.020> it's<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.410> plus<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.220> write

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
yeah it's a plus because you can write

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.310 
yeah it's a plus because you can write
anything<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.880> want<00:02:15.210> it's<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.450> -<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.020> you

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
anything you want it's so - because you

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.890 
anything you want it's so - because you
wish<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.680> had<00:02:17.120> something<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.510> double<00:02:18.870> check

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
wish you had something to double check

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.750 
wish you had something to double check
yourself<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.560> say<00:02:19.710> am<00:02:20.100> i<00:02:20.220> doing<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> right

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
yourself and say am i doing the right

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360 
yourself and say am i doing the right
thing<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.440> write<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.160> you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
thing and so you just write it and you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.830 
thing and so you just write it and you
hope<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.880> right<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.690> game

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
hope that it's right for what the game

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.170 
hope that it's right for what the game
is<00:02:24.900> ultimately<00:02:25.500> going<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.800> look<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
is ultimately going to look like but you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.699 
is ultimately going to look like but you
don't<00:02:27.209> know

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
don't know

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.640 
don't know
and<00:02:29.359> serendipity<00:02:30.359> sometimes<00:02:31.109> takes<00:02:31.469> its

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and serendipity sometimes takes its

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:47.640 
and serendipity sometimes takes its
course

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.350 

we<00:02:48.650> had<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> are<00:02:49.250> who<00:02:49.400> player<00:02:49.610> named<00:02:49.790> Karen<00:02:50.150> Han

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
we had a are who player named Karen Han

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.449 
we had a are who player named Karen Han
whose<00:02:50.770> phenomenal<00:02:51.790> work<00:02:52.790> on<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.060> score<00:02:54.459> she

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
whose phenomenal work on the score she

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.730 
whose phenomenal work on the score she
makes<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.850> sound<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.300> smooth<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:57.290> easy<00:02:57.560> and

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
makes it sound so smooth and so easy and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.860 
makes it sound so smooth and so easy and
it's<00:02:58.100> not<00:02:58.190> she<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.150> makes<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.510> sound<00:02:59.720> that

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
it's not she just makes it sound that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:14.650 
it's not she just makes it sound that
way

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.930 

in<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:15.260> weird<00:03:15.530> way<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:16.100> almost<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.670> like<00:03:16.700> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
I suppose to sound like the strings that

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.900 
I suppose to sound like the strings that
are<00:03:59.630> out<00:03:59.780> in<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.020> main<00:04:00.230> room<00:04:00.580> it's<00:04:01.580> just<00:04:01.790> a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
separation with everything and I think

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.600 
separation with everything and I think
video<00:04:08.239> games<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.720> little<00:04:08.930> different<00:04:09.320> than

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
video games a little different than

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.900 
video games a little different than
scoring<00:04:10.610> for<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.180> film<00:04:11.810> in<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:13.130> want<00:04:13.550> to

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
scoring for a film in that you want to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.140 
scoring for a film in that you want to
be<00:04:14.480> able<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:15.440> have<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:15.920> lot<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.370> flexibility

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
be able to have a lot of flexibility

the end product eventually is going to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
to be able to be separated enough so

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.970 
to be able to be separated enough so
when<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.870> goes<00:04:27.020> into<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.350> game<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.800> can

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
when it goes into the game you can

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.100 
when it goes into the game you can
separate<00:04:28.370> out<00:04:28.430> multiple<00:04:29.390> percussion<00:04:29.900> layers

and multiple brass layers so when we're

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
looking at the end game it's a kind of a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.830 
looking at the end game it's a kind of a
daunting<00:04:39.290> process<00:04:39.860> but<00:04:40.520> once<00:04:40.820> once<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.660> get

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
daunting process but once once you get

one cue down and you realize this is how
every<00:04:44.330> other<00:04:44.450> cue<00:04:44.750> is<00:04:44.870> gonna<00:04:45.050> follow<00:04:45.260> you<00:04:45.500> just

every other cue is gonna follow you just

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.890 
every other cue is gonna follow you just
you<00:04:46.729> just<00:04:46.790> start<00:04:47.150> going<00:04:47.360> from<00:04:47.479> there

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
you just start going from there

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.750 
you just start going from there
well<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:48.860> start<00:04:49.220> with<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.370> game<00:04:49.490> there's

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
well I start with the game there's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.460 
well I start with the game there's
literally<00:04:50.270> it's<00:04:50.600> very<00:04:50.870> quiet

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
usually just gunfire I usually start out

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.219 
usually just gunfire I usually start out
with<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.700> completely<00:04:56.240> blank<00:04:56.300> canvas<00:04:56.960> in<00:04:57.140> a

Greg's music and I just play through
them<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:03.440> think<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.800> myself<00:05:03.950> having<00:05:04.790> played

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
them and I think to myself having played

them and I think to myself having played
through<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:06.320> entire<00:05:06.350> game<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:07.130> very<00:05:07.520> early

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
through the entire game and very early

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.000 
through the entire game and very early
stages<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.390> kind<00:05:09.020> of<00:05:09.050> block<00:05:09.320> out<00:05:09.470> in<00:05:09.680> my<00:05:09.800> mind

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
stages I kind of block out in my mind

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.860
