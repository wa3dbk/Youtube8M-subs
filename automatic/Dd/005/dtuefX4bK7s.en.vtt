 unblock or revive our 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.550
 device itself this is when 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.440
 our device does not go beyond the 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.400
 yin and stays there permanently 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.430
 watch out 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.860
 to fix this is simple the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.630
 only requirements to have is to have 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.360

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.329
 have an internet connection count on 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.970

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.769
 program called mobile engine your portal

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.269
 we give yes 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.800
 we wait for the installation 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.750
 installation is very fast once 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.200
 installed the program will open 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.200
 automatically 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.290

 close that transparent curtain is the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.090
 program interface before proceeding 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.620
 install the drivers of our 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.320
 device if they already have them installed 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.520
 they skip this step we are going to click 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.280
 in 'I install driver 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.100
 and we will look for our model as 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.760

 download the driver 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.869
 once it has been downloaded 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.600
 automatically we will get the window of 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.950
 the installation of the drivers 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.080
 we select our language in my case 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.080
 it's spanish we give you next 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.430
 we give in next and we wait for 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.430
 install 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.810
 has already been installed correctly 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.940
 we accept 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.810
 and we opened the program again you 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.239
 we give in ok 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.860
 once installed the drivers now 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.530
 let's proceed to connect the cell phone to 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.890
 the pc as follows with the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.349
 cell phone battery inserted 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.840
 to press the volume key more and not 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.640
 we're going to let go and we're going to connect the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.650
 usb cable to the cell phone and the pc 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 remember not to release the button 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.000
 volume + 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.239
 and we wait for the pc to recognize us the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.459
 cellular is going to have to appear a 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.220
 image like this once it disappears 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.080
 image we can release the volume 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.820
 As you can see here, it's already 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.660
 recognizing the cell phone and I 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.820
 It is recognized that the jeep of 768 g les 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.580
 can leave two options the first one is 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.230
 that this message does not come out of you 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.570
 they have to install again the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.920
 drivers if you do not get them pictures 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.260
 that have latest version of the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.780
 controllers if you get them to come out is 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.610
 that there is a new update and if not 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.380
 we update them to the latest version not 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.620
 we will be able to continue to the next 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.520
 I go through it like in my case we are going to 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.620
 click ok 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.900
 As you can see , two of 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.600
 the drivers and how I commented to my 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.760
 installed version is 3.08 which makes 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.340
 we settled in and we needed 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.220
 now install the version 3 points 10 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.140
 which is the latest version 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.350
 then another version will appear that does not 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.700
 matter simply we give next and 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.700
 we wait for them to install 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.280
 as you can see it has already been installed 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.100
 we give in finalize 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.360
 as you can see here you are already trying 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.560
 read with the cell phone 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.560
 is connecting it 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.460
 and the model is no longer the same as they can 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.850
 see never left the message to install 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.860
 the controllers well we continue the 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.770
 next step let's go to features 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.830
 additional we click and click on 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.740
 recovery of update error 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.290
 as you can see automatically from the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.900
 email from your cell phone if you do not appear 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.850
 they write it well in the back of the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.870
 cell where the battery is in a 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.670
 white stamp this is going to install the 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.670
 official firmware of your phone and that 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.740
 correspond to you in your country and the last 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.720
 version in which you an example if you 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.300
 them 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.030
 if they were blocked, they died on ice 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.070
 cream and there's update in the direction 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.440
 update that they will install the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.750
 last one to help 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.820
 once explained this we are going to click 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.620
 in ok 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.620
 and we will open a next window 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.650
 as you can see here is already starting to 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.650
 recognize the cell phone 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.820
 you are already reading the system and everything 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.640
 the file size about 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.620
 600 megs in my case I have a 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.380
 collection of 2 megabytes and it will take me 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.640
 approximately 50 minutes and it's a bit 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.380
 it's taken if you have a 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.680
 faster collection then it's going to be more 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.900
 fast cell phone leave it alone 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.540
 after explaining what will happen to the 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.580
 next step that subtel and the last 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.830
 finalized 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.990
 and I recommend that you do not disconnect 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.639
 nothing of the cell phone world until 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.919
 dial 100 once you have done this 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.419
 You can now disconnect your cell phone 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.389
 cell phone automatically goes to 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.150
 restart if they get to be that 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.280
 do not also pass the logo of him and only 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.550
 we have to do a hard reset that is 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:31.000
 pressing the volume key minus the 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.580
 of home and power at the same time 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.010
 Once this is done, it will look like a 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.830
 Android when I finish doing that 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.770
 automatically the cell equal back 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.630
 to learn and they will be able to access the 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.060
 operating system without any problem 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.370
 with this the problems of the 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.470
 ticket or what they have died as 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.030
 who says I hope it worked for them and 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.890
 liked anything do not come 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.890
 ask them to have an excellent day
