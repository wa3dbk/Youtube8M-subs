00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone with you dag and now i'm 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.980
 tell you how to create your corner 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.980
 blows and mary 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.090
 for a start and show your 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.560
 corner method i did so 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.180
 so that my players stand on the line 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.520
 opponent's gate and while filing 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.849
 shifted to the center of the penalty for causing 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.849
 hitting 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.850
 now let's create your corner for 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.550
 of this we need to go to the arena 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.280
 call the training mode menu and select 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 point create standard position 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.330
 after that you need to select the zone with which 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.310
 we will work pay attention that 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.840
 for each side for each zone we 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.150
 must create their own 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 standard position that is if you 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.780
 create the left head 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.020
 then it will not be available for right 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.060
 sides our zone to create 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.790
 standard position is not limited 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.020
 corner flag that means that if 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.030
 you got dumped in this zone 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.890
 then with a free kick you too 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.160
 execute your created standard 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.090
 position as in the corner 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.130
 now let's look at the possibilities 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.220
 menus that appear when you create 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.050
 standards when you click on the button b 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.950
 will begin recording the motion path 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.800
 selected player 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.630
 button wye or y is responsible for 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.850
 demonstration of movement on your recorded 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.680
 trajectories left analog stick 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.610
 designed to move the selected 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.770
 player across the field 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.980
 right analog stick is for 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.420
 switching us to the players we need 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.490
 green button and we need to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 testing the corner we created 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.090
 clicking on x we will keep what we have 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.280
 it turned out to create 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 and finally when you click on the right 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.500
 analog stick we can hide or same 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.120
 vice versa return this menu 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.979
 directly to create a corner 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.570
 let's start with some 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.130
 player in the penalty area try 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.720
 write down his trajectory and 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.510
 check how it will work on 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.890
 practice here we have chosen this players 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.840
 by push button 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.360
 shows us that the record of the trajectory 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.670
 started and move this player to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.080
 side of the gate then us in it only and 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.080
 our trajectory signed up 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.000
 let's and probably check button a 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.890
 and here we are in angular mode 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 notice that the player starts his 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.989
 movement does not always exist immediately 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.670
 slight delay everything works well here 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.670
 our player ran where needed 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.200
 to find 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.290
 Now , quickly create a corner 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.640
 which I showed the beginning of the video 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.349
 alternately put the players on the line 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.980
 gate and we write down for everyone 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.980
 trajectory of movement 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.400
 This standard position is good because 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.140
 footballers of the defending team too 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.390
 shifted to my footballer on line 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.549
 the gate but then my players run out on 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.530
 center of the penalty and they do not have time so 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:18.599
 react sharply the players who their 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.549
 covered for yourself you can come up 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.769
 absolutely any standard position 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.780
 but don't get carried away don't move 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.280
 polkomando to the gate track rival can 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.099
 keep a good counterattack 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.200
 in the penalty move players higher 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.870
 man fast put closer to the middle 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.030
 fields so they can interrupt the counterattack 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.049
 and hold fast hitters your 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.680
 contender here I created about 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.329
 our corner 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.010
 Now press the button Igor 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.810
 check yes how will our run 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.220
 players can then be 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.180
 test created by us 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.180
 standard position 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.890
 as we see everything works well now 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.080
 need to keep our corner for this 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.730
 click on the x button appears here 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.700
 menu to select the save slot 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.349
 standard if you choose the top one 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.209
 when you feed the corner just 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.120
 press the arrow to adjust tactics 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.790
 up well, like everything told showed 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.669
 Now try to create your corner. 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.040
 well, you can also create penalties 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.900
