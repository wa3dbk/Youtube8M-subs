hi<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> Dave<00:00:09.719> long<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.290> static<00:00:10.679> works

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
hi this is Dave long from static works

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.650 
hi this is Dave long from static works
and<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.639> sequence<00:00:12.120> we're<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.570> be

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
and in this sequence we're going to be

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.509 
and in this sequence we're going to be
talking<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.710> different<00:00:14.070> types<00:00:14.280> of

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
talking about the different types of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.760 
talking about the different types of
carpet<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.480> are<00:00:15.630> used<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.080> prevent<00:00:16.320> static

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
carpet that are used to prevent static

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.189 
carpet that are used to prevent static
electricity<00:00:17.130> problems<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
electricity problems first one going to

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.240 
electricity problems first one going to
discuss<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.920> computer<00:00:20.760> grade<00:00:21.529> static<00:00:22.529> control

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
discuss is computer grade static control

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.450 
discuss is computer grade static control
carpet<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.150> by<00:00:24.840> computer<00:00:25.380> grade<00:00:25.590> carpet<00:00:26.099> but

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
carpet and by computer grade carpet but

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.130 
carpet and by computer grade carpet but
we're<00:00:26.640> talking<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.480> very<00:00:27.869> old

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
we're talking about is very old

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.769 
we're talking about is very old
technology<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.000> originally<00:00:30.570> designed

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
technology that was originally designed

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.850 
technology that was originally designed
to<00:00:31.740> prevent<00:00:32.160> static<00:00:32.969> shocks<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.630> people<00:00:34.200> who

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to prevent static shocks on people who

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.549 
to prevent static shocks on people who
worked<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.309> computer<00:00:36.000> rooms<00:00:36.410> early<00:00:37.410> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
worked in computer rooms early on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.910 
worked in computer rooms early on
probably<00:00:38.250> early<00:00:38.969> 1980s<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.379> thought<00:00:40.649> was

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
probably early 1980s the thought was

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
probably early 1980s the thought was
that<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.460> people<00:00:41.850> did<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> shock<00:00:43.140> when

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that if people did not get a shock when

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.010 
that if people did not get a shock when
they<00:00:43.469> walked<00:00:43.739> across<00:00:44.010> carpet<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
they walked across carpet then the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
they walked across carpet then the
computer<00:00:46.350> equipment<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> room<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.640> also

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
computer equipment in the room was also

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.290 
computer equipment in the room was also
protected<00:00:48.660> static<00:00:49.500> electricity

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
protected static electricity

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.130 
protected static electricity
unfortunately<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:51.420> we've<00:00:51.570> learned<00:00:51.809> since

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
unfortunately what we've learned since

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100 
unfortunately what we've learned since
then<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> person<00:00:53.699> feels<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.840> shock

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
then is that when a person feels a shock

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.900 
then is that when a person feels a shock
it<00:00:55.949> requires<00:00:56.570> 3,500<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> 4,000<00:00:58.320> volts

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
it requires 3,500 to 4,000 volts

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.510 
it requires 3,500 to 4,000 volts
computer<00:00:59.910> parts<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.420> sensitive<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> 30<00:01:01.800> 40<00:01:02.340> 50

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
computer parts are sensitive to 30 40 50

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.929 
computer parts are sensitive to 30 40 50
under<00:01:03.480> 100<00:01:03.870> volts<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> static<00:01:04.589> electricity<00:01:04.939> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
under 100 volts of static electricity so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.550 
under 100 volts of static electricity so
today<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.720> look<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:06.930> computer<00:01:07.350> grade

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
today when we look at computer grade

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.700 
today when we look at computer grade
carpet<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.340> actually<00:01:08.990> look<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.320> totally

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
carpet we actually look at it as totally

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.410 
carpet we actually look at it as totally
ineffective<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.150> should

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
ineffective because all it really should

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.899 
ineffective because all it really should
be<00:01:12.450> called<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.960> shock<00:01:13.560> free<00:01:13.890> carpet<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.700> won't

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
be called as shock free carpet you won't

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.130 
be called as shock free carpet you won't
get<00:01:15.090> hurt<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.420> you're<00:01:15.570> walking<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:16.049> the
