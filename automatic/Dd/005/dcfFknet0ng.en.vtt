00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 keep a squad free of diseases 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.049
 maybe it's your biggest concern 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 and there are so many that the scream tv produced 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.300
 a series of reports that will show 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.610
 which treatments are most indicated 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.310
 in front of the most serious one is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.710
 linked to problems with hooves in the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.810
 report that you see the reporter now 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.390
 adriana pellegrino shows how it works 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.420
 the pad provided a treatment for the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 spontaneous disinfection of wheel helmets 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.929
 matter 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.750
 one of the fundamental health care 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.850
 of sheep is to take the deluge foot exam 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.870
 who will tell you more about it is the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.610
 catic luciana vet you do not mind 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.180
 to me why it's important to do these 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.980
 examinations resolve them because the sheep are 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.489
 animals that they usually have 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.989
 bacteria that lodge in the hull and skin 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.590
 digital 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.109
 then this bacterium it ignites and there 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.969
 this information on the cause so the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.500
 animals begin in the flesh to detect and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.920
 also our sound by which he talks 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.439
 solution for us to prevent the problem of 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.729
 foot date that we usually go through 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.290
 the animals glove number that is this is 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.290
 this building that we are here 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.890
 inside pd luvio we have a solution 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.049
 of 10% zinc sulfate with 1% of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.930
 detergent to help remove 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.229
 dirt also used the facts of 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.759
 copper is what you said but rather usoc 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 say we can use 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.549
 copper sulphate or formaldehyde 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.560
 But we did not use 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.620
 copper for being toxic 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.750
 it can cause a certain 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.030
 the situation of the animals so we do not 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.220
 we use cob support to prevent 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.320
 actions we prefer to use the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.340
 zinc sulphate and from which age 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.770
 the animals can separate us 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.350
 we recommend from the moment that it 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.660
 can already go to the folder he can already start to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.470
 we already said that he already 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.680
 can pass through the little shepherd is that 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.930
 he will get contaminated and producer is 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.990
 starting now it's important he do 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.510
 a trunk of this design is a yes one 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.420
 simple process yes that horn it 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.830
 is important because it is in this 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.670
 place that he will do an examination of the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.370
 animals 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.340
 he will collect samples for exams and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.650
 here that also goes with it will be able to 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.620
 the request via it is then the time that 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.990
 he is going to build this frame 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.260
 This trunk is already going to make a 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.030
 hole to put the solution alone. 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.010
 did not say to do it again 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.140
 besides the pt delbio has also some 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.050
 other exams you enjoy are 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.330
 known as the animals they have to 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.050
 pass around three worlds in ped 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.640
 mobile 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.920
 we take advantage of this moment that they 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.040
 They are all here for us. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.720
 take the primary clinical examination exam 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.810
 clinical examination that we usually 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.560
 making the sheep is to an examination of the mucosa 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.670
 ocular mucosa she goes 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.130
 demonstrate the anemia of animals 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.640
 how do we know that with more problem 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.890
 sanitary - is the verminose and the worm that 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.840
 It is more common for them and what causes anemia is 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.690
 crazy then it is at this moment that people 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.090
 will evaluate the crop and if they are with 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.780
 they or not you also take an exam 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.480
 that there was any 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.790
 The girls move or we enjoy it. 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.380
 this moment to make a population is 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.050
 because sheep are very common 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.750
 trenches in the made girls nÃ© 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.080
 the fly larvae on their chests then they 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.940
 pass one hand on the ninth weight of the animal 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.610
 that we can not see or 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.530
 we pass the hand to visualize to feel 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.110
 if the soul moves or not 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.750
 and here you also separate the animals 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.090
 having the disease in the case have to 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.010
 able to take care of and also to 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.200
 others, but this is also done here 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.480
 this is also done here it is also 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.060
 done here we are passed animals in the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.980
 green luvio and from here we're separating 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.900
 those who are sick and those who 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.900
 who are not sick because they are 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.609
 sick after we do a job 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.109
 and those who are not sick and 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.150
 they come back at Easter 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.729
 some of them even receive application here 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.340
 even that, we have already taken advantage of the 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.620
 three minutes to make the applications 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.260
 very good at it is important to remember that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.860
 during the summer it is recommended to 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.320
 pad once a week and according to 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.000
 Luciana veterinarian there at the 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.790
 new odessa zootechnics 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.320
 in the other seasons of the year once 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.320
 month is enough
