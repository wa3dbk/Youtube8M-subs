00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
there on this sort of edge here which is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
there on this sort of edge here which is
exposed<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.470> its<00:01:40.680> down<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
can just get in through the vent if I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
can just get in through the vent if I
press<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> top<00:01:45.119> you'll<00:01:45.300> see<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.680> clip

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.800 
got to do is there's a couple of cables
and<00:02:03.899> connectors<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.530> need<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.860> undo<00:02:05.240> okay<00:02:06.240> so
