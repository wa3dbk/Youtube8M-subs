00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.819
 I'm hardly going to show you a new horse in this video like here 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.190
 Cottbus is no banknotes in Cinema 4d 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.589
 and our goal is today 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.939
 To shoot money to distort the one pictured here 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.560
 was too high 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 Group snow and gas 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.649
 with shadow and with it 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.399
 he had that looks pretty thick and real 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.929
 we show you that we will do it 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:34.730
 now 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.110
 I have already modeled such a before 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.940
 here 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.990
 of course, I do not need a picture like this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 Wettig in a store was us 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.840
 needs a new material as I would have to double-click labor 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.060
 double click on the material in the window 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.089
 the new material and now light on DAX 2 on this Bathen 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.730
 to pick out more in the picture and it never was me 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.870
 this one 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.870
 it is a simple picture 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.970
 a parking lot 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.900
 confirm and now I have this picture 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.370
 to this 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.570
 Ball off 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.740
 this is just a preview 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.540
 I love loaded 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.610
 and 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.920
 that uses divide us then was the first here yet 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.210
 around 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.020
 is that a background again and now create this 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.970
 We have animals in 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.580
 Just now and Jäcki will have windows is now I just want to 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.620
 I'll go back I'll 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.740
 the subject 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.080
 would this material on 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.230
 background 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.180
 push 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.470
 Bochum SID you know what happened 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.610
 I'm looking out here with this one kid 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.669
 to the salt Emely smaller 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:15.599
 I have one 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.139
 aligned the sofa where it should be its connection in the picture 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.769
 I'm going up SEO Mingus 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.359
 it fits 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.359
 and we still need that 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.229
 Configurations for that 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:36.119
 Material for kicking on this material once and it is and 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.479
 grumbles 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.529
 and the 8 family 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.229
 then this one 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.769
 Projection is 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.249
 Properties to the Fontane Mappings be do the stolen goods 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.949
 Now I understand a love Mill and licks 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.559
 here you see 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.819
 Now not just this point and bigger it 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.809
 the whole world 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.879
 and with this in the little easy 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.559
 Symbol of the parking lot 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.149
 to make a post 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:13.419
 As a reward for this pond, I have everything else now, there is none 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.369
 Long 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:16.289
 could 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:21.839
 could refine this level so well lies in the structure 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.389
 increases 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.399
 existing with 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:27.629
 and 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.999
 why is it actually going to need this level of 5 see and everyone 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.109
 Although if no light and order directly now 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.419
 Now I want to align it so that approximately along with the picture above 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.899
 thus the light source from the picture 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:48.669
 he lies it looks now I'll make the way seven times 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:54.170
 here you see the shadow that runs from left to right 2 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.449
 that is logical is the 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.609
 Light source on the left side it was 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.609
 which animals to stock up in and now I go with the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.849
 with the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.939
 with the clearing directly with the not object 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.929
 back 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:11.749
 that fits 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.219
 and now I need one again though 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:20.529
 Object or this% Texture and they will lie on the giving 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.830
 PTI aesthetic the picture 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.599
 and 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.759
 it is already 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.789
 This object selects what is this material Brietzke I turn to 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.029
 projection 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.729
 and opponents head and at the bar 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.729
 that looks and so on 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.809
 and 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:42.219
 now I would have tiles off 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.449
 quoted from 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.029
 so far she has already seen the change 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.379
 söb the um 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.339
 SZ the texture is now only up to the edge here China 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.969
 that happens little all the time 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.009
 With the Camorra omission of the looks here wonderful intimate area 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.800
 that's not all we need right now he is the one 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.650
 Tribune to select 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.499
 and of course that still needs 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.939
 an intertek only 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:16.340
 and first, Schaath 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.340
 First we look at what that looks like and we want to tackle that way 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.000
 Sentence that I bind animals here, which we do not want to have 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.830
 even Nils who said that showed that 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.969
 to get out 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.680
 in fact 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.240
 I go to the stage 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.260
 Right click Cinema 4d textet he may also be happy 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.289
 certainly already 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.529
 Aphthas available "What I needed now is it helps 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.389
 Background comes at 7 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.389
 and we are going to cast shadows 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.080
 that actually fits 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.800
 Now I'm just switching to light 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.869
 around the shadow 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.869
 and the shadow to six animals 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:04.080
 Sharpton 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.779
 is shadow stood 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.960
 Mesic up 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.189
 posed 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.309
 I change that and quite simply times Shadow Maps 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.580
 I'll leave the settings 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.580
 and if we change now 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.990
 this one 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.659
 is our object 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:25.779
 besides the shadows 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.759
 that looks like he really is lying on this road 

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:33.699
 of course it can still move everything I can still ' 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.629
 I could do that now, too 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.650
 it is so far behind 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.710
 SWO Andrae me 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.369
 that's how it looks 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:50.129
 Witzigkeit now all sorts of 3d objects rhine-lahn and 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.710
 in this way 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:53.949
 a shadow 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.729
 add and 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:57.779
 until the next video
