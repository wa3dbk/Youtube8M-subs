00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.660
 boat is of course not a very good one in 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.490
 do not finally it's me I like 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.260
 so I took a step fake his 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.750
 malted trout 3 hardness good here it is 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 nice fixed so we can fish trout 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.769
 with now let's talk about 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.810
 bühler lasts like that said that 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.190
 it's really not for that 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.350
 it's done for the map the projects that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.140
 it is often the cir therefore already without 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.019
 fresh a cross on it that's so 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.670
 for trout so do not use 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.750
 Too much saddle so there what I like 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.170
 that's what's the hep the hooks and 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:40.810
 especially that there the kinds of attachment so 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:43.140
 like these have kidnapped me like that has 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.140
 so 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.370
 you can like that with this kind of 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.190
 edge is master and thus remove change 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:58.550
 from them very quickly not for that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:04.910
 here after the spoon too big too 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.890

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.709
 your own editing so she's like 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.610
 As it is folded not long 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.120
 date that's all I had to say 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.120
 so 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.420
 so that was a record of 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.140
