00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.809

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.730
 here in las vegas this time i will do 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.869
 One more technical team already showed 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.060
 You're that kind of event but I'm going 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.320
 show now again with moto 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 because it's the only event I can get 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.180
 getting on with motorbikes is good there 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.820
 events that you have some time to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.199
 you do the three laps on the track or 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.030
 be with this clue that then I will jump 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 The introduction to you does not have to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.940
 seeing something again that I do not 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.320
 I liked the previous video I just finished 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 ending video a little before 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 see this is that I've moved all the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.450
 women 's help is that all 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 women can help you 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.809
 during the game player let's you guys 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 want to show in the next video not 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.640
 forget it, do not forget to ask 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.170
 occurs after the ame type but I with a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.770
 lock woman there she helps me she 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.910
 give me 25% 23% more money I think 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 that twenty-five percent more than 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 speed then give me two improvements there 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.690
 when I'm using her help 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.129
 is one left activated there is the last woman 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.119
 even the mouth in the game even won a 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.070
 conquest 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.500
 else I do not know if I mentioned in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 previous videos of the game is that it has 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.430
 support xbox live then you win 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.320
 conquers leave your profile live that 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.590
 It's very cool for those who use this 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.560
 feature I played in the game on xbox 360 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 and I prefer it later, when 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.460
 have money to buy an xbox the year 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.930
 so it's very useful for me, it's beautiful 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.549
 achievements will stay on my profile there 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.540
 that I played the game and everything else 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.610
 I intend to get all the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.500
 achievements in it because it does not seem so 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.420
 difficult to achieve 100% of achievements 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 It has lots achievements and will need 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 time on Tuesday in determination but 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.299
 I did not see any so difficult of you. 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.100
 to get out more difficult than I think 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.399
 which is you reach the maximum level here 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.750
 in the game doing the races was 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.270
 experience and has reached the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 than what is 49 something like that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 50 then activates the thus attaining 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.090
 level you win the last 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.610
 conquest that I think the last one that goes 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.079
 working in the game he several others 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.630
 achievements that require a little bit of 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.969
 ability a little challenge and that is 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.459
 for example a can do thousand 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.349
 drifting points to be a very long hit 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.030
 to get this and the drift here at 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.080
 game is not so easy to do such 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.330
 usually 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.100
 I 'm not very durable. 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.660
 being only the problem of using the motorcycle 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.160
 Face you hit behind the vehicle and you 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.090
 end up falling on the car you do not have 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.130
 this problem 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.930
 but then the drift is not that hard to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.970
 you do but it's hard for you to do 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.770
 it lasts because the books here in the game 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.780
 are not continuous you turned to do 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.520
 one of the graduates and will return to the other 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.530
 and does not accumulate the break points it 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.300
 has a new riff then have to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.670
 take a beautiful one of a curve and at the same 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.070
 time there planning a lot for you 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.330
 do not finish that drift guy you guys 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.830
 You see what it 's like to have here more 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.510
 I think I'll make it because these 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.340
 here team tracks until they are not as 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590
 So difficult even so why I 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.730
 I chose to use a motorcycle show 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.230
 motorcycles for you I know the galley 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.430
 What do you like motorcycle? 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.140
 I'm not really into the bike but 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.300
 how do I know a lot of people like it then? 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.400
 so I decided to show on these tracks here 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.050
 team until one more time I got this 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.300
 shortcut I do not know for you in the video 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.670
 Previous also a well last shortcut 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.470
 economy time and damn 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.730
 this quick death since it is fast 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.010
 so in real life they also need to 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.510
 that more than 300 kilometers per hour 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.730
 these bikes here in brazil that is the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.140
 most coming on the street is not even 200 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.940
 wow, never never 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.070
 but also this bike here for sure 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.720
 It must be very expensive, I already told you before 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.790
 I do not like motorcycles either. 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.470
 motorbikes so much of home taking a bit of 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.660
 speed of vehicles I quite understand 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.459
 about the brands of the models I only see 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.690
 any car and on the street I understand 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.480
 very well but I also do not 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.610
 sumbe sert I do not know much about mechanics 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.459
 more same type of cars issue 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.739
 Speed â€‹â€‹names of motorcycle type I 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.450
 I do not know anything, nothing, even if it tells me 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.459
 the name of a motorcycle and very popular of the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.220
 Brazil, I know it's okay, I'm not going. 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.980
 to know then is very complicated and my 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.239
 knowledge about the bike and looks 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.590
 Police already here and who are not only 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.459
 using more help from that woman who 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.840
 I told you 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.160
 the day before she was using it 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.019
 decreases the chance the police come after 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.060
 I'm already raining after police. 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.320
 I got to jump on the ramp. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.269
 I thought I would not have been well on 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.530
 her life really if you're not well 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.850
 in the middle well positioned you do not 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.019
 Can you jump but I did well in 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.220
 corner it still get 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.470
 jump was not my intention is 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.269
 jumping more helped me he has some more 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.100
 These points will help a little 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.690
 more final money with more experience 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.669
 and we'll pick up once again that this 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.380
 shortcut saves time we touched 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.670
 very beautiful to use it 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.010
 you also saw the use the liter 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.090
 three times the nitro then it gives a 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.680
 motorcycle yaw 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.420
 one thing that is missing with note is you 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.310
 can not do 20 for example this curve 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.740
 which is too closed and can not do 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.980
 This complicates a lot. You lose a lot. 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.650
 speed him on the bend there pick one more 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.910
 bit of nitro here the game is to have a 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.610
 little law to carry the scenery 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.540
 in the background but this is normal games there 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.820
 laptops in racing games to be 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.620
 very fast for mobile devices is 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.750
 normal you see things loading on the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.640
 background as if this is not procon because of 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.930
 of the smartphone that is the fault of the game 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.310
 even a little bit older 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.410
 new law do not have much to so 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.640
 carry the scenery things but at the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.720
 minus everything that's next carries 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.310
 right right 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.020
 but good place ending here then more 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.140
 a race, let's get there first 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.450
 is enough time left even as 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.430
 I told you 72,000 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.860
 in the previous video of the rich man with more than 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.480
 2 million engineer is a case and 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.100
 like the vigilante is dj also liked 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.240
 that have no channel 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.950
 My twitter receives everyone who is 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.970
 dedicated to the campaign to reach 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.260
 I'm going to stay here for a hug. 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.260
 all and until the next video I went
