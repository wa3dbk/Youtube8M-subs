00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
step in this skill to train it so much

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.289 
step in this skill to train it so much
that<00:01:55.590> they<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.829> reached<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.310> last<00:01:56.579> possible

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that they have reached a last possible

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.959 
that they have reached a last possible
XP<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.560> can't<00:01:58.890> possibly<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.520> more<00:01:59.729> XP

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
XP in it you can't possibly get more XP

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.999 
XP in it you can't possibly get more XP
in<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> skill<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.680> how<00:02:01.860> much

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
in this skill and that is how much

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
in this skill and that is how much
offended<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:03.180> completely<00:02:03.630> finishing

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
offended and for completely finishing

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.420 
offended and for completely finishing
the<00:02:04.259> skill<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.189> should<00:02:05.399> be

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the skill I think that you should be

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.280 
the skill I think that you should be
awarded<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.090> 200<00:02:06.630> million<00:02:06.780> cave<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
awarded with the 200 million cave to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
awarded with the 200 million cave to
prove<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.090> kept<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
prove that you actually kept out and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.890 
prove that you actually kept out and
finished<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.229> entire<00:02:10.379> skill<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.660> one

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
finished an entire skill but this one

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.880 
finished an entire skill but this one
won't<00:02:13.170> exist

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
won't exist

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
won't exist
so<00:02:14.219> let's<00:02:14.609> go<00:02:14.730> back<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.030> 120<00:02:15.569> cave<00:02:15.780> this

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so let's go back to the 120 cave this

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.459 
so let's go back to the 120 cave this
one<00:02:16.500> might<00:02:16.709> exist<00:02:17.069> but<00:02:17.609> why<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.290> should

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
one might exist but why if we should

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.720 
one might exist but why if we should
look<00:02:19.560> at<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.859> thing<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.400> made<00:02:20.609> in

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
look at this thing that I made in

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.339 
look at this thing that I made in
Photoshop<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.599> shows<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.989> every

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
Photoshop it shows that every

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.289

other skill really except engineering

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.490 
other skill really except engineering
you<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.609> 99<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.390> next<00:02:27.870> achievement<00:02:28.379> is

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you get 99 and the next achievement is

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.129 
you get 99 and the next achievement is
200<00:02:29.040> million<00:02:29.280> XP<00:02:29.579> between<00:02:30.480> here<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:30.989> not

this is my argument why should we be

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.159 
this is my argument why should we be
awarded<00:03:17.909> for<00:03:18.090> getting<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.479> certain<00:03:18.870> number<00:03:19.139> of

skill but that doesn't matter for
anything<00:03:23.940> else<00:03:24.290> why<00:03:25.290> don't<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:25.680> get<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.829> reward

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
anything else why don't we get a reward

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.069 
anything else why don't we get a reward
for<00:03:26.280> capping<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.729> entire<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.269> skill<00:03:27.659> instead

so<00:03:28.829> let<00:03:28.979> me<00:03:29.129> explain<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.549> issue<00:03:29.669> that<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.000> can

so let me explain the issue that I can

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.119 
so let me explain the issue that I can
see<00:03:30.479> some<00:03:30.750> people<00:03:31.049> saying<00:03:31.290> which<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.739> also<00:03:31.949> the

get a new touch to it i don't know what
it<00:03:59.699> could<00:03:59.819> be<00:04:00.000> maybe<00:04:00.269> an<00:04:00.479> additional<00:04:00.659> flair<00:04:01.259> or

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
it could be maybe an additional flair or

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.740 
it could be maybe an additional flair or
glow<00:04:01.739> somewhere<00:04:02.280> or<00:04:02.639> just<00:04:02.970> more<00:04:03.120> details<00:04:03.540> to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
glow somewhere or just more details to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.719 
glow somewhere or just more details to
it<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.439> it<00:04:04.560> would<00:04:04.680> definitely<00:04:05.129> work<00:04:05.370> itself

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
it but it would definitely work itself

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.429 
it but it would definitely work itself
out<00:04:05.909> then<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.479> would<00:04:06.599> be<00:04:06.689> just<00:04:06.930> as<00:04:07.019> much<00:04:07.049> work

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
out then it would be just as much work

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.369 
out then it would be just as much work
for<00:04:07.470> jag<00:04:07.829> access<00:04:08.220> 120<00:04:08.879> caves<00:04:09.090> would<00:04:09.269> be<00:04:09.419> so<00:04:10.229> in
