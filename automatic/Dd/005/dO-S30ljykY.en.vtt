00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 ball to the station 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.370
 in this case we leave a little bit more 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.170
 the team and at a certain point the Northern League but dulled between the ball to the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.080
 number four 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.010
 at this point 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 the number four will be the I of and competence of the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.579
 delta quarters detaching Latin impression 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 let's see how the other shamael players must move 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.780
 number 8 how to install mezzala will make me a cover 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.140
 preventive 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 widening the inclination of the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.440
 of the diagonal tour as the number four that the Methodist median 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.640
 will get up 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.430
 pimania between going even space - there is cuantos and we know if 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.700
 when 10 hp in vertical line filler look killer lands 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.050
 hard a rope 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.270
 2 to 12 flight po of 54 will be delivered 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.229
 from the rocky mountains you turn up red vasco 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.530
 group 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.320
 Mrs. Minu MinÃ¹ The number 11 in this case is not the case with the dog 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.790
 killed ball ok now 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 unloading 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.580
 brentelle 4 towards a 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.429
 his player 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.429
 teammate while number 9 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.429
 discover 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.439
 the side passage 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.950
 here he will be in a position to avoid even the number four I can 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.059
 make a side pass 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:27.849
 therefore it will go dark 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.079
 the player who is in this position has played another game 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.200
 construction 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.639
 luciana here 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.429
 if the player to pay is in this position 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.769
 he will go dark 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.289
 the passage 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:47.709
 same thing goes for the wall 11se lidl own teammate of the red 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.339
 it's here 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.679
 how they will cover the drain 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.679
 exposure to 5 stars in the way here 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:03:01.359
 the 7 lotto players will logically go ahahah to obscure the passages 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:04.599
 lateral 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.469
 and two external via bass 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.819
 in this case they will get up 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.829
 a little bit more in the sense that one here will stand up here 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.679
 a little more while killer 6 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.909
 evil5 will rise you have that they 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.659
 towards the ball 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.049
 aligning 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.760
 while the number two you can raise a little bit more 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.929
 compared to 5 6 logically 3 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:39.529
 it will be a little bit more contracting wheels 2 cost aci 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:47.789
 the distance bettarini ventura and therefore in amplitude between rai 2 and 3 in me 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.019
 this case 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.540
 salate re a little bit plants and compared to before because it is more one 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.869
 ball and lies between distant 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:02.610
 dallara our penalty area is more logically 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.619
 distances and spaces therefore increase the distance between 3 and x2 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:13.150
 we could also say about 40 meters 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.420
 compared years 30 35 or ture 25 we have seen 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.749
 previous distance 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:26.569
 ktys could be between 6 and 5 indicatively compared to you 2 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:29.370
 midfielders 2 half le 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.000
 it could be around 15 months then at a vertical china distance 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.520
 approximately 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.199
 and on 25 - 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:51.080
 as we have said before, since the ball is over the hill 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.800
 of 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.370
 midfield here in the opposing half of this field. 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.469
 the is task 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.899
 and our players are not going to cover 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.229
 lesson cover the area the cookery opponents venturi holes that you can 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.399
 come to create in our rearguard but it is to go 

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.220
 then 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.600
 all in which you go into depression number four you go right apt obscure 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.620
 the steps then 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.870
 we go to close the passages 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.380
 then let's imagine that the ball comes the number four then 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.080
 this. here is that 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 the liked to pressure 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.359
 so you don't know what the hocico proclo zone areas are anymore 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.780
 festival to close any passages then lot goes under pressure 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.110
 ale a player to lower competence 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.990
 1007 mbar close 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.300
 the possible passages 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.479
 11 e9 when to close 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.509
 landfills number four 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.960
 rises together with allasia 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.189
 parliamentary magna festival 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:02.189
 the offside 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.289
 opponents so nothing on 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:11.599
