to<00:00:31.430> project<00:00:31.820> those<00:00:32.300> dilemma<00:00:32.719> of<00:00:32.899> fine

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
to project those dilemma of fine

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.259 
to project those dilemma of fine
resonance<00:00:36.019> in<00:00:36.289> the<00:00:36.350> dilemmas<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.280> we<00:00:37.699> has

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
culture go through so those questions or

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.340 
culture go through so those questions or
those<00:00:46.489> social<00:00:46.969> questions<00:00:47.449> existential

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
questions find a way to my work but then

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.509 
questions find a way to my work but then
they<00:00:52.249> find<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:53.059> resolution<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:53.929> is<00:00:54.109> not

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
they find a resolution that is not

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.569 
they find a resolution that is not
social<00:00:55.519> or<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.089> so<00:00:56.389> social<00:00:57.519> political<00:01:00.579> so

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
basically it is the extension aspect of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.880 
basically it is the extension aspect of
life<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:04.940> let's<00:01:05.900> say<00:01:06.050> it<00:01:06.260> starts<00:01:06.650> from<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
life that let's say it starts from the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.340 
life that let's say it starts from the
pain<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.370> living<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.060> now<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:08.600> can<00:01:09.020> overcome

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
pain of living and now we can overcome

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.850 
pain of living and now we can overcome
the<00:01:09.710> pain<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.220> living<00:01:10.510> through<00:01:12.430> images<00:01:13.600> works

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
the pain of living through images works

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.280 
the pain of living through images works
and<00:01:15.860> work<00:01:16.340> in<00:01:17.060> itself<00:01:18.310> my<00:01:19.310> studio<00:01:20.000> is<00:01:20.300> sort<00:01:21.200> of

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
and work in itself my studio is sort of

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.190 
and work in itself my studio is sort of
less<00:01:21.670> reflection<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.970> my<00:01:23.240> schizophrenia

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
less reflection of my schizophrenia

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.610 
less reflection of my schizophrenia
between<00:01:24.830> painting<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:26.110> sculptures<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:27.380> it's

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
between painting and sculptures so it's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.270 
between painting and sculptures so it's
there's<00:01:28.010> a<00:01:28.130> wall<00:01:28.340> between<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.910> two<00:01:29.060> worlds

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
there's a wall between the two worlds

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.350 
there's a wall between the two worlds
the<00:01:31.280> sculpture<00:01:31.790> well<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.930> really<00:01:33.380> messy<00:01:34.360> like

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
the sculpture well is really messy like

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.750 
the sculpture well is really messy like
I<00:01:35.390> think<00:01:35.870> sculpture<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.620> today<00:01:37.010> there's<00:01:37.370> too

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
I think sculpture is today there's too

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.480 
I think sculpture is today there's too
many<00:01:37.940> materials<00:01:38.600> too<00:01:39.020> many<00:01:39.230> ideas<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:40.250> it's

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
many materials too many ideas and it's

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.190 
many materials too many ideas and it's
about<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:42.100> arborescent<00:01:43.100> nature<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.820> mind

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
about the arborescent nature of the mind

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.649 
about the arborescent nature of the mind
painting<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.320> more<00:01:45.500> like<00:01:45.800> giving<00:01:46.400> me<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.790> relief

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
painting is more like giving me a relief

course I do not succeed so I go back to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.219 
course I do not succeed so I go back to
this<00:02:02.300> culture<00:02:02.720> world<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.229> make<00:02:03.950> those<00:02:04.159> moles

that<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.790> would<00:02:37.970> basically<00:02:38.530> reproduce<00:02:39.530> this

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
that I would basically reproduce this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.930 
that I would basically reproduce this
painting<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.690> tribute<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.440> him<00:02:42.950> whose<00:02:43.730> work

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
painting as a tribute to him whose work

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.060 
painting as a tribute to him whose work
I<00:02:44.120> really<00:02:44.270> liked<00:02:44.390> very<00:02:44.630> much<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:45.500> driven<00:02:45.740> by

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
I really liked very much it's driven by

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.820 
I really liked very much it's driven by
my<00:02:46.310> interest<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:47.590> ethnography<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.709> other

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
my interest in ethnography and other

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.110 
my interest in ethnography and other
cultures<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:50.470> see<00:02:51.470> little<00:02:51.830> worlds<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.520> like<00:02:52.790> a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
cultures to see little worlds is like a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.020 
cultures to see little worlds is like a
way<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.709> all<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:55.220> world<00:02:55.489> at<00:02:55.880> arm's<00:02:56.720> length<00:02:56.810> and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
way to all the world at arm's length and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.050 
way to all the world at arm's length and
sort<00:02:59.030> of<00:03:00.100> making<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.370> distance<00:03:01.880> with<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> world

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
sort of making a distance with the world

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.240 
sort of making a distance with the world
fabricating<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.239> distance<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.950> way<00:03:07.070> for

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
fabricating this distance it's a way for

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.550 
fabricating this distance it's a way for
me<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.489> realize<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:07.910> our<00:03:08.360> dual<00:03:08.840> position

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
me to realize that our dual position

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.430 
me to realize that our dual position
that<00:03:10.190> we<00:03:10.400> are<00:03:10.520> both<00:03:10.670> observer<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.510> an<00:03:12.020> actor

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
that we are both observer and an actor

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.060 
that we are both observer and an actor
of<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.580> world<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.270> world<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.720> both<00:03:15.320> outside

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
of the world the world is both outside

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.390 
of the world the world is both outside
us<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.459> in<00:03:16.940> us<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.530> think<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.070> way<00:03:19.370> of

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
us and in us so I think it's a way of

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.280 
us and in us so I think it's a way of
establishing<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.450> balance<00:03:20.810> between<00:03:20.959> the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
establishing the balance between the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.570 
establishing the balance between the
objective<00:03:21.769> view<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.850> subjective<00:03:23.060> view
