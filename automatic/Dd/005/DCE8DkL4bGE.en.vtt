00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 I'll show you how the operation will work. 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.009
 I will show how it is usually done and what it is for. 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.710
 leads 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.530
 that is, for a general understanding of what it is 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.929
 generally such a pain and it draw 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.240
 which is on the stack compound common 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.789
 This operation allows 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 Subtraction of the object and the subject well, that is, 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.890
 I will not explain just show it immediately 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.410
 it becomes clear we choose an object from 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.199
 whom we will deduct from which we 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 we will cut something after that we press 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:39.530
 sick click on the peak operand and click the object 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.809
 which we will deduct in this way 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 we get the complexity of a composite object 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.379
 which looks like this 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.289
 that is, how to cut a hole here but 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.600
 so hard bulik envelope we are in the field 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.000
 Well, still the grid has not collapsed yet well 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.629
 we are lucky now let's say we need 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.449
 knit some more window or not 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.180
 window notch no matter we do another 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.369
 we will see and the grid is already starting to lead 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.229
 see yourself not quite correctly 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.970
 such not very pleasant ones appear 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.220
 such are parasitic ages 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.560
 it's not good okay but still be tolerant 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 still doing sick still more 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 and in the end we get this 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.159
 The object with the wrong grid is absolutely 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.259
 not beautiful and further work with this 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.869
 the object at best will be 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.939
 uncomfortable worst case facility 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.240
 disintegrate you either appear in it 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.509
 any holes this will be and you will have to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.060
 to build interfield as correctly bowline 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.530
 goes in particular the arched window strike 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.350
 I make an object 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.200
 box and i need to get arched 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.320
 window in this part well for a start i am 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.390
 I will draw an arched window 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:07.159
 I have a window to the plan must 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.159
 I will take cancer tenge lor I will build a window 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:15.000
 envelope well see it was a spline take 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:21.090
 do the corresponding points here 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:27.150
 archway but I will be built on the eye for sure 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:31.470
 line up and make an extrude of this 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.480
 the object here they have turned out I did 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.550
 Otabek to obtain a preform 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.070
 under the pancake, that is, I am now using it 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.620
 cut a window here before cutting 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.989
 window not to get here 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.350
 such a fragmented ugly grid i 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.300
 Take the next I'll just take here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.239
 envelope this box in the field we always have it 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:59.959
 make and add a couple of segments that 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:04.550
 I will limit my window 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.550
 vertical and horizontal 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 after i limited my object 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.690
 for will be and here are such segments I 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.120
 I can perform the operation of bulin in this 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.520
 case 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.370
 phantom these here or parasitic and jack 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.730
 as they call 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.280
 not refer to the entire object and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.610
 only on this cut segment see 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.230
 so she appeared appeared and jack you from 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.410
 he will not get rid he will be you in any 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.370
 case to appear like not cool but it 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.370
 already under control
