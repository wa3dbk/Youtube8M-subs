00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:05.179
 from her and welcome to tutorials 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.980
 in today's tutorial we will make a tree 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.960
 to decorate with candy we are going to 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.380
 need a dry ice skull or 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.490
 unicel acrylic paint cream coffee color 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.869
 and black scissors thin ribbon a ribbon 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.810
 a little thicker than the color 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.009
 you prefer sponge to paint silicon and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.480
 a flexible tree 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.460
 You can find all this in 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.259
 fantasias miguel the first thing we will do 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.450
 will bend the branches of our tree 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.220
 flexible separating the ones to be treated 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.860
 that the fold is peak so that 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.760
 see a little more mysterious then what 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 we will paint in black 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.940
 when we finish we will paint the skull of 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.190
 dry ice cream 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 then we will put some brown paint 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.269
 in the eyes you can also use a little 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.760
 of black paint to mark 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.469
 the more now we will use the ribbon 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.690
 we will cut several strips of 20 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.190
 centimeters and the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.040
 we will gather by the center for later 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.050
 fold them in half this way 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.880
 the units making a knot with a 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.270
 little more ribbon and we will cut the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.270
 tips 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.830
 we will also make some handles like this 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.930
 but a little smaller than they will be for 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.180
 decorate the branches 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.260
 we will stick with silicone the skull the base 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.260
 from the tree on one side 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.890
 and on the other side the bun that we had 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.560
 fact 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.330
 you can use the candy you want alone 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.370
 you have to cut ribbon and paste it with a 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.010
 little silicon and a lot of care for the sweet 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.840
 the little monkeys will stick to the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.940
 branches and sweets the gange will make 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.560
