self-propelled self-propelled works

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.920 
self-propelled self-propelled works
throttle<00:00:46.530> doesn't<00:00:47.129> work<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.329> set<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
throttle doesn't work but it set it a

gonna try and start it now primer bulbs
been<00:01:01.770> slow<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.670> made<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.500> 2000<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> yes<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
been slow this was made in 2000 so yes I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.679 
been slow this was made in 2000 so yes I
set<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.490> camera<00:01:11.700> over<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
set this camera over here and here I

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:53.730 
set this camera over here and here I
started

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.070 

and<00:01:54.130> that<00:01:54.340> doesn't<00:01:54.670> shut<00:01:54.970> off<00:01:55.000> until<00:01:55.510> you

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
and that doesn't shut off until you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:19.450 
and that doesn't shut off until you
let<00:01:57.290> go<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.680> it

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.260 

yeah<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.970> thing<00:02:21.180> runs<00:02:21.390> pretty<00:02:22.260> darn<00:02:22.530> good

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
yeah so that thing runs pretty darn good

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.550 
yeah so that thing runs pretty darn good
looks<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.600> looked<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.080> oil<00:02:25.110> had

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
looks like it looked like the oil had

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.600 
looks like it looked like the oil had
never<00:02:25.800> been<00:02:25.980> changed

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
never been changed

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.600 
never been changed
they<00:02:26.700> never<00:02:26.880> added<00:02:27.360> oil<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:28.490> since<00:02:29.490> they

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
they never added oil to it since they

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.460 
they never added oil to it since they
bought<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
bought it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.020 
bought it
they<00:02:31.470> never<00:02:31.710> clean<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> air<00:02:32.280> filter<00:02:32.490> cuz<00:02:32.880> it

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
they never clean the air filter cuz it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.570 
they never clean the air filter cuz it
was<00:02:33.120> clogged<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.890> didn't<00:02:35.070> have<00:02:35.160> an<00:02:35.250> extra

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
was clogged and I didn't have an extra

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940 
was clogged and I didn't have an extra
one<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:35.940> kind<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.440> blew<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.470> out<00:02:37.710> as

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
one so I just kind of blew it out as

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.490 
one so I just kind of blew it out as
best<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.400> could<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:42.080> spark<00:02:43.080> plug<00:02:43.290> looks

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
best as I could so that spark plug looks

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.290 
best as I could so that spark plug looks
relatively<00:02:44.160> new<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.520> maybe<00:02:44.700> they<00:02:44.820> did<00:02:44.970> replace

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
relatively new so maybe they did replace

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.720 
relatively new so maybe they did replace
that<00:02:47.210> but<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.750> runs<00:02:48.930> really<00:02:49.290> good<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.800> was<00:02:50.310> gonna

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that but it runs really good I was gonna

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.410 
that but it runs really good I was gonna
blow<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.410> fun<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.240> runs

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
blow it up you know for fun but it runs

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.920 
blow it up you know for fun but it runs
too<00:02:54.690> darn<00:02:54.870> good<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.230> blow<00:02:55.470> up<00:02:56.480> but<00:02:57.560> we'll<00:02:58.560> see<00:02:58.740> I

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
too darn good to blow up but we'll see I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.710 
too darn good to blow up but we'll see I
might<00:03:00.930> end<00:03:01.050> up<00:03:02.150> maybe<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.240> can<00:03:03.420> convert<00:03:03.660> this

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
might end up maybe I can convert this

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.680 
might end up maybe I can convert this
one<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.170> propane<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.670> take<00:03:05.880> my<00:03:06.030> propane<00:03:06.420> piece

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
one to propane and take my propane piece

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.800 
one to propane and take my propane piece
of<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.260> blow<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.950> up<00:03:08.450> as<00:03:09.450> I've<00:03:09.690> been

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
of and blow that up as I've been

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.390 
of and blow that up as I've been
wanting<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.140> blow<00:03:10.320> up<00:03:10.440> an<00:03:10.680> engine<00:03:10.950> up<00:03:11.100> for<00:03:11.340> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
wanting to blow up an engine up for a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.250 
wanting to blow up an engine up for a
while<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.270> one<00:03:12.450> just<00:03:12.480> runs<00:03:12.900> too<00:03:13.080> darn

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
while but this one just runs too darn

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.880 
while but this one just runs too darn
good<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.690> only<00:03:15.840> thing<00:03:16.050> it's<00:03:16.350> missing<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
good and the only thing it's missing the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.470 
good and the only thing it's missing the
top<00:03:18.350> plastic<00:03:19.350> thing<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:19.950> goes<00:03:20.070> over<00:03:20.370> that

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
top plastic thing that goes over that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.400 
top plastic thing that goes over that
but<00:03:21.480> other<00:03:21.900> than<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.140> it's<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.800> perfect
