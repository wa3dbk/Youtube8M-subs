 comfort to pamper you to the fullest 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.360

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.350
 values ​​of love and friendship in alex style 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.509
 American alcohol and drugs are 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.280
 strictly prohibited especially in the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.930
 public places where forces 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.520
 of the order are always ready to 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.790
 repress all forms of racism e 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.409
 violence as much as accidents due 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.460
 to alcohol and drug use in 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:02:00.030

 Click but obviously I want the business 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.230
 being able to carve out my own business 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.150
 remember that in this city 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.220
 apparently it's all if you show up 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.750

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.380
 right now the perfect opportunity 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.730
 could be investing in the stock market 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.299

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.470

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.380
 view if I understand what you mean in 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.870

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.549

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.079
 blow you have to plan everything to the minimum 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.769
 details without ever leaving anything to 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.440

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.139
 always a low profile and take action 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.930

 also to assemble your head without knowing it 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.769
 doing is risky can break and therefore 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.130
 try not to spend all that 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.170
