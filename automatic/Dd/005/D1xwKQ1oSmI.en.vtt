00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.030
 please 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.030
 by ap 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.610
 blu-ray technology was created in 2002 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.090
 aims to sell high-resolution images on an optical disk that 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.920
 It is the same size as a boy his age but offers storage 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.529
 up to 50 gigawatts high and several per ace of high quality was the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.940
 instantly in the opa or latin want she is product manager of 23 and 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.660
 electronics now welcome 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.849
 national 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.849
 to explain how vigo network technology works 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.850
 Juan Orlando Blu-ray technology is basically a digital format 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.640
 which offers a greater storage capacity 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.650
 that translates into better image quality and that girl 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.150
 well many people wonder what has its conventional xxxii plus division 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.990
 the house that enter cintron divide and a blu-ray 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.540
 but the main difference is the ability to follow as I said 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.359
 previously 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.690
 divinity a capacity of 4 points leagues 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.030
 a blu-ray that a capacity of more than 40 days 5 this is a difference in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450
 key between these two formats 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.150
 in the other the coverage that has the blu-ray has a plastic cover 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.160
 that protects us 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.210
 the scratches this coverage is called durable and escaped after they do not have it 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.039
 divided skin this is a great advantage that has imploring 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.420
 and the other one is the reader 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.890
 simply the blu-ray 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.920
 mclean much more 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.290
 net like the one with the capasu with the ability that a microscope has by 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.570
 example a scientist that's the difference wake is my microscope's 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.180
 a student that the ability to read that has a king and the ability 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.110
 that has a divided 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.270
 or that that goal analysts from the market many buyers 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.920
 who gave the battle between the formats hd dvd the blu-ray makes about two 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.409
 years 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.040
 they preferred to wait 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.220
 and still continue undecided 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.510
 because the adoption of blu-ray technology is so difficult 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.359
 dies the cost of doing a divide is has a much lower cost 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.260
 precisely good coverage that I spoke previously 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.180
 first of all seconds to the companies that are behind this 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.440
 blu-ray technology 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.580
 companies like for a pitcher is like fox like in chile in colombia 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.289
 they are making titles per hundred with blu-ray technology 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.150
 these these companies set the standards of technology that's why today 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.389
 day there is a lot more titles i would have wasted let's say in this case the wins 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.159
 blu-ray 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.950
 or what is on the other side to take advantage of the quality of the film in 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.919
 blu-ray format the users not only require the blu-ray player but 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.959
 they also require a high definition television explain us 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.829
 yes the end and aunt mind 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.549
 Lynn is currently setting the standard for full HD TVs for 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.269
 take advantage of this benefit that this is read and envelopes we can only 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.959
 achieve it with a blu-ray player then we need this one this 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.769
 technology to be able to have all these benefits that initially not 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 they paint these new inti products that are on the market 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.859
 good to know that I would recommend you still a user who wants to buy a 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.319
 player 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.319
 that comes with disturbing power to re 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:21.209
 definitely in blu-ray if the consumer is looking for a high 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.969
 image quality and that united you should definitely buy a product 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.529
 a blu-ray player 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:28.670
 good really 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.940
 paola you think that versatile digital technology this cool thing and like 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.030
 is known will be obsolete in a few years with the arrival of the Cuban rays 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.679
 keep the market together 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.969
 the global trend towards blu-ray technology 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.709
 but at this moment let's say in colombia 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.479
 still not going to have a short-term migration will see it but still long 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.949
 term we hope that in 2012 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:00.029
 9% of the market is in a rec currently temple we have 3% 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:04.429
 then more or less so that it floods there's an idea how on how to do 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.319
 this migration 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.969
 Well, despite the payment explanations, the fig tree won in three sets
