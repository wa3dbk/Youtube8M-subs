00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
talked about earlier we do not want to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.269 
talked about earlier we do not want to
rotate<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.960> shoulder<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.590> most<00:00:23.070> other

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
rotate that shoulder in most other

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.710 
rotate that shoulder in most other
cricketing<00:00:23.730> shots<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.449> particular

shot<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.710> want<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.189> rotate<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.580> shoulder<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
shot we want to rotate the shoulder so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.849 
shot we want to rotate the shoulder so
we're<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> focus<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.930> Kern<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.800> he

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
we're going to focus on Kern and how he

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.080 
we're going to focus on Kern and how he
rotates<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.460> front<00:00:29.699> shoulder<00:00:31.790> just<00:00:32.790> rotate

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
rotates that front shoulder just rotate

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.870 
rotates that front shoulder just rotate
and<00:00:33.270> stop<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.250> shoulders

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and stop so there you go that shoulders

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
and stop so there you go that shoulders
rotated<00:00:36.390> nicely<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.290> ball<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> coming<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
rotated nicely the ball is coming this

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.250 
rotated nicely the ball is coming this
way<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> he's<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> perfect<00:00:39.510> position<00:00:39.930> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
way and he's in the perfect position to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.770 
way and he's in the perfect position to
slap<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.950> down<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> other<00:00:41.969> key<00:00:42.180> aspect<00:00:42.629> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
slap it down now the other key aspect is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.209 
slap it down now the other key aspect is
to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.960> able<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> load<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.500> wrist<00:00:43.800> over<00:00:44.010> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
place that ball either later or earlier

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.620 
place that ball either later or earlier
you<00:01:13.470> have<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.010> cross<00:01:14.280> your<00:01:14.310> feet<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.600> feet

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you have to cross your feet if your feet

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
you have to cross your feet if your feet
then<00:01:16.049> cross<00:01:16.350> you'll<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.710> stuck<00:01:17.040> once<00:01:17.340> again

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
then cross you'll be stuck once again

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.679 
then cross you'll be stuck once again
playing<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.180> shot<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.810> inverse

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
playing one shot at it and inverse

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.599 
playing one shot at it and inverse
in<00:01:19.749> the<00:01:19.899> air<00:01:20.049> you've<00:01:20.619> got<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.070> be<00:01:21.189> able<00:01:21.249> to<00:01:21.429> keep

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
in the air you've got to be able to keep

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.580 
in the air you've got to be able to keep
its<00:01:21.819> feet<00:01:22.060> on<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.299> ground<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.869> place<00:01:23.350> the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
its feet on the ground and place the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:42.790 
its feet on the ground and place the
ball<00:01:23.770> where<00:01:24.249> you<00:01:24.280> want<00:01:24.759> it<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:24.999> go

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.240 

you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.680 

that<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.370> nice<00:01:50.610> cut<00:01:50.850> shot<00:01:51.120> from<00:01:51.330> current

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
that was a nice cut shot from current

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.030 
that was a nice cut shot from current
obviously<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.260> would<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.470> liked<00:01:52.710> him<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
obviously we would have liked him to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
obviously we would have liked him to
maintain<00:01:53.190> better<00:01:53.730> balance<00:01:54.210> rather<00:01:54.540> than

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
maintain better balance rather than

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
maintain better balance rather than
moving<00:01:54.900> away<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.590> ball<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
moving away from the ball going into the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.610 
moving away from the ball going into the
ball<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.480> we'd<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> cut<00:01:58.170> shot<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> be

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
ball so we'd like the cut shot to be

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.890 
ball so we'd like the cut shot to be
played<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.580> with<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.330> balance<00:02:00.690> going

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
played like that with the balance going

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.020 
played like that with the balance going
back<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.650> coming<00:02:02.190> forward<00:02:02.490> rather<00:02:02.850> than

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
back and coming forward rather than

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.450 
back and coming forward rather than
going<00:02:03.420> away<00:02:03.750> from<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> body<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.250> was

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
going away from the body and that was

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.520 
going away from the body and that was
just<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.970> slight<00:02:06.360> hiccup<00:02:06.900> with<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.260> shot

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
just a slight hiccup with that shot

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.320 
just a slight hiccup with that shot
other<00:02:07.740> than<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.100> he<00:02:08.220> perfectly<00:02:08.820> timed<00:02:09.090> it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
other than that he perfectly timed it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.880 
other than that he perfectly timed it
you<00:02:09.479> might<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.780> got<00:02:09.929> even<00:02:10.050> fair<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.649> deep

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
you might have got even fair if you deep

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.130 
you might have got even fair if you deep
the<00:02:11.040> further<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.880> we<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.050> he

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the further so we like that but if he

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660 
the further so we like that but if he
can<00:02:13.290> maintain<00:02:13.440> better<00:02:13.860> balance<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> next

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
can maintain better balance the next

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.330 
can maintain better balance the next
time<00:02:14.850> will<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.090> even<00:02:15.390> happier<00:02:15.950> Smith<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.070> George

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
time will be even happier Smith I George

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.470 
time will be even happier Smith I George
