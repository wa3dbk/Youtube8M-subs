talking about how to ballast easy track
easy<00:00:05.250> tracks<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.700> good<00:00:05.850> option<00:00:06.120> for<00:00:06.810> people<00:00:06.960> who

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
easy tracks a good option for people who

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.980 
easy tracks a good option for people who
don't<00:00:08.010> want<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> put<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.090> effort<00:00:09.210> into<00:00:09.540> like<00:00:09.929> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
don't want to put the effort into like a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.140 
don't want to put the effort into like a
harder<00:00:10.380> track<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:11.580> know<00:00:11.670> laying<00:00:11.940> down<00:00:12.120> that

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
harder track you know laying down that

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.099 
harder track you know laying down that
cork<00:00:12.570> bed<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.219> making<00:00:14.219> their<00:00:14.340> own<00:00:14.370> track<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
cork bed and making their own track I

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.150 
cork bed and making their own track I
personally<00:00:16.109> use<00:00:16.230> easy<00:00:16.440> track<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:17.010> I'm

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
personally use easy track because I'm

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.800 
personally use easy track because I'm
active-duty<00:00:17.550> military<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.449> don't<00:00:18.600> move<00:00:18.750> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
active-duty military and I don't move a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.510 
active-duty military and I don't move a
lot<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.619> don't<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> go

lot so I don't want to have to go

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.179 
lot so I don't want to have to go
through<00:00:20.550> all<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> effort<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.689> my<00:00:21.840> layout

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
what we're going to do there's two

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.630 
what we're going to do there's two
different<00:00:49.320> ways<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.070> there's<00:00:50.579> a

different ways you can do this there's a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
different ways you can do this there's a
fast<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:52.079> there's<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.710> more

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
fast way and then there's a a more

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.549 
fast way and then there's a a more
effective<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.239> detailed<00:00:54.989> way<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> makes

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
use the fast way on my entire track so

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.870 
use the fast way on my entire track so
that's<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.400> glue

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
that's the glue

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.670 
that's the glue
you're<00:02:01.780> gonna<00:02:01.900> sprinkle<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.590> on<00:02:04.080> now<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.500> want

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
you're gonna sprinkle it on now you want

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.560 
you're gonna sprinkle it on now you want
to<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.040> personally<00:02:06.850> do<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:07.210> my<00:02:07.360> layout

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
to I personally do it on my layout

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.440 
to I personally do it on my layout
because<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.500> leave<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:09.520> ballast<00:02:10.890> light<00:02:11.890> I

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
because I leave the ballast light I

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.840 
because I leave the ballast light I
leave<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:14.140> where<00:02:14.740> it's<00:02:15.010> actually<00:02:15.460> gonna<00:02:15.640> go

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
leave it to where it's actually gonna go

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.590 
leave it to where it's actually gonna go
ahead<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.030> sit<00:02:16.270> on<00:02:16.300> top<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:18.240> don't<00:02:19.240> actually

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
ahead and sit on top I don't actually

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.630 
ahead and sit on top I don't actually
spray<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.380> down<00:02:20.530> spray<00:02:21.010> glue<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.310> down<00:02:21.430> like

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
spray it down spray glue it down like

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
spray it down spray glue it down like
some<00:02:21.850> people<00:02:22.090> do<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.410> can<00:02:23.560> see<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> little

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
some people do now you can see a little

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.450 
some people do now you can see a little
Ridge<00:02:24.280> or<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.210> EZ<00:02:25.390> track<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.280> take<00:02:27.400> a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
Ridge or the EZ track is you can take a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.750 
Ridge or the EZ track is you can take a
brush<00:02:27.790> or<00:02:28.600> any<00:02:28.810> edge<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.410> push<00:02:30.250> until<00:02:30.460> that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
brush or any edge and push until that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.710 
brush or any edge and push until that
Ridge<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.030> gone<00:02:32.640> now<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.910> would<00:02:34.090> preferably

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
Ridge is gone now you would preferably

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.080 
Ridge is gone now you would preferably
do<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.320> from<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.620> angle<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:36.610> way<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:36.880> don't

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
do it from this angle that way you don't

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.640 
do it from this angle that way you don't
have<00:02:37.360> like<00:02:37.600> too<00:02:37.810> much<00:02:37.990> of<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.230> spread<00:02:38.440> of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
have like too much of a spread of

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.760 
have like too much of a spread of
ballast<00:02:39.490> but<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.330> gradually<00:02:41.260> working<00:02:41.470> its

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
ballast but it is gradually working its

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.920 
ballast but it is gradually working its
way<00:02:41.950> down<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.490> that<00:02:43.060> Ridge<00:02:43.270> isn't<00:02:43.450> exposed

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
way down and that Ridge isn't exposed

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.500 
way down and that Ridge isn't exposed
now<00:02:44.650> one<00:02:44.920> thing<00:02:45.370> that's<00:02:45.610> not<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> benefit<00:02:46.360> to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
now one thing that's not a benefit to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.600 
now one thing that's not a benefit to
this<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:47.080> since<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:47.800> loose<00:02:47.980> gravel<00:02:48.459> it's

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
this is since it's loose gravel it's

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.850 
this is since it's loose gravel it's
going<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.060> shift<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.840> you'll<00:02:50.440> have<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.740> go

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
going to shift and you'll have to go

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.740 
going to shift and you'll have to go
back<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.250> push<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.580> up<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.300> keep<00:02:52.510> loose

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
back and push it up but I keep loose

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.080 
back and push it up but I keep loose
gravel<00:02:53.110> because<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.530> don't<00:02:53.680> want<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.980> damage<00:02:54.520> my

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
gravel because I don't want to damage my

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.060 
gravel because I don't want to damage my
grass<00:02:55.360> lay<00:02:55.630> out<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.830> bottom<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:59.070> the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
grass lay out the bottom of it so the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.540 
grass lay out the bottom of it so the
more<00:03:00.280> detailed<00:03:00.730> way<00:03:01.920> I'm<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.160> do<00:03:03.280> on<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
more detailed way I'm going to do on the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.670 
more detailed way I'm going to do on the
other<00:03:03.580> side<00:03:04.030> but<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.870> won't<00:03:05.170> be<00:03:05.260> able<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.470> see

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
other side but you won't be able to see

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.650 
other side but you won't be able to see
so<00:03:05.890> well<00:03:06.100> but<00:03:07.090> basically<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:10.239> run<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.630> very

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
so well but basically you run it very

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:25.960 
so well but basically you run it very
slowly<00:03:14.070> across

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.150 

trying<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.810> keep<00:03:26.990> those<00:03:27.170> railroad<00:03:27.710> ties

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
trying to keep those railroad ties

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:36.900 
trying to keep those railroad ties
exposed

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.270 

still<00:03:37.660> it's<00:03:37.990> kind<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.380> fast<00:03:38.650> way<00:03:38.920> I'm<00:03:39.040> doing

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
still it's kind of a fast way I'm doing

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.340 
still it's kind of a fast way I'm doing
it<00:03:39.400> because<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:39.970> time<00:03:40.240> constraints<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.230> this

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
it because of time constraints on this

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.520 
it because of time constraints on this
video<00:03:42.120> however<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.630> key<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:43.990> keep<00:03:44.380> those

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
video however the key is keep those

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.670 
video however the key is keep those
railroad<00:03:45.040> ties<00:03:45.220> exposed<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.350> I'm<00:03:47.410> gonna<00:03:47.530> go

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
railroad ties exposed so I'm gonna go

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.030 
railroad ties exposed so I'm gonna go
and<00:03:47.830> shake<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.340> now<00:03:48.490> on<00:03:48.640> this<00:03:48.790> side<00:03:50.040> which

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
and shake this on now on this side which

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.470 
and shake this on now on this side which
is<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.340> way<00:03:51.460> you<00:03:51.520> should<00:03:51.790> always<00:03:51.910> face

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
is the way you should always face

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.960 
is the way you should always face
towards<00:03:52.960> the<00:03:53.140> area<00:03:53.590> you're<00:03:53.740> painting<00:03:54.130> with

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
towards the area you're painting with

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.860 
towards the area you're painting with
the<00:03:55.090> glue<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.960> make<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> thinner<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:58.480> straight

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the glue to make a thinner more straight

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.430 
the glue to make a thinner more straight
line<00:03:59.140> of<00:03:59.350> ballast<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:04.120> now<00:04:04.360> you<00:04:04.420> see<00:04:04.750> all<00:04:04.990> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
line of ballast and now you see all the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.920 
line of ballast and now you see all the
railroad<00:04:05.800> ties<00:04:06.040> are<00:04:06.070> exposed<00:04:06.670> as<00:04:07.540> on<00:04:07.780> this

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
railroad ties are exposed as on this

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.600 
railroad ties are exposed as on this
side<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.260> have<00:04:08.410> some<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:09.040> are<00:04:09.160> covered<00:04:09.490> up

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
side you have some that are covered up

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.090 
side you have some that are covered up
and<00:04:09.850> now<00:04:10.060> at<00:04:10.210> least<00:04:10.360> with<00:04:10.630> glue<00:04:10.870> now<00:04:11.800> you<00:04:11.860> have

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
and now at least with glue now you have

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.890 
and now at least with glue now you have
another<00:04:12.370> option<00:04:12.460> like<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.330> said<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.540> keep<00:04:13.810> in

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
another option like I said I keep in

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.540 
another option like I said I keep in
mind<00:04:14.050> with<00:04:14.230> loose<00:04:14.380> gravel<00:04:14.800> you<00:04:15.070> actually<00:04:15.400> have

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
mind with loose gravel you actually have

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.640 
mind with loose gravel you actually have
two<00:04:15.760> other<00:04:15.910> options<00:04:16.030> one<00:04:17.020> is<00:04:17.050> you<00:04:17.290> can<00:04:17.440> make<00:04:17.590> a

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
two other options one is you can make a

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.160 
two other options one is you can make a
glue<00:04:17.980> mixture<00:04:18.160> which<00:04:18.550> you<00:04:18.730> find<00:04:19.030> on<00:04:19.150> any<00:04:19.300> Yahoo

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
glue mixture which you find on any Yahoo

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.070 
glue mixture which you find on any Yahoo
search<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.010> spray<00:04:21.820> down<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.510> ballast<00:04:22.900> like

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
search and spray down the ballast like

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.110 
search and spray down the ballast like
it<00:04:23.230> is<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:24.010> might<00:04:24.190> want<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.370> cover<00:04:24.580> your<00:04:24.700> track

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
it is you might want to cover your track

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.620 
it is you might want to cover your track
with<00:04:25.540> tape<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:27.160> will<00:04:27.520> make<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.270> ballast

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
with tape and that will make the ballast

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.510 
with tape and that will make the ballast
hard<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.230> it<00:04:29.410> won't<00:04:29.590> go<00:04:29.740> anywhere<00:04:29.980> but<00:04:30.460> I

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
hard and it won't go anywhere but I

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.260 
hard and it won't go anywhere but I
don't<00:04:30.760> do<00:04:30.910> that

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
don't do that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.300 
don't do that
I<00:04:31.300> leave<00:04:31.840> my<00:04:32.050> ballast<00:04:32.380> loose<00:04:32.620> but<00:04:33.160> there's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
I leave my ballast loose but there's

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.570 
I leave my ballast loose but there's
also<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.610> third<00:04:33.880> option<00:04:34.090> you<00:04:34.510> can<00:04:35.080> take<00:04:35.290> this

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
also a third option you can take this

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.440 
also a third option you can take this
Road<00:04:37.140> easy<00:04:38.140> track<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.880> lift<00:04:39.880> it<00:04:40.030> up<00:04:40.180> away<00:04:40.330> from

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
Road easy track and lift it up away from

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.360 
Road easy track and lift it up away from
the<00:04:40.630> ballast<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.740> have<00:04:41.920> something<00:04:42.250> that

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
the ballast and you have something that

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.570 
the ballast and you have something that
looks<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:44.560> basically<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:45.250> ballast

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
looks like this so basically the ballast

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.840 
looks like this so basically the ballast
is<00:04:45.760> sprinkled<00:04:46.180> over<00:04:46.270> most<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.960> track<00:04:47.850> but

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
is sprinkled over most of the track but

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.440 
is sprinkled over most of the track but
there<00:04:49.000> are<00:04:49.090> some<00:04:49.300> areas<00:04:49.480> missing<00:04:50.010> now<00:04:51.450> another

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
there are some areas missing now another

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.150 
there are some areas missing now another
thing<00:04:52.720> you're<00:04:52.840> going<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.020> want<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.290> do<00:04:53.410> is

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
thing you're going to want to do is

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.590 
thing you're going to want to do is
sprinkle<00:04:54.460> some<00:04:54.760> in<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:55.030> middle<00:04:55.270> of<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.420> ties

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
sprinkle some in the middle of the ties

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.380 
sprinkle some in the middle of the ties
and<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:57.010> go<00:04:57.160> over<00:04:57.370> there<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.730> to<00:04:57.910> make<00:04:58.090> sure<00:04:58.210> the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
and it go over there is to make sure the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.060 
and it go over there is to make sure the
ties<00:04:58.600> are<00:04:58.870> exposed<00:04:59.260> in<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.500> middle<00:04:59.710> as<00:04:59.860> well

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
ties are exposed in the middle as well

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.450 
ties are exposed in the middle as well
so<00:05:00.880> you<00:05:00.940> could<00:05:01.090> take<00:05:01.210> a<00:05:01.270> brush<00:05:01.570> or<00:05:01.720> your<00:05:01.780> finger

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
so you could take a brush or your finger

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.370 
so you could take a brush or your finger
run<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.580> down<00:05:03.730> to<00:05:04.030> where<00:05:04.270> all<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:05.080> railroad

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
run it down to where all the railroad

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.620 
run it down to where all the railroad
ties<00:05:05.560> are<00:05:05.740> exposed<00:05:06.180> making<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.300> look<00:05:07.420> more

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
ties are exposed making it look more

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.160 
ties are exposed making it look more
realistic<00:05:09.000> but<00:05:10.000> once<00:05:10.240> again<00:05:10.420> you<00:05:10.870> could<00:05:10.960> also

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
realistic but once again you could also

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.810 
realistic but once again you could also
like<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.620> said<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:11.860> could<00:05:12.010> do<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.220> this<00:05:12.340> way<00:05:12.580> and

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
like I said you could do it this way and

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.760 
like I said you could do it this way and
then<00:05:13.510> there's<00:05:13.690> not<00:05:13.840> all<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.140> loose<00:05:14.320> ballast

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
then there's not all that loose ballast

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.840 
then there's not all that loose ballast
or<00:05:15.420> having<00:05:16.420> to<00:05:16.510> do<00:05:16.630> all<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.870> spring<00:05:17.610> tour<00:05:18.610> it's

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
or having to do all the spring tour it's

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.840 
or having to do all the spring tour it's
all<00:05:18.970> covered<00:05:19.500> one<00:05:20.500> disadvantage<00:05:20.950> of<00:05:21.400> this<00:05:21.580> is

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
all covered one disadvantage of this is

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.380 
all covered one disadvantage of this is
the<00:05:22.270> glue<00:05:22.480> peeled<00:05:23.440> off<00:05:24.270> exposing<00:05:25.270> the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
the glue peeled off exposing the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.410 
the glue peeled off exposing the
original<00:05:25.750> easy<00:05:25.900> track<00:05:26.400> now<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.430> use<00:05:27.880> medium

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
original easy track now I use medium

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.110 
original easy track now I use medium
grey<00:05:28.870> ballast<00:05:29.290> to<00:05:29.470> mix<00:05:29.680> by<00:05:30.310> woodland<00:05:30.730> Scenic's

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
grey ballast to mix by woodland Scenic's

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.080 
grey ballast to mix by woodland Scenic's
that's<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.140> good<00:05:32.320> base<00:05:32.560> for<00:05:32.950> this<00:05:33.100> gray<00:05:33.790> easy

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
that's a good base for this gray easy

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.300 
that's a good base for this gray easy
track<00:05:34.420> I've<00:05:34.870> also<00:05:35.110> seen<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.560> black<00:05:35.770> ez<00:05:36.010> track

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
track I've also seen the black ez track

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.160 
track I've also seen the black ez track
you<00:05:36.490> can<00:05:36.640> get<00:05:36.790> darker<00:05:37.180> or<00:05:37.420> lighter<00:05:37.450> ballasts

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
you can get darker or lighter ballasts

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.320 
you can get darker or lighter ballasts
but<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:38.830> prefer<00:05:39.280> this<00:05:39.400> grey<00:05:39.610> mix<00:05:39.910> it's<00:05:40.120> still<00:05:40.300> a

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
but I prefer this grey mix it's still a

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.500 
but I prefer this grey mix it's still a
little<00:05:40.420> lighter<00:05:40.720> than<00:05:40.840> normal

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
little lighter than normal

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.300 
little lighter than normal
you<00:05:41.570> know<00:05:41.660> your<00:05:41.810> average<00:05:41.930> railroad<00:05:42.470> is<00:05:42.740> a<00:05:43.100> lot

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
you know your average railroad is a lot

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.160 
you know your average railroad is a lot
darker<00:05:43.550> or<00:05:43.880> ballast<00:05:44.270> because<00:05:44.720> of<00:05:44.840> all<00:05:45.020> the<00:05:45.140> oil

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
darker or ballast because of all the oil

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.770 
darker or ballast because of all the oil
and<00:05:45.560> stuff<00:05:45.800> that<00:05:45.830> it's<00:05:46.160> exposed<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.730> but<00:05:47.510> this

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
and stuff that it's exposed to but this

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.210 
and stuff that it's exposed to but this
does<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.110> trick<00:05:48.140> for<00:05:48.500> somebody<00:05:48.890> that's<00:05:49.100> on

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
does the trick for somebody that's on

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.310 
does the trick for somebody that's on
