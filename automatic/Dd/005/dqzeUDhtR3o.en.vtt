00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
them to wear but other than that pretty

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
them to wear but other than that pretty
much<00:01:16.619> pointless<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:17.820> don't

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
much pointless and I don't really don't

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
much pointless and I don't really don't
someone<00:01:18.689> said<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.200> could<00:01:19.409> store<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
they can store it I think the only way

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.850 
they can store it I think the only way
can<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.119> stores<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:27.840> open<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.710> and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
which gets the same effect I don't have

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.479 
which gets the same effect I don't have
lug<00:02:22.810> nut<00:02:23.020> here<00:02:23.319> with<00:02:23.530> me<00:02:23.770> at<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.100> moment<00:02:24.130> but<00:02:24.430> I

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
lug nut here with me at the moment but I

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.780 
lug nut here with me at the moment but I
or<00:02:25.030> else<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.330> would<00:02:25.510> demonstrate<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.790> but

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
or else I would demonstrate that but but

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.120 
or else I would demonstrate that but but
I<00:02:27.850> don't<00:02:28.720> see<00:02:28.930> these<00:02:29.110> real<00:02:29.380> breaking<00:02:29.860> all<00:02:29.980> that

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
I don't see these real breaking all that

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.920 
I don't see these real breaking all that
much<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.370> mean<00:02:30.520> they're<00:02:30.670> real<00:02:31.209> flexible<00:02:31.630> but

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
much I mean they're real flexible but

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.210 
much I mean they're real flexible but
they're<00:02:32.080> also<00:02:32.260> pretty<00:02:32.650> strong<00:02:33.040> too<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:35.220> would

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
they're also pretty strong too I would

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.260 
they're also pretty strong too I would
have<00:02:36.310> preferred<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:36.730> more<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.060> these

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
have preferred to have more of these

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.420 
have preferred to have more of these
zones<00:02:37.450> instead<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.380> having<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.220> like

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
zones instead of just having to and like

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.430 
zones instead of just having to and like
having<00:02:39.760> them<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.239> little<00:02:40.600> suitcase<00:02:41.050> looking

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
having them in a little suitcase looking

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.460 
having them in a little suitcase looking
cool<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.550> magnet<00:02:43.060> scan<00:02:43.510> them<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:43.870> yeah

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
cool that a magnet scan them but yeah

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.820 
cool that a magnet scan them but yeah
these<00:02:44.620> are<00:02:45.480> there's<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.569> lot<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.110> play<00:02:47.410> value

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
these are there's a lot of a play value

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.540 
these are there's a lot of a play value
in<00:02:47.950> these<00:02:50.010> next<00:02:51.010> up<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:52.739> show<00:02:53.739> accurate<00:02:54.040> up

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
in these next up is the show accurate up

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.350 
in these next up is the show accurate up
magnet<00:02:55.060> magnet<00:02:55.840> cuffs<00:02:56.319> for<00:02:57.069> ratchet<00:02:57.780> which<00:02:58.780> I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
magnet magnet cuffs for ratchet which I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.789 
magnet magnet cuffs for ratchet which I
really<00:03:01.360> don't<00:03:01.569> like<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:02.140> stickers<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.560> they

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
really don't like the stickers that they

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.530 
really don't like the stickers that they
put<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.220> them<00:03:03.400> they<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.880> really<00:03:04.180> can't<00:03:04.360> make

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
put on them they just really can't make

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.050 
put on them they just really can't make
it<00:03:04.660> work<00:03:04.870> look<00:03:05.290> even<00:03:05.620> worse<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:06.130> think<00:03:06.910> you'd

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
it work look even worse I think you'd

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.509 
it work look even worse I think you'd
get<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.330> better<00:03:07.569> effect<00:03:07.750> if<00:03:08.140> he<00:03:08.230> just<00:03:08.440> took<00:03:09.250> some

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
get a better effect if he just took some

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.250 
get a better effect if he just took some
metallic<00:03:10.060> blue<00:03:10.269> paint<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.780> almost<00:03:11.140> just

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
metallic blue paint and almost just

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.550 
metallic blue paint and almost just
dipped<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:13.390> did<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.750> tips<00:03:13.989> in<00:03:14.260> and

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
dipped it in just did the tips in and

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.530 
dipped it in just did the tips in and
you'll<00:03:14.709> get<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> better<00:03:15.130> effect<00:03:15.370> out<00:03:15.700> I'm

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
you'll get a better effect out I'm

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.150 
you'll get a better effect out I'm
probably<00:03:16.780> going<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.140> do<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.380> just<00:03:17.530> uh<00:03:17.739> peel

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
probably going to do that just uh peel

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.130 
probably going to do that just uh peel
is<00:03:18.340> these<00:03:18.700> stickers<00:03:18.970> off<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.510> paint<00:03:19.750> them<00:03:19.930> I

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
is these stickers off and paint them I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.050 
is these stickers off and paint them I
think<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.950> looked<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.370> lot<00:03:21.519> better<00:03:21.730> than

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
think it looked a lot better than

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.870 
think it looked a lot better than
because<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.660> get<00:03:23.079> a<00:03:23.140> lot<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.410> uh<00:03:23.790> let's<00:03:24.790> see

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
because you get a lot of uh let's see

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.880 
because you get a lot of uh let's see
you<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.239> do<00:03:25.390> it<00:03:25.480> absolutely<00:03:26.019> perfect<00:03:26.320> but

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
you just do it absolutely perfect but

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.170 
you just do it absolutely perfect but
it's<00:03:27.010> kind<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.220> hard<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.430> do<00:03:27.609> expression<00:03:28.120> on

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
it's kind of hard to do expression on

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.890 
it's kind of hard to do expression on
the<00:03:28.269> back<00:03:28.420> because<00:03:28.630> there's<00:03:29.079> out<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.739> show<00:03:29.920> you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
the back because there's out to show you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.190 
the back because there's out to show you
on<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.230> bot<00:03:32.410> back<00:03:32.799> here<00:03:33.810> where<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.019> molding

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
on the bot back here where the molding

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.330 
on the bot back here where the molding
excesses<00:03:38.200> it's<00:03:39.040> real<00:03:39.670> difficult<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.390> get<00:03:40.570> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
excesses it's real difficult to get the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.580 
excesses it's real difficult to get the
sticker<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:43.060> lie<00:03:43.239> perfectly<00:03:43.780> flat<00:03:44.079> up<00:03:44.200> against

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
sticker to lie perfectly flat up against

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.849 
sticker to lie perfectly flat up against
that<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.540> yeah<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.810> think<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.320> just<00:03:47.350> may<00:03:47.680> be<00:03:47.709> a

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
that so yeah I think it just may be a

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.940 
that so yeah I think it just may be a
better<00:03:48.100> idea<00:03:48.160> just<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.180> paint<00:03:49.390> them<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:50.290> you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
better idea just to paint them and you

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.310 
better idea just to paint them and you
let<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:51.640> attach<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:52.120> see<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.540> as<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.690> little

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
let you attach it is see it as a little

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.550 
let you attach it is see it as a little
circle<00:03:54.250> here<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.820> will<00:03:55.000> go<00:03:55.209> on<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:56.079> inside

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
circle here that will go on the inside

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.559 
circle here that will go on the inside
of<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.980> spring<00:04:00.459> there<00:04:01.980> like<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.970> just<00:04:04.239> open<00:04:04.390> up

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
of the spring there like so just open up

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.790 
of the spring there like so just open up
his<00:04:04.750> hand

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.010 

that's<00:04:09.800> it<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:10.640> can<00:04:11.000> close<00:04:11.210> the<00:04:11.810> hand

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
that's it you just can close the hand

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.460 
that's it you just can close the hand
for<00:04:12.200> effect<00:04:12.440> but<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:12.980> don't<00:04:13.100> have<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.460> it's<00:04:14.030> in

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
for effect but you don't have to it's in

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.060 
for effect but you don't have to it's in
there<00:04:15.470> just<00:04:15.800> as<00:04:16.010> well<00:04:16.190> but<00:04:17.560> still<00:04:18.560> really<00:04:18.830> cool

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
there just as well but still really cool

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.180 
there just as well but still really cool
I<00:04:19.100> think<00:04:19.310> it's<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:19.790> lot<00:04:19.970> better<00:04:20.239> looking<00:04:20.510> than

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
I think it's a lot better looking than

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.970 
I think it's a lot better looking than
the<00:04:22.190> ones<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.670> he<00:04:22.790> has<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.330> toys<00:04:23.630> no<00:04:23.980> see

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
the ones that he has on the toys no see

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.940 
the ones that he has on the toys no see
they're<00:04:25.540> definitely<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:27.050> lot<00:04:27.380> more<00:04:27.440> cooler

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
they're definitely a lot more cooler

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.940 
they're definitely a lot more cooler
looking<00:04:28.160> than<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:31.930> all<00:04:32.930> right<00:04:33.140> now<00:04:33.440> on<00:04:33.710> to

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
looking than that all right now on to

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.430 
looking than that all right now on to
the<00:04:33.980> last<00:04:34.910> but<00:04:35.300> definitely<00:04:35.510> not<00:04:35.810> least<00:04:35.930> the

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
the last but definitely not least the

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.110 
the last but definitely not least the
reason<00:04:36.950> why<00:04:37.070> I<00:04:37.100> got<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.850> most<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.600> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
reason why I got this the most is the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
reason why I got this the most is the
Allspark<00:04:41.120> itself<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.950> is<00:04:43.180> pretty<00:04:44.180> hefty<00:04:44.900> for

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
Allspark itself it is pretty hefty for

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.980 
Allspark itself it is pretty hefty for
how<00:04:45.230> small<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.710> is<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.480> it<00:04:47.480> will<00:04:47.570> look<00:04:47.750> pretty

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
how small it is and it will look pretty

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.740 
how small it is and it will look pretty
bland<00:04:48.470> without<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:49.190> stickers<00:04:49.670> on<00:04:49.820> but<00:04:50.060> as<00:04:50.600> you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
bland without the stickers on but as you

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.990 
bland without the stickers on but as you
can<00:04:50.840> see<00:04:51.020> what<00:04:51.140> those<00:04:51.290> metallic<00:04:52.160> stickers<00:04:52.790> it

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
can see what those metallic stickers it

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.770 
can see what those metallic stickers it
just<00:04:53.240> really<00:04:53.570> gives<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.900> very<00:04:54.520> mystic<00:04:55.520> and

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
just really gives a very mystic and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.840 
just really gives a very mystic and
powerful<00:04:56.780> effect<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.970> now<00:04:59.740> it<00:05:00.740> does<00:05:01.640> have

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
powerful effect to it now it does have

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.940 
powerful effect to it now it does have
and<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.420> course<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.840> does<00:05:03.020> resemble<00:05:03.380> the

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
and of course it does resemble the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.980 
and of course it does resemble the
matrix<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.550> leadership<00:05:04.730> you<00:05:05.150> feel<00:05:05.540> like<00:05:05.780> this

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
matrix of leadership you feel like this

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.200 
matrix of leadership you feel like this
and<00:05:06.350> just<00:05:06.380> like<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.950> matrix<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.700> does<00:05:07.910> open

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
and just like the matrix it does open

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.460 
and just like the matrix it does open
but<00:05:09.110> there's<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.380> little<00:05:09.530> catch<00:05:09.740> this<00:05:11.470> it

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
but there's a little catch this it

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.160 
but there's a little catch this it
doesn't<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.940> doesn't<00:05:14.000> really<00:05:14.390> open<00:05:14.660> us<00:05:14.960> so

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
doesn't it doesn't really open us so

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.030 
doesn't it doesn't really open us so
much<00:05:15.320> as<00:05:15.560> come<00:05:15.860> apart<00:05:17.200> let's<00:05:18.200> take<00:05:18.620> this<00:05:18.800> sign

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
much as come apart let's take this sign

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.570 
much as come apart let's take this sign
off<00:05:19.160> for<00:05:19.340> example<00:05:20.980> there's<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.220> actual

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
off for example there's the actual

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.460 
off for example there's the actual
Allspark<00:05:23.450> itself<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:25.750> get<00:05:26.750> it<00:05:26.900> in<00:05:27.080> a<00:05:27.169> position

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
Allspark itself to get it in a position

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.710 
Allspark itself to get it in a position
where<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:28.190> looks<00:05:28.430> like<00:05:28.520> it's<00:05:28.790> opened<00:05:29.210> you

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
where it looks like it's opened you

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.990 
where it looks like it's opened you
really<00:05:30.020> just<00:05:30.050> take<00:05:30.560> one<00:05:30.830> side<00:05:31.040> off<00:05:31.250> slide<00:05:31.760> this

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
really just take one side off slide this

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.270 
really just take one side off slide this
out<00:05:32.180> move<00:05:33.140> it<00:05:33.290> down<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:34.370> about<00:05:34.820> there<00:05:36.280> there's

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
out move it down to about there there's

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.730 
out move it down to about there there's
a<00:05:37.490> little<00:05:38.300> groove<00:05:38.600> right<00:05:38.900> there<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:39.320> slides

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
a little groove right there that slides

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.990 
a little groove right there that slides
into<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:41.180> put<00:05:41.360> it<00:05:41.480> close<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.200> up<00:05:43.000> same

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
into and to put it close it up same

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.140 
into and to put it close it up same
thing<00:05:44.240> up<00:05:44.360> there<00:05:44.390> and<00:05:44.750> you<00:05:45.050> can<00:05:45.169> see<00:05:45.440> where<00:05:45.740> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
thing up there and you can see where the

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.010 
thing up there and you can see where the
circle<00:05:47.150> on<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:47.450> inside<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:48.410> container<00:05:49.400> is

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
circle on the inside the container is

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:58.990 
circle on the inside the container is
slide<00:05:51.020> it<00:05:51.169> there<00:05:53.320> and<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:56.120> get<00:05:57.080> a

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
slide it there and you get a

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.180 
slide it there and you get a
affected<00:06:00.000> or<00:06:00.360> look<00:06:00.990> looking<00:06:01.530> like<00:06:01.830> it's<00:06:02.010> been

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
affected or look looking like it's been

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:10.280 
affected or look looking like it's been
opened<00:06:02.520> Allspark<00:06:06.320> now<00:06:07.940> at<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:09.270> I<00:06:09.570> would

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
opened Allspark now at this I would

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.690 
opened Allspark now at this I would
really<00:06:10.530> would<00:06:10.770> have<00:06:10.860> preferred<00:06:11.220> if<00:06:11.370> it<00:06:11.460> came

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
really would have preferred if it came

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.310 
really would have preferred if it came
ahead<00:06:12.030> of<00:06:12.210> like<00:06:12.450> some<00:06:12.660> sort<00:06:12.900> of<00:06:13.020> function

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
ahead of like some sort of function

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.540 
ahead of like some sort of function
where<00:06:13.530> you<00:06:13.620> open<00:06:13.950> it<00:06:14.040> this<00:06:14.310> would

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
where you open it this would

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.550 
where you open it this would
automatically<00:06:15.030> just<00:06:15.270> kind<00:06:15.480> of<00:06:15.570> slide<00:06:16.320> on<00:06:16.530> down

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
automatically just kind of slide on down

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.850 
automatically just kind of slide on down
instead<00:06:17.040> of<00:06:17.130> having<00:06:17.310> to<00:06:17.430> reassemble<00:06:18.090> it<00:06:18.210> but

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
instead of having to reassemble it but

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.780 
instead of having to reassemble it but
there's<00:06:19.860> not<00:06:20.010> much<00:06:20.160> you<00:06:20.190> can<00:06:20.400> do<00:06:20.550> about<00:06:20.640> that

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
there's not much you can do about that

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.980 
there's not much you can do about that
then<00:06:21.390> that<00:06:21.890> Allspark<00:06:22.890> is<00:06:23.010> not<00:06:23.220> just<00:06:23.490> Bullock's

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
then that Allspark is not just Bullock's

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:31.090 
then that Allspark is not just Bullock's
it<00:06:25.430> is<00:06:26.430> an<00:06:26.610> actual<00:06:27.560> be<00:06:28.560> here<00:06:29.480> actually<00:06:30.480> just<00:06:30.750> a

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
it is an actual be here actually just a

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.490 
it is an actual be here actually just a
basic<00:06:32.100> marble<00:06:32.730> just<00:06:33.330> painted<00:06:34.400> blue<00:06:36.500> instead

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
basic marble just painted blue instead

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.840 
basic marble just painted blue instead
of<00:06:37.650> just<00:06:37.830> a<00:06:37.920> little<00:06:38.130> plastic<00:06:38.400> piece<00:06:38.610> which<00:06:38.820> is

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
of just a little plastic piece which is

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.810 
of just a little plastic piece which is
a<00:06:39.090> real<00:06:39.720> nice<00:06:39.990> touch<00:06:40.260> that<00:06:40.650> like<00:06:42.380> now<00:06:43.380> like<00:06:43.820> I

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
a real nice touch that like now like I

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.340 
a real nice touch that like now like I
said<00:06:44.850> this<00:06:45.150> is<00:06:45.330> the<00:06:45.360> main<00:06:45.630> reason<00:06:45.990> i<00:06:46.020> got<00:06:46.080> the

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
said this is the main reason i got the

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.440 
said this is the main reason i got the
set<00:06:46.560> do<00:06:47.070> I<00:06:47.100> think<00:06:47.430> it's<00:06:47.520> worth<00:06:47.730> it<00:06:47.850> yes<00:06:48.060> because

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450 
set do I think it's worth it yes because

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.800 
set do I think it's worth it yes because
I<00:06:48.540> really<00:06:48.810> wanted<00:06:49.110> to<00:06:49.170> animate<00:06:49.830> Allspark<00:06:50.810> but

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
I really wanted to animate Allspark but

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.130 
I really wanted to animate Allspark but
it<00:06:52.560> comes<00:06:52.890> with<00:06:52.980> so<00:06:53.280> much<00:06:53.460> a<00:06:53.520> little<00:06:54.140> drunk

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140 
it comes with so much a little drunk

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.420 
it comes with so much a little drunk
that<00:06:55.350> I<00:06:55.380> really<00:06:55.650> didn't<00:06:55.860> care<00:06:55.890> about<00:06:56.070> like

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
that I really didn't care about like

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.100 
that I really didn't care about like
like<00:06:56.940> the<00:06:57.090> key<00:06:58.550> but<00:06:59.550> I<00:06:59.580> do<00:06:59.670> overall<00:07:00.390> think<00:07:00.990> that

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
like the key but I do overall think that

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.070 
like the key but I do overall think that
the<00:07:01.380> set<00:07:01.590> is<00:07:01.740> worth<00:07:01.950> it<00:07:02.160> at<00:07:02.310> instead<00:07:03.240> of<00:07:03.270> a<00:07:03.420> fan

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
the set is worth it at instead of a fan
