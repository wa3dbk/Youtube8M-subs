turbulence or something like that um but
it's<00:00:20.550> worth<00:00:20.670> twenty<00:00:21.060> gamerscore<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.869> all<00:00:22.050> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it's worth twenty gamerscore and all you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.290 
it's worth twenty gamerscore and all you
have<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.949> play<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.850> mission

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
have to do is play on the mission

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
turbulence on recruit so you start off

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.620 
turbulence on recruit so you start off
and<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.619> president's<00:00:29.490> airplane<00:00:30.119> Russian

are gonna go crazy explosions and um
this<00:01:03.960> admission<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> fun<00:01:05.610> because

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
this admission is a lot of fun because

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.870 
this admission is a lot of fun because
of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> zero<00:01:06.659> gravity<00:01:06.869> part<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.640> only

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
of the zero gravity part and it's only

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
of the zero gravity part and it's only
going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> take<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.360> about<00:01:09.479> two<00:01:09.720> three

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
minutes get this mission or this

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.679 
minutes get this mission or this
achievement<00:01:12.420> unless<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:14.130> um<00:01:14.689> get

achievement unless you do not get um get
on<00:01:15.810> your<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.200> try<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> took<00:01:17.130> me<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
on your first try which it took me a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.609 
on your first try which it took me a
couple<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:18.020> tries<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.830> finally<00:01:19.860> got<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
couple of tries but I finally got it so

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.190 
couple of tries but I finally got it so

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
some good aim in some zero gravity it's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.460 
some good aim in some zero gravity it's
quite<00:01:28.409> fun<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> they're<00:01:30.659> talking<00:01:31.079> everything

I'm just fooling around so your gunfire
people<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.960> yelling<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> stuff<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:39.180> can

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
people are yelling and stuff you can

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.220 
people are yelling and stuff you can
tell<00:01:39.509> somethings<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.170> go<00:01:40.259> down

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
tell somethings about to go down

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.510 
tell somethings about to go down
it<00:01:42.350> was<00:01:42.800> like<00:01:42.950> with<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.250> present<00:01:43.640> down<00:01:45.520> and

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it was like with the present down and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.800 
it was like with the present down and
all<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.780> sudden<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.880> door<00:01:50.590> goes<00:01:51.590> boom<00:01:52.810> so

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
all of a sudden the door goes boom so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.630 
all of a sudden the door goes boom so
you're<00:01:54.260> going<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.650> kill<00:01:54.890> those<00:01:55.100> two<00:01:55.130> people

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
you're going to kill those two people

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.540 
you're going to kill those two people
you're<00:01:56.300> going<00:01:56.480> to<00:01:56.540> take<00:01:56.810> one<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.230> their<00:01:57.500> aks<00:01:58.220> I

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
you're going to take one of their aks I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.380 
you're going to take one of their aks I
did<00:01:59.450> not<00:01:59.570> use<00:01:59.930> mine<00:02:00.260> but<00:02:00.970> it's<00:02:01.970> probably

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
did not use mine but it's probably

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.200 
did not use mine but it's probably
helpful<00:02:02.810> if<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.170> use<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.040> anyway<00:02:04.370> you're

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
helpful if you use it so anyway you're

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.660 
helpful if you use it so anyway you're
gonna<00:02:05.720> pop<00:02:06.380> up<00:02:06.410> into<00:02:07.010> this<00:02:07.160> little<00:02:07.840> area<00:02:08.840> and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
gonna pop up into this little area and

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.840 
gonna pop up into this little area and
you're<00:02:10.670> gonna<00:02:10.790> go<00:02:10.940> zero<00:02:11.210> gravity<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.850> there's

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
you're gonna go zero gravity and there's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
you're gonna go zero gravity and there's
going<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> be<00:02:14.090> five<00:02:14.360> people<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.350> are<00:02:15.470> enemies

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
going to be five people that are enemies

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.100 
going to be five people that are enemies
