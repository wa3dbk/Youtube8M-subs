will<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.009> much<00:01:41.280> lower<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.090> all

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
will be much lower because it's all

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420 
will be much lower because it's all
composite<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.710> savings<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
composite and the savings are going to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.690 
composite and the savings are going to
be<00:01:44.549> significant<00:01:45.680> what<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.799> our<00:01:46.920> target<00:01:47.159> market

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
be significant what is our target market

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.550 
be significant what is our target market
basically<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.479> initial<00:01:48.930> airplane<00:01:49.320> we

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
basically with this initial airplane we

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
basically with this initial airplane we
are<00:01:49.649> targeting<00:01:49.920> flight<00:01:50.399> schools<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.149> initial

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
are targeting flight schools in initial

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
are targeting flight schools in initial
flight<00:01:51.810> training<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> biggest

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
flight training one of the biggest

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.940 
flight training one of the biggest
barriers<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:54.540> now<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> flying<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.649> people

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
barriers right now to flying for people

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
barriers right now to flying for people
is<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> cost<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.640> flying<00:01:56.790> there's<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
is the cost of flying there's a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.569 
is the cost of flying there's a
tremendous<00:01:57.990> pilot<00:01:58.380> shortages<00:01:58.860> coming<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.369> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
tremendous pilot shortages coming up and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
tremendous pilot shortages coming up and
we<00:02:00.090> want<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.390> make<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> affordable<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
we want to make it affordable with the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.679 
we want to make it affordable with the
ATP<00:02:01.770> requirements<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> 1500<00:02:03.450> hours

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
ATP requirements to get up to 1500 hours

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.929 
ATP requirements to get up to 1500 hours
right<00:02:03.899> now<00:02:03.979> we'll<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.100> able<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> cut<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> cost

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
right now we'll be able to cut the cost

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.310 
right now we'll be able to cut the cost
of<00:02:06.090> somebody<00:02:06.390> getting<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.750> license<00:02:07.140> by

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
of somebody getting a license by

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.529 
of somebody getting a license by
probably<00:02:07.979> 60<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.550> 80<00:02:08.700> percent

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
probably 60 to 80 percent

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.809 
probably 60 to 80 percent
a<00:02:09.569> little<00:02:10.439> bit<00:02:10.530> about<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.920> solar<00:02:11.159> aspects<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
a little bit about the solar aspects of

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.089 
a little bit about the solar aspects of
the<00:02:11.909> airplane<00:02:12.329> as<00:02:13.049> you<00:02:13.230> see<00:02:13.439> that<00:02:13.620> wing<00:02:13.920> has

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
the airplane as you see that wing has

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.670 
the airplane as you see that wing has
solar<00:02:14.370> panels<00:02:14.819> on<00:02:14.939> each<00:02:15.090> side<00:02:15.409> basically<00:02:16.409> what

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
solar panels on each side basically what

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.229 
solar panels on each side basically what
that<00:02:16.709> does<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.549> of<00:02:17.670> people<00:02:17.909> look<00:02:18.090> at

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that does and a lot of people look at

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.009 
that does and a lot of people look at
doing<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.769> adds<00:02:19.909> 15%<00:02:20.909> plus<00:02:21.329> or<00:02:21.569> minus<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.930> little

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
doing is adds 15% plus or minus a little

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.929 
doing is adds 15% plus or minus a little
bit<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.469> in-flight<00:02:23.040> duration<00:02:23.579> but<00:02:23.760> more

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
bit to in-flight duration but more

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.339 
bit to in-flight duration but more
especially<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.659> park<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.019> airplane

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
especially you can park the airplane

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.550 
especially you can park the airplane
outside<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:26.129> two<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.090> three<00:02:27.120> days<00:02:27.299> it<00:02:28.260> will

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
outside in two to three days it will

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.869 
outside in two to three days it will
basically<00:02:28.769> recharge<00:02:29.609> itself<00:02:30.000> at<00:02:30.510> no<00:02:30.780> cost

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
basically recharge itself at no cost

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.309 
basically recharge itself at no cost
like<00:02:32.879> what<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.359> our<00:02:33.480> target<00:02:33.840> price<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
like what is our target price for the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.440 
like what is our target price for the
airplane<00:02:34.680> basically<00:02:35.519> we<00:02:35.849> are<00:02:35.879> looking<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.359> get

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
airplane basically we are looking to get

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.050 
airplane basically we are looking to get
the<00:02:36.569> airplane<00:02:36.810> produces<00:02:37.849> inexpensively<00:02:38.849> or

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
the airplane produces inexpensively or

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.670 
the airplane produces inexpensively or
cost<00:02:39.269> efficiently<00:02:39.810> as<00:02:39.959> possible<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.590> we

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
cost efficiently as possible and we

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.979 
cost efficiently as possible and we
believe<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.129> cost<00:02:41.370> will<00:02:41.609> be<00:02:41.840> 180,000<00:02:42.840> or

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
believe the cost will be 180,000 or

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.679 
believe the cost will be 180,000 or
below<00:02:43.519> which<00:02:44.519> may<00:02:44.730> seem<00:02:44.939> a<00:02:44.970> little<00:02:45.060> high<00:02:45.389> for<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
below which may seem a little high for a

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.119 
below which may seem a little high for a
two-seat<00:02:46.049> trainer<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.859> look<00:02:47.010> at

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
two-seat trainer but when you look at

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.770 
two-seat trainer but when you look at
the<00:02:47.250> cost<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.669> operations<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.389> you<00:02:48.540> save

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the cost of operations that you save

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.240 
the cost of operations that you save
within<00:02:49.169> the<00:02:49.260> first<00:02:49.500> year<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.859> two<00:02:50.010> you'll

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
within the first year the two you'll

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.490 
within the first year the two you'll
have<00:02:50.370> made<00:02:50.549> back<00:02:50.760> all<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.419> money<00:02:51.659> and<00:02:51.870> be

have made back all of that money and be
