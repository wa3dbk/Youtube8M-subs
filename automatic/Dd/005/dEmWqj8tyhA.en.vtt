00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
really interesting and if only there was

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.100 
really interesting and if only there was
some<00:05:29.250> channel<00:05:30.060> of<00:05:30.150> communication<00:05:30.870> with<00:05:31.020> the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
some channel of communication with the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.390 
some channel of communication with the
mainstream<00:05:31.289> I'm<00:05:31.800> sure<00:05:31.979> people<00:05:32.219> would

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
mainstream I'm sure people would

was a channel of communication with the
mainstream<00:05:36.000> I'm<00:05:36.449> sure<00:05:36.960> people<00:05:37.169> wouldn't<00:05:37.560> like

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680
