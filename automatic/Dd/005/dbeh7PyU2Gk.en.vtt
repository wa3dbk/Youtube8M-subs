00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.540 
batad I haven't got any yet and I
wouldn't<00:00:47.879> make<00:00:47.940> any<00:00:48.059> media<00:00:48.539> any<00:00:48.930> rare<00:00:49.230> ones<00:00:49.550> so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.939 
wouldn't make any media any rare ones so
this<00:00:50.700> has<00:00:50.850> 112<00:00:51.660> chance<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.410> each<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.920> can

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
this has 112 chance of each you can

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130 
this has 112 chance of each you can
collect<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.969> none<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> these<00:00:55.110> are

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.479 
collect them all so none of these are
rare<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:56.039> chances<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.969> much<00:00:57.510> better

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
rare so the chances are much much better

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.930 
rare so the chances are much much better
than<00:00:59.489> one<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.480> 72<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.800> without<00:01:02.489> much<00:01:02.789> further

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
than one of 72 so without much further

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.429
