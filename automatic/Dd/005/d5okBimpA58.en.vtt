 4 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.480
 you just finished the white phase the runners and the ridges are good 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.000
 oriented in other words the colors of the crown correspond to the colors 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.329
 rescue centers 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.539
 return the cube to better see the opposite sides to the white face 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.989
 we have four stops not placed the stops orange blue 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.099
 blue red the red berengere 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.460
 to solve the beautiful blue orange we seek the rubik's cube 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.070
 here she's right next 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.210
 often you have to look for the edges of the second floor on the top floor 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.260
 it is much more practical to make the resolution there will always be one 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.570
 gust of wind that will be on the top face first quarter we will place 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.660
 the strange blue art instead of the pearl for red we want the rule 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.860
 in August of the phase passes on the right side as on the drawing he makes sure 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.470
 what the color of the beast is aligned with one of the two centers in this 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.500
 case it is the orange center perform the following movements 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.280
 why right ward rc 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.980
 right poured 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.870
 to reverse face pour 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.220
 why bonnart face was well placed and well oriented second 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.009
 possibility 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.920
 the color is on the right phase in the center and you want to do it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.499
 to pass in front of you on the right side as on this death 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.660
 the color aligned on the right face 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.490
 just now they were lined up on the left 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.730
 the green wave has to go instead of the red 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.200
 in the following movements to reverse and then reverse 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.010
 in front 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.729
 why whose act to reverse inverted rights 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.030
 Yes 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.979
 the stop of red glass that he was well placed 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.939
 third possibility no stop of the 2nd floor net on the last floor 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.600
 v 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.689
 yes the blue rhetoric must take the place of the rejoinder rejoice 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.130
 the idea was to get out its edges and bring them to the face of the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.129
 bridge to then be able to restore them to their plasma needs 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.449
 with the formula just now to the right fpi to invert right inverted 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:23.529
 to invert coface pour aubin he fascinates in this example the restaurant 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.610
 I did not place well but she went out to get this stop to go 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:33.409
 according to centers catherine again the formula the right water to reverse 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.999
 right poured oah showers and a face to pour boris face watteled that 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.479
 bringing in all the edges you want to place
