00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
my opinion this is the best Harry Potter

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.890 
my opinion this is the best Harry Potter
film<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.400> they've<00:03:50.520> made<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:50.910> far<00:03:51.120> it's<00:03:51.390> it's

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
film that they've made so far it's it's

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.200 
film that they've made so far it's it's
perfect<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.620> books<00:03:52.920> always<00:03:53.340> really<00:03:53.970> bring

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
perfect the books always really bring

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.210 
perfect the books always really bring
the<00:03:54.240> emotion<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.870> life<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.260> sometimes<00:03:55.860> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
the emotion to life and sometimes the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.620 
the emotion to life and sometimes the
films<00:03:56.490> have<00:03:56.640> lacked<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.270> because<00:03:57.510> they

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
films have lacked that is because they

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.060 
films have lacked that is because they
have<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.900> fit<00:03:58.110> all<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.500> plot<00:03:58.680> elements

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
have to fit all of the plot elements

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.770 
have to fit all of the plot elements
into<00:03:59.250> two<00:03:59.400> hours<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.420> first<00:04:00.540> time<00:04:00.690> I

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
into two hours and for the first time I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.000 
into two hours and for the first time I
think<00:04:00.930> they<00:04:01.140> got<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.440> marriage<00:04:01.590> perfect

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
think they got the marriage perfect

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.970 
think they got the marriage perfect
between<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:03.090> emotion<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.750> action<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.650> it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
between the emotion and the action so it

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.280 
between the emotion and the action so it
was<00:04:05.130> great<00:04:05.250> for<00:04:05.520> me<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.660> visual<00:04:06.989> effects

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
was great for me and the visual effects

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.560

are<00:04:07.530> breathtaking<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.430> forget<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.450> these

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
are breathtaking you forget that these

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.940 
are breathtaking you forget that these
movies<00:04:09.900> could<00:04:10.020> not<00:04:10.170> be<00:04:10.290> made<00:04:10.470> without<00:04:10.680> all

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950
