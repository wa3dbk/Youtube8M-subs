00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 gÃ¼iza what happened welcome to pronounced 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.389
 with light light ours and I good and we 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.389
 they are not but I'm still the hector emphasis 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:23.519
 and people think because there is no longer 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.050
 to comment that the rhythm is here today 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.460
 with us because I talked to him and he 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.560
 said he 's on vacation and not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.910
 is at home so if it's not a little 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.619
 would be with us to clarify what has 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.719
 happened with the series but but can not 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.469
 be here so let's explain 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.050
 david and I clear and also like so that 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.700
 do not despair so much let's do it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 as soon as possible because it 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.570
 enough time that they look for it if 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.940
 leave in the comments of all 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.140
 channels that told me so they are 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.219
 expanding all videos in plan what 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.219
 happened what happened what happened 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:03.559
 the director hector because he said to me 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.559
 is saying that he worked 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.040
 and so the funny thing is that I also 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.690
 they commented on the plan because it was just 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.340
 when we stop recording and we go 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.890
 postponing the digital recording and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.570
 they started saying that they will start counting 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.979
 curious to you and it is that it was 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.270
 because we had already stopped recording and not 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.400
 had with him to record and appeared 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.990
 puddles but it was not because I did not want 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.729
 record with you that people what 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.010
 I was saying no, you do not have things that 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.750
 they are not true not nothing to see chau in 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.220
 the thing is that as they have to understand 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.210
 that we are besides that we are countries 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.130
 different schedules are 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.020
 completely different we both have 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.910
 channels I enjoy for example actor and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.350
 timid me that I have two also that 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.290
 now I have to think to server in 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.840
 channel nou little and receives has its 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.640
 channel is obviously difficult to square well 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.200
 and for and someone of week that already follows 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.910
 on the stock market because we did not do 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.340
 other problems that were arising that 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.479
 yesterday hector explains all that explains 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.780
 It makes you a while, but we were not 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.750
 recording because I just come back to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.460
 explain me then not if the case is 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.229
 that when we started recording 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.550
 people just think that the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.500
 we know about a lifetime and it did not come out 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.090
 I had done the interview from and had 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.980
 talked to rich on twitter and some 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.450
 once by skype and then and then we 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
 we really put together three people who do not 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.730
 we knew each other 100% and at the beginning 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.140
 we squared perfectly but between 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.550
 messes we had each with our 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 life on our vital YouTube channel 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.330
 every time we start having less time 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.280
 to record some days we do not record 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.739
 then the next 10 grams of 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.770
 suddenly three episodes or four in a 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.000
 day and we ended up even overwhelmed and every 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.709
 Once we start to have each one more 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.540
 with our channel and such and there was 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.860
 rubbing because obviously we do not usually do 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.780
 a series with two people to do 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.220
 three a do a series with three and that 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.410
 we do not know each other really 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.170
 very very very good 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.000
 that another rubbing and finally the desire 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.080
 that we have as desire as those 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.940
 we have at the beginning they left 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.620
 dissipating and then we stop recording 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.590
 without saying anything that was wrong but 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.190
 we stop recording but removing when 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.019
 it killed me it stung me very fast if it ended 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.600
 the series that's why people will say no 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.100
 to continue but if it is no longer the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.260
 good wave as aristeo would touch the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.280
 there is no longer a principle that we have 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.100
 now each of our days with 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.230
 our channel 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.450
 In addition, many comments are 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.430
 saying that I kind of like the wave every 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.750
 Once it was going off by turning off and 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.070
 now basically that's why because I mean 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.810
 we who serve us those who 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.730
 we live well but afterwards we like 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.110
 deal with the wave like we do not finish 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.240
 talking a lot and in the end just 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.660
 we ended up joining us to record 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:37.610
 just and that in between as obligation and 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.320
 do not record with people you talk to 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.760
 every day and play several games and 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.560
 one of those parts because already record is 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.200
 when more natural and better is left but if 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.060
 you record with people and do not do anything else 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.580
 that what you record because it does not not cool 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.960
 Of course, there certainly if anyone wants the 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.460
 map of what we were playing 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.800
 unfortunately we will not be able to 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.850
 get it since the server is died 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.400
 because it is not, the thing was that I 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.500
 I scheduled to be paid only every 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.450
 week was paid only I retired the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.670
 money on the card every week but not 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.530
 I know what the fuck happened that did not have to be 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.120
 manually I did not manually and the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.880
 server can fuck and that costs 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.440
 min other reasons that was pretty 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.850
 curious in plane you're going to record this 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.489
 week 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.030
 I see it complicated by 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.440
 I do not think you said I do not have time 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.940
 and then apart you said good and 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.360
 I also think that the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.020
 server server is not connected was 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.660
 I eat well 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.080
 but in the same way that someday what 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.530
 invited and makes more good departure and 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.720
 laughter 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.400
 yes, I will win if it is for example 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.199
 interesting to win is but then like 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.270
 in favor of hunger are very bad is 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.150
 I also say that I am very bad at 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.430
 hunger games I have fiber optics like this 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.430
 that already like the last
