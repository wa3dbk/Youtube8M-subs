00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:15.500
 good together we are here 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:19.690
 the family that we are here 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.690
 to have the family that I want 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.350
 this is 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.990
 the affirmation in front of the post of 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.720
 puerto rico town that those who 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.510
 we believe in marriage and family 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.809
 as it has always been normal natural 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.899
 we are the majority and that we are not going to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.500
 allow you to be in that institution so 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.420
 important has been disrupted that there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.220
 that protect something that is important 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.890
 and that is 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.010
 people bought the truth that they 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.860
 we communicated and communicated it to others 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.990
 pastors to their church to their communities 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.620
 and that 's why we're here, this is 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:09.310
 the product of the body's work of 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.409
 a united church where each one occupies 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.289
 and do the work 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.750
 they get up like we never go out to 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.930
 defend the family 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.800
 as already established between a man and 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.510
 a woman 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.090
 and he will rise and the glory is for 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.490
 god we get up and here is the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.070
 answer there are more than 100 thousand believers 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.550
 here and they keep coming for the glory of 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.570
 god for it to be seen that a minority does not 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.420
 can establish what the majority in 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.940
 a democracy in which he expresses himself 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.220
 is that in defense of the family in 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.430
 defense of values in defense of 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.830
 marriage in defense of children here 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.140
 we are for the glory of God we can and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.730
 that went to life as a Christian and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.940
 citizenship of the people was going to life 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.330
 life went away because you could 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.690
 then not express indicates that 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.250
 we accept not talking implies that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.590
 we tolerate we become accomplices if we do not 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.750
 we make in our pronunciations 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.820
 true so I thank you what 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.730
 that the town understood it and here 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.060
 we are all united by a cause the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.260
 family children and marriages 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.260
 we are here 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.180
 this is a historic moment for port 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.880
 rich where all the sectors that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.610
 profess the Christian faith people who do not 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.880
 they go to no church and even people 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.590
 with gay conduct they have said present 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.770
 all of us who defend marriage 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.420
 unique and biological according to what it establishes 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.360
 the word of God we are not making an appointment 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.970
 so this is an event that marks a 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.220
 new story in this country people from 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.520
 all religious and social sectors 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.530
 we are saying present validating what 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.310
 that we believe marriage 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.290
 heterosexual and traditional family 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.860
 by the attempt that there is of some sector 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.650
 reduced minimum of changing 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.690
 the way of living and living together 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.930
 human beings in this country in the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.220
 dignity of the human being is inviolable 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.530
 regardless of their creed of their 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.070
 political ideas of his religious life of 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.130
 your race is a democracy as a port 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.050
 rich- we enjoy having that great 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.360
 blessing to be able to say present and 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.680
 speak and advocate for those who do not 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.680
 they have the opportunity 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.930
 this is vital in the development of 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:50.709
 life of puerto rico- the town of dios- 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.200
 as never before has he responded not to 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.620
 called our fate to the call of God 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.230
 to defend the values of the family that 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.109
 they are not negotiable, it is not a time of 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.019
 confrontation is a time to raise 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.379
 what God has determined for the 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.450
 family not only in the aspect of 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.689
 marriage between a man and a woman 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.720
 but in the aspect of morality for everything 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:19.440
 the town of puerto rico and beyond 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.440
 Puerto Rico
