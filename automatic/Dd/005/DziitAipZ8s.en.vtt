the actual curly weave is I know that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
the actual curly weave is I know that
sounds<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> gross<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
sounds kind of gross to you all but I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.439 
sounds kind of gross to you all but I
did<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> salon<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.579> few<00:00:56.879> times<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.329> get

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
did go to the salon a few times to get

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
did go to the salon a few times to get
it<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> deep<00:00:58.079> wash<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
it like a deep wash now on one of the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.099 
it like a deep wash now on one of the
other<00:00:59.579> reasons<00:00:59.789> why<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.570> she<00:01:00.719> told<00:01:00.960> me

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
other reasons why I think she told me

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 
other reasons why I think she told me
not<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.440> wash<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.550> roots<00:01:02.850> whenever<00:01:03.239> I

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
not to wash like the roots whenever I

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
not to wash like the roots whenever I
washed<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.220> mildew

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
washed it was that you get that mildew

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.320 
washed it was that you get that mildew
buildup<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:07.020> blow<00:01:07.320> dry<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.619> hair

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
buildup if you don't blow dry your hair

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
buildup if you don't blow dry your hair
correctly<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.260> once<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> wash

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
correctly because you know once you wash

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.530 
correctly because you know once you wash
it<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> weave<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.640> needs<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.119> very

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it with the weave it needs to be very

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
it with the weave it needs to be very
very<00:01:12.659> dry<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.920> again<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
very dry so again you don't get that

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.920 
very dry so again you don't get that
buildup<00:01:15.299> um<00:01:15.650> but<00:01:16.650> also<00:01:16.920> i<00:01:17.130> use<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
buildup um but also i use this here the

I won't even get into that whole the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700 
I won't even get into that whole the
whole<00:01:53.729> politics<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.600> natural<00:01:55.049> hair<00:01:55.200> versus

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
whole politics of natural hair versus

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.969 
whole politics of natural hair versus

whatever is your prerogative I've had it
all<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:01.890> I've<00:02:02.009> gotten<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.549> level

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
all and I think I've gotten to the level

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.700 
all and I think I've gotten to the level
of<00:02:02.850> maturity<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.509> my<00:02:03.659> life<00:02:03.960> where<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> just

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
of maturity in my life where I just

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.830 
of maturity in my life where I just
enjoy<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.250> all<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> political

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
enjoy it all so it's not a political

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.469 
enjoy it all so it's not a political
stance<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.649> me<00:02:07.799> having<00:02:08.220> now

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
stance for me having now

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.029 
stance for me having now
your<00:02:08.629> hair<00:02:08.869> even<00:02:09.200> though<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.349> guess<00:02:09.619> having<00:02:09.950> an

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
your hair even though I guess having an

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.680 
your hair even though I guess having an
afro<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.519> is<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> political<00:02:11.239> stance<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.629> a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
afro it is a political stance to a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.690 
afro it is a political stance to a
certain<00:02:11.989> extent<00:02:12.319> but<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:13.040> not<00:02:13.220> meant<00:02:13.549> to<00:02:13.670> be

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
certain extent but it's not meant to be

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.490 
certain extent but it's not meant to be
that<00:02:13.970> way<00:02:14.030> more<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:14.750> me<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.110> meant<00:02:15.349> to<00:02:15.470> be

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
that way more so for me it's meant to be

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.520 
that way more so for me it's meant to be
me<00:02:16.069> expressing<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.879> loving<00:02:17.180> myself<00:02:17.530> every
