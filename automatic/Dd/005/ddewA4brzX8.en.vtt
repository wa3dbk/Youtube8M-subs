00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 hello love rummenigge when I first 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 Let's do it myself but wanted to do it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.029
 me that somehow because of me 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.869
 complicated imagined forever ago 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.550
 pushed me 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.470
 but when I attacked then 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.029
 I could say it is 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.040
 not complicated at all 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.869
 Of course you can also do an art here 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.309
 make it out of it and a bit he goes 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.649
 on this Christmas pasta here in this 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.809
 direction but from the principle is the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.399
 pasta making really quite simple 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.800
 and probably because of that too 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.660
 held for millennia because we 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 maybe from my video too 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 World Children's Day is the oldest one 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.800
 Excavation found building already 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.109
 4000 years old we do today 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.719
 First of all , we make pasta 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.269
 secondly, it jeopardizes this fits 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.399
 green and third how do you bring in 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.260
 a christmas specific form so that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.730
 It's both for a Christmas dinner 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.569
 as well as for a christmas present 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.930
 is 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.909
 we need mail for that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.470
 and there are very different ones 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.540
 the most common 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.729
 is durum wheat semolina with wheat flour too 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.950
 mix and nothing else is here too 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 this finished pasta mail 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.920
 and I already have that with several 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.540
 food retailers in any case 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.250
 seen in the buying country at real 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.180
 I can only recommend you we need 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.189
 salt and for coloring spinach on 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.509
 best fresh spinach but it 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.060
 works as well as with me here 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 please deep-frozen variant alternatively 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 can also color herbs on 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.600
 best basil and, of course, too 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.219
 We use food coloring 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.880
 start with the preparation of the green 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.159
 dye 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 I add the cultivated spinach to it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.440
 briefly cut in the mixer 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.380
 little 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.060
 and then transfer the mass into a sieve 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 a bowl so that the juice 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.250
 drain can press the spinach 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.660
 something with a wooden spoon yes and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 Eventually it has dripped off 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.290
 this liquid we fill into 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.520
 drops on a hot stove plate and 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.080
 I hear you again now 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.030
 scold because of the waste of energy 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.890
 but I have no smaller stove plate 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.410
 so now everything must be brought to a boil 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.330
 Be and stay there when it is 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.790
 then you start cooking the pot 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.960
 quickly escape heat what we do 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.850
 doing here is really only the 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.860
 producing a chlorophyll extract 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.020
 this is at the top of the list 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.450
 liquid ab is also called spinach 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.250
 mat he has been in the last time 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.320
 all through johann lafer means 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.930
 Cookery is known again, however 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.070
 actually a familiar one 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.260
 preparation already by sophie 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.510
 dates scheibler a cookbook 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.380
 authors who lived in the 18th century 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.120
 has been described 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.400
 So now cook up on the stove 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.440
 and this upper intense green layer 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.930
 Let's take a look now that we will 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.100
 need to color 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.870
 By the way, the rest would not have 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.880
 throw away but makes easy 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.890
 Ice cubes could come out later 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.959
 someday for smoothies or for 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.720
 use colorize other food 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.459
 but now ran a noodle dough to give 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.050
 we from the pastor picture into a bowl 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:15.950
 Give the eggs a little salt 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.140
 edit everything briefly with the kneading hook 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.280
 and then give of our chlorophyll 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.379
 Extract everything further with the 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.120
 you will edit the crochet hook 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.780
 dough is slowly taking a green 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.450
 coloring 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.610
 without further notice pasta without making 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.069
 Later we will go a little less far so far 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.989
 is that from the key edge to ground 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.269
 solve starts then take it out 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.280
 chosen with the pastor one 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.349
 Work a bit and knead dough 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.299
 with the hands again through properly 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.830
 I would say at least five 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.830
 minutes ten minutes are even better 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.480
 then wrap them in 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.200
 fresh foil and provides the dough of 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.920
 about half an hour cool 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.590
 then you choose one again 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.569
 Work surface take the chilled dough 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.790
 Trend of a piece of it just so 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.739
 much we wanted to work on at the moment 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.349
 Wrap up rest and roll it back 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.060
 dough then thin out the optimum 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.440
 thickness is a millimeter but 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.000
 if it's a little more or less 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.630
 still can eat christmas 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.250
 be beautiful 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.769
 So far we have pasta dough 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.450
 prepared this green colored missing 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.280
 the Christmas aspect and the 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.260
 means by means of suitable cookie cutters 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.760
 We only lend it in the lend 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.830
 Christmassy touch and I take 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.840
 cookie cutter in breakdown tree shape 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.300
 but this works with heart monden 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.070
 or pay in the same way and around 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.810
 to bring in a little variety like 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.169
 So me cookie cutter in different 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.169
 sizes 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.640
 then the peeled pasta parts to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.780
 Dry on a grid often lay that 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.250
 he previously gave some baking paper 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.990
 and when this dough is processed 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.650
 So let's grab the next piece 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.760
 and everything starts all over again 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.590
 by the way, if the pasta is not like that 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.150
 you can artfully design them 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.800
 with a knife also quite easy in 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.020
 strip and then stop 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.460
 green noodles then everything 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.110
 Let it dry overnight 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.720
 notice that the green one too 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.120
 little darkens and finished is ours 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.090
 Christmas pasta and whether he is now with 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.680
 high-contrast red tomato sauce 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.660
 prepared or packaged in a sachet and 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.700
 giving away is entirely up to you 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.320
 I think that's a very original idea 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.230
 I wish you much fun 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.240
 make yourself and then someday right 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.890
 Enjoy your meal 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.080
 if, however, rather just something with 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.220
 would like to prepare green noodles 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.340
 example green tagliatelle with 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.940
 smoked salmon but not a green one 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.370
 stay 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.710
 Spaghetti with green sauce are better 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.460
 then just have a look 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.680
 videos into it 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.150
 I still have to say until the 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.150
 Next time when
