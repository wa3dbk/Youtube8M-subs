00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
science this is a very quick tutorial

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.980 
science this is a very quick tutorial
using<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.569> canon<00:00:06.960> t2i<00:00:08.179> to<00:00:09.179> do<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> green<00:00:09.780> screen

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
using the canon t2i to do a green screen

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.499 
using the canon t2i to do a green screen
setup<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:11.160> I've<00:00:11.490> done<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> couple<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.480> things

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
setup so I've done a couple of things

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.099 
setup so I've done a couple of things
here<00:00:12.870> one<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.799> can<00:00:13.980> see<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> microphone<00:00:15.109> I

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
here one you can see the microphone I

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
here one you can see the microphone I
had<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.890> synchronize<00:00:17.369> these<00:00:17.609> because<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> t21

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
had to synchronize these because the t21

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.650 
had to synchronize these because the t21
doesn't<00:00:18.960> flow<00:00:19.380> directly<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:20.070> Camtasia<00:00:20.660> also

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
doesn't flow directly into Camtasia also

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.609 
doesn't flow directly into Camtasia also
I<00:00:21.689> used<00:00:21.900> Camtasia<00:00:23.269> from<00:00:24.269> TechSmith<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.900> order

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
I used Camtasia from TechSmith in order

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.720 
I used Camtasia from TechSmith in order
to<00:00:25.859> grab<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> video<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.480> edit<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.730> had

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to grab the video in and edit it I had

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
to grab the video in and edit it I had
to<00:00:29.880> flip<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.539> camera<00:00:31.550> video<00:00:32.550> upside<00:00:32.969> down<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
to flip the camera video upside down you

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.780 
to flip the camera video upside down you
can<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.950> hanging<00:00:35.190> off<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> my<00:00:35.760> desk

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
tricks like this clap so then i can get

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
tricks like this clap so then i can get
the<00:01:49.350> audio<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.740> video<00:01:50.100> synced<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.780> a

the audio and video synced up this is a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.109 
the audio and video synced up this is a
whole<00:01:52.140> lot<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> work<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.070> here<00:01:53.340> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
