00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
as well I was confused because I thought

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
as well I was confused because I thought
for<00:01:58.560> sure<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.950> still<00:01:59.040> fit<00:01:59.280> free<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.640> then

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
for sure it was still fit free but then

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.160 
for sure it was still fit free but then
I<00:01:59.790> realized<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.270> lot<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.479> people<00:02:00.570> say<00:02:00.810> sulfate

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
I realized a lot of people say sulfate
free<00:02:01.320> shampoo<00:02:01.490> does<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.729> lather<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
free shampoo does it lather and this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.630 
free shampoo does it lather and this
stuff<00:02:03.899> lathers<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.920> I'm<00:02:05.130> actually<00:02:05.250> kind<00:02:05.579> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
stuff lathers so I'm actually kind of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.089 
stuff lathers so I'm actually kind of
confused<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.540> don't<00:02:07.469> think<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.979> has

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
