00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello dear friends and subscribers 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.350
 the priest is with you again and today I will show you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.610
 how to connect yusbi modem asus tablet 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.519
 google nexus 7 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.620
 for this you need 4 things 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.540
 Actually usb modem for example 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.580
 How I have this modem intertelekom 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.660
 from the company the highway I purchased it in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.519
 box building for 360 hryvnia before 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.289
 so as it still connect the tablet you 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.679
 need to connect either computer 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.430
 either to the laptop to set the tariff and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.570
 make the first payment 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:43.140
 Next you need the hotel cable right 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.059
 superuser and program which he 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 Iâ€™ll show you what it is called ppp widget 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.250
 you can download it for free with android 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 of the market here you can see here ppp 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:04.049
 widget tune up what you see y 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 I have it already installed so after u 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.740
 you will need to install it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.880
 withdraw 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.850
 desktop widget here you will see 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.939
 cool model for me on it and you 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.170
 will need to configure it in order 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.820
 so that he can go through the modem in 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.460
 Internet and go in more detail 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.979
 to the settings so the apn access point of this 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.979
 don't touch the username here you are 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.560
 Drive the number you give together 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.509
 with a modem, for example, as with me 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.720
 intertelecom 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:47.689
 password is when you register 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 and him through the computer here you will be him 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:55.680
 so the dialing number it can be either 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.790
 lattice three sevens for sdm and that is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.369
 for 3g or snowflake 99 snowflake snowflake 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.680
 snowflake 1 lattice for jetsam that is 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.920
 for 2g 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.509
 in my case it is a grid of three sevens 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.270
 after you have it all tunes 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.360
 you can proceed to connect 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.590
 myself 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.850
 modem tablet but do not forget to turn off 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.240
 Wi fi as may arise 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.670
 difficulties with the program and maybe 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.940
 you simply restart your tablet or 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.120
 off or just hang and every 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.680
 would we possibly like ppp widget 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.810
 the program would not have said so on stage 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.930
 beta testing is possible since she 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.709
 Well, not very adequately sometimes works 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.959
 happens connection flies well and if you 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.540
 something like that happens then not 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.310
 grieve 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.080
 you all did it right 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.650
 program trouble so now 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.020
 we connect the modem by the way about 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.489
 wifi 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.910
 why did I tell you to turn it off because 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.770
 that the modem is more exact is a ppp program 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.370
 widget 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:21.150
 use Wi-Fi antennas to display 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.510
 3g signal quality so choose ppp 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.510
 widget 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.980
 so disconnected click connect so 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.190
 dialing is connected so you see 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.890
 a wi-fi badge appeared 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.370
 but actually as you see here 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.740
 written ppp widget i.e. it is included 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.560
 Do not wi-fi connected exactly 3g 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.720
 all now successfully connected to 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.890
 Internet and you can safely use 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.110
 him but for example I would be your way 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.340
 advised to save traffic download 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.790
 opera mini for better savings let's say 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.130
 so traffic now visit some 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.130
 site well, let it be and stolen 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.770
 speed in my city 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.910
 reaches just completely upholstered with this 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.000
 certainly not enough 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.790
 But think about the fact that this Internet you 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.550
 carry with you to start the photo you see 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.680
 the site opened all pretty quickly 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.840
 just opened a mobile page 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.840
 Naturally turn on the classic 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:48.480
 so as you see everything pretty quickly and 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.000
 everything works so still i could you 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.770
 advise in order to save 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.310
 let's say traffic watch your 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.800
 to the means 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:03.090
 my there is such a widget I have it 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.540
 shows account balance on my account 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.810
 I have an intertelecom so this program 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.440
 called a balance widget can also have it 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.680
 Download for free from Play Store or 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.000
 drive there too click add here 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.870
 enter the data and here it is further you 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.330
 show your balance change so you 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.330
 can control your account also for 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.740
 traffic control I would advise 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.729
 you download the program which 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.969
 called traffic monitor that's how it is 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.489
 looks like 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.669
 here it shows separately 

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:46.839
 used traffic on the wi-fi network and 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:50.889
 2g networks or either 3g and always you 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:52.599
 let's say let's know about how much you 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.209
 traffic used 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.429
 if you have free megabytes there or 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:58.589
 if necessary depending on what 

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:02.739
 you fare 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:06.689
 so well now we push it off and 

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:08.529
 it is necessary on the first attempt does not turn off 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.989
 there is a shutdown 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.119
 if wi-fi was turned off then at the moment 

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:16.149
 disconnecting it will turn off again as you 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:19.679
 see now consist and everything happened 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:29.019
 turned off now we can bake quietly 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:31.089
 all on this I will probably finish everything 

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:33.519
 thanks for watching the likes 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:37.149
