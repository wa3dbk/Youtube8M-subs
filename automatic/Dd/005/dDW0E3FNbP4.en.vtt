enough<00:02:26.250> man<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.390> know<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> lot<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.780> people

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
enough man so you know a lot of people

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.590 
enough man so you know a lot of people
think<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.520> epic<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.120> I'm<00:02:30.240> going<00:02:30.420> this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
think that it's epic that I'm going this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.080 
think that it's epic that I'm going this
high<00:02:30.840> but<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.890> really<00:02:32.130> easy<00:02:32.430> guys<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
high but it's really easy guys the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.640 
high but it's really easy guys the
hardest<00:02:33.420> part<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:34.050> through<00:02:34.260> 40

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
hardest part is just one through 40

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.890 
hardest part is just one through 40
because<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.460> zombies<00:02:35.820> are<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.970> lot<00:02:36.180> slower<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
because the zombies are a lot slower and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420 
because the zombies are a lot slower and
stuff<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.710> always<00:02:37.920> want<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> start

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
stuff like that you always want to start

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.060 
stuff like that you always want to start
out<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.150> first<00:02:39.420> building<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
out in this first building here the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.680 
out in this first building here the
spawn<00:02:41.370> building<00:02:41.820> because<00:02:42.270> if<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.540> actually

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
spawn building because if you actually

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.840 
spawn building because if you actually

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
go out and start into the swamp it can

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.060 
go out and start into the swamp it can
kind<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.540> screw<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.560> know<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.710> got<00:02:46.950> the
