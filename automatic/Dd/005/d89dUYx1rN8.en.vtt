00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.500
 rephrasing the words classic you can 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 say that everything should be in the house 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.170
 nice and foundation and walls and windows and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 roof 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 and since the house begins with the foundation about 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.020
 it will be discussed and if we talk about 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.490
 reliably in inexpensive and pre-fabricated 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 foundations on screw piles 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.180
 then he is not particularly beautiful 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.700
 different it repels many 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.739
 customers do not want to live in the house 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.810
 like chicken legs and the exit here 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.120
 quite simple and quite predictable 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.920
 you just need to close the cap that is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.109
 the space between the surface of the earth and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.199
 directly by the house itself at the bottom to 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.510
 120 corner 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.859
 also needles are treated with special 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.870
 anti-corrosion compound 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.910
 the same way to handle 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.500
 screw piles and it laid out 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 brickwork from facing 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 bricks are made on top of it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.609
 ebbs and you get a full 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 foundation which is visually nothing 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.670
 different from traditional concrete 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 foundation but it is much cheaper possible 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 apply also another technology place 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.300
 masonry use 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.960
 decorative plinth plastic 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.530
 panels here it will be 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.810
 much more cost effective from the point of 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.710
 Beauty view but always natural 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.369
 stone or brick it still looks 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.290
 much richer and more beautiful than any 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.759
 decorative panel but as for 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.770
 blind area of ​​another mandatory 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.690
 element of the house then there are options 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.759
 Here is such a paving stone or 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.380
 just a concrete screed of course first 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.540
 more beautiful option and what is called 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.580
 more presentable by the way if you already 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.440
 built a house on screw stilts and live 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.450
 it does not even think about its external 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.910
 form and suddenly decided to close the shock 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.800
 then do it is never too late and can 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.340
 be right now it's just his time 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.530
 In principle, it is better to postpone the juice already 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.360
 when you build a house have forged 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.720
 communication to the house after that 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.179
 quietly made such a corner can 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.890
 weld also anytime all this you 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.209
 can do both yourself and 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.160
 turn to professionals 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.350
 but what is close and a cap 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.019
 will benefit your home think none 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.019
 who does not doubt the house looks 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.220
 nobly rich beautiful beauty should 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.220
 be all over here
