 the coffee we see the cream she makes it a 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:22.050
 gala mix in canada so actually 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.670
 whipped cream I specify that the cream 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.580
 be cold because if it's hot 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.540
