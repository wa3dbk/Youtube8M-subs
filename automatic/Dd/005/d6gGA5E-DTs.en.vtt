00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.600
 what's up with that crazy girl here we are going 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.450
 to play on this bus but this time in 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.820
 camelot craft that has already opened again 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.140
 the great reopening since nothing this 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.250
 video I do it so you know that 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.260
 it is already open that you already have another 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.240
 server over here to be able to play 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.250
 skyworks and for those who do not know it 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.869
 because here the graf is a server that 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.630
 it's pretty good it does not have any lag 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.090
 in which you can play both skyworks 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.920
 as hunger games ' will do pvp 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.180
 and search and destroy have put several 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.790
 anyway so I recommend that 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.740
 metals come on me this server played 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.510
 long before it was before 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.510
 loan because breastplate and has been a month 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.250
 or so without being able to play but now it's 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.920
 so I can not recommend anything to you 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.630
 happen that you watch it that if you are 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.190
 games that is pretty good to me 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.990
 love this server I love me 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.750
 love I love apart from cube kraft 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.340
 is one of my favorite servers in 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.320
 which then I play and I pass it 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.629
 pretty good and there are quite a few 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.369
 subscribers here also that which 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.290
 then try to make a team and I'm going to 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.119
 burst because I have no armor nor 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.950
 I have nothing like aranda open now 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.079
 again and I do not have any 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.840
 I do not have anything or I do not have any chip 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.670
 and he was able to take make it and that's why 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.020
 I do not have anything extra in armor wool 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.990
 I shit on everything that speaks and colleague 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 this bridge and if you think that I have not 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.500
 seen something 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.119
 it does not take for this one is that I'm going to have 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.460
 to throw away because otherwise I will not be able to 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.579
 win and still I think I'm not going to 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.799
 win but good is they are things that happen 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.409
 it's normal not someone I do not even know 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.179
 I do not see them to colleagues, the tie is given to me 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.130
 scary because it's there shooting me 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.929
 you know subscribers are all the time 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.450
 making me focus that I do not like and 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.060
 if you realize on this map in this 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.770
 server in skyworks at least me that 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.229
 before I played I did not change it when 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.340
 it's some very far away, you do not see it and 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.679
 that's what I think is something that's good 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.329
 because that's the one on the other side of the map 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.069
 you do not do good kids that I almost 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.220
 busting the other end of the map does not 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.940
 can kill or is it can kill you but not 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.900
 you can see it's worth 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.900
 let's see if 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.760
 my mother said this sword 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.550
 is that it is very much that everything is very small this 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.590
 sword and I'm missing a helmet that's 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.490
 now he's going to see that I can pull power 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.490
 power power flame 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.450
 and I have no sword nothing but 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.450
 the off 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.070
 God, that's that, that's what 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.450
 excalibur kid to excalibur the famous 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.730
 excalibur I wanted to pig 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.190
 caliber you only need to see the uncle 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.600
 go to the one that you read it that looks I will win 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.430
 even the game 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.840
 I just need to see the colleague is what 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.580
 I told you that if it is too far away, 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.590
 you can see even if I 'm on that island 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.900
 invisible, do not panic anymore 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.210
 decided to hyun wook no you do not see the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.670
 people there who are far away and if they dare 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.530
 normal that's worth not be scared and then 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.510

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.400
 partisans good click what is here 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.269
 I welcome the banana in case you are seeing 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.310
 this is good anyway 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.590
 You already know that I do not have a kit, why do not you 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.180

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.430
 boy killed but still cal excalibur 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.349
 I can not do many things because I do not 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.970
 I have although good I have something of 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.810
 armor I can not complain the truth 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.609
 because this is better than nothing because 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.099
 another one gave a bit of disgust not to have 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.889
 nothing to see and if I do some magicians here 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.719
 something with Nestor if I put it in the 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.699
 oven since I already have an oven what 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.160
 took the maximum lad 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:23.039
 to see if 712 and look at it I put this 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.360
 I'll wait and if somebody comes for me 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.430
 less than 2,000 different metal because 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.430
 I already say this is going to be complicated 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.960
 I do not have arrows the only thing that I need 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.600
 they are arrows and I'm going to do something because 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.490
 I never get to do this but I do not 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.870
 I advise it if you do not have anything like me 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.250
 right now, I advise you that 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.780
 do and take all the diamonds that 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.780
 you can because I've heard 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.040
 oh what a scare I say goodbye what happens here 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.710
 and now I have some dynamite but I do not 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.510
 needed I did not remember this means gives me 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.100
 scary because it's going to start I do not think that I 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.990
 pull but because he is doing me the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.390

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.860

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.730
