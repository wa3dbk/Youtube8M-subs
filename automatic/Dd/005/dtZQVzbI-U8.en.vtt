00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:08.590
 video tutorial of an error that 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.530
 surely you will have your server 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.590
 with many minecraft that you have come 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.400
 for the title of the video because I 've 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.710
 fixed that videos of this there is not in 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.230
 Spanish only to the east to fix 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.599
 this error comes from an English forum and 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.449
 well it works pretty well but I think 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.460
 know I do not see how baby did not see any 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.960
 video of how to fix this error that 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.630
 is in Spanish so it's good that 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.750
 I bring how to solve it well 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.920
 here we have two tribes server as 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.810
 obviously if you are watching this is 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.650
 because you already know how it's done and if not 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:48.560
 you know then it's very simple with cogÃ©is 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.040
 downloads the porsche the installer 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.590
 and once you submit it to the minecraft 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.560
 then you give to select to install 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.200
 to make several selections the folder 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.910
 where you have the server already with the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.820
 Discharged 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.440
 and click there and you download everything 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.240
 then simply put the bikes here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.510
 that you want but your would serve you 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.960
 Well now what happens is that 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.060
 when you have it, the server already done 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.680
 with the machi and all this because it happened what 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.770
 next we will see here on a server 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:28.020
 open and now look what happens 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.450
 we put this we give 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 well I'm going to put on kraft good is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.740
 that I now minimized it so that what 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.439
 you see and this does not come out of fear you leave it 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.909
 bounty of same truth good comes out 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.130
 externally that surely so 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.659
 you have come to see the video well 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.710
 Now I will teach you 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.770
 fix is very easy actually 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.950
 so let's do it in minecraft 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.570
 and we are going to do the following but let's 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.840
 to get in to see the folder 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 market I'm going to put you run you know 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.819
 with app data or if you have the mangrove 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.729
 original and you give him here edit profili 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.700
 open game director and I think it's we have 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.730
 here are minecraft and this is what 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.709
 important the folder confirms to see 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.799
 well let's do the following wait 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.360
 let's also close the server and now 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.830
 what we are going to do is to eliminate 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 this folder with fidel point minecraft 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.460
 Epic forgiveness creates a shortcut 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.740
 we delete the config folder delete yes 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.940
 it's worth very well now just what 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.940
 we have to do is open our 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.880
 minecraft folder of the server and this 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.450
 end of the server folder that is 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.160
 create just copy it remember that this 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.040
 it is once done that we have already gotten 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.040
 all the mods and this let's see this 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.350
 and we go to the minecraft point folder 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.080
 and we paste it here 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.000
 for garcia we have the trust good and 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.090
 that simple 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.560
 is already looked at and now I should 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.690
 function 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.690
 let's wait for him to load this 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.960
 and well, that's how the tutorial is 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.190
 really very easy to do 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.050
 and the truth is that he did think about uploading it 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.560
 well at the end at the beginning I did not think 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.930
 upload it because as I assumed it would already 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.490
 of this but there was also quite 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.220
 people look that Spanish that good that 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.440
 speak spanish 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.420
 I had this problem and I did not know how 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.480
 fix it so good i'm at it's own 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.760
 and so you see 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.230
 today we are going to try it now for 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.430
 show you what really works 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.420
 to see what the minecraft loads 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.590
 the stop we have to open 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.620
 now we open the server 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.010
 the truth that today remember that we have 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.680
 to copy the border of this folder and 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.420
 drag it to the point of minecraft and 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.880
 we delete the one from the minecraft point so 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:14.240
 simple is already very easy 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.209
 now I will show you how to drive it, you will see 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.739
 we have here load good now it gives 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.460
 for not answering minecraft good I'll 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.200
 to make a cut and come back right away 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.320
 well we have already returned to minecraft and 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:32.120
 now you will see how it works there is 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:36.040
 my server I do not know what load entering 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.290

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.850
 You see, he has already let us in and as you see 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.670
 we are already here inside the truth 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.560
 is that I had already been if I'm going to upload 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:56.380
