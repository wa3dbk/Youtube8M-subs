00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
are the main differences between these

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.180 
are the main differences between these
two<00:00:09.389> devices<00:00:09.660> let's<00:00:10.500> start<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> looks

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
two devices let's start with the looks

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.190 
two devices let's start with the looks
the<00:00:11.730> iPhone<00:00:12.030> 5s<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.389> almost<00:00:12.870> an<00:00:13.110> identical

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
twin of last year's iphone 5 with the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.900 
twin of last year's iphone 5 with the

the<00:00:18.390> galaxy<00:00:18.840> s4<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.500> probably<00:00:19.740> know

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the galaxy s4 as you probably know

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.130 
the galaxy s4 as you probably know
already<00:00:20.279> comes<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.150> hyper<00:00:21.359> blaze<00:00:21.630> plastic

already comes with a hyper blaze plastic

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
already comes with a hyper blaze plastic
casing<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> doesn't<00:00:23.460> exactly<00:00:23.730> feel

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
casing so it doesn't exactly feel

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.359 
casing so it doesn't exactly feel
premium<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.230> at<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.439> same<00:00:25.680> time<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.189> can

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
premium but at the same time you can

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.130 
premium but at the same time you can
easily<00:00:26.519> take<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> back<00:00:27.359> panel<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.960> get
