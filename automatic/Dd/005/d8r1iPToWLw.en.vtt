00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.720 
like 2015 2016 and
2000a<00:01:58.910> on<00:01:59.170> 2017<00:02:00.170> maybe<00:02:00.410> because<00:02:01.250> it's<00:02:01.640> just

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
2000a on 2017 maybe because it's just

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.260 
2000a on 2017 maybe because it's just
like<00:02:02.180> futuristic<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.650> then<00:02:04.370> we<00:02:04.730> do<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.120> this

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
like futuristic and then we do have this

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.150 
like futuristic and then we do have this
thing<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.960> can<00:02:06.080> see<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.740> do<00:02:06.920> get

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
thing that we can see that we do get

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.090 
thing that we can see that we do get
that<00:02:07.910> they<00:02:08.030> ditched<00:02:08.330> if<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.929> home<00:02:09.170> button<00:02:09.410> so

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
that they ditched if the home button so

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.460 
that they ditched if the home button so
you<00:02:10.130> now<00:02:10.460> have<00:02:10.490> three<00:02:11.330> capacitive<00:02:12.260> touch

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
you now have three capacitive touch

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.440 
you now have three capacitive touch
buttons<00:02:12.500> not<00:02:13.100> on-screen<00:02:13.520> buttons<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:14.240> that's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
buttons not on-screen buttons but that's

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.540 
buttons not on-screen buttons but that's
probably<00:02:14.660> going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> media<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.620> future<00:02:16.160> step

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
probably going to media the future step

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.600 
probably going to media the future step
to<00:02:16.790> go<00:02:16.940> somewhere<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.810> future<00:02:18.320> 60mm<00:02:19.280> pixel

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
to go somewhere in the future 60mm pixel

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.310 
to go somewhere in the future 60mm pixel
camera<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:20.210> of<00:02:20.360> course<00:02:20.540> would<00:02:20.810> be<00:02:20.870> able<00:02:21.110> to

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
camera that of course would be able to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.949 
camera that of course would be able to
take<00:02:21.710> amazing<00:02:22.430> pictures<00:02:22.640> not<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.660> skill

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
take amazing pictures not a skill

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.410 
take amazing pictures not a skill
probably<00:02:24.260> ask<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.920> much<00:02:25.040> going<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.280> z1<00:02:25.730> but

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
probably ask so much going to z1 but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.960 
probably ask so much going to z1 but
then<00:02:26.930> again<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.230> have<00:02:27.500> compared<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.490> pictures

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
then again I have compared the pictures

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.140 
then again I have compared the pictures
because<00:02:29.780> sometimes<00:02:30.230> use<00:02:30.980> need<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.550> do<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.850> and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
because sometimes use need to do it and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.570 
because sometimes use need to do it and
if<00:02:32.750> use<00:02:33.020> upload<00:02:33.380> pictures<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.950> facebook<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
if use upload pictures to facebook you

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.850 
if use upload pictures to facebook you
from<00:02:34.880> not<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.300> have<00:02:35.450> problems<00:02:35.750> with<00:02:36.530> any
