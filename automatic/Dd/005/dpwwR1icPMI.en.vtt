just received the earnest sports yes 12

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.220 
just received the earnest sports yes 12
the<00:00:05.339> other<00:00:05.460> day<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.629> wanted<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> provide<00:00:07.169> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the other day and wanted to provide a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.160 
the other day and wanted to provide a
little<00:00:07.319> video<00:00:07.620> on<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.580> works

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
little video on how it works

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.170 
little video on how it works
the<00:00:10.590> es<00:00:10.800> 12<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:12.710> little<00:00:13.710> mini<00:00:14.150> doppler<00:00:15.150> radar

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
the es 12 is a little mini doppler radar

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.429 
the es 12 is a little mini doppler radar
that<00:00:16.020> tracks<00:00:16.980> your<00:00:17.099> ball<00:00:17.939> speed<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.869> golf<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
that tracks your ball speed for golf and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.650 
that tracks your ball speed for golf and
provides<00:00:20.429> a<00:00:21.140> approximate<00:00:22.140> distance<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.660> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
provides a approximate distance and the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
provides a approximate distance and the
vise<00:00:24.810> itself<00:00:25.259> is<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> pretty<00:00:26.130> small<00:00:26.519> device<00:00:26.849> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
vise itself is a pretty small device you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.779 
vise itself is a pretty small device you
can<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> palm<00:00:27.929> of<00:00:28.079> hand<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
can see if it's in the palm of hand and

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.480 
can see if it's in the palm of hand and
it<00:00:29.789> seems<00:00:30.089> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.239> pretty<00:00:30.449> accurate<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:31.109> least

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
it seems to be pretty accurate at least

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.460 
it seems to be pretty accurate at least
when<00:00:32.490> compared<00:00:32.820> against<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.470> velocity

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
when compared against like a velocity

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.060 
when compared against like a velocity
pure<00:00:34.860> lawn<00:00:35.160> or<00:00:35.520> pure<00:00:35.850> flight<00:00:36.060> I<00:00:36.770> recently<00:00:37.770> had

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
pure lawn or pure flight I recently had

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.010 
pure lawn or pure flight I recently had
one<00:00:38.220> of<00:00:38.310> those<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> numbers<00:00:39.840> are

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
one of those and the the numbers are

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
one of those and the the numbers are
pretty<00:00:40.520> consistent<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:43.280> even<00:00:44.280> matching<00:00:44.610> up

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
pretty consistent and even matching up

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.050 
pretty consistent and even matching up
to<00:00:44.880> a<00:00:44.910> real-life<00:00:45.480> situation<00:00:46.520> where<00:00:47.520> last<00:00:47.790> year

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
to a real-life situation where last year

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.460 
to a real-life situation where last year
I<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.600> numbers<00:00:48.900> I<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.140> hitting<00:00:49.320> last

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
I was the numbers I was hitting last

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.110 
I was the numbers I was hitting last
year<00:00:49.740> kind<00:00:50.220> of<00:00:50.310> fall<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.640> line<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.540> that<00:00:52.050> bad<00:00:53.120> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
year kind of fall in line so that bad so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.940 
year kind of fall in line so that bad so
while<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.690> device<00:00:54.930> itself<00:00:55.290> is<00:00:55.530> easy<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
while the device itself is easy to

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.980 
while the device itself is easy to
operate<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.910> press<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.480> power<00:00:57.690> button<00:00:57.780> to

operate you press the power button to

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.690 
operate you press the power button to
turn<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.200> on<00:00:58.380> and<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.100> liquid<00:00:59.280> crystal

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
turn it on and there's a liquid crystal

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.820 
turn it on and there's a liquid crystal
display<00:00:59.970> at<00:01:00.060> the<00:01:00.150> top<00:01:00.360> that<00:01:00.990> will<00:01:01.260> display<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
display at the top that will display the

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.299 
display at the top that will display the
club<00:01:02.100> selected<00:01:02.730> now<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:04.859> way<00:01:05.039> this

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
club selected now you know the way this

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.039 
club selected now you know the way this
device<00:01:05.999> works<00:01:06.359> as<00:01:06.749> opposed<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.469> say<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:09.049> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
device works as opposed to say the that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.830 
device works as opposed to say the that
others<00:01:10.799> velocity<00:01:11.340> device<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.939> pure<00:01:12.210> contact

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
others velocity device the pure contact

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.929 
others velocity device the pure contact
which<00:01:13.049> kind<00:01:13.289> of<00:01:13.320> looks<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.649> this<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
which kind of looks like this one I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.190 
which kind of looks like this one I
don't<00:01:15.240> believe<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.719> to<00:01:15.840> select<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
don't believe you have to select the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.279 
don't believe you have to select the
club<00:01:16.499> on<00:01:16.679> that<00:01:16.829> one<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.929> is<00:01:19.079> one<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
club on that one so this is one you

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.169 
club on that one so this is one you
select<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> club<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.460> way<00:01:20.579> toggle<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
select the club and the way toggle the

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.520 
select the club and the way toggle the
club<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.539> by<00:01:21.659> pressing<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.319> club<00:01:22.590> button<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
club is by pressing the club button and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.429 
club is by pressing the club button and
so<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.399> toggling<00:01:26.880> through<00:01:27.439> it

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so you can see I'm toggling through it

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.120 
so you can see I'm toggling through it
goes<00:01:28.740> hybrid<00:01:29.630> 5-wood<00:01:30.630> 3-wood<00:01:31.109> driver<00:01:31.649> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
goes hybrid 5-wood 3-wood driver and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.169 
goes hybrid 5-wood 3-wood driver and
then<00:01:32.310> back<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> lob<00:01:32.759> lob<00:01:32.999> wedge<00:01:33.359> so<00:01:33.990> I'm<00:01:34.350> gonna

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
then back to lob lob wedge so I'm gonna

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.879 
then back to lob lob wedge so I'm gonna
keep<00:01:36.179> gap<00:01:36.450> wedge<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.899> here<00:01:37.139> and<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.770> gonna

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
keep gap wedge on here and I'm gonna

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.129 
keep gap wedge on here and I'm gonna
give<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.369> an<00:01:38.520> example<00:01:38.789> how<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.149> works<00:01:39.359> so<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:40.139 
give you an example how it works so the

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:41.929 
give you an example how it works so the
directions<00:01:40.770> say<00:01:41.039> there's<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> little

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
directions say there's a little

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.309 
directions say there's a little
kickstand<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> back<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.959> I'm<00:01:43.049> extending

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
kickstand on the back that I'm extending

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.359 
kickstand on the back that I'm extending
the<00:01:44.219> directions<00:01:44.729> say<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.109> place<00:01:46.109> it<00:01:46.350> 10<00:01:47.009> inches

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the directions say to place it 10 inches

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
the directions say to place it 10 inches
in<00:01:47.520> front<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> ball<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.959> see<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
in front of the ball so if you see the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.539 
in front of the ball so if you see the
ball<00:01:49.289> here<00:01:49.439> 10<00:01:49.619> inches<00:01:49.859> in<00:01:49.950> front<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> ball

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
ball here 10 inches in front of the ball

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.419 
ball here 10 inches in front of the ball
and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.509> 10<00:01:51.719> inches<00:01:51.990> over<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.369> is

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
and then 10 inches over so and this is

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.789 
and then 10 inches over so and this is
downrange<00:01:54.179> so<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.659> front<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.499> is<00:01:55.649> to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
downrange so the front of this is to

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.459 
downrange so the front of this is to
facing<00:01:56.249> down<00:01:56.429> range<00:01:56.759> or<00:01:57.029> in<00:01:57.569> my<00:01:57.719> case<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.319> in

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
facing down range or in my case I'm in

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.359 
facing down range or in my case I'm in
front<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.709> a<00:01:58.859> net<00:01:59.459> and<00:02:00.829> I'm<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.279> ahead

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
front of a net and I'm going to go ahead

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.429 
front of a net and I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:02.700> hit<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:02.880> ball

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
and hit a ball

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:14.770 
and hit a ball

show<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:09.830> next<00:05:10.830> little<00:05:11.100> feature<00:05:11.400> about

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
show you the next little feature about

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:31.680 
show you the next little feature about
the<00:05:12.300> range<00:05:12.510> data

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.540 

so<00:05:32.690> now<00:05:32.840> is<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.320> two<00:05:33.590> more<00:05:33.770> balls<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.250> can<00:05:34.370> see

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
so now is it two more balls you can see

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.440 
so now is it two more balls you can see
it's<00:05:34.730> pretty<00:05:35.090> pretty<00:05:36.080> instant<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:37.450> reading

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
it's pretty pretty instant the reading

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.030 
it's pretty pretty instant the reading
and<00:05:38.570> then<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.840> communication<00:05:39.530> to<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:39.740> device

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
and then the communication to the device

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.520 
and then the communication to the device
so<00:05:40.820> if<00:05:40.970> we<00:05:41.150> want<00:05:41.510> to<00:05:41.600> end<00:05:41.780> this<00:05:41.930> session<00:05:42.200> we're

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
so if we want to end this session we're

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.830 
so if we want to end this session we're
gonna<00:05:42.620> hit<00:05:42.770> end<00:05:42.980> range<00:05:43.160> session<00:05:43.639> and<00:05:43.850> we'll<00:05:44.600> go

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
gonna hit end range session and we'll go

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.790 
gonna hit end range session and we'll go
to<00:05:44.980> home<00:05:45.980> for<00:05:46.010> now<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.930> we're<00:05:48.410> gonna<00:05:48.470> look<00:05:48.650> at

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
to home for now and we're gonna look at

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.400 
to home for now and we're gonna look at
the<00:05:48.860> device<00:05:49.130> we're<00:05:49.340> going<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.550> go<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:50.410> range

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
the device we're going to go to range

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.280 
the device we're going to go to range
data<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:52.400> then<00:05:52.610> we're<00:05:52.700> gonna<00:05:52.790> look<00:05:53.030> at

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
data and then we're gonna look at

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.080 
data and then we're gonna look at
historical<00:05:54.290> range<00:05:54.560> data<00:05:54.890> and<00:05:55.220> then<00:05:56.000> we're

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
historical range data and then we're

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.830 
historical range data and then we're
gonna<00:05:56.180> look<00:05:56.390> at<00:05:56.630> what<00:05:57.260> my<00:05:57.410> gap<00:05:57.800> wedge<00:05:58.100> was

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.960 

we're<00:06:02.840> in<00:06:02.990> a<00:06:03.050> view<00:06:03.290> report<00:06:03.770> now<00:06:04.520> this<00:06:04.760> little

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
we're in a view report now this little

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.710 
we're in a view report now this little
dove<00:06:05.150> this<00:06:05.419> part<00:06:05.720> of<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.230> app<00:06:06.380> will<00:06:07.070> show<00:06:07.720> that

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
dove this part of the app will show that

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.550 
dove this part of the app will show that
my<00:06:09.290> average<00:06:10.419> distance<00:06:11.419> was<00:06:11.540> 87<00:06:11.990> yards<00:06:12.140> this

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
my average distance was 87 yards this

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.040 
my average distance was 87 yards this
morning<00:06:12.919> now<00:06:13.850> that's<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.330> low<00:06:14.570> average<00:06:14.690> for<00:06:14.960> me

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
morning now that's a low average for me

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.180 
morning now that's a low average for me
but<00:06:15.229> that<00:06:15.350> doesn't<00:06:15.560> matter<00:06:15.650> for<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:15.919> purpose

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
but that doesn't matter for the purpose

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.580 
but that doesn't matter for the purpose
of<00:06:16.250> this<00:06:16.400> video<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:18.970> it'll<00:06:19.970> show<00:06:20.150> my

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
of this video and the it'll show my

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.730 
of this video and the it'll show my
lowest<00:06:21.590> was<00:06:22.400> 85<00:06:22.790> yards<00:06:23.180> my<00:06:23.330> furthest<00:06:24.229> was<00:06:24.350> 92

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
lowest was 85 yards my furthest was 92

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.100 
lowest was 85 yards my furthest was 92
yards<00:06:25.070> and<00:06:25.250> macedon<00:06:25.760> that<00:06:26.240> yellow<00:06:26.600> dotted

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
yards and macedon that yellow dotted

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.760 
yards and macedon that yellow dotted
line<00:06:27.320> is<00:06:27.560> my<00:06:27.770> average<00:06:28.280> of<00:06:28.400> 87<00:06:28.910> yards<00:06:29.200> so<00:06:30.200> it

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
line is my average of 87 yards so it

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.140 
line is my average of 87 yards so it
gives<00:06:30.919> you<00:06:31.010> kind<00:06:31.130> of<00:06:31.250> cool<00:06:31.430> information<00:06:31.970> you

gives you kind of cool information you
know<00:06:32.240> nothing<00:06:32.900> crazy<00:06:33.830> but<00:06:34.130> it's<00:06:34.280> still<00:06:34.460> neat

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
know nothing crazy but it's still neat

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.719 
know nothing crazy but it's still neat

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
to have you know do your yardages and

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.610 
to have you know do your yardages and
more<00:06:38.330> so<00:06:38.539> to<00:06:38.600> even<00:06:38.930> just<00:06:39.050> practice<00:06:39.440> for

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
more so to even just practice for

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.110

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
on hitting a 60 yard shot you want to

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.890 
on hitting a 60 yard shot you want to
only<00:06:43.310> hit<00:06:43.550> a<00:06:43.580> 60<00:06:43.880> yard<00:06:43.970> shot<00:06:44.240> you<00:06:44.419> can<00:06:44.600> get<00:06:44.750> a

only hit a 60 yard shot you can get a

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.080 
only hit a 60 yard shot you can get a
little<00:06:45.140> bit<00:06:45.260> of<00:06:45.380> feedback<00:06:45.760> there's<00:06:46.760> also<00:06:46.910> a

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
little bit of feedback there's also a

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.500 
little bit of feedback there's also a
video<00:06:47.300> analysis<00:06:48.020> app<00:06:48.760> there's<00:06:49.760> a<00:06:49.970> weather<00:06:50.270> app

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
video analysis app there's a weather app

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.560 
video analysis app there's a weather app
of<00:06:50.960> course<00:06:51.020> caddie<00:06:51.590> which<00:06:51.890> is<00:06:52.180> you<00:06:53.180> put<00:06:53.390> in<00:06:53.479> the

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
of course caddie which is you put in the

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.050 
of course caddie which is you put in the
distance<00:06:54.020> so<00:06:54.260> if<00:06:54.380> I<00:06:54.500> wanted<00:06:54.950> to<00:06:55.010> know<00:06:55.550> how<00:06:55.789> far

distance so if I wanted to know how far

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.420 
distance so if I wanted to know how far
I<00:06:56.090> hit<00:06:56.500> 85<00:06:57.500> yards<00:06:58.630> it's<00:06:59.630> gonna<00:06:59.720> tell<00:07:00.050> me<00:07:00.200> oh

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
I hit 85 yards it's gonna tell me oh

I hit 85 yards it's gonna tell me oh
okay<00:07:01.460> 85<00:07:02.210> yards<00:07:02.660> oh<00:07:02.840> my<00:07:03.289> gosh<00:07:03.740> it<00:07:04.070> was<00:07:04.160> 85<00:07:04.400> yards

the blue one there so already I can go

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:08.740 
the blue one there so already I can go
pick<00:07:07.460> that<00:07:07.700> now<00:07:08.030> so<00:07:08.090> you<00:07:08.240> can<00:07:08.360> use<00:07:08.450> it<00:07:08.510> out<00:07:08.660> in

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
pick that now so you can use it out in

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.170 
pick that now so you can use it out in
the<00:07:08.840> course<00:07:09.669> now<00:07:10.669> obviously<00:07:10.940> that's<00:07:11.060> not

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180 
the course now obviously that's not

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.810 
the course now obviously that's not
gonna<00:07:11.360> be<00:07:11.479> used<00:07:11.660> in<00:07:11.870> tournament<00:07:12.500> play<00:07:12.530> but<00:07:12.860> the

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
gonna be used in tournament play but the

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.940 
gonna be used in tournament play but the
then<00:07:14.570> there's<00:07:14.720> a<00:07:14.810> scorecard<00:07:15.200> feature<00:07:15.500> but<00:07:15.919> I

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
then there's a scorecard feature but I

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.550 
then there's a scorecard feature but I
believe<00:07:16.280> you<00:07:16.400> have<00:07:16.520> to<00:07:16.729> manually<00:07:17.450> program<00:07:18.320> all

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
believe you have to manually program all

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.650 
believe you have to manually program all
the<00:07:19.000> all<00:07:20.000> the<00:07:20.270> holes<00:07:21.250> so<00:07:22.250> I<00:07:23.090> know<00:07:23.450> they're

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660 
the all the holes so I know they're

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.020 
the all the holes so I know they're
trying<00:07:23.900> to<00:07:24.050> be<00:07:24.200> a<00:07:24.229> little<00:07:25.870> be<00:07:26.870> a<00:07:26.900> little

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.030 
trying to be a little be a little

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.480 
trying to be a little be a little
holistic<00:07:29.030> here<00:07:29.270> with<00:07:29.450> all<00:07:29.690> the<00:07:29.930> different

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
holistic here with all the different

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.430 
holistic here with all the different
application<00:07:31.490> features<00:07:31.970> but<00:07:32.479> honestly<00:07:33.320> I

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 
application features but honestly I

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.540 
application features but honestly I
think<00:07:33.590> they<00:07:33.860> could<00:07:34.039> have<00:07:34.130> just<00:07:34.159> done<00:07:34.430> the

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550 
think they could have just done the

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.760 
think they could have just done the
range<00:07:34.760> data<00:07:35.060> and<00:07:35.510> done<00:07:36.169> away<00:07:36.349> with<00:07:36.380> weather

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:36.770 
range data and done away with weather

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.300 
range data and done away with weather
and<00:07:37.190> scored<00:07:37.760> scorecard<00:07:38.599> and<00:07:38.780> all<00:07:38.870> that<00:07:39.020> but

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310 
and scored scorecard and all that but

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.469 
and scored scorecard and all that but
nevertheless<00:07:40.310> the<00:07:40.729> application<00:07:41.300> is<00:07:41.360> pretty

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 
nevertheless the application is pretty

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.330 
nevertheless the application is pretty
cool<00:07:41.750> another<00:07:42.200> cool<00:07:42.409> feature<00:07:42.560> is<00:07:42.830> if<00:07:43.039> you<00:07:43.190> had

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340 
cool another cool feature is if you had

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.960 
cool another cool feature is if you had
a<00:07:43.370> Bluetooth<00:07:43.849> headset<00:07:43.940> hooked<00:07:44.870> up<00:07:45.190> to<00:07:46.190> the<00:07:46.430> to

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:46.970 
a Bluetooth headset hooked up to the to

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.200 
a Bluetooth headset hooked up to the to
the<00:07:47.120> iPad<00:07:47.570> or<00:07:47.720> iPhone<00:07:47.840> the<00:07:49.030> robotic<00:07:50.030> voice

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.210 
the iPad or iPhone the robotic voice

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.610 
the iPad or iPhone the robotic voice
telling<00:07:50.690> you<00:07:50.780> the<00:07:50.900> yardage<00:07:51.200> would<00:07:51.380> go<00:07:51.470> right
