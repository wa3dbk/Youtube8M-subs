now<00:00:06.149> that<00:00:06.450> piece<00:00:06.720> there<00:00:07.349> as<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.309> see<00:00:08.549> is<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
now that piece there as you see is the

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.470 
now that piece there as you see is the
back<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.700> bottom<00:00:11.700> part<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.809> pretty<00:00:13.710> much

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
back of the bottom part so pretty much

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.810 
back of the bottom part so pretty much
that<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.629> driver<00:00:15.929> side<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> I've<00:00:17.490> got<00:00:17.669> two

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
that is driver side so I've got two

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.179 
that is driver side so I've got two
notches<00:00:18.029> where<00:00:18.419> the<00:00:18.509> wires<00:00:18.720> go<00:00:19.099> don't<00:00:20.099> worry

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
notches where the wires go don't worry

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.220 
notches where the wires go don't worry
you'll<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.700> works<00:00:20.849> out<00:00:21.000> later<00:00:21.239> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
you'll see how it works out later and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.490 
you'll see how it works out later and
then<00:00:22.950> I've<00:00:23.099> got<00:00:23.309> a<00:00:23.669> five<00:00:24.090> inch<00:00:24.270> fan<00:00:24.509> which<00:00:25.349> it

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
then I've got a five inch fan which it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.249 
then I've got a five inch fan which it
was<00:00:25.590> blowing<00:00:25.800> air<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.309> and<00:00:26.960> then<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.079> this<00:00:28.200> side

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
was blowing air in and then on this side

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.950 
was blowing air in and then on this side
where<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.309> wires<00:00:29.489> go<00:00:29.790> and<00:00:30.239> I've<00:00:30.599> got<00:00:30.809> two

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
where the wires go and I've got two

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
where the wires go and I've got two
three<00:00:31.290> inch<00:00:31.469> fans<00:00:31.770> that<00:00:32.279> should<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.489> blowing

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
three inch fans that should be blowing

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.330 
three inch fans that should be blowing
air<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.120> sucking<00:00:33.480> area<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
air or sucking area and then on this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
air or sucking area and then on this
side<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:36.059> used<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> rabbeting<00:00:37.020> bit<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.830> my<00:00:37.950> topic

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
side I used a rabbeting bit so my topic

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.240 
side I used a rabbeting bit so my topic
and<00:00:38.520> sit<00:00:38.790> flush<00:00:38.970> with<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.470> now<00:00:40.470> the<00:00:40.530> car<00:00:40.920> here

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and sit flush with it now the car here

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.730 
and sit flush with it now the car here
as<00:00:41.450> you<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.829> crescendo<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.040> wired<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.740> almost

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
as you see crescendo is wired so almost

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.310 
as you see crescendo is wired so almost

done<00:00:50.030> fuses<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.660> now<00:00:52.410> they're<00:00:52.590> there

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
done fuses are there now they're there

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.610 
done fuses are there now they're there
because<00:00:53.040> when<00:00:53.610> once<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.360> put<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.630> top<00:00:54.810> on<00:00:54.960> you

because when once I put the top on you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.200 
because when once I put the top on you
only<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.980> from<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.280> level<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> won't

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210

only see from this level and you won't
see<00:00:57.360> them<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.590> did<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.950> that<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> only

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
see them so I just did it that the only

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.030 
see them so I just did it that the only
things<00:01:01.170> aren't<00:01:01.410> wired<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.670> LEDs<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:04.040> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
things aren't wired up the LEDs and the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.550 
things aren't wired up the LEDs and the
fans<00:01:05.280> cause<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.759> I<00:01:05.850> meani<00:01:06.060> yet<00:01:06.320> know<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.470> you

you<00:01:12.929> see<00:01:13.109> this<00:01:13.289> panel<00:01:13.619> which<00:01:14.219> I've<00:01:14.399> made<00:01:15.049> which

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you see this panel which I've made which

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.039 
you see this panel which I've made which
is<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.409> bottom<00:01:17.369> dividing<00:01:17.850> panel<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.810> pretty

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
is my bottom dividing panel so pretty

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.289 
is my bottom dividing panel so pretty
much<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.069> fan<00:01:20.310> panel<00:01:20.670> goes<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:20.999> there<00:01:21.149> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
much the fan panel goes in there and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.050 
much the fan panel goes in there and
sits<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.859> over<00:01:22.859> bidding<00:01:23.459> like<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> bit<00:01:23.999> of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
sits on the over bidding like the bit of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.059 
sits on the over bidding like the bit of
Steel<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.450> hanging<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.889> this

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:26.069 
Steel that's hanging out and then this

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:27.919 
Steel that's hanging out and then this
panel<00:01:26.369> covers<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.819> all<00:01:27.240> I've<00:01:27.450> got<00:01:27.569> a<00:01:27.600> cut<00:01:27.780> out

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
panel covers it all I've got a cut out

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.959 
panel covers it all I've got a cut out
on<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.469> be<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> hole<00:01:28.889> for<00:01:29.759> where<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
on this one will be a hole for where the

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.639 
on this one will be a hole for where the
fans<00:01:30.179> are<00:01:30.389> not<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.719> square<00:01:30.990> holds<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.439> round

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
fans are not a square holds the round

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.889 
fans are not a square holds the round
hole<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.380> panels<00:01:35.159> there<00:01:35.429> I've<00:01:36.090> pretty

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
hole so that panels there I've pretty

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.830 
hole so that panels there I've pretty
much<00:01:36.990> made<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.529> panel<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.670> am<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:39.179> probably

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
much made that panel I am gonna probably

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.109 
much made that panel I am gonna probably
body<00:01:40.170> fill<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.859> corners<00:01:41.219> of<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.029> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
body fill the corners of it so it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.469 
body fill the corners of it so it
actually<00:01:42.270> curves<00:01:42.719> in<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.499> there<00:01:43.709> we<00:01:43.889> have<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
actually curves in and there we have it

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.249 
actually curves in and there we have it
wired<00:01:46.189> fans<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.429> wide<00:01:47.609> so<00:01:48.420> I've<00:01:48.539> got<00:01:48.719> big<00:01:48.990> five

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
wired fans are wide so I've got big five

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.410 
wired fans are wide so I've got big five
inch<00:01:49.439> fan<00:01:49.649> blowing<00:01:50.399> air<00:01:50.670> towards<00:01:51.090> me<00:01:51.179> on<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
inch fan blowing air towards me on that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
inch fan blowing air towards me on that
side<00:01:51.630> I've<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.619> two<00:01:52.889> three<00:01:53.159> inch<00:01:53.279> fans<00:01:53.579> over

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
side I've got two three inch fans over

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.989 
side I've got two three inch fans over
there<00:01:54.060> sucking<00:01:54.569> air<00:01:54.869> out

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
there sucking air out

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.249 
there sucking air out
LEDs<00:01:56.999> are<00:01:57.029> wired<00:01:57.389> now<00:01:58.729> amps<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.819> wired

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259
