00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.100
 john miss your breed in this mugs at 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 another new complete here on my 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.560
 channel and gaming varieties 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.630
 on the ground gameplay i have my 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.550
 very first crank the gameplay on my 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.109
 channel here as damping and hurts 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.640
 is the game ever course you make one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.039
 time to start to run from 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.660
 30 seconds you get from all kinds of turkish 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 will stolker 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 etcetera etcetera so if you sound 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.460
 you can get around reasonably quickly 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.140
 also marathon the bay lightweight the bee 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.790
 or whatever that may be called in the game 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 a pagan in the games and you want too 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.020
 need the byrds that get for it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 because if you don't have one inside that shoe 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.520
 pill 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.149
 are you explode but it fell here 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.050
 a folder 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.219
 not the nicest mat because it is 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.750
 soul 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.789
 only if it has been irritating 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.980
 they run all over the sides of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.180
 the folder where it is too large if there is one 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.980
 some go to the center of the map 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.120
 look up and they go by the name 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.860
 going to the center of the folder is a whole 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.600
 chilling man so it just depends 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.549
 how the enemy play or this one chilling out 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.530
 or kutmop is good but I am hurt 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.479
 games you have so that timer runs on it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.820
 when you've got too crank 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.229
 double score that in you get two 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.610
 points for your team making the game 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.259
 passes very quickly making it too 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.400
 100 kills must be made or 100 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.860
 points must be made 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 warts gameplay is over and you get it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.340
 xp twice 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 so if you are quick to siege the and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.030
 did i'm good at it 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.560
 sounds i like the shelly games go it 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.490
 then play with your level too so just 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.930
 faster through 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 and can is also go faster precision 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.759
 I am currently level 58 and up 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.829
 from the first prestige or the nose 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.030
 prestige whatever it is called 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.409
 I live just very quickly 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.439
 plays pastor must of course 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 You can also grab a flag just below and quickly 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.380
 krenkt is just cleaning a game ota 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 the fast slave of the game becomes like you 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.649
 the can in many kills you might well 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.299
 thinks yes I have tested lobster 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.920
 but I'm bad at it and I can 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.450
 it did not I already comes to 20 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.310
 then to play you 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.200
 simply play some honey you can 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.270
 think well after which i will try it out 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.280
 I'm going to try to get better at that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.310
 good if you think what i really think 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.569
 a facking pussy games then stop it 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.730
 just team and the play like one 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.290
 play pastor because that's just like that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.000
 you just so silly a word 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.709
 by running you race then you have to 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.209
 also just don't play but you have to 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.159
 they also go stress when you play crank 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.989
 he sees 987 here 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.670
 phoebus comte countdown and then already 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.650
 little stress all shit shows one 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.180
 solution'm still here quietly 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.219
 your minimap you watch quietly look where 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.019
 demolish the amy and then just grab it 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.459
 briefly that time for as much as you have 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.900
 but don't just walk stress 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.700
 just enjoy spraying around 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 with your barbecue but then you miss everything and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.569
 So just get it once 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.430
 hurts ideal demo tom quickly 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.870
 leveling was allowed in from fast prestige 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.760
 If you want to become your soldiers quickly 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.989
 want on a level you can speak 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.099
 go play because I get you a lot 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.420
 scoring through it is a bit 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.470
 difficult idea because what of course if 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.150
 someone is hurt 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.739
 gets that a lot of perth there like 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.419
 the tribe like i simply disney like 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.400
 lightweight ex cetera et cetera 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.450
 so that is careful because they 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.889
 Just kill you faster 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.019
 they also just walk to you at once 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.639
 so we are your concentration 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.859
 loses and i am i represents you with one 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.450
 speech from here to Tokyo and are you 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.310
 immediately dead and then you can just as well 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.290
 Immediately in your back it suits you so 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.569
 watch out demo too fast he found demos and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.769
 a nice new games 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.299
 on the one hand I think it's a shame 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.680
 so they made that percerin because 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.479
 you just have the advantage like you 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.250
 bitch but also on it 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.750
 better because otherwise you walk them for 30 seconds 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.790
 quickly and then you can not kills 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.199
 within those 30 seconds but the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.879
 camper is almost there again on this one 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.780
 puppies are very fast 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.190
 I want to thank you for looking 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.900

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.400

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.959
 if you are good in bed it is for you 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.280
 ideal game ever and is really for now until 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.079
