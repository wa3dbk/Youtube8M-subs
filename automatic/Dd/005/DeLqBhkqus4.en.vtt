it's<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.670> lot<00:02:09.789> lower<00:02:10.030> than<00:02:10.179> my<00:02:10.509> ship<00:02:10.780> but<00:02:11.500> I

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:21.690 
guess it's a bit longer so to say it's
definitely<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> bit<00:02:15.730> longer<00:02:19.950> kinda<00:02:20.950> bit<00:02:21.430> longer

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
definitely a bit longer kinda bit longer

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.490
