00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that is right the pharmaceutical

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.750

should more eggs more plaque plus the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.290 
should more eggs more plaque plus the

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
group that had more plaque were also

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.750 
group that had more plaque were also

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
smokers as we're both groups so may not

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.820 
smokers as we're both groups so may not
