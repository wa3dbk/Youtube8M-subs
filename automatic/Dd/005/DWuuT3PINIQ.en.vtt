00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
never well there's a there's there's a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.720 
never well there's a there's there's a
obstacle<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.410> overcome<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.219> obstacle

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
obstacle to overcome and that obstacle

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.970 
obstacle to overcome and that obstacle
is<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.149> reality<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.960> Saturn<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> says<00:00:40.770> if

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
is the reality of Saturn that says if

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
is the reality of Saturn that says if
you're<00:00:41.129> gonna<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.180> better<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.719> able<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you're gonna do it you better be able to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
you're gonna do it you better be able to
do<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.230> right<00:00:43.559> follow<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> do

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
do it right follow through and do it do

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.450 
do it right follow through and do it do
something<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.780> matters<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.559> can't<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.950> do

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
something that matters you can't just do

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.209 
something that matters you can't just do
anything<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:49.320> shifts<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.039> bit

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
anything but then it all shifts a bit

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.549 
anything but then it all shifts a bit
well<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> chips<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.870> discipline

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
well a chips because the discipline

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
well a chips because the discipline
hopefully<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> Mars<00:00:53.610> Saturn<00:00:53.910> opposition

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
hopefully of the Mars Saturn opposition

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.590 
hopefully of the Mars Saturn opposition
is<00:00:55.430> dissipated<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.730> moon<00:00:56.969> goes<00:00:57.270> into

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
is dissipated when the moon goes into

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
is dissipated when the moon goes into
Aquarius<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.410> morning<00:00:58.770> Aquarius<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> sign

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
Aquarius this morning Aquarius is a sign

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.900 
Aquarius this morning Aquarius is a sign
that<00:01:00.000> wants<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.170> free<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.980> whatever<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that wants to be free to do whatever it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.560 
that wants to be free to do whatever it
can<00:01:03.059> possibly<00:01:03.629> imagine<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.680> yet<00:01:05.570> imagination

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
can possibly imagine and yet imagination

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
can possibly imagine and yet imagination
then<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.020> represented<00:01:07.710> by<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> mind<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
then is represented by the mind and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
then is represented by the mind and
mercury<00:01:09.119> goes<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.380> very<00:01:10.590> different

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
mercury goes in a very different

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.039 
mercury goes in a very different
direction<00:01:10.950> yeah<00:01:11.640> well<00:01:11.880> mercury<00:01:12.420> moves<00:01:12.689> into

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
direction yeah well mercury moves into

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.560 
direction yeah well mercury moves into
Taurus<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.220> ways<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:15.299> not

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
Taurus which in some ways it's not

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
Taurus which in some ways it's not
really<00:01:16.110> Saturnian<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> feeds

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
really Saturnian but it kind of feeds

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.060 
really Saturnian but it kind of feeds
that<00:01:18.270> side<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> equations<00:01:19.320> realistic

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that side of the equations realistic

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
that side of the equations realistic
it's<00:01:20.250> realistic<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.210> down<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.659> earth<00:01:21.840> it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
it's realistic it's down to earth it's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.039 
it's realistic it's down to earth it's
practical<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.390> even<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.900> this

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
practical and even that on this

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.109 
practical and even that on this
incredibly<00:01:25.680> hectic<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.340> confusing<00:01:26.970> day

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
incredibly hectic and confusing day

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.510 
incredibly hectic and confusing day
doesn't<00:01:27.570> tell<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> whole<00:01:27.960> story<00:01:28.340> because<00:01:29.340> we

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
doesn't tell the whole story because we

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
doesn't tell the whole story because we
are<00:01:29.640> also<00:01:29.850> getting<00:01:30.299> something<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.930> drives

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
are also getting something that drives

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.749 
are also getting something that drives
us<00:01:31.470> into<00:01:31.650> deeper<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.700> meaningful

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
us into deeper and more meaningful

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
us into deeper and more meaningful
realms<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.320> harmonious<00:01:34.920> trying

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
realms that's a harmonious trying

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.219 
realms that's a harmonious trying
between<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.790> willful<00:01:36.270> son<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> Lord<00:01:37.110> of

between the willful son and the Lord of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.950 
between the willful son and the Lord of
the<00:01:37.350> underworld<00:01:37.380> Pluto<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.520> upside<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.720> Sun

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the underworld Pluto the upside of a Sun

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
the underworld Pluto the upside of a Sun
Pluto<00:01:40.200> China's<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> capacity<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
Pluto China's the capacity to get to the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
Pluto China's the capacity to get to the
bottom<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.930> things<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.740> we're<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.340> on

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
bottom of things so we're going to be on

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
bottom of things so we're going to be on
the<00:01:44.909> ground<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> sky<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.290> we're<00:01:46.439> kind

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the ground in the sky I think we're kind

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.800 
the ground in the sky I think we're kind
of<00:01:46.770> all<00:01:46.950> over<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.369> place<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.390> feeling

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
of all over the place but not feeling

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.960 
of all over the place but not feeling
very<00:01:48.840> light<00:01:49.259> about<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.770> no<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.460> ends<00:01:50.820> up

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
very light about it no and it ends up

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
very light about it no and it ends up
feeling<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.810> think<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> heaviness<00:01:52.860> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
feeling I think that heaviness is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.249 
feeling I think that heaviness is
actually<00:01:54.090> something<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.780> used<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
actually something that can be used to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.649 
actually something that can be used to
our<00:01:55.290> advantage<00:01:55.579> because<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.090> sun's<00:01:57.329> trying

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
our advantage because the sun's trying
