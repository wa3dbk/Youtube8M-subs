00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
then of course on the back we will find

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.300 
then of course on the back we will find
our<00:01:58.729> antenna<00:01:59.420> and<00:02:00.289> we<00:02:00.409> can<00:02:00.560> use<00:02:00.679> our<00:02:00.920> panel

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
our antenna and we can use our panel

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.980 
our antenna and we can use our panel
remover<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.819> that<00:02:03.250> track<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.460> antenna<00:02:04.990> and

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
remover on that track the antenna and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.150 
remover on that track the antenna and
then<00:02:06.880> here<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.030> our<00:02:08.209> electrical<00:02:09.160> connectors

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
then here is our electrical connectors

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.920 
then here is our electrical connectors
on<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.880> back<00:02:11.090> there's<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.690> little<00:02:11.750> button

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
on the back there's a little button

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.920 
on the back there's a little button
right<00:02:12.230> there<00:02:12.700> push<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:15.319> pull

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
right there push that in and then pull

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.170 
right there push that in and then pull
the<00:02:17.930> piece<00:02:18.230> out<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.190> radio<00:02:19.489> just<00:02:19.940> like

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the piece out of the radio just like

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.819 
the piece out of the radio just like
that<00:02:21.489> look<00:02:22.489> at<00:02:22.579> this<00:02:22.989> we<00:02:23.989> got<00:02:24.019> our<00:02:24.230> radio<00:02:24.470> house

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
that look at this we got our radio house

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.319 
that look at this we got our radio house
I<00:02:26.860> think<00:02:27.860> that's<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.430> little<00:02:28.670> bit<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.269> an

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
I think that's a little bit of an

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.979 
I think that's a little bit of an
improvement<00:02:29.720> over<00:02:30.079> the<00:02:31.390> over<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.420> ones<00:02:32.690> with

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
improvement over the over the ones with

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.800 
improvement over the over the ones with
the<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.430> ones<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.150> use<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the the ones that you have to use the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.440 
the the ones that you have to use the
din<00:02:36.350> removing<00:02:36.799> tools<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.850> know<00:02:37.970> these<00:02:38.150> ones

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
din removing tools you know these ones

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.120 
din removing tools you know these ones
right<00:02:38.660> here<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:39.579> think<00:02:41.109> this<00:02:42.109> is<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> new

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
right here I think this is a new

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.770 
right here I think this is a new
improvement<00:02:43.820> comes<00:02:44.690> out<00:02:44.870> much<00:02:45.049> easier<00:02:47.709> so

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
improvement comes out much easier so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.620 
improvement comes out much easier so
that's<00:02:50.780> all<00:02:51.109> there<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:52.340> removing<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:53.060> radio

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
that's all there is to removing a radio

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:02.010 
that's all there is to removing a radio
on<00:02:53.930> your<00:02:54.410> Ford<00:02:54.799> Focus

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.080 

you
