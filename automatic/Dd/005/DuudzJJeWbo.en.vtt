00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
into your opponent without even being

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.469 
into your opponent without even being
touched<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.909> we're<00:01:33.030> gonna<00:01:33.119> put<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
touched right now we're gonna put this

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.090 
touched right now we're gonna put this
video<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.780> slow<00:01:34.079> motion<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.470> help<00:01:34.560> explain<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
video in slow motion to help explain to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
video in slow motion to help explain to
you<00:01:35.159> guys<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.329> important<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you guys first off it's important to

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600 
you guys first off it's important to
note<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> with<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.470> lap<00:01:37.650> shot<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
note that with this lap shot you need to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
note that with this lap shot you need to
be<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> specific<00:01:39.090> piece<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.570> cover<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
be on a specific piece of cover that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
be on a specific piece of cover that
allows<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> either<00:01:40.710> aim<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> look

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
allows you to either aim right and look

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.380 
allows you to either aim right and look
up<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.540> aim<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.470> look<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.390> first

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
up or aim up and look down the first

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.730 
up or aim up and look down the first
example<00:01:45.810> we're<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> show<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.560> doing

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
example we're going to show you is doing

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.590 
example we're going to show you is doing
the<00:01:46.890> slap<00:01:47.100> shot<00:01:47.130> aiming<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.210> looking

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the slap shot aiming right and looking

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.420 
the slap shot aiming right and looking
up<00:01:48.810> which<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.860> slightly<00:01:50.040> less

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
up which I think is slightly less

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.050 
up which I think is slightly less
effective<00:01:50.700> than<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.810> former

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
effective than the the former

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060 
effective than the the former
so<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.229> notice<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.799> while<00:01:55.950> you're

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
so here it is notice how while you're

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
so here it is notice how while you're
doing<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.310> lab<00:01:56.490> shot<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:57.180> character

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
doing this lab shot your character

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
doing this lab shot your character
actually<00:01:57.780> still<00:01:58.229> stays<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.560> cover<00:01:58.979> while

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
actually still stays in cover while

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.480 
actually still stays in cover while
you're<00:01:59.729> able<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.970> pop<00:02:00.150> shutter<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.570> corner

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
you're able to pop shutter on the corner

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.399 
you're able to pop shutter on the corner
now<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.850> vice<00:02:03.030> versa<00:02:03.299> aiming<00:02:03.900> up<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.170> looking

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
now the vice versa aiming up and looking

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.749 
now the vice versa aiming up and looking
to<00:02:04.500> your<00:02:04.590> right<00:02:04.770> which<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.040> feel<00:02:05.220> like<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> lot

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
to your right which I feel like is a lot

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.999 
to your right which I feel like is a lot
more<00:02:05.970> effective<00:02:06.409> here's<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.500> slow-motion<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
more effective here's a slow-motion of

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
more effective here's a slow-motion of
how<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.640> here's<00:02:08.910> an<00:02:09.060> actual

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
how to do it and here's an actual

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.949 
how to do it and here's an actual
example

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
example

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.229 
example
so<00:02:10.140> notice<00:02:10.649> once<00:02:10.860> again<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.640> character<00:02:12.000> does

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
so notice once again your character does

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.120 
so notice once again your character does
stay<00:02:12.480> behind<00:02:12.660> cover<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.860> remain

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
stay behind cover and you remain

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.930 
stay behind cover and you remain
untouched<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:17.370> are<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.730> few<00:02:17.760> more

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
untouched here are just a few more

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.490 
untouched here are just a few more
examples<00:02:18.180> before<00:02:18.690> we<00:02:18.870> jump<00:02:19.140> into<00:02:19.200> live

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
examples before we jump into live

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
examples before we jump into live
gameplay<00:02:22.850> alrighty<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.180> once<00:02:24.600> again<00:02:24.690> this

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
gameplay alrighty so now once again this

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.690 
gameplay alrighty so now once again this
is<00:02:24.989> against<00:02:25.200> bots<00:02:25.410> we<00:02:26.160> are<00:02:26.250> gonna<00:02:26.370> jump<00:02:26.550> into

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
is against bots we are gonna jump into

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.970 
is against bots we are gonna jump into
live<00:02:26.820> gameplay<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:27.330> how<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.780> useful<00:02:27.980> of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
live gameplay but how this is useful of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.620 
live gameplay but how this is useful of
course<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.519> against<00:02:29.760> bots<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.300> keep<00:02:30.510> in

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
course it is against bots but keep in

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.360 
course it is against bots but keep in
mind<00:02:30.660> bots<00:02:30.989> don't<00:02:31.290> miss<00:02:31.470> shots<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.160> fact

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
mind bots don't miss shots so the fact

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.470 
mind bots don't miss shots so the fact
that<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:32.580> staying<00:02:32.850> behind<00:02:32.940> cover<00:02:33.269> without

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
that I'm staying behind cover without

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.060 
that I'm staying behind cover without
even<00:02:33.810> being<00:02:33.900> hit<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.590> shows<00:02:34.920> how

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
even being hit really shows how

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.040 
even being hit really shows how
effective<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.519> pop<00:02:35.700> shot<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
effective the pop shot is you can do the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.600 
effective the pop shot is you can do the
pop<00:02:37.230> shot<00:02:37.410> either<00:02:37.500> long<00:02:37.769> rain<00:02:38.040> or<00:02:38.280> sorry<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
pop shot either long rain or sorry the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.280 
pop shot either long rain or sorry the
slap<00:02:38.819> shot<00:02:38.850> either<00:02:39.269> long<00:02:39.630> range<00:02:39.870> or<00:02:40.050> close

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
slap shot either long range or close

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.960 
slap shot either long range or close
range<00:02:40.560> right<00:02:41.160> here<00:02:41.340> might<00:02:41.489> not<00:02:41.519> be<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.819> best

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
range right here might not be the best

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.790 
range right here might not be the best
example<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.480> when<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.810> do<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.620> was

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
example of when to do it but this was

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.290 
example of when to do it but this was
this<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.069> course<00:02:44.100> was<00:02:44.519> for<00:02:44.700> demonstrative

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
this of course was for demonstrative

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.250 
this of course was for demonstrative
purposes<00:02:47.390> again<00:02:48.390> notice<00:02:48.930> how<00:02:48.959> I'm<00:02:49.140> putting

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
purposes again notice how I'm putting

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.229 
purposes again notice how I'm putting
such<00:02:49.620> powerful<00:02:50.069> shots<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.790> shot<00:02:51.060> down

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
such powerful shots I just to shot down

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.530 
such powerful shots I just to shot down
to<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.510> bot<00:02:51.720> without<00:02:52.290> even<00:02:52.530> being<00:02:52.650> hit<00:02:56.540> of

to that bot without even being hit of

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.880 
to that bot without even being hit of
course<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:58.079> important<00:02:58.410> remember<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.769> need

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
course it's important remember you need

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.319 
course it's important remember you need
to<00:02:58.950> be<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> piece<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.549> cover<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.940> can<00:03:00.060> you

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
to be on a piece of cover that can you

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.449 
to be on a piece of cover that can you
can<00:03:00.450> aim<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.930> look<00:03:01.019> down

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.250 

in<00:03:04.030> this<00:03:04.120> situation<00:03:04.659> you<00:03:04.750> obviously<00:03:05.049> want<00:03:05.200> to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
in this situation you obviously want to

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.899 
in this situation you obviously want to
back<00:03:05.409> off<00:03:05.590> once<00:03:06.010> again<00:03:06.159> for<00:03:06.459> demonstrative

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
back off once again for demonstrative

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.280

that bot from behind cover without even
being<00:03:13.659> touched<00:03:16.920> now<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.310> also<00:03:18.459> important<00:03:18.969> to

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
being touched now it's also important to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.220 
being touched now it's also important to
note<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.359> can<00:03:19.510> mess<00:03:19.689> up<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.989> slap<00:03:20.200> shot

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
note that you can mess up the slap shot

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.319 
note that you can mess up the slap shot
it's<00:03:20.709> actually<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.040> somewhat<00:03:21.579> difficult<00:03:21.790> shot

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
it's actually a somewhat difficult shot

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.179 
it's actually a somewhat difficult shot
to<00:03:22.359> hit<00:03:22.659> as<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.319> will<00:03:23.469> see<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.799> couple

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
to hit as you will see in a couple

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.250 
to hit as you will see in a couple
seconds<00:03:24.609> in<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:24.849> video<00:03:25.090> there<00:03:25.959> is<00:03:25.989> a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
seconds in this video there is a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.360 
seconds in this video there is a
possibility<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.769> messed<00:03:26.920> up<00:03:27.010> that's<00:03:27.189> why<00:03:27.310> I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
possibility of messed up that's why I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.399 
possibility of messed up that's why I
didn't<00:03:27.639> label<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.000> as<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.120> moderate<00:03:28.599> difficulty

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
didn't label it as a moderate difficulty

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.709 
didn't label it as a moderate difficulty
at<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.859> beginning<00:03:30.099> of<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.340> slide<00:03:30.629> here<00:03:31.629> we

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:31.719 
at the beginning of this slide here we

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.420 
at the beginning of this slide here we
go<00:03:31.840> for<00:03:32.379> BOTS<00:03:32.590> rushing<00:03:32.950> me<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.159> it's<00:03:33.280> also

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
go for BOTS rushing me and it's also

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.679 
go for BOTS rushing me and it's also
really<00:03:33.609> good<00:03:33.879> obviously<00:03:34.209> to<00:03:34.299> get<00:03:34.389> one<00:03:34.540> shot

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
really good obviously to get one shot

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.360 
really good obviously to get one shot
headshot<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:35.349> saw<00:03:35.500> right<00:03:35.650> there<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.040> right

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
headshot you saw right there and right

headshot you saw right there and right
there<00:03:36.639> as<00:03:36.819> well<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:42.790> think<00:03:43.000> here<00:03:43.180> in<00:03:43.239> a

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
there as well and I think here in a

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.550 
there as well and I think here in a
second<00:03:43.540> turn<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.870> see<00:03:43.989> me<00:03:44.079> actually<00:03:44.349> messed

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
second turn you see me actually messed

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.909 
second turn you see me actually messed
up

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
up

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.149 
up
it's<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.459> slap<00:03:45.939> shot<00:03:45.970> not<00:03:46.510> yet<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:48.010> it's

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
it's the slap shot not yet but it's

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.800 
it's the slap shot not yet but it's
coming<00:03:48.189> in<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.609> second<00:03:48.969> so<00:03:49.090> bear<00:03:49.480> with<00:03:49.510> me<00:03:49.659> just

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
coming in a second so bear with me just

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.819 
coming in a second so bear with me just
for<00:03:50.139> a<00:03:50.200> second<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.799> there<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.849> is<00:03:52.439> so<00:03:53.439> as<00:03:53.680> you

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
for a second and there it is so as you

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.800 
for a second and there it is so as you
saw<00:03:54.069> instead<00:03:54.669> of<00:03:54.790> actually<00:03:55.120> pop<00:03:55.329> shotting<00:03:55.689> I

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
saw instead of actually pop shotting I

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.300 
saw instead of actually pop shotting I
essentially<00:03:56.349> just<00:03:56.379> blind<00:03:56.769> fired<00:03:57.069> over<00:03:57.219> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
essentially just blind fired over the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.890 
essentially just blind fired over the
wall<00:03:57.489> which<00:03:57.700> is<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.939> common<00:03:58.299> way<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.480> mess<00:03:58.719> up

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
wall which is the common way to mess up

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.569 
wall which is the common way to mess up
the<00:03:59.109> slap<00:03:59.319> shot<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.769> you<00:04:00.159> really<00:04:00.370> need<00:04:00.519> to

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
the slap shot and you really need to

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.849 
the slap shot and you really need to
practice<00:04:00.730> this<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.299> scrimmages<00:04:01.870> ranked

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
practice this and scrimmages ranked

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.640 
practice this and scrimmages ranked
matches<00:04:03.040> whatever<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.579> might<00:04:03.669> be<00:04:04.349> also<00:04:05.349> keep

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
matches whatever it might be also keep

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.080 
matches whatever it might be also keep
in<00:04:05.739> mind<00:04:05.769> it's<00:04:06.010> not<00:04:06.129> always<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.549> best<00:04:06.639> option

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
in mind it's not always the best option

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.520 
in mind it's not always the best option

make sure you remember you do need a

make sure you remember you do need a
two-piece<00:04:52.210> cover<00:04:52.510> so<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.870> need<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.230> a

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
two-piece cover so you need to have a

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.170 
two-piece cover so you need to have a
cover<00:04:53.530> where<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:53.770> can<00:04:53.890> look<00:04:54.040> up<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.460> name<00:04:54.490> over

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
or look over and aim up I think it is

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.580 
or look over and aim up I think it is
personal<00:04:58.030> preference<00:04:58.240> like<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.630> said<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:59.140> have

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
personal preference like I said I have

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.530 
personal preference like I said I have
found<00:04:59.740> it<00:04:59.920> to<00:04:59.950> be<00:05:00.070> more<00:05:00.220> effective<00:05:00.360> aiming<00:05:01.360> up

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
found it to be more effective aiming up

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.560 
found it to be more effective aiming up
and<00:05:01.810> looking<00:05:02.260> over<00:05:02.470> very<00:05:02.860> very<00:05:03.130> quickly

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
and looking over very very quickly

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.180 
and looking over very very quickly
better<00:05:04.570> than<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.810> great<00:05:05.320> shot<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.800> use<00:05:05.980> in<00:05:06.100> a
