00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
probably about like still about 20% when

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
probably about like still about 20% when
it's<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.080> super<00:01:07.470> damp<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> tad

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's not super damp but it is just a tad

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's not super damp but it is just a tad
bit<00:01:08.670> still<00:01:09.119> damp<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.229> pretty<00:01:10.439> much<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
bit still damp it's not pretty much just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
bit still damp it's not pretty much just
I'm<00:01:11.460> setting<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.240> hair<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.020> kind

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
I'm setting my hair with that and kind

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.539 
I'm setting my hair with that and kind
of<00:01:13.320> making<00:01:13.530> sure<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> keeper<00:01:14.310> touches

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
of making sure that keeper touches

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
of making sure that keeper touches
pretty<00:01:14.820> much<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.240> entire<00:01:15.570> head<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.590> for

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
pretty much all of my entire head so for

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
pretty much all of my entire head so for
the<00:01:16.979> blow-drying<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.820> pretty<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.420> use<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the blow-drying I pretty much use the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.630 
the blow-drying I pretty much use the
addition<00:01:19.439> method<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:20.100> majority<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
addition method for majority of this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.280 
addition method for majority of this
process<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.689> all<00:01:21.780> you're<00:01:21.930> doing<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.259> just

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
process so all you're doing is just

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.620 
process so all you're doing is just
stuffing<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> hair<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:23.610> gently<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.390> not

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
stuffing the hair very gently but not

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.280 
stuffing the hair very gently but not
too<00:01:24.840> hard

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
too hard

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
too hard
I'm<00:01:25.619> studying<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> hair<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.790> pretty<00:01:26.939> much

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
I'm studying the hair and pretty much

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.850 
I'm studying the hair and pretty much
taking<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:27.960> blow-dryer<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.770> get

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
taking my blow-dryer and when we get

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
taking my blow-dryer and when we get
backwards<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> board<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> heat<00:01:31.079> is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
backwards and board so that the heat is

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.730 
backwards and board so that the heat is
able<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.650> cover<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:32.100> entire<00:01:32.220> action<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> hair

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
able to cover my entire action of hair

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
able to cover my entire action of hair
and<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> guys<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:36.000> wondering<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.510> do<00:01:36.570> have

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and if you guys are wondering I do have

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.950 
and if you guys are wondering I do have
my<00:01:37.020> blow-dryer<00:01:37.290> set<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.100> warm<00:01:38.729> high<00:01:39.030> heat<00:01:39.330> if<00:01:39.540> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
my blow-dryer set on warm high heat if I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.930 
my blow-dryer set on warm high heat if I
did<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.470> low<00:01:40.799> heat<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:41.430> take<00:01:41.640> literally

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
did do low heat it was take literally

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.880 
did do low heat it was take literally
forever<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.320> decide<00:01:43.650> to<00:01:43.680> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
forever to do that so I decide to just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.330 
forever to do that so I decide to just
do<00:01:44.130> warm<00:01:44.490> high<00:01:44.850> heat<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.479> once<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.860> my

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
do warm high heat and once I do that my
hair<00:01:47.550> usually<00:01:47.759> still<00:01:48.060> has<00:01:48.210> kinks<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.780> tangles

hair usually still has kinks and tangles
and<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.650> take<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> large<00:01:50.400> paddle<00:01:50.820> brush

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and it's all take a large paddle brush

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.969 
and it's all take a large paddle brush
and<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:51.720> brush<00:01:51.960> them<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.259> very<00:01:52.560> gently

starting<00:01:53.340> from<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.180> ends<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.869> going

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
starting from this the ends and going

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.499 
starting from this the ends and going
towards<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> root<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> really<00:01:57.149> helps<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
towards the root so that really helps it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.389 
towards the root so that really helps it
swim<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:57.810> hair<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.649> minimize<00:01:59.070> as

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
swim my hair out and just minimize as

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.609 
swim my hair out and just minimize as
many<00:01:59.610> tangles<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.300> possible<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.990> want

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
many tangles as possible I want

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.280 
many tangles as possible I want
something<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.430> tuck<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.729> away

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
something with that that is tuck it away

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.899 
something with that that is tuck it away
so<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.500> ochsenknecht<00:02:04.979> section<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> take

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
so now ochsenknecht section I take

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.330 
so now ochsenknecht section I take
another<00:02:06.600> vegan<00:02:06.990> section<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.470> hair<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.130> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
another vegan section of hair and I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.009 
another vegan section of hair and I
pretty<00:02:08.580> much<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.970> exact<00:02:09.300> same<00:02:09.330> step<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
pretty much do the exact same step so I

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.070 
pretty much do the exact same step so I
apply<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.769> heat<00:02:11.700> protectant<00:02:12.180> first<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.959> then

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
apply my heat protectant first and then

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.050 
apply my heat protectant first and then
I<00:02:13.140> take<00:02:13.500> my<00:02:13.530> blow-dryer<00:02:14.040> which<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.610> set<00:02:14.820> on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I take my blow-dryer which is set on

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.180 
I take my blow-dryer which is set on
warm<00:02:15.600> high<00:02:15.810> heat<00:02:16.110> into<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.440> tension<00:02:16.860> method

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
warm high heat into the tension method

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.100 
warm high heat into the tension method
which<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.030> tugging<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.420> hair<00:02:18.720> very

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
which is just tugging the hair very

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.590 
which is just tugging the hair very
gently<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.280> bringing<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.000> blow-dryer

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
gently and it's bringing the blow-dryer

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.300 
gently and it's bringing the blow-dryer
backwards<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.260> board<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.739> make<00:02:22.860> sure<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
backwards and board to make sure that

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.460 
backwards and board to make sure that
the<00:02:23.610> whole<00:02:23.790> section<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.150> hair<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.630> getting<00:02:24.989> all

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the whole section of hair is getting all

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.830 
the whole section of hair is getting all
of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.830> heat<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.420> straight

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
of the heat so it's just really straight

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.330 
of the heat so it's just really straight
for<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.290> love<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.560> method<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.160> this

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
for I love this method because this

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.490 
for I love this method because this
makes<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.030> blow<00:02:30.360> drying<00:02:30.570> process<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.290> much

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
makes the blow drying process so much

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.790 
makes the blow drying process so much
easier<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.959> then<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.080> course<00:02:34.350> if<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.620> have

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
easier and then of course if you have

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.770 
easier and then of course if you have
any<00:02:34.830> tangles<00:02:35.340> or<00:02:35.610> any<00:02:35.790> extra<00:02:36.120> kinks<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.600> there

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
any tangles or any extra kinks in there

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.390 
any tangles or any extra kinks in there
just<00:02:37.230> go<00:02:37.410> ahead<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.709> take<00:02:37.800> your<00:02:37.920> paddle<00:02:38.220> brush

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
just go ahead and take your paddle brush

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.729 
just go ahead and take your paddle brush
and<00:02:38.730> expression<00:02:39.269> out<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.989> will<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:40.500> help

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
and expression out this will really help

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.920 
and expression out this will really help
to<00:02:40.890> minimize<00:02:41.549> frizz<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.180> it'll<00:02:42.480> really<00:02:42.600> help

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
to minimize frizz and it'll really help

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.319 
to minimize frizz and it'll really help
to<00:02:43.230> smooth<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> hair<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.950> smooth<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.280> possible
