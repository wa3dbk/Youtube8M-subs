recently now the first couple of changes
have<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:21.840> ladders<00:00:22.970> first<00:00:23.970> being<00:00:24.269> in

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
have to do with ladders first being in

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.900 
have to do with ladders first being in
constructing<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> ladders<00:00:25.980> now<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> used<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
constructing the ladders now it used to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.279 
constructing the ladders now it used to
be<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> when<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> sticks<00:00:27.990> into

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
be that when you put the sticks into

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.589 
be that when you put the sticks into
your<00:00:28.560> inventory<00:00:28.910> into<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> crafting<00:00:30.330> window

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
your inventory into the crafting window

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
your inventory into the crafting window
sorry<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.369> only<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.640> one

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
sorry like so you would only get one

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
sorry like so you would only get one
ladder<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.200> changed<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.800> now

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
ladder out but it's changed so that now

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.380 
ladder out but it's changed so that now
you<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.640> which<00:00:35.820> i<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.239> great

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you get to out which i think is a great

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
you get to out which i think is a great
thing<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.050> lovers<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:37.860> always<00:00:38.070> quite

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
thing because lovers are always quite

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.790 
thing because lovers are always quite
costly<00:00:38.809> however<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.079> benefits<00:00:40.590> been

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
costly however this benefits been

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.799 
costly however this benefits been
outweighed<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.610> cost<00:00:42.000> which<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
outweighed by a cost which I'm about to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.720 
outweighed by a cost which I'm about to
go<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:44.120> now<00:00:45.530> one<00:00:46.530> popular<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.370> use

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
go over now one popular way to use

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.630 
go over now one popular way to use
ladders<00:00:48.030> used<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.649> one-block<00:00:50.280> gap

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
ladders used to be with a one-block gap

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970 
ladders used to be with a one-block gap
in<00:00:50.879> between<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.050> able<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.440> cross

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
in between as you are able to cross

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.840 
in between as you are able to cross
right<00:00:53.730> past<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.390> gap<00:00:55.129> however<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.579> as

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
right past that gap however now as

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.510 
right past that gap however now as
you'll<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:58.079> no<00:00:58.559> longer<00:00:58.770> works<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.399> get

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you'll see that no longer works you get

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.360 
you'll see that no longer works you get
stuck<00:00:59.940> halfway<00:01:00.239> between<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> two<00:01:00.989> ladders

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
stuck halfway between the two ladders

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.939 
stuck halfway between the two ladders
now<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.120> need<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.619> ladders

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
now what you need to do is put ladders

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.730 
now what you need to do is put ladders
all<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:10.490> as<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.710> on

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
all the way up like so as you can see on

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
all the way up like so as you can see on
my<00:01:13.920> other<00:01:14.130> world<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.670> saved<00:01:14.970> while<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
my other world are saved while down a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
my other world are saved while down a
hole<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:17.100> nearly<00:01:17.400> enough<00:01:17.549> letters<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
hole with not nearly enough letters to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.640 
hole with not nearly enough letters to
get<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> problem

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
get out so this is a bit of a problem

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.060 
get out so this is a bit of a problem
for<00:01:20.280> me<00:01:21.140> next<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.040> my

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
for me next as you can see in my

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.830 
for me next as you can see in my
inventory<00:01:23.400> button<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.150> bottom<00:01:24.390> we've<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
inventory button the bottom we've got a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
inventory button the bottom we've got a
couple<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.229> new<00:01:25.380> rail<00:01:25.650> pieces<00:01:25.950> we've<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
couple of new rail pieces we've got the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.319 
couple of new rail pieces we've got the
detector<00:01:27.479> rail<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.350> powered<00:01:28.770> rail<00:01:29.329> now

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
detector rail and the powered rail now

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.880 
detector rail and the powered rail now
the<00:01:30.390> good<00:01:30.659> thing<00:01:30.810> about<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.110> power<00:01:31.320> rail<00:01:31.619> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the good thing about the power rail is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
the good thing about the power rail is
that<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> requires<00:01:32.610> gold<00:01:33.060> ingots<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.869> it's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that it requires gold ingots so it's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.950 
that it requires gold ingots so it's
good<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.470> finally<00:01:34.710> has<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> use

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
good that it finally has a use

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.240 
good that it finally has a use
constructing<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.320> powered<00:01:37.740> rail<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> pretty

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
constructing the powered rail is pretty

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.420 
constructing the powered rail is pretty
much<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> same<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:39.000> constructing<00:01:39.840> your

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
much the same as constructing your

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
much the same as constructing your
regular<00:01:41.430> mine<00:01:41.670> cart<00:01:41.970> rail<00:01:42.240> except<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
regular mine cart rail except for the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.740 
regular mine cart rail except for the
fact<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.250> uses<00:01:44.490> gold<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> sides<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
fact that it uses gold in the sides and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.319 
fact that it uses gold in the sides and
a<00:01:46.140> piece<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> redstone<00:01:46.740> down<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> bottom<00:01:47.670> also

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
a piece of redstone down the bottom also

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
a piece of redstone down the bottom also
instead<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.659> getting<00:01:48.840> 16<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.799> with<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
instead of getting 16 out like with the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.920 
instead of getting 16 out like with the
normal<00:01:50.340> rail<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.820> only<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.180> six<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
normal rail you only get six of the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.010 
normal rail you only get six of the
powered<00:01:52.290> rail<00:01:52.850> now<00:01:53.850> next<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> detector

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
powered rail now next up is the detector

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.139 
powered rail now next up is the detector
rail<00:01:55.229> now<00:01:55.860> again<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.549> made<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:57.030> like

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
rail now again this is made just like

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
rail now again this is made just like
the<00:01:57.450> regular<00:01:57.630> rail<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> couple<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the regular rail just with a couple of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.609 
the regular rail just with a couple of
small<00:01:59.399> differences<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.110> does<00:02:01.320> use

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
small differences so this one does use

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
the detector rails are is that even

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.610 
the detector rails are is that even
though<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.270> made<00:02:33.510> using<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.020> stone<00:02:34.290> pressure

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620

though it's made using a stone pressure
plate<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.430> acts<00:02:35.790> as<00:02:36.090> though<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.690> made<00:02:37.080> using

a<00:02:37.500> wooden<00:02:37.740> pressure<00:02:38.040> plate<00:02:38.340> what<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> mean<00:02:39.420> by

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
a wooden pressure plate what I mean by

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.080 
a wooden pressure plate what I mean by
this<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.900> even<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:40.770> an<00:02:40.920> empty<00:02:41.610> minecart

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
this is that even if an empty minecart

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.040 
this is that even if an empty minecart
passes<00:02:42.540> over<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.890> will<00:02:44.070> give<00:02:44.250> off<00:02:44.400> signal

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
passes over it it will give off signal

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.380 
passes over it it will give off signal
this<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.290> my<00:02:46.470> mind<00:02:46.710> makes<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.940> pressure<00:02:48.180> plate

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this in my mind makes the pressure plate

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.870 
this in my mind makes the pressure plate
rather<00:02:48.870> useless<00:02:49.470> aside<00:02:50.130> from<00:02:50.280> when<00:02:50.490> used<00:02:50.700> in

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
rather useless aside from when used in

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.200 
rather useless aside from when used in
combination<00:02:51.120> with<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.750> power<00:02:52.230> rail<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.970> reason

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
combination with a power rail the reason

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.170 
combination with a power rail the reason
I<00:02:54.270> say<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:55.140> power<00:02:55.680> rails

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
I say this is that power rails

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.510 
I say this is that power rails
ironically<00:02:57.180> need<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.510> be<00:02:57.600> powered<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.980> unless

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
ironically need to be powered so unless

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.070 
ironically need to be powered so unless
they're<00:02:59.790> powered<00:03:00.150> they<00:03:00.300> will<00:03:00.450> act<00:03:00.600> as<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> brake

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
they're powered they will act as a brake

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.720 
they're powered they will act as a brake
and<00:03:01.350> they'll<00:03:01.500> stop<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.980> minecart<00:03:02.460> in<00:03:02.580> its

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
and they'll stop the minecart in its

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.090 
and they'll stop the minecart in its
tracks<00:03:03.290> however<00:03:04.290> once<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.530> power<00:03:04.830> them

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
tracks however once you power them

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.930 
tracks however once you power them
you'll<00:03:05.520> see<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.850> red<00:03:06.030> sections<00:03:06.660> glow<00:03:07.050> and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
you'll see the red sections glow and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.290 
you'll see the red sections glow and
they<00:03:08.940> will<00:03:09.090> now<00:03:09.240> act<00:03:09.480> as<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:10.100> booster<00:03:11.100> as<00:03:11.310> a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
they will now act as a booster as a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.510 
they will now act as a booster as a
result<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.110> only<00:03:13.380> real<00:03:13.590> purpose<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.250> see

the power rails this is something I find

the power rails this is something I find
really<00:03:20.700> disappointing<00:03:21.450> because<00:03:21.720> for<00:03:22.050> me<00:03:22.170> it's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
really disappointing because for me it's

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.900 
really disappointing because for me it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
as well that the old-school boosters

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.090 
as well that the old-school boosters
that<00:03:51.660> we've<00:03:51.780> been<00:03:51.900> using<00:03:52.200> up<00:03:52.440> until<00:03:52.740> now<00:03:52.800> would

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
that we've been using up until now would

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.250 
that we've been using up until now would
be<00:03:53.220> removed<00:03:53.580> from<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.000> game<00:03:54.210> as<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.020> see

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
be removed from the game as you can see

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.810 
be removed from the game as you can see
as<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.770> update<00:03:56.160> they're<00:03:56.370> still<00:03:56.610> working

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
as of this update they're still working

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.850 
as of this update they're still working
perfectly<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.170> means<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:58.440> all<00:03:58.680> those

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
perfectly so this means that all those

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.320 
perfectly so this means that all those
mine<00:03:59.100> cart<00:03:59.370> systems<00:03:59.820> that<00:03:59.970> you've<00:04:00.060> designed

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
mine cart systems that you've designed

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.860 
mine cart systems that you've designed
thus<00:04:00.600> far<00:04:00.840> won't<00:04:01.230> break<00:04:01.500> down<00:04:01.740> just<00:04:02.100> yet<00:04:02.870> now

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
thus far won't break down just yet now

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.830 
thus far won't break down just yet now
of<00:04:04.080> course<00:04:04.140> we<00:04:04.380> all<00:04:04.560> know<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.220> addition<00:04:05.610> of

that aside from being completely

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.860 
that aside from being completely

I know doc a.m. has been waiting for for

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.080 
I know doc a.m. has been waiting for for
quite<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.430> while<00:04:48.699> is<00:04:49.440> these<00:04:50.440> unique<00:04:51.400> saplings

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
quite a while is these unique saplings

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.000 
quite a while is these unique saplings
so<00:04:52.389> each<00:04:52.570> different<00:04:52.840> type<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.199> tree<00:04:53.650> that<00:04:53.680> you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
so each different type of tree that you

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.240 
so each different type of tree that you
chop<00:04:54.280> down<00:04:54.720> will<00:04:55.720> drop<00:04:56.380> different<00:04:56.860> types<00:04:57.100> of

chop down will drop different types of

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.430 
chop down will drop different types of
saplings<00:04:57.520> so<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.479> planting<00:04:58.900> them<00:04:59.050> will<00:04:59.260> grow

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
saplings so that planting them will grow

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.240 
saplings so that planting them will grow

that particular type of tree the snow

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.700 
that particular type of tree the snow
and<00:05:03.520> rain<00:05:03.700> were<00:05:03.970> also<00:05:04.300> introduced<00:05:04.870> but<00:05:05.169> after

and rain were also introduced but after
