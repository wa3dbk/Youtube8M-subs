00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
everyone this is going to be a video

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.830 
everyone this is going to be a video
showing<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.310> some<00:00:02.639> tips<00:00:03.060> for<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.480> ortega

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
showing you some tips for the ortega

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.530 
showing you some tips for the ortega
method<00:00:04.259> for<00:00:04.529> doing<00:00:04.620> it<00:00:04.830> faster<00:00:05.220> um<00:00:05.480> these<00:00:06.480> are

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
method for doing it faster um these are

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.849 
method for doing it faster um these are
pretty<00:00:06.930> much<00:00:07.049> all<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.319> things<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.710> i<00:00:07.740> do

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
pretty much all the things that i do

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.299 
pretty much all the things that i do
when<00:00:08.400> i'm<00:00:08.519> using<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> ortega<00:00:09.480> method<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.309> so

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
when i'm using the ortega method and so

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.829 
when i'm using the ortega method and so
the<00:00:11.429> first<00:00:11.639> thing<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.450> pretty<00:00:13.019> basic<00:00:14.839> pretty

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the first thing is pretty basic pretty

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
the first thing is pretty basic pretty
much<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.199> must<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.800> color<00:00:17.190> neutral<00:00:17.430> it's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
much you just must be color neutral it's

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.760 
much you just must be color neutral it's
an<00:00:18.060> absolute<00:00:18.570> must<00:00:18.750> because<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> lot<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.500> times

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
an absolute must because a lot of times

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.580 
an absolute must because a lot of times
if<00:00:20.550> you're<00:00:20.789> only<00:00:21.000> able<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.539> do<00:00:21.720> white<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
if you're only able to do white see you

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.640 
if you're only able to do white see you
have<00:00:22.769> kind<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.420> it's<00:00:24.420> an<00:00:24.630> okay<00:00:25.080> case<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
have kind of it's an okay case for the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.910 
have kind of it's an okay case for the
white<00:00:25.830> space<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.150> lot<00:00:27.300> better<00:00:27.920> for

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
white space but it's a lot better for

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.639 
white space but it's a lot better for
red<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.630> four<00:00:31.080> moves<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.500> could

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
red you have four moves and that could

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.799 
red you have four moves and that could
be<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> lot<00:00:36.000> faster<00:00:36.210> than<00:00:36.540> trying

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
be that will be a lot faster than trying

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.139 
be that will be a lot faster than trying
to<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.140> white<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.680> loved<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> sometimes<00:00:39.000> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
to do on white I loved and sometimes you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
to do on white I loved and sometimes you
even<00:00:39.300> have<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> complete<00:00:39.930> face<00:00:40.170> done<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
even have a complete face done for you

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.250 
even have a complete face done for you
and<00:00:41.120> being<00:00:42.120> colored<00:00:42.390> neutral<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.780> CY<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and being colored neutral on CY to you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
and being colored neutral on CY to you
is<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.649> easy<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.090> thing<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is very easy because the thing that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.940 
is very easy because the thing that
makes<00:00:45.510> being<00:00:45.719> called<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> neutral<00:00:46.289> heart<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.710> on

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
makes being called a neutral heart is on

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.209 
makes being called a neutral heart is on
3<00:00:47.340> by<00:00:47.489> 3<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> f2<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.739> don't<00:00:49.770> have

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
3 by 3 is the f2 all and you don't have

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
3 by 3 is the f2 all and you don't have
an<00:00:50.430> F<00:00:50.550> too<00:00:50.579> well<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.840> very<00:00:52.020> easy<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.500> be

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
an F too well so it's very easy to be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
an F too well so it's very easy to be
color<00:00:53.010> neutral<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.559> by<00:00:55.710> two<00:00:56.719> now

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
color neutral on a on a two by two now

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.599 
color neutral on a on a two by two now
the<00:00:57.780> only<00:00:58.020> bad<00:00:58.350> thing<00:00:58.379> about<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.129> Ortega

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the only bad thing about the Ortega

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
the only bad thing about the Ortega
method<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.300> think<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.140> number

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
method that I can think of is the number

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.100 
method that I can think of is the number
of<00:01:01.440> steps<00:01:01.879> there<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.030> three<00:01:03.300> steps<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of steps there are three steps and it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.020 
of steps there are three steps and it's
not<00:01:04.199> necessarily<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.769> steps<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:05.519> bad<00:01:05.760> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
not necessarily the steps that's bad is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
not necessarily the steps that's bad is
the<00:01:06.630> puppets<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> pause<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.770> people<00:01:08.100> have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the puppets the pause that people have

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.789 
the puppets the pause that people have
in<00:01:08.610> between<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> steps<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.590> basically

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
in between the steps and so basically

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.830 
in between the steps and so basically
these<00:01:11.310> next<00:01:11.670> few<00:01:11.850> tips<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.420> about

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
these next few tips are all about

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
these next few tips are all about
reducing<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.979> number<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.280> pauses<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.909> have

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
reducing the number of pauses you have

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
reducing the number of pauses you have
in<00:01:15.270> between<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> steps<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.290> make<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.590> one

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
in between the steps just make it one

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.200 
in between the steps just make it one
smooth<00:01:17.820> solve<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.820> when<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.180> your

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
smooth solve and so when you make your

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.810 
smooth solve and so when you make your
first<00:01:21.659> place<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:23.009> should<00:01:23.040> always<00:01:23.460> always

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
first place you should always always

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
first place you should always always
always<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.869> inspection<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.680> try<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
always use your inspection to try to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.700 
always use your inspection to try to
figure<00:01:26.159> out<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:27.060> case<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
figure out what case you have on the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.649 
figure out what case you have on the
bottom<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.729> bottom<00:01:29.759> thinks<00:01:30.240> whether<00:01:30.450> it's

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bottom on the bottom thinks whether it's

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
bottom on the bottom thinks whether it's
adjacent<00:01:31.590> switch<00:01:32.009> diagnose<00:01:32.670> switch<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.090> if

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
adjacent switch diagnose switch or if

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.469 
adjacent switch diagnose switch or if
it's<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.540> completely<00:01:33.990> solved<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:35.270> easy<00:01:36.270> way

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it's all completely solved and easy way

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.179 
it's all completely solved and easy way
to<00:01:36.540> tell<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.890> times<00:01:38.040> you'll

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to tell is just a lot of times you'll

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.560 
to tell is just a lot of times you'll
have<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.549> next<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.909> each<00:01:38.970> other<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.420> can

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
have two next to each other and you can

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.539 
have two next to each other and you can
see<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> these<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.650> are<00:01:40.710> solved<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
see that these two are solved so it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.740 
see that these two are solved so it's
either<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> whole<00:01:42.450> thing<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
either going to be the whole thing is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.940 
either going to be the whole thing is
solved<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:45.259> these<00:01:46.259> two<00:01:46.470> aren't<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
solved or these two aren't you going to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590 
solved or these two aren't you going to
be<00:01:47.070> switched<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.299> piece

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
be switched and I see that this piece

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.490 
be switched and I see that this piece
I'm<00:01:48.869> gonna<00:01:49.100> put<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.479> if<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> do

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I'm gonna put there if I was going to do

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.410 
I'm gonna put there if I was going to do
this<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.860> piece<00:01:53.070> would<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
this this piece would go there and I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
this this piece would go there and I
would<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.990> does<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.350> match<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
would see that this does not match up to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.310 
would see that this does not match up to
that<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> already<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.869> these<00:01:58.079> two

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
that so I already know that these two

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
that so I already know that these two
are<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.710> split

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179 

another<00:02:03.780> thing<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.439> always<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:05.100> able

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
another thing is that you always be able

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.490 
another thing is that you always be able
to<00:02:05.369> tell<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:06.390> case<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.049> by<00:02:07.290> just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
to tell what case you have by just

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.839 
to tell what case you have by just
looking<00:02:07.829> at<00:02:07.950> two<00:02:08.250> sides<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.720> bottom<00:02:10.020> layer

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
looking at two sides of the bottom layer

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.830 
looking at two sides of the bottom layer
first<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:13.050> solid<00:02:14.720> two<00:02:15.720> of

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
first of all if you have a solid two of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.660 
first of all if you have a solid two of
the<00:02:15.900> same<00:02:16.050> colors<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:16.770> obviously<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.610> have

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the same colors then obviously you have

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.360 
the same colors then obviously you have
two<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> same<00:02:18.330> colors<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.739> if<00:02:20.130> you're

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
two of the same colors but if you're

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.740 
two of the same colors but if you're
just<00:02:20.550> looking<00:02:20.640> like<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.450> might<00:02:21.569> be<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
just looking like this it might be a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870 
just looking like this it might be a
little<00:02:21.900> bit<00:02:22.050> harder<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.349> tell<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:23.519> one<00:02:23.700> thing

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
little bit harder to tell but one thing

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.790 
little bit harder to tell but one thing
you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.180> know<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.319> have<00:02:25.530> two

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
you can know is that if you have two

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.699 
you can know is that if you have two
opposites<00:02:26.599> next<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.690> each<00:02:27.780> other<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.230> they're

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
opposites next to each other and they're

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.020 
opposites next to each other and they're
the<00:02:28.800> only<00:02:29.010> office<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.519> next<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.819> each<00:02:29.910> other

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the only office is next to each other

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.420 
the only office is next to each other
then<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.780> means<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.170> opposite<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
then I means the opposite on the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.100 
then I means the opposite on the
opposite<00:02:32.880> side<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.950> matching<00:02:34.950> colors

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
opposite side you have matching colors

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.900 
opposite side you have matching colors
but<00:02:37.110> let's<00:02:37.470> say<00:02:39.110> we<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.549> opposite<00:02:41.549> colors

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
but let's say we have opposite colors

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.120 
but let's say we have opposite colors
here<00:02:42.180> an<00:02:42.330> opposite<00:02:43.230> color<00:02:43.440> somewhere<00:02:43.890> else

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
here an opposite color somewhere else

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.330 
here an opposite color somewhere else
anywhere<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> cube<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:46.080> means<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
anywhere on the cube that means that you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.460 
anywhere on the cube that means that you
have<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.819> why<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.660> bottom<00:02:48.780> which<00:02:49.230> means

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
have a why on the bottom which means

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.289 
have a why on the bottom which means
that<00:02:49.590> they<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.400> switched<00:02:50.640> diagonally

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
that they have to be switched diagonally

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.809 
that they have to be switched diagonally
and<00:02:52.099> whenever<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.110> t-case<00:02:55.819> since

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
and whenever you have the t-case since

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.630 
and whenever you have the t-case since
you<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.420> taught<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.140> recognize<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:59.130> pbl

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you I taught you to recognize the pbl

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.430 
you I taught you to recognize the pbl
case<00:03:00.170> by<00:03:01.170> searching<00:03:01.890> for<00:03:02.069> these<00:03:02.459> bars<00:03:02.819> here

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
case by searching for these bars here

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.250 
case by searching for these bars here
you<00:03:04.440> should<00:03:04.590> always<00:03:04.769> know<00:03:04.920> where<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.580> bar<00:03:05.790> is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
you should always know where that bar is

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.050 
you should always know where that bar is
before<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.590> even<00:03:07.859> start<00:03:08.250> solving<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:08.940> you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
before you even start solving and you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.000 
before you even start solving and you
should<00:03:09.209> just<00:03:09.329> figured<00:03:09.630> all<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:09.870> out<00:03:10.049> during

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
should just figured all that out during

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:22.069 
should just figured all that out during
the<00:03:11.190> inspection<00:03:20.600> another<00:03:21.600> thing<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:21.870> you

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
the inspection another thing that you

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.990 
the inspection another thing that you
can<00:03:22.170> do<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:22.769> with<00:03:23.069> what<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> little<00:03:23.910> bit

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
can do but with what is a little bit

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.020 
can do but with what is a little bit
trickier<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.600> too<00:03:25.160> when<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.430> simple

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
trickier is too when you have a simple

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.960 
trickier is too when you have a simple
first<00:03:27.840> face<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.530> you've<00:03:29.250> already<00:03:29.430> figured

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
first face and you've already figured

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.340 
first face and you've already figured
out<00:03:30.180> which<00:03:30.450> case<00:03:30.720> you're<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.109> have<00:03:31.230> on

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
out which case you're going to have on

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.099 
out which case you're going to have on
the<00:03:31.380> bottom<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:31.889> this<00:03:32.040> case<00:03:32.750> these<00:03:33.750> two<00:03:33.989> need

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
the bottom in this case these two need

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.539 
the bottom in this case these two need
to<00:03:34.230> switch<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.889> this<00:03:35.010> means<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.250> half<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
to switch so this means a half of the

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.699 
to switch so this means a half of the
bar<00:03:35.760> here<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:37.079> after<00:03:37.139> you<00:03:37.290> figure<00:03:37.560> out<00:03:37.620> that

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
bar here so after you figure out that

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.069 
bar here so after you figure out that
doing<00:03:38.459> your<00:03:38.579> remaining<00:03:39.030> 15<00:03:39.569> seconds<00:03:39.989> of

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
doing your remaining 15 seconds of

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.140 
doing your remaining 15 seconds of
inspection<00:03:40.739> we<00:03:41.430> should<00:03:41.639> try<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.790> do<00:03:42.030> is

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
inspection we should try to do is

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.789 
inspection we should try to do is
predict<00:03:42.480> your<00:03:42.660> oh<00:03:42.690> okay<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.590> can<00:03:43.709> go

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
predict your oh okay so you can go

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.470 
predict your oh okay so you can go
straight<00:03:44.040> into<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.519> after<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:45.060> finish<00:03:45.359> the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
straight into it after you finish the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.770 
straight into it after you finish the
first<00:03:45.660> face<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:47.430> can<00:03:48.000> get<00:03:48.299> pretty<00:03:48.510> hard

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
first face and this can get pretty hard

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.250 
first face and this can get pretty hard
if<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.590> have<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:50.130> complicated<00:03:50.730> first<00:03:51.150> face<00:03:51.420> but

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
if you have a complicated first face but

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.720 
if you have a complicated first face but
you<00:03:52.350> shouldn't<00:03:52.590> have<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.769> complicated<00:03:53.310> first

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
you shouldn't have a complicated first

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.539 
you shouldn't have a complicated first
phase<00:03:53.940> too<00:03:54.180> often<00:03:54.569> if<00:03:54.750> your<00:03:54.900> color<00:03:55.109> neutral<00:03:55.549> so

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
phase too often if your color neutral so

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.370 
phase too often if your color neutral so
for<00:03:56.819> this<00:03:56.910> one<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.420> only<00:03:57.660> three<00:03:57.870> moves<00:03:58.049> are

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
for this one it's only three moves are

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.250 
for this one it's only three moves are
you<00:03:58.560> are<00:03:58.739> prime<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.549> even<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.389> follow<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
you are prime and I even just follow the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.800 
you are prime and I even just follow the
pieces<00:04:01.590> around<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:02.069> your<00:04:02.130> head<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.660> see

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
pieces around in your head and I can see

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.240 
pieces around in your head and I can see
that<00:04:03.989> I'll<00:04:04.109> have<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.760> diagonals<00:04:06.329> case<00:04:07.250> where

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
that I'll have the diagonals case where

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.520 
that I'll have the diagonals case where
two<00:04:08.579> of<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.049> corners<00:04:10.049> are<00:04:10.170> correctly

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
two of the corners are correctly

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.460 
two of the corners are correctly
oriented<00:04:10.879> so<00:04:11.879> when<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.360> do<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.290> just

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
oriented so when I do that I can just

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.380 
oriented so when I do that I can just
immediately

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
immediately

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.460 
immediately
go<00:04:14.660> into<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:16.489> algorithm<00:04:16.850> and<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.930> can

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
go into that the algorithm and I can

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.180 
go into that the algorithm and I can
just<00:04:18.590> go<00:04:18.739> fix<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:20.320> pbl<00:04:21.320> kiss<00:04:24.190> sometimes

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
just go fix the pbl kiss sometimes

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.870 
just go fix the pbl kiss sometimes
though<00:04:25.730> when<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.810> have<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.320> first<00:04:28.310> face<00:04:28.580> that's

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
though when you have a first face that's

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.880 
though when you have a first face that's
more<00:04:29.180> than<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.930> three<00:04:30.170> moves<00:04:30.380> or<00:04:30.590> something

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
more than like three moves or something

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.070 
more than like three moves or something
or<00:04:31.070> if<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.430> can't<00:04:31.820> seem<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:32.690> be<00:04:32.810> able<00:04:32.900> to

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
or if you just can't seem to be able to

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.270 
or if you just can't seem to be able to
predict<00:04:33.380> which<00:04:33.560> case<00:04:33.800> you're<00:04:33.950> going<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.130> get

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
predict which case you're going to get

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.760 
predict which case you're going to get
what<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.330> like<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.630> do<00:04:35.750> sometimes<00:04:36.050> when<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.470> can't

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
what I like to do sometimes when I can't

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.210 
what I like to do sometimes when I can't
do<00:04:36.919> it<00:04:36.950> is<00:04:37.400> um<00:04:37.840> right<00:04:38.840> when<00:04:39.590> I'm<00:04:39.710> about<00:04:39.740> to

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
do it is um right when I'm about to

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.210 
do it is um right when I'm about to
finish<00:04:40.400> my<00:04:41.090> first<00:04:41.570> face<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:42.110> will<00:04:42.440> slow<00:04:42.800> down<00:04:42.830> my

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
finish my first face I will slow down my

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.670 
finish my first face I will slow down my
turning<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:43.790> try<00:04:44.390> to<00:04:44.450> see<00:04:44.750> what<00:04:45.110> case<00:04:45.350> it<00:04:45.560> is

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
turning and try to see what case it is

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.860 
turning and try to see what case it is
before<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.130> happens<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:46.910> again<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:47.720> go

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
before it happens so I and again just go

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.570 
before it happens so I and again just go
straight<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.530> I<00:04:48.980> won't<00:04:49.190> have<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.310> pause

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
straight to it and I won't have a pause

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.710 
straight to it and I won't have a pause
and<00:04:49.970> even<00:04:50.180> though<00:04:50.240> you're<00:04:50.390> slowing<00:04:50.690> down

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
and even though you're slowing down

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.600 
and even though you're slowing down
it'll<00:04:51.230> still<00:04:51.470> be<00:04:51.590> faster<00:04:52.040> than<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.310> can<00:04:52.400> pause

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
it'll still be faster than you can pause

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.090 
it'll still be faster than you can pause
like<00:04:53.540> for<00:04:53.690> example<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:55.000> would<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.650> would<00:04:57.650> do<00:04:57.890> this

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
like for example I would I would do this

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.909 
like for example I would I would do this
fast<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.730> then<00:04:58.880> slow<00:04:59.390> down<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.900> I<00:04:59.990> see<00:05:00.290> these

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
fast and then slow down and I see these

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.180 
fast and then slow down and I see these
I<00:05:01.460> don't<00:05:02.419> see<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.660> code<00:05:02.960> GREEN<00:05:03.169> here<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.070> that

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
I don't see a code GREEN here so that

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
I don't see a code GREEN here so that
means<00:05:04.400> it's<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:06.530> case<00:05:06.770> and<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.790> can<00:05:07.940> just<00:05:08.060> do<00:05:08.180> a

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
means it's that case and I can just do a

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.990 
means it's that case and I can just do a
fade<00:05:08.419> into<00:05:11.230> another<00:05:12.230> thing<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.620> like<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:13.160> do<00:05:13.730> but

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
fade into another thing I like to do but

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.110 
fade into another thing I like to do but
isn't<00:05:14.390> really<00:05:14.660> necessary<00:05:14.810> is<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:16.220> be<00:05:16.760> able<00:05:16.880> to

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
isn't really necessary is to be able to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.870 
isn't really necessary is to be able to
do<00:05:17.300> all<00:05:17.570> cases<00:05:18.080> from<00:05:18.860> different<00:05:19.280> angles<00:05:19.640> like

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
do all cases from different angles like

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.190 
do all cases from different angles like
I<00:05:20.450> could<00:05:20.690> do<00:05:20.840> this<00:05:20.990> case<00:05:21.470> from<00:05:21.800> this<00:05:21.979> angle

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
I could do this case from this angle

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.370 
I could do this case from this angle
like<00:05:24.200> that<00:05:24.820> or<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:26.690> could<00:05:26.900> do<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.110> from<00:05:27.169> this

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
like that or I could do it from this

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.450 
like that or I could do it from this
angle<00:05:29.500> like<00:05:30.500> that<00:05:31.270> another<00:05:32.270> case<00:05:33.229> is<00:05:33.590> i<00:05:33.890> can<00:05:34.280> do

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
angle like that another case is i can do

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:42.430 
angle like that another case is i can do
this<00:05:35.090> case<00:05:35.390> like<00:05:35.660> this<00:05:38.830> or<00:05:39.830> i<00:05:39.860> can<00:05:40.820> do<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:42.020> with

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
this case like this or i can do it with

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.659 
this case like this or i can do it with
the<00:05:42.680> headlights<00:05:43.310> on<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.580> side<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:46.460> you<00:05:46.520> just

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
the headlights on the side so you just

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.909 
the headlights on the side so you just
search<00:05:46.910> around<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.330> internet<00:05:47.470> for<00:05:48.470> multiple

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
search around the internet for multiple

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.500 
search around the internet for multiple
algorithm<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.640> oh<00:05:49.669> okay<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:50.360> don't

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
algorithm for the oh okay so you don't

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.630 
algorithm for the oh okay so you don't
have<00:05:50.570> to<00:05:50.690> spend<00:05:50.930> time<00:05:51.160> adjusting<00:05:52.160> you<00:05:52.400> face

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
have to spend time adjusting you face

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.300 
have to spend time adjusting you face
because<00:05:53.260> that<00:05:54.260> takes<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.710> little<00:05:54.860> bit<00:05:55.010> of<00:05:55.100> time

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
because that takes a little bit of time

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.340 
because that takes a little bit of time
so<00:05:56.000> that's<00:05:56.180> pretty<00:05:56.330> much<00:05:56.510> all<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:56.990> tips<00:05:57.229> that

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
so that's pretty much all the tips that

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.060 
so that's pretty much all the tips that
I<00:05:57.500> use<00:05:58.479> but<00:05:59.479> I<00:05:59.660> don't<00:05:59.870> really<00:06:00.140> use<00:06:00.470> or<00:06:00.710> Talia

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
I use but I don't really use or Talia

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.700 
I use but I don't really use or Talia
anymore<00:06:01.430> since<00:06:01.640> I<00:06:01.789> just<00:06:02.030> learned<00:06:02.180> CLL<00:06:02.810> which

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
anymore since I just learned CLL which

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.190 
anymore since I just learned CLL which
is<00:06:03.860> pretty<00:06:04.010> nice<00:06:04.220> but<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:05.690> don't<00:06:05.900> feel<00:06:06.050> like

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
is pretty nice but and don't feel like

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.779
