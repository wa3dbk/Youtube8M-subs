00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
virtual fighter like clone mode you know

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.490 
virtual fighter like clone mode you know
you<00:06:50.909> want<00:06:51.150> to<00:06:51.210> go<00:06:51.389> through<00:06:51.630> that<00:06:51.659> it's<00:06:52.050> pretty

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
you want to go through that it's pretty

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.520 
you want to go through that it's pretty
basic<00:06:52.680> animation<00:06:53.400> it's<00:06:53.699> not<00:06:53.819> too<00:06:54.000> good<00:06:54.180> but<00:06:55.169> it

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
basic animation it's not too good but it

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.189 
basic animation it's not too good but it
does<00:06:55.710> its<00:06:55.889> job<00:06:56.250> but<00:06:56.970> then<00:06:57.180> you<00:06:57.300> go<00:06:57.479> on<00:06:57.509> to<00:06:57.780> the

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
does its job but then you go on to the

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.529 
does its job but then you go on to the
super<00:06:58.409> deform<00:06:58.979> know<00:06:59.580> where<00:06:59.909> characters<00:07:00.240> are

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 
super deform know where characters are

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.320 
super deform know where characters are
big<00:07:00.780> heads<00:07:01.020> mode<00:07:02.060> surprisingly<00:07:03.060> that's

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
big heads mode surprisingly that's

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.020 
big heads mode surprisingly that's
actually<00:07:03.840> pretty<00:07:04.020> good<00:07:04.580> predictive<00:07:05.580> once<00:07:05.880> you

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
actually pretty good predictive once you

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.120 
actually pretty good predictive once you
find<00:07:06.240> different<00:07:06.659> ions<00:07:07.020> by<00:07:07.620> the<00:07:07.680> different

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
find different ions by the different

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.839 
find different ions by the different
characters<00:07:08.280> get<00:07:08.849> some<00:07:09.120> experience<00:07:09.479> points<00:07:10.849> as

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:11.849 
characters get some experience points as

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.450 
characters get some experience points as
actually<00:07:12.569> /<00:07:12.810> in<00:07:12.990> fron<00:07:13.289> I<00:07:13.650> would<00:07:13.889> recommend
