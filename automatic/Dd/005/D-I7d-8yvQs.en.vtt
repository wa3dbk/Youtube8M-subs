screen alright there we go as you can
see<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.390> held<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.899> two<00:01:49.229> screws<00:01:51.049> so

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
see it's held in with two screws so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.469 
see it's held in with two screws so
basically<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.700> need<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.119> take<00:01:54.329> out

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
basically all you need to do is take out

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.800 
basically all you need to do is take out
these<00:01:54.659> two<00:01:54.960> screws<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.670> there's<00:01:57.479> two

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
these two screws and then there's two

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.109 
these two screws and then there's two
slots<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.500> bottom<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.820> slides

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
slots on the bottom that just slides

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.749 
slots on the bottom that just slides
into<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.710> once<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> two<00:02:02.189> screws<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.729> removed

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
into so once the two screws are removed

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.090 
into so once the two screws are removed
you<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.540> slide<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> servo<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.619> there's<00:02:04.950> no

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you just slide the servo out there's no

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.370 
you just slide the servo out there's no
need<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> split<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> front<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.719> split<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
need to split the front to split the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
need to split the front to split the
frame<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> stock

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
frame like you have to do with the stock

my helicopter nice and smooth and if you
need<00:03:57.030> change<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.569> B<00:03:57.780> year<00:03:58.340> might<00:03:59.340> be<00:03:59.370> thinking

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
need change the B year might be thinking

this<00:04:00.329> is<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> light<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.350> all

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
this is in the light and it's all

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.880 
this is in the light and it's all
covered<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:02.450> all<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.840> need<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.109> do<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.260> if<00:04:04.769> you

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
covered but all you need to do is if you

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.880 
covered but all you need to do is if you
remove<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.459> servo<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.959> could<00:04:07.200> put<00:04:07.709> the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
remove this servo you could put the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.520 
remove this servo you could put the
begin<00:04:08.459> an<00:04:08.910> end<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.510> like<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> point<00:04:10.350> nine

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
begin an end of like a point nine

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.270 
begin an end of like a point nine
millimeter<00:04:11.100> allen<00:04:11.459> key<00:04:12.329> and<00:04:12.859> slide<00:04:13.859> it<00:04:13.889> in

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
millimeter allen key and slide it in

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.879 
millimeter allen key and slide it in
through<00:04:14.760> here<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.320> you'll<00:04:16.320> be<00:04:16.530> able<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.799> get

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
through here and you'll be able to get

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.420 
through here and you'll be able to get
the<00:04:17.010> big<00:04:17.220> ear<00:04:17.519> into<00:04:17.729> place<00:04:18.289> so<00:04:19.289> you<00:04:19.709> can<00:04:20.250> just

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
the big ear into place so you can just

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.399 
the big ear into place so you can just
remove<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.880> servo<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.660> it'd<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:21.780> easier<00:04:22.229> than

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
remove the servo and it'd be easier than

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.940 
remove the servo and it'd be easier than
taking<00:04:22.650> off<00:04:22.950> half<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.700> side<00:04:23.940> frame<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.919> a

taking off half the side frame the a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.770 
taking off half the side frame the a
gear<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.909> one<00:04:27.150> might<00:04:27.360> feel

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
gear that one might feel

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.810 
gear that one might feel
little<00:04:27.900> bit<00:04:27.990> harder<00:04:28.290> to<00:04:28.320> get<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.889> but<00:04:29.490> if<00:04:29.670> you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
little bit harder to get to but if you

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.940 
little bit harder to get to but if you

upgrade to the metal a year you'll never

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.560 
upgrade to the metal a year you'll never

a few shims behind my seat year to get
it<00:04:52.350> perfect<00:04:52.650> but<00:04:54.380> overall<00:04:55.380> it's<00:04:55.800> not<00:04:56.190> bad<00:04:56.520> just

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
it perfect but overall it's not bad just

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.500 
it perfect but overall it's not bad just
to<00:04:57.030> put<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.240> few<00:04:57.540> shims<00:04:57.750> back<00:04:58.110> there<00:04:59.150> to<00:05:00.150> get<00:05:00.300> rid

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
to put a few shims back there to get rid

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.720 
to put a few shims back there to get rid
of<00:05:00.540> any<00:05:01.080> wobble<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.130> might<00:05:02.400> be<00:05:02.580> on<00:05:02.700> the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
of any wobble that might be on the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.909 
of any wobble that might be on the
torque<00:05:03.240> tube<00:05:03.480> shaft<00:05:03.810> because<00:05:04.290> every<00:05:04.590> torque

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
torque tube shaft because every torque

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.620 
torque tube shaft because every torque
tube<00:05:05.160> is<00:05:05.340> manufactured<00:05:06.120> slightly

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
tube is manufactured slightly

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.290 
tube is manufactured slightly
differently<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:08.040> not<00:05:08.340> every<00:05:08.760> gear<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.150> going

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
differently so not every gear is going

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.800 
differently so not every gear is going
to<00:05:09.390> fit<00:05:09.540> exactly<00:05:09.660> perfect<00:05:10.530> on<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.750> my<00:05:12.750> D

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
to fit exactly perfect on it of my D

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.580 
to fit exactly perfect on it of my D
gear<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.890> fit<00:05:14.280> on<00:05:14.490> perfectly<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:16.080> was<00:05:16.290> very

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
gear that fit on perfectly it was very

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.110 
gear that fit on perfectly it was very
nice<00:05:17.370> fit<00:05:17.669> onto<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.180> tail<00:05:18.390> shaft<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:19.700> then<00:05:20.700> i

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
nice fit onto the tail shaft and then i

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.210 
nice fit onto the tail shaft and then i

feeling and lastly i have the new

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.719 
feeling and lastly i have the new
extreme<00:05:42.180> production<00:05:42.690> swashplate<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.620> as<00:05:44.610> you

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
extreme production swashplate and as you

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.020 
extreme production swashplate and as you
can<00:05:44.850> see<00:05:44.880> they've<00:05:45.660> now<00:05:46.050> raised<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:47.580> back

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
can see they've now raised the back

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.680 
can see they've now raised the back
anti-rotation<00:05:48.780> pin<00:05:49.430> so<00:05:50.430> now<00:05:50.729> when<00:05:51.419> you<00:05:51.510> give

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
anti-rotation pin so now when you give

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.080 
anti-rotation pin so now when you give
elevator<00:05:52.229> movement<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.890> your<00:05:53.010> blade<00:05:53.520> 130x

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
elevator movement to your blade 130x

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.580 
elevator movement to your blade 130x
it's<00:05:54.510> going<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.780> go<00:05:54.840> straight<00:05:55.169> back<00:05:55.530> or

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
it's going to go straight back or

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.260 
it's going to go straight back or
straightforward<00:05:56.100> it's<00:05:56.760> not<00:05:56.940> going<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.150> have

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
straightforward it's not going to have

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.370 
straightforward it's not going to have
any<00:05:57.919> interactions<00:05:58.919> or<00:05:59.250> tilt<00:05:59.729> to<00:05:59.880> the<00:05:59.940> side

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
any interactions or tilt to the side

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.480 
any interactions or tilt to the side
it's<00:06:01.380> going<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.620> work<00:06:01.800> perfectly<00:06:04.039> so<00:06:05.039> overall

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
it's going to work perfectly so overall

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.060 
it's going to work perfectly so overall
the<00:06:06.210> six-string<00:06:06.810> production<00:06:07.410> carbon<00:06:07.830> fiber

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
the six-string production carbon fiber

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.560 
the six-string production carbon fiber
frame<00:06:08.510> it's<00:06:09.510> me<00:06:09.690> my<00:06:09.840> helicopter<00:06:10.530> much<00:06:10.770> better

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
frame it's me my helicopter much better

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.960 
frame it's me my helicopter much better
makes<00:06:12.570> a<00:06:12.690> lot<00:06:12.900> smoother<00:06:13.530> and<00:06:13.820> just<00:06:14.820> a<00:06:14.940> great

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
makes a lot smoother and just a great

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.290 
makes a lot smoother and just a great
upgrade<00:06:15.479> overall<00:06:16.200> and<00:06:16.729> there's<00:06:17.729> only<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:18.030> very

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
upgrade overall and there's only a very

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.659 
upgrade overall and there's only a very
minimal<00:06:18.990> weight<00:06:19.200> gain<00:06:19.470> over<00:06:19.860> stock<00:06:20.190> so<00:06:20.640> i

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
minimal weight gain over stock so i

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.560 
minimal weight gain over stock so i
wouldn't<00:06:21.120> hesitate<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.630> use<00:06:21.840> it<00:06:22.140> whatsoever
