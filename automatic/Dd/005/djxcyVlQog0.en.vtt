00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
through all the basics here it's very

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.940 
through all the basics here it's very
very<00:00:08.460> simple<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:08.880> straightforward<00:00:09.950> first

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
very simple and straightforward first

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.770 
very simple and straightforward first
portion<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.269> head<00:00:12.480> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
portion of this is that the head is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.870 
portion of this is that the head is
completely<00:00:13.290> adjustable<00:00:13.650> through<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.730> back

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
completely adjustable through the back

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.380 
completely adjustable through the back
headband<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:16.080> previously<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:17.090> hard<00:00:18.090> head<00:00:18.240> at

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
headband is previously a hard head at

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.170 
headband is previously a hard head at
band<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.900> it's<00:00:19.020> very<00:00:19.529> very<00:00:19.710> strong<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.880> pop

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180

mask<00:00:23.539> simply<00:00:24.539> adjust<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.920> firm<00:00:26.580> but

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
mask simply adjust this so it's firm but

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.900 
mask simply adjust this so it's firm but
not<00:00:27.300> overly<00:00:27.689> tight<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.400> should<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.670> just

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
not overly tight and you should be just

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.290 
not overly tight and you should be just
fine<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:31.050> second<00:00:31.380> portion<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.910> movable

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
fine the second portion is this movable

fine the second portion is this movable
chin<00:00:34.290> Bob<00:00:34.500> which<00:00:34.920> basically<00:00:35.360> allows<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
chin Bob which basically allows the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
chin Bob which basically allows the
system<00:00:37.079> known<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> live<00:00:37.800> drop<00:00:38.070> 3<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
system known as the live drop 3 to be a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.660 
system known as the live drop 3 to be a
push-pull<00:00:39.510> jaw<00:00:40.260> system<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.309> allows<00:00:41.640> for

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
push-pull jaw system which allows for

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
push-pull jaw system which allows for
not<00:00:42.300> only<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.660> articulation<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> job

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
not only the articulation of the job

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529 
not only the articulation of the job
being<00:00:43.710> open<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> closed<00:00:45.120> which

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
being open but also the closed which

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
being open but also the closed which
means<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.200> bite<00:00:46.410> objects<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
means that you can bite objects and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.340 
means that you can bite objects and
interact<00:00:47.969> objects<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> jaws<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
interact objects with the jaws and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.610 
interact objects with the jaws and
sounds<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.809> between<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.500> an

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
sounds so between that and you have an

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
sounds so between that and you have an
elastic<00:00:52.829> strap<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.670> goes<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.300> head

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that holds that in place and it's really

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.660 
that holds that in place and it's really

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
see though the JA system working talks

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.120 
see though the JA system working talks
normally<00:01:45.010> you<00:01:45.520> can<00:01:45.670> fight<00:01:45.850> things<00:01:47.130> that's

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
always that sort of thing very

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.480 
always that sort of thing very
articulated<00:01:51.730> moves<00:01:52.180> really<00:01:52.540> really<00:01:52.810> well<00:01:53.490> we

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
articulated moves really really well we

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.890 
articulated moves really really well we
might<00:01:54.670> do<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:55.090> little<00:01:55.300> bit<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.480> practice<00:01:55.600> in

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
might do a little bit of practice in

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.710 
might do a little bit of practice in
front<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.200> mirror<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.860> can<00:01:57.010> get<00:01:57.400> the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
front of the mirror so you can get the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.810 
front of the mirror so you can get the
overall<00:01:58.720> feel<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.440> mask<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.310> how<00:02:00.700> it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
overall feel of a mask and how it

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.100 
overall feel of a mask and how it
articulates<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.450> how<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.630> probably<00:02:01.930> want<00:02:02.080> to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
articulates and how you probably want to

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.710 
articulates and how you probably want to
move<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.350> head<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.250> eyes<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.510> eyes

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
move the head and the eyes now the eyes

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.880 
move the head and the eyes now the eyes
of<00:02:05.170> course<00:02:05.410> are<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:07.410> pelvic<00:02:08.410> tree<00:02:08.530> cable

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
of course are on a pelvic tree cable

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.440 
of course are on a pelvic tree cable
which<00:02:09.190> allows<00:02:09.520> for<00:02:09.550> even<00:02:10.270> small<00:02:10.720> movements<00:02:12.450> or

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
which allows for even small movements or

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.110 
which allows for even small movements or
large<00:02:14.110> movements<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.220> adjust<00:02:18.940> these

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
large movements you can adjust these

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.630 
large movements you can adjust these

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
Center it up just a little bit um the
