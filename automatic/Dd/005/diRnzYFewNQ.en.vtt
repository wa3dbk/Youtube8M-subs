at<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.930> well<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> they've<00:00:52.739> been

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
at all well i think that they've been

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.529 
at all well i think that they've been
doing<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.670> try<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.000> battle<00:00:54.270> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
doing all they can to try and battle it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.930 
doing all they can to try and battle it
especially<00:00:54.870> china<00:00:55.320> by<00:00:55.530> raising<00:00:55.770> rates<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.910> i

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
especially china by raising rates but i

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
especially china by raising rates but i
don't<00:00:57.239> think<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.780> enough<00:00:58.079> at<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
don't think that it's enough at all to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.880 
don't think that it's enough at all to
you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> stop<00:01:00.539> prices<00:01:01.109> from<00:01:01.320> continuing

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you know to stop prices from continuing

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.429 
you know to stop prices from continuing
to<00:01:02.010> rise<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> data<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.049> week<00:01:04.229> then

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to rise so on the data this week then

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.560 
to rise so on the data this week then
how<00:01:04.680> high<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:04.979> gold<00:01:05.369> prices<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:06.229> well<00:01:07.520> 1377

how high do gold prices go well 1377

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.450 
how high do gold prices go well 1377
1378<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.869> still<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.650> know<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> upper<00:01:11.189> end<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
1378 is still you know the upper end of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.250 
1378 is still you know the upper end of
the<00:01:11.549> range<00:01:11.850> i<00:01:12.210> think<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:12.960> been<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the range i think that that's been a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
the range i think that that's been a
challenge<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.770> gold<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> few<00:01:14.640> weeks<00:01:14.729> now

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
challenge for gold for a few weeks now

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
challenge for gold for a few weeks now
and<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> take<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> close

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and really it's going to take a close

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.480 
and really it's going to take a close
over<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.450> close<00:01:18.780> over<00:01:19.229> 1377<00:01:20.220> get

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
over there if we close over 1377 get

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
over there if we close over 1377 get
into<00:01:20.700> thirteen<00:01:21.240> eighty<00:01:21.420> s<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> prospect

forty<00:02:24.300> dollars<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.500> matter<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.769> wine<00:02:26.040> i

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
forty dollars just a matter of wine i

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.610 
forty dollars just a matter of wine i
think<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.060> possibility<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> forty<00:02:28.319> dollars

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
think the possibility of forty dollars

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.979 
think the possibility of forty dollars
by<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.860> end<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.310> year<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:30.330> completely

by the end of the year is is completely
you<00:02:31.349> know<00:02:31.400> possible<00:02:32.400> i<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:33.030> there's<00:02:33.209> no

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
you know possible i think there's no

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.970 
you know possible i think there's no

question that silver will achieve those

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.380 
question that silver will achieve those
levels<00:02:35.519> it's<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.000> matter<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.299> when

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
levels it's just a matter of when

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.390 
levels it's just a matter of when
because<00:02:36.959> silver<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.500> product<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.040> can't

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
because silver is a product that can't

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.150 
because silver is a product that can't
be<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.819> know<00:02:39.360> reproduced<00:02:40.019> or<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.440> ronan<00:02:40.950> in

the ground like a crop I think it's very

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.069 
the ground like a crop I think it's very
limited<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:45.269> know<00:02:45.390> that's<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.750> reason

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
limited so you know that's the reason

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.750 
limited so you know that's the reason
why<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.290> should<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:46.739> up<00:02:46.769> there<00:02:47.130> alright<00:02:47.579> so<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
why it should go up there alright so a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.400 
why it should go up there alright so a
supply<00:02:48.120> crunch<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.599> still<00:02:48.780> leading<00:02:48.959> silver

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
