00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.550 

you<00:01:23.940> have<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.300> all<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.810> routine<00:01:25.290> all

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
you have to do all this routine all

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.930 
you have to do all this routine all
together<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.970> minute<00:01:28.070> for<00:01:29.070> each<00:01:29.220> ppm<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
together for one minute for each ppm I

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.350 
together for one minute for each ppm I
usually<00:01:30.390> start<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.960> 100<00:01:31.590> ppm<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:33.150> up

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
usually start with a 100 ppm and go up

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.210 
usually start with a 100 ppm and go up
til<00:01:34.580> 130<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:38.300> since<00:01:39.470> while<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.650> practice<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
til 130 but since while you practice you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.140 
til 130 but since while you practice you
get<00:01:41.430> tired<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.940> will<00:01:42.690> get<00:01:42.810> tired<00:01:43.940> at<00:01:44.940> the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
get tired you will get tired at the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.040 
get tired you will get tired at the
beginning<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.530> can't<00:01:46.770> reach<00:01:47.400> like<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
beginning if you can't reach like if you

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.290 
beginning if you can't reach like if you
start<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> 100<00:01:50.550> ppm<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.270> 30<00:01:52.170> seconds<00:01:53.300> for

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
start with a 100 ppm for 30 seconds for

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.740 
start with a 100 ppm for 30 seconds for
each<00:01:54.420> exercise<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.450> 120<00:01:57.450> BPM

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
each exercise and you get to 120 BPM

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
each exercise and you get to 120 BPM
than<00:01:58.050> your<00:01:58.200> tire<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.220> for<00:01:59.430> 20<00:01:59.820> seconds

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
than your tire you can do for 20 seconds

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.190 
than your tire you can do for 20 seconds
instead<00:02:00.660> of<00:02:00.810> 30<00:02:01.020> seconds<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.850> go<00:02:02.850> up<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.780> do

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
instead of 30 seconds and go up like do

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.109 
instead of 30 seconds and go up like do
20<00:02:04.500> seconds<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.070> 120<00:02:06.000> BPM<00:02:06.479> 15<00:02:07.320> seconds<00:02:07.830> at<00:02:08.119> 125

and<00:02:09.450> 10<00:02:10.019> seconds<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.649> 130<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:12.660> important

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and 10 seconds for 130 the important

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.360 
and 10 seconds for 130 the important
thing<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:17.100> keep

at<00:02:25.579> 110<00:02:26.579> BBM<00:02:27.209> now<00:02:27.480> all<00:02:28.290> together<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.090> short

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
at 110 BBM now all together for a short

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.770 
at 110 BBM now all together for a short
time<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.260> not<00:02:31.560> 30<00:02:31.860> seconds<00:02:32.370> each<00:02:32.640> other<00:02:33.120> for

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
time so not 30 seconds each other for

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:57.160 
time so not 30 seconds each other for
like<00:02:33.959> two<00:02:34.350> bars<00:02:34.620> each

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.990 

with<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.380> develop<00:02:58.980> both<00:02:59.190> endurance<00:02:59.790> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
with this you develop both endurance and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.620 
with this you develop both endurance and
speed<00:03:00.920> at<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:01.950> same<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.490> with<00:03:03.480> these

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
speed at the same time with these

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.120 
speed at the same time with these
routines<00:03:04.110> I've<00:03:04.380> showed<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:06.840> should<00:03:07.230> if

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
routines I've showed you you should if

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
routines I've showed you you should if
you<00:03:08.190> do<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.550> every<00:03:08.850> day<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.890> time<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.400> told

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
you do it every day for the time I told

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.520 
you do it every day for the time I told
you<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:15.090> easily<00:03:15.870> get<00:03:16.140> in<00:03:16.440> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
you to do it and you easily get in a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.290 
you to do it and you easily get in a
couple<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.920> months<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.970> should<00:03:18.000> easily

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
couple of months you should easily

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.290 
couple of months you should easily
improve<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:19.080> blast<00:03:19.350> beats<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.300> can't

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
improve your blast beats and I can't
