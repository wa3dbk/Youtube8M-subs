installed the Metasploit install what do

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.930 
installed the Metasploit install what do
you<00:05:35.470> simple<00:05:35.770> have<00:05:35.950> to<00:05:36.099> do<00:05:36.250> is<00:05:36.460> you<00:05:36.820> have<00:05:36.910> to

that I'm in a directory MS f3 that's a

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.279 
that I'm in a directory MS f3 that's a
Metasploit<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.919> I'm<00:05:51.639> gonna<00:05:51.789> do<00:05:52.150> LS<00:05:52.599> you<00:05:53.050> see

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
Metasploit and I'm gonna do LS you see

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.850 
Metasploit and I'm gonna do LS you see
that<00:05:53.500> MS<00:05:53.970> console<00:05:54.970> is<00:05:55.240> there<00:05:55.479> but<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.410> run<00:05:56.650> that

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
that MS console is there but to run that

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.159 
that MS console is there but to run that
what<00:05:57.190> I<00:05:57.220> notice<00:05:57.700> earlier<00:05:58.270> we<00:05:58.479> used<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.840> do<00:05:58.990> it

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
what I notice earlier we used to do it

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.040 
what I notice earlier we used to do it
simply<00:05:59.410> dot<00:06:00.370> forward<00:06:00.970> slash<00:06:01.330> then<00:06:01.690> you<00:06:01.900> can

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
simply dot forward slash then you can

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.830 
simply dot forward slash then you can
type<00:06:02.260> MS<00:06:02.669> console<00:06:03.669> but<00:06:04.030> now<00:06:04.300> what<00:06:04.690> do<00:06:04.750> you<00:06:04.780> have

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
type MS console but now what do you have

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.279 
type MS console but now what do you have
to<00:06:04.960> do<00:06:05.110> is<00:06:05.260> Ruby<00:06:06.900> MSF<00:06:08.520> console<00:06:09.960> it's<00:06:10.960> takes<00:06:11.169> a

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
to do is Ruby MSF console it's takes a

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:17.820 
to do is Ruby MSF console it's takes a
little<00:06:11.409> while<00:06:11.650> to<00:06:11.919> get<00:06:12.219> it<00:06:12.370> on

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830

you go

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:39.940 
you go
show<00:06:35.410> exploits<00:06:37.630> so<00:06:38.630> now<00:06:38.810> you<00:06:38.870> can<00:06:39.170> see<00:06:39.470> it<00:06:39.740> it's

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
show exploits so now you can see it it's

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.090 
show exploits so now you can see it it's
a<00:06:40.070> little<00:06:40.340> slow<00:06:40.640> but<00:06:41.630> hey<00:06:41.840> well<00:06:42.200> this<00:06:42.800> is<00:06:42.980> the
