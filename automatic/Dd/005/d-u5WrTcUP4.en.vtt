just<00:01:23.220> gonna<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.700> cool<00:01:23.850> till<00:01:24.060> every<00:01:24.330> darkest

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
just gonna be cool till every darkest

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
just gonna be cool till every darkest
second<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.700> excited<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> all

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
second so I'm really excited to that all

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
second so I'm really excited to that all
it's<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:27.930> gonna<00:01:28.170> say<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
it's just gonna say like you know that

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's just gonna say like you know that
they're<00:01:29.369> gonna<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.729> rerun<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> big

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
they're gonna have a rerun like a big

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.960 
they're gonna have a rerun like a big
nights<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.439> something<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.770> January<00:01:32.340> 2015<00:01:32.729> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
nights or something at January 2015 so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.399 
nights or something at January 2015 so
I'm<00:01:33.210> guessing<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.990> gonna<00:01:34.140> start

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
I'm guessing that this is gonna start

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.800 
I'm guessing that this is gonna start
airing<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.040> random<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.909> springtime<00:01:36.210> right<00:01:36.659> now

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
airing a random of springtime right now

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.030 
airing a random of springtime right now
it's<00:01:36.960> gonna<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.200> next<00:01:37.409> season<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:37.740> time

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
it's gonna be next season more time

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's gonna be next season more time
there<00:01:38.549> isn't<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:38.909> enough<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
there isn't really enough for like a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
there isn't really enough for like a
rabbit<00:01:40.229> wintertime<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.070> nor<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> robot

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
rabbit wintertime but nor the robot

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.420 
rabbit wintertime but nor the robot
spring<00:01:42.030> summer<00:01:42.659> time<00:01:42.930> which<00:01:43.380> I'm<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
spring summer time which I'm if I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.010 
spring summer time which I'm if I
believe<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.850> last<00:01:45.060> time<00:01:45.240> third<00:01:45.479> season<00:01:45.810> aired

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
believe one last time third season aired

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
believe one last time third season aired
around<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:46.470> summertime<00:01:47.070> or<00:01:47.250> something

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
around about summertime or something

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
around about summertime or something
science<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.060> maybe<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.570> might<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.750> spring<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
science so maybe it might be spring to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
science so maybe it might be spring to
summer<00:01:49.740> I'm<00:01:49.979> guessing<00:01:50.340> I'd<00:01:50.640> say<00:01:50.880> spring<00:01:51.270> we've

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
summer I'm guessing I'd say spring we've

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060 
summer I'm guessing I'd say spring we've
got<00:01:51.630> quite<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.680> spring<00:01:52.920> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
got quite a lot going on for spring so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
got quite a lot going on for spring so
I'm<00:01:53.220> looking<00:01:53.490> forward<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> spring<00:01:54.180> seems

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
I'm looking forward to it spring seems

I'm looking forward to it spring seems
oh<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.600> gonna<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.960> pretty<00:01:55.560> big<00:01:55.920> time<00:01:56.159> for

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
oh it's gonna be a pretty big time for
