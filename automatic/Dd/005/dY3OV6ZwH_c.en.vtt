00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.640
 hello that such friends my name is frank 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.009
 rulers 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.730
 and well, nothing is good that I was 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.980
 working and I got to the part where by 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.020
 usually people tend to get complicated 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.820
 what is hair trimming and 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.369
 I took the opportunity to make this little video 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 tutorial the first thing we have to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.669
 do 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.550
 after having been stable and more in 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.690
 main is to create a selection 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.240
 pressing the control key 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.140
 here in the mask and this little one is created 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.520
 selection once we've done that 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.520
 we select the lasso tool 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.320
 pressing the alt key what we do is 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 subtract 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.560
 what we are not going to use 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.870
 nothing 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.409
 this process is still in the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.600
 challenge that has nothing retouching just 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:10.000
 It is a sketch 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.920
 but well nothing once we create the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.110
 selection of what really we 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 Interested in what is going to trim the hair what 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.670
 what we do is duplicate the layer 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.880
 and we put it under the main one goes 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.860
 to look something like 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.180
 once we have the image 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.440
 here we put it in fusion mode 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.440
 multiply mode 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.570
 after this we go to fit image 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.800
 curves or what can we do with the command 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.800
 fast that is control m 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.280
 and what we do is clarify these 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.280
 shadows that are here 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.450
 like these white waste 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:04.010
 when multiplying what you do is eliminate 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:09.800
 the white and the opposite of him is the in the 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:12.770
 plot that eliminates is the black only worth 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.620
 So what we do is increase the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.860
 targets so that the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.120
 shadow 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.120
 small of a box 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.670
 let's place how were these 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.030
 waste that is here we increase the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.319
 White 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.319
 and disappears 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.590
 there is no exact value of what is 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.959
 the increase of white as such because that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.769
 is relative will depend on the image 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.769
 have 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.140
 it's worth once we do this is what 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.190
 is 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.510
 in the layer above 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.510
 and with a brush 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.290
 in this case it's black is also 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.670
 relative 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.560
 what we do is 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.560
 paint vale 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.340
 and it is calm 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:26.250
 how multiply eliminates blank by 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:31.100
 So the black will always be 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.100
 it's pretty easy, nothing complicated 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.910
 it was a little faster I am 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.610
 doing way above to apply 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.910
 because summer lasted so long and it's easy 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.910
 to understand 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.780
 with this I do not mean that it is one of 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.370
 the most correct ways to cut the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.620
 hair not the way 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.709
 which I do until I share it with 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.709
 your 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.700
 but nothing 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.810
 and that's how 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.100
 the hair cut we make with 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.790
 watch out 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.790
 Take it 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.569
 good friends I hope it has served 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.759
 something 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.619
 share the video you can look for me 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.420
 through on my facebook page frank what 

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:50.400
 fernandez 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.740
 Y 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.020
