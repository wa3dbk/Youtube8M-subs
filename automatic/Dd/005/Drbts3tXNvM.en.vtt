00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
existing year out experience that they

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220 
existing year out experience that they
have<00:00:32.460> already<00:00:32.640> had<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.450> their<00:00:33.600> key<00:00:33.780> practice

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
have already had with their key practice

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
have already had with their key practice
and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.579> continue<00:00:36.090> into<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and then that will continue into the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.410 
and then that will continue into the
first<00:00:36.660> year<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.590> program<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.910> also<00:00:39.059> think

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
first year of the program we also think

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
first year of the program we also think
that<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.960> time<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.800> full<00:00:41.010> qualification<00:00:41.700> will

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that the time to full qualification will

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.290 
that the time to full qualification will
be<00:00:41.969> shorter<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.629> we're<00:00:42.899> exploiting<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
be shorter because we're exploiting the

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.900 
be shorter because we're exploiting the
relationship<00:00:45.300> between<00:00:45.539> practice<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
relationship between practice and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.190 
relationship between practice and
academia<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.510> first<00:00:48.750> year<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> the

academia in the first year of the
program<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.940> also<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.210> acknowledging<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
program and also we're acknowledging the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750
