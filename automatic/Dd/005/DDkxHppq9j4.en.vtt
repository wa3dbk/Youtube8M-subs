00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
place but this doesn't really go

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
place but this doesn't really go
anywhere<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.259> sort<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.500> pops<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.189> who's<00:01:44.369> back

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579

I<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:22.010> his<00:02:22.190> transformation<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:23.060> lot<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.720> really

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I like his transformation a lot I really

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.920 
I like his transformation a lot I really
like<00:02:24.770> how<00:02:25.010> he<00:02:25.070> looks<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.240> both<00:02:26.450> modes<00:02:26.720> by

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
like how he looks and both modes by

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.720 
like how he looks and both modes by
especially<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.560> mode<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.160> think<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.580> looks

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
especially this mode I think it looks

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.030 
especially this mode I think it looks
very<00:02:28.790> striking<00:02:29.540> he<00:02:29.930> has<00:02:30.710> plenty<00:02:30.920> of

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
very striking he has plenty of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.730 
very striking he has plenty of
possibility<00:02:31.780> most<00:02:32.780> things<00:02:33.080> stay<00:02:33.440> out<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
possibility most things stay out of the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.980 
possibility most things stay out of the
way<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:36.290> he's<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> pretty<00:02:36.770> neat<00:02:36.980> figure<00:02:37.990> it's

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
way and he's a pretty neat figure it's

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.340 
way and he's a pretty neat figure it's
just<00:02:39.410> this<00:02:40.130> thing<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.820> don't<00:02:41.180> like<00:02:41.390> ah<00:02:41.600> there

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
just this thing I don't like ah there

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.760 
just this thing I don't like ah there
should<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:42.680> been<00:02:42.880> some<00:02:43.880> way<00:02:44.060> for<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.480> to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
should have been some way for this to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.650 
should have been some way for this to
pig<00:02:45.770> in<00:02:45.950> somewhere<00:02:46.370> fold<00:02:46.850> up<00:02:47.030> something

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
pig in somewhere fold up something

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.710 
pig in somewhere fold up something
should<00:02:47.870> have<00:02:47.960> been<00:02:47.990> done<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:48.670> this

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720
