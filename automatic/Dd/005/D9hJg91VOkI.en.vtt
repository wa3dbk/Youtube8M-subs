 travelers returning from the east 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.400
 They say that they are there and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.939
 returning west travelers 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.659
 telling what they are there and since 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:28.100

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.660
 let's say that elephants were given 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.090
 and now attention is correct 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.080

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.770
 mistakenly believing that elephants are found 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.400
 only in india and the source is absolutely 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.400
