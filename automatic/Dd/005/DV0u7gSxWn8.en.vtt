him

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.070 
him
I'm<00:00:26.099> not<00:00:26.430> spurning<00:00:26.880> nothing<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.779> that

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
I'm not spurning nothing like that

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.349 
I'm not spurning nothing like that
because<00:00:28.769> I've<00:00:28.949> taught<00:00:29.220> him<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> willingly<00:00:30.000> do

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
because I've taught him to willingly do

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.530 
because I've taught him to willingly do
it<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.019> how<00:00:31.710> he<00:00:31.769> willingly<00:00:32.579> does<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.239> stuff

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
it and how he willingly does this stuff

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840 
it and how he willingly does this stuff
is<00:00:33.870> because<00:00:34.440> he<00:00:34.559> feels<00:00:34.860> complete<00:00:35.489> comfort

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
is because he feels complete comfort

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.010 
is because he feels complete comfort
when<00:00:36.510> he<00:00:36.600> tries<00:00:38.420> go<00:00:39.420> ahead<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.629> jump<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
when he tries go ahead and jump on it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
when he tries go ahead and jump on it
and<00:00:42.379> then<00:00:43.379> once<00:00:43.590> they're<00:00:43.890> good<00:00:44.100> pushing<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and then once they're good pushing it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.709 
and then once they're good pushing it
then<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.059> add<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.629> weight<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:47.719> it's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
then we add some weight to it and it's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
then we add some weight to it and it's
the<00:00:48.899> exact<00:00:49.200> same<00:00:49.230> thing<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.980> he<00:00:50.100> gets<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.610> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the exact same thing if he gets kind of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
the exact same thing if he gets kind of
crooked<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.600> he<00:00:51.780> feels<00:00:52.050> pressure<00:00:52.640> then

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
crooked because he feels pressure then

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
crooked because he feels pressure then
I'll<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.000> straighten<00:00:54.449> him<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I'll just straighten him up and I'm just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
I'll just straighten him up and I'm just
barely<00:00:55.920> doing<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:57.510> he's<00:00:57.690> straight

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
barely doing it but when he's straight

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.549

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
and he's going forward then I leave him
alone<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.489> doing<00:01:02.789> nothing<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.300> all<00:01:03.480> I'm

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719

doing<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.199> keeping<00:01:04.409> him<00:01:04.680> straight<00:01:05.070> right<00:01:05.760> now

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
doing is keeping him straight right now
well<00:01:07.340> good<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:09.689> he<00:01:09.720> tries<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.530> can

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
