yeah<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.530> got<00:00:01.800> rid<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.040> that<00:00:02.100> Mercedes<00:00:02.820> I'm

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
yeah I got rid of that Mercedes I'm

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.320 
yeah I got rid of that Mercedes I'm
playing<00:00:03.600> with<00:00:03.750> his<00:00:03.870> little<00:00:03.899> Batson<00:00:05.330> the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
playing with his little Batson the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.350 
playing with his little Batson the
gauges<00:00:06.810> working<00:00:07.440> intermittently<00:00:07.740> just<00:00:08.400> those

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
gauges working intermittently just those

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.070 
gauges working intermittently just those
two<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:10.370> mean<00:00:11.370> straight<00:00:11.790> under<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.599> Aaron<00:00:12.960> had

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
two I mean straight under the Aaron had

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.990 
two I mean straight under the Aaron had
a<00:00:13.110> look<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.559> thing<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.400> mentioned<00:00:14.849> last

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
a look for that thing I mentioned last

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.990 
a look for that thing I mentioned last
video<00:00:15.770> it's<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.010> these<00:00:17.100> things<00:00:17.460> bi-metal

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
video it's one of these things bi-metal

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.710 
video it's one of these things bi-metal
strip<00:00:18.180> now<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.289> thousands<00:00:19.680> regulate<00:00:20.720> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
strip now all the thousands regulate the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.650 
strip now all the thousands regulate the
voltage<00:00:21.900> basically<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> gauges<00:00:23.660> each

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
voltage basically to the gauges each

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.370 
voltage basically to the gauges each
gauge<00:00:25.109> works<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.980> same<00:00:26.250> way<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.939> does<00:00:27.380> go

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
gauge works the same way as this does go

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.439 
gauge works the same way as this does go
to<00:00:28.439> coil<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> heats<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> moves<00:00:30.029> that's

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
to coil it heats up and moves that's

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.470 
to coil it heats up and moves that's
when<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> needle<00:00:31.080> moves<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.180> sort<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
when the needle moves and this sort of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.569 
when the needle moves and this sort of
corresponds<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.350> both<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.829> gauges<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.430> they

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
corresponds with both the gauges so they

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.330 
corresponds with both the gauges so they
don't<00:00:35.850> know<00:00:35.969> about<00:00:36.059> overheat<00:00:37.070> so<00:00:38.070> when<00:00:38.219> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
don't know about overheat so when this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.360 
don't know about overheat so when this
gets<00:00:38.610> hot<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.180> open<00:00:39.840> circuits<00:00:40.320> knows<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
gets hot that open circuits knows for a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.760 
gets hot that open circuits knows for a
little<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:41.910> closes<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
little bit and then closes and so the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.380 
little bit and then closes and so the
gauges<00:00:44.129> give<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.579> reading<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.239> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
gauges give the right reading and so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.790 
gauges give the right reading and so
they<00:00:45.510> don't<00:00:45.750> overheat<00:00:46.070> bit<00:00:47.070> weird<00:00:48.649> contact<00:00:49.649> on

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
they don't overheat bit weird contact on

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.540 
they don't overheat bit weird contact on
that<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> problem<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:53.309> feel

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that bit so that's the problem you feel

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.549 
that bit so that's the problem you feel
like<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:53.969> turn<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like it one turn off and that was that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.369 
like it one turn off and that was that
right<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.610> down<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> flick<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:58.230> up

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
right go down you have to flick it go up

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.400 
right go down you have to flick it go up
again<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> speak<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.170> put<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
again so speak of that and put that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.369 
again so speak of that and put that
together<00:01:02.420> yeah<00:01:03.420> I've<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> heater<00:01:04.170> box

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
together yeah I've got the heater box

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.660 
together yeah I've got the heater box
out<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.659> leaking<00:01:06.659> everywhere

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
out that was a leaking everywhere

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.640 
out that was a leaking everywhere

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.950 
yeah that's coming one nicely I don't
work<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:10.979> where<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> radio<00:01:11.490> doesn't<00:01:11.760> work

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
work out where the radio doesn't work

work out where the radio doesn't work
came<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.110> once<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> shut<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> passenger

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
came on once when I shut the passenger

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.560 
came on once when I shut the passenger
door<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.170> about<00:01:16.259> it
