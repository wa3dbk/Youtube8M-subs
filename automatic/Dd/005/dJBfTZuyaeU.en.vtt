00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.600 
her body but of course when thrifting
you<00:01:26.850> can't<00:01:27.090> always<00:01:27.299> find<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:28.500> exact<00:01:28.890> size<00:01:29.189> or

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you can't always find your exact size or

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.740 
you can't always find your exact size or

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.810 
whatever so you just kind of have to
make<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> love<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> color<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.880 
make do but I love the color of this
blouse<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.750> very<00:01:33.810> pretty<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.409> fun

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
blouse I think it's very pretty and fun

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.130 
blouse I think it's very pretty and fun
and<00:01:34.920> since<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.880> dressier<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.049> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and since it is dressier I think that it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
and since it is dressier I think that it
gives<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.500> son<00:01:37.890> survived<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
gives off that son survived so I just

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
gives off that son survived so I just
paired<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.720> some<00:01:39.990> dress<00:01:40.259> pants<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> also
