position so you can do that in 27

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
position so you can do that in 27
aggression<00:01:25.590> factor<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.310> figure<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
aggression factor to see figure you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
aggression factor to see figure you

might get paid off there when you did ok
I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.520> works<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.880> probably<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.750> just

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I think that works I probably much just

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.420 
I think that works I probably much just
because<00:01:31.079> its<00:01:31.380> range<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.770> tight<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.189> I'm<00:01:32.310> in

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
because its range so tight but I'm in

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.390 
because its range so tight but I'm in
position<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.420> full<00:01:33.659> sacked<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> got

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
position and we are full sacked so I got

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
position and we are full sacked so I got
another<00:01:35.579> call<00:01:35.670> calling<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.509> ok<00:01:36.810> yeah

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
another call calling there is ok yeah

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
another call calling there is ok yeah
and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.229> getting<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> third<00:01:37.740> caller<00:01:37.979> is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and then getting the third caller is

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.100 
and then getting the third caller is
nice<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.450> well<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:45.060> check<00:01:45.270> check<00:01:45.540> what

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
nice as well so when check check what

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.499 
nice as well so when check check what
