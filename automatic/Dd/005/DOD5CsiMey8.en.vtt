the<00:02:08.399> long<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.789> lines<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.330> long<00:02:09.479> unless<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
the long the lines are long unless the

so we overseas every truck that comes to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.120 
so we overseas every truck that comes to
the<00:02:15.209> farm<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.660> loads<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.739> know<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> local

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
me when I started the concept of farming

cover<00:02:59.640> crop<00:02:59.910> obviously<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.720> look<00:03:00.930> behind

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
cover crop obviously if you look behind

me<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.560> can<00:03:01.590> see<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:03.150> terrain<00:03:03.450> probably

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
me you can see that the terrain probably

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.009 
me you can see that the terrain probably
drops<00:03:04.110> 60<00:03:04.680> 70<00:03:05.040> feet<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.370> places<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:05.940> but<00:03:06.900> that
