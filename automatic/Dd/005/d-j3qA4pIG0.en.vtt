the first thing that we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.820> go<00:01:00.030> ahead<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.239> remove<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
we're gonna go ahead and remove the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.139 
we're gonna go ahead and remove the
slip-on<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> clutch

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
slip-on so right now we're on the clutch

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
slip-on so right now we're on the clutch
side<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> bike<00:01:03.799> and<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> 12<00:01:05.250> millimeter

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
side of the bike and get a 12 millimeter

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.890 
side of the bike and get a 12 millimeter
bolt<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.450> connecting<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bolt right here that's connecting the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.810 
bolt right here that's connecting the
slip-on<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> guess<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.490> could<00:01:08.520> call

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
slip-on to I guess what you could call

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.160 
slip-on to I guess what you could call
the<00:01:09.000> mid<00:01:09.180> pipe<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.659> technically<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the mid pipe but it's technically the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260 
the mid pipe but it's technically the
header<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.770> you're<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.180> up

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
header and you're just going to go up

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
header and you're just going to go up
here<00:01:16.939> loosen<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.060> clamp<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:26.159> then<00:01:26.340> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
here loosen this clamp up and then you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.100 
here loosen this clamp up and then you
should<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.210> able<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.630> over<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
should just be able to go over to the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.800 
should just be able to go over to the
other<00:01:28.229> side<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.950> take<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.909> bolt<00:01:30.180> off<00:01:30.390> before

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
other side and take the bolt off before

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
other side and take the bolt off before
the<00:01:30.900> slip<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.890> pull<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> off<00:01:32.520> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the slip on and then pull that off so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.740 
the slip on and then pull that off so
we're<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> jump<00:01:33.299> over<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> other

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
we're going to jump over to the other

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
we're going to jump over to the other
side<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.670> remove<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.909> stuff<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.659> right

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
side and remove this stuff on all right

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
side and remove this stuff on all right
so<00:01:37.079> once<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> release<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.950> clamp<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so once you release that clamp that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.719 
so once you release that clamp that
holds<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.240> slip<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.369> header

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
holds on the slip on to the the header

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.280 
holds on the slip on to the the header
you're<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.270> gonna<00:01:42.360> come<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.600> over<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.170> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
millimeter socket because on this side

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.170 
millimeter socket because on this side
you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.770> but<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.550> side<00:02:36.790> closer

the heat shield here you won't be able

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.540 
the heat shield here you won't be able
to<00:02:40.360> fit<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.959> socket<00:02:41.650> inside<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.190> there<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.430> we're

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
to fit a socket inside of there so we're

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.949 
to fit a socket inside of there so we're
gonna<00:02:42.610> go<00:02:42.850> ahead<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.090> loosen<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:43.810> up
