00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and now here on the big screen the teacher of 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.330
 art history implements that will in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.980
 helping to understand how groups act 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.170
 rebel in syria 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 we are always talking about Syria and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.179
 confronts these climate that is in the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.029
 Syria there is now you can understand a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.859
 little more seeing that there are a thousand groups 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 rebels with more than 100,000 combatants 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.170
 that they act in the country is not that and there they are. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.869
 the principals of them exactly william 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.910
 much of the confusion is given by 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 by the proliferation of groups that today 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
 are on the ground and are not 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.820
 coordinated, ie these groups 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.829
 rebels fight each other 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
 basically a thousand rebel groups with 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.700
 100,000 combatants and the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.500
 main are the military council 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.210
 supreme army of the syrian army which is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 a big front right 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.510
 the Syrian army consul was the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 first formed from civilians 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.520
 and military deserters of the army 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.399
 besides it has the Islamic front where it has 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.739
 also various Islamic groups 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.080
 often with the financing of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.000
 fathers of the gulf monarchs council 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.630
 military supremacy with the financing of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 west turkey after groups 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 that most of them are 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.710
 Islamists and there we have the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 groups of rades which are then the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.939
 another pole is that we have a 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.150
 other polemen who are 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.640
 linked to al-Qaeda claim to have about 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.979
 half of the ground forces are more 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.369
 radicals are the most radical within 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.829
 we have the ifs and we have the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 that is attached to the letter 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.460
 Let's show a map of the region just to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.460
 people understand better where the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.130
 Syrian to Syrian is an Arab country is in the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.740
 southwest of Asia is that this region is the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 Middle East is there in the Middle East 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.960
 exactly the southwest of Asia between 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.119
 Turkey and Iraq, so the whole 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.040
 conflict that has spread over the past 10 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.469
 from the occupation spills into the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.590
 Syria and vice versa 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.600
 this border is very fluid and in this 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.729
 map we see in a very 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.989
 interesting because it is difficult to do this 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.880
 map but a concrete plausible division 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.130
 than how the forces are 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.060
 related and placed on the ground in 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.330
 black 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.630
 the main control sites today 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.710
 of extremists of connected radio 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.400
 Ã  al qaeda 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.700
 here in black in pink the forces of 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.100
 government and dominate and blue at the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.870
 opposition forces north times the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.580
 short ones that I did not mention in the room 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.620
 previous training because costs try to 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.500
 keep away from your conflict 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.520
 interest is to maintain control over the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.710
 short region 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.530
 nothing else now the opposition has accused 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.340
 the short ones of being a pro force 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.560
 regime 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.780
 within this scenario now because both 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.990
 conflict he looks at the historical 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.490
 see is a country colonized by france there 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.760
 very interesting to go back this past 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.990
 historical development is because until 1918 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.080
 first world war 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.160
 Syria was part of the Ottoman Empire 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.460
 World War I ended the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.990
 Ottoman empire fell and Syria together 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.480
 with other October to all the east 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.330
 average it was divided by france 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.459
 England at a meeting of the League of 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.090
 Nations which was an Unesco teacher. 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.400
 France then achieved the 1918 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.850
 colonial term is the term used 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.470
 Syria and a long process of fighting 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.370
 Syria was able to become independent 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.010
 in 1946, only recently passed 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.980
 for a period of great instability 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.860
 to the origin of the government of the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.640
 party baas of the current bashar al 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.860
 assad that it was a fairly 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.150
 authoritarian despite having 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.459
 repressive that they will pass climence 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.730
 82 for 30 years in power 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.160
 exactly where the successor was the son 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.600
 ie the population itself voting 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.300
 the elections are not 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.310
 absolutely controlled transparent 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.989
 today the fight is with the rebels and the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.489
 son bashar al-assad they want it 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.100
 He leaves but the rebels do not want 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.340
 only government they want to adopt a 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.280
 country with radical Islam is that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.930
 part of the rebels those in black 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.209
 because the rebels 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.760
 the other portion of the rebels within that 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.280
 military command 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.180
 it is they are mainly the islamic 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.670
 moderate to nationalists and leftists 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.550
 then we have in Syria three forces 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.880
 fighting extremist rebels 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.340
 the rebels to moderates and the government and 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.010
 another thing that there is not a 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 military dominance no group today 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.580
 You'll be able to win by the power of okay. 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.630
 for us to end the worst with assad 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.450
 Or rather, this is a question. 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.420
 terrible transfer to answer is because 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.970
 What can happen once with one time 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.910
 which assad falls into which is the forecast 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.450
 the forecast is that if there is no one 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.940
 the political process of negotiation 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.370
 what will happen if you sacrifice it 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.710
 there is a chaos process or the only one 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.900
 exit to Syria is negotiated 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.660
 there is no military exit only one 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.690
 negotiation is that it could lead to a 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.300
 resolution, but the forecast is one of 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.840
 prolonged civil war of the bole thank you 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.840
 by explanation
