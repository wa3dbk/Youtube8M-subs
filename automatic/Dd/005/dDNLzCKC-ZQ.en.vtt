00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.540
 who after a short time close opponents 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.940
 search and attack these 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.659
 prioritize chatting 65 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.700
 magic harm 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.560
 more fox fire the same target 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.850
 have only tried to drink 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.799
 50 percent of their damage 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.510
 max 39 damage this game was 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.510
 changed we had seen now 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.270
 we come to the third attack so 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.979
 dÃ©i throws a kiss the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.369
 arrived against 90 mark damage 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.009
 inflicting this conjures up this 125th 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.460
 for seconds defenseless to her to 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.460
 dry 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.700
 this post was not changed either 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.880
 So from particles we come to aris 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.550
 fourth attack so the ultimate the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.640
 sprint forward and fire is 3 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.500
 Wanted to be in small opponents 85 x 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.930
 cause harm and thereby champions 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.090
 You may prefer spirits within 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.270
 from ten seconds to three times 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:42.739
 be activated before the cooldown 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:47.090
 is triggered by this game 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.050
 were changed to the particles ok 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.420
 Now let's get to the skills 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.769
 as a passive network of the field makes 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.480
 which makes her more physical 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.060
 extremely resistant 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.670
 will strengthen 15 percent of his ability 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:07.040
 be commented armor now have 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:12.079
 I just got 38 and get 576 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.970
 Armor we come too much for 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.459
 first day has a very hard one 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.870
 far reaching arrivals 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.870
 causes magical damage 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.330
 here the particles were changed 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:32.200
 as with all nathan folks years 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.819
 it continues with heart two days dws he 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.380
 binds itself to a source 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.870
 Magical does what the range 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.760
 his magic increases and in 25 percent 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.590
 granted additional magic penetrate 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.330
 the bond stays for eight seconds 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.650
 or until deactivated 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.600
 You can speak the ability too 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.310
 deactivate when the effects end 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.480
 is much the running tempo two seconds to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.480
 35 percent increased 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.050
 you see the rich became good 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.050
 changed 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:06.780
 we come to the third attack 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.540
 the 220 magical harm done to an opponent 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.370
 and draw them with unstable magic 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.739
 unstable magic conjured the next one 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.209
 this opponent hits him for 15 seconds 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.759
 and so the part would have ended 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.650
 Sponsors Fire Department and if I am mine 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.650
 Next he confessed 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.789
 and last but not least the ultimate 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.830
 capacity ordered extra one he shock 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.430
 can power their a adversaries in a 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.590
 range can damage 125 magical 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.449
 within 12 seconds up to three times 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.110
 be used before the cooldown 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.110
 is triggered 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:57.720
 really great we come to now 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.720
 animation 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.440
 and last but not least the splash 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.500
