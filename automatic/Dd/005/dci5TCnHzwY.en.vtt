and that is the redesign of the area
which<00:00:15.809> was<00:00:15.960> originally<00:00:16.550> our<00:00:17.550> garden<00:00:18.240> at<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.340 
growing home so as you can see right now
it's<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> big<00:00:23.820> pile<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.090> dirt<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.869> that's

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
it's just a big pile of dirt and that's

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.300 
it's just a big pile of dirt and that's
because<00:00:25.710> we're<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.490> doing<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> lot<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
because we're going to be doing a lot of

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.389 
because we're going to be doing a lot of
redesigning<00:00:29.310> here<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.570> below<00:00:30.779> me

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
redesigning here as you can see below me

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
redesigning here as you can see below me
I've<00:00:32.399> already<00:00:32.790> started<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> dig<00:00:33.450> out<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I've already started to dig out what is

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.990 
I've already started to dig out what is
gonna<00:00:34.800> be<00:00:34.969> our<00:00:35.969> large<00:00:36.930> pond<00:00:37.829> okay<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.820> is

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
gonna be our large pond okay so this is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.260 
gonna be our large pond okay so this is
gonna<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.390> about<00:00:39.590> 5<00:00:40.590> feet<00:00:40.860> long<00:00:41.100> 3<00:00:41.700> feet<00:00:42.030> wide

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
gonna be about 5 feet long 3 feet wide

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.200 
gonna be about 5 feet long 3 feet wide
and<00:00:43.160> hopefully<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and hopefully if I'm up to it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.170 
and hopefully if I'm up to it
4<00:00:45.480> feet<00:00:45.719> deep<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> think<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.250> 2<00:00:47.940> feet

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
4 feet deep I think we're about 2 feet

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.709 
4 feet deep I think we're about 2 feet
right<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.410> got<00:00:49.620> another<00:00:49.800> 2<00:00:50.070> feet<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> go

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
right now so I got another 2 feet to go

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
right now so I got another 2 feet to go
so<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:51.840> gonna<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.170> three<00:00:52.410> ponds<00:00:52.770> here

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
so we're gonna have three ponds here

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.680 
so we're gonna have three ponds here
this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> large<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.480> will

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
this is going to be the large one will

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.770 
this is going to be the large one will
be<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> smaller<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.789> area<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.449> then

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
be a smaller one in that area and then

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.099 
be a smaller one in that area and then
also<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.730> smaller<00:00:59.730> one<00:01:00.030> behind<00:01:00.390> me<00:01:00.570> those<00:01:00.960> are

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
also a smaller one behind me those are

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.569 
also a smaller one behind me those are
just<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:01.890> feet<00:01:01.920> wide<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
just going to be about two feet wide and

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.429 
just going to be about two feet wide and
2<00:01:02.730> feet<00:01:02.940> deep

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
2 feet deep

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
2 feet deep
this<00:01:04.680> whole<00:01:04.920> area<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:06.330> already<00:01:06.689> been<00:01:06.960> dug<00:01:07.170> out

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
this whole area has already been dug out

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
this whole area has already been dug out
about<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.220> foot<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.360> we're

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
about a foot and that's because we're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
about a foot and that's because we're
gonna<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.380> whole<00:01:10.530> area<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> wetland

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
gonna make the the whole area a wetland

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060 
gonna make the the whole area a wetland
so<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> areas<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.470> ponds<00:01:13.710> are

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so the areas that are not the ponds are

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.890 
so the areas that are not the ponds are
going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.369> about<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> foot<00:01:14.970> deep<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.840> water

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
going to be about a foot deep of water

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620 
going to be about a foot deep of water
and<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> wetland<00:01:18.119> area

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and that's going to be a wetland area

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
and that's going to be a wetland area
where<00:01:18.869> we're<00:01:19.020> gonna<00:01:19.110> grow<00:01:19.470> wetland<00:01:20.250> plants

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
where we're gonna grow wetland plants

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.590 
where we're gonna grow wetland plants
like<00:01:21.000> cattails<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.020> Taro's<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
like cattails and Taro's and then in the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.840 
like cattails and Taro's and then in the
ponds<00:01:24.840> will<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.350> some<00:01:25.680> more<00:01:26.250> deep<00:01:26.520> water

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
ponds will have some more deep water

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
ponds will have some more deep water
plants<00:01:27.950> then<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.979> side

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
plants then this then just to this side

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.330 
plants then this then just to this side
of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.270> wetland<00:01:34.170> we're<00:01:34.860> gonna<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.100> planting

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of the wetland we're gonna be planting

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
of the wetland we're gonna be planting
some<00:01:35.670> fruit<00:01:35.939> trees<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:37.020> want

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
some fruit trees that's because we want

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.190 
some fruit trees that's because we want
shade<00:01:38.159> over<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> ponds<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
shade over the ponds and over the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
shade over the ponds and over the
wetland<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.860> prevent<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.430> much<00:01:41.670> evaporation

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
wetland to prevent as much evaporation

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
wetland to prevent as much evaporation
as<00:01:42.540> possible<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.229> way<00:01:43.409> we're<00:01:43.619> holding

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
as possible so that way we're holding

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
as possible so that way we're holding
water<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.490> here<00:01:44.700> we're<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.540> lose<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
water in here we're not gonna lose it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.100 
water in here we're not gonna lose it
all<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> Sun<00:01:47.220> over<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> summer<00:01:48.110> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
all to to the Sun over the summer and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.920 
all to to the Sun over the summer and
then<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.530> area<00:01:50.040> where<00:01:50.970> we've<00:01:51.329> kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.689> piled

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
then that area where we've kind of piled

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.010 
then that area where we've kind of piled
up<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> dirt<00:01:52.470> right<00:01:52.710> now<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.220> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
up the dirt right now is going to be the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.959 
up the dirt right now is going to be the
vegetable<00:01:55.829> area<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.490> we're<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> be

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
vegetable area so we're going to be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.090 
vegetable area so we're going to be
digging<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.619> we're<00:01:58.619> gonna<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.860> basically

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
digging out we're gonna be basically

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.609 
digging out we're gonna be basically
mounting<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.119> soil<00:02:00.390> where<00:02:01.380> we're<00:02:01.530> gonna

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
mounting up the soil where we're gonna

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
mounting up the soil where we're gonna
have<00:02:01.860> our<00:02:02.009> beds

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
have our beds

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.950 
have our beds
and<00:02:03.060> then<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> pathways<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:04.470> be<00:02:04.590> dug<00:02:04.800> out

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
and then the pathways will be dug out

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.499 
and then the pathways will be dug out
about<00:02:06.960> two<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.380> Jif<00:02:08.100> two<00:02:08.670> feet<00:02:08.940> or<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> foot<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
about two or Jif two feet or a foot and

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.690 
about two or Jif two feet or a foot and
a<00:02:09.539> half<00:02:09.570> deep<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.259> filled<00:02:11.009> with<00:02:11.130> mulch<00:02:11.430> so

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a half deep and filled with mulch so

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.390 
a half deep and filled with mulch so
that<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.060> water<00:02:12.300> from<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.690> area<00:02:13.110> drains<00:02:14.100> in

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
that the water from that area drains in

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.860 
that the water from that area drains in
to<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.300> wetland<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.050> into<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.440> ponds<00:02:17.870> so

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
to the wetland and into the ponds so

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.040 
to the wetland and into the ponds so
remove<00:02:19.140> doing<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.680> lot<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:19.950> work<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.630> we'll<00:02:21.630> try

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050
