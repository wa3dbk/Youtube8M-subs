00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.610
 and if we dare to look at the world 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.040
 as it is 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.889
 let's divest ourselves for a moment of any 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.190
 preconceived idea that forms us 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.680
 would show that you said the problem 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.120
 I was in the inconsistency of the PSOE 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.130
 well fine please study 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.010
 the sun is in the center since 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.200
 we turn around and it's to the vine 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.640
 hates is not a fool if well since 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.980
 varies in our distance is 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.329
 exactly but 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.510
 how could it occupy two positions to the 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.510
 time 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.210
 How could I occupy two positions 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.210
 How two positions could occur 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.799
 and now the other here and keeping the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.799
 same answer 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.260
 very well to the extreme to 200 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.710
 imagine that this is the earth and that each 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.420
 one of these flames is one of the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.299
 extreme positions of the sun regarding 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.390
 she that of winter and that of summer what 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.110
 would happen if both positions were 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.480
 the two owners of the same type 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.010
 but that is not possible ama expects that 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.060
 we know from the circle that the center of 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.500
 circle is always the same 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.030
 distance from any point of 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.820
 perimeter 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.190
 but and if I divide that center in two and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.450
 what I keep constant is the sum of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.450
 its distances to the perimeter 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.280
 good again was along the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.130
 rope to have a segment the other 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.200
 segment decreases and vice versa 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.200
 so the sum of both always goes to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.610
 be constant you see it now and yes 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.970
 we apply this to the movement of the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.970
 land 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.850
 I do not have 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.629
 with the sun 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.159
 but a very special ellipse whose few 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.549
 they have come so close that they look like 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.549
 eyes 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:28.319
 or maybe I'm raving, I wonder 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.319
 why 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.110
 we will continue with this 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.000
 Goodnight
