00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to let me know if it happened to you it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.690 
to let me know if it happened to you it
felt<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:04.200> bowels<00:02:04.770> started<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> move<00:02:05.549> but

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
felt like my bowels started to move but

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.069 
felt like my bowels started to move but
I<00:02:05.790> didn't<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.360> use<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> bathroom<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
I didn't have to use the bathroom it

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.779 
I didn't have to use the bathroom it
didn't<00:02:07.320> make<00:02:07.409> me<00:02:07.560> use<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> bathroom<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
didn't make me use the bathroom so I

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.020 
didn't make me use the bathroom so I
guess<00:02:09.390> that's<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.720> good<00:02:09.750> thing<00:02:10.370> if<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.580> are

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.610 
guess that's a good thing if you are
afraid<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> use<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.379> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
afraid to use it because of that

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
would actually send me into labor so I

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.170 
would actually send me into labor so I
