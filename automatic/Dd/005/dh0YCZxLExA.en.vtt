particularly<00:01:39.360> enjoyed<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.150> just

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
particularly enjoyed this one and just

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.590 
particularly enjoyed this one and just
because<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> diversity<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.939> me<00:01:44.939> using<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
because of the diversity of me using the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
because of the diversity of me using the
bow<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.990> arrow<00:01:46.140> while<00:01:46.649> he<00:01:46.920> was<00:01:47.100> sword<00:01:47.430> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
bow and arrow while he was sword and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.780 
bow and arrow while he was sword and
shield<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.659> was<00:01:48.810> actually<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.500> level<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.280> I

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
shield there was actually a level and I

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.999 
shield there was actually a level and I
think<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> might<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> second<00:01:52.259> level<00:01:52.439> where

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
think it might be the second level where

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.060 
think it might be the second level where
I<00:01:53.509> was<00:01:54.509> put<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.869> platform<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.890> was

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
I was put on a platform because i was

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.399 
I was put on a platform because i was
using<00:01:56.280> bow<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.759> arrow<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.299> he<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.170> down

the bowel bombs that were on the floor

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.449 
the bowel bombs that were on the floor

when the enemies came near and it just

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.570 
when the enemies came near and it just
exploded<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.330> mall<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> was<00:02:10.110> really<00:02:10.289> cool
