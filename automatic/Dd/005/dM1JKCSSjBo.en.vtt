sold recently and then some pictures

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.210 
sold recently and then some pictures
shown<00:04:10.359> him<00:04:10.509> taking<00:04:11.259> it<00:04:11.349> across<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.650> country

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
and then part 4 of the book I think

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.670 
and then part 4 of the book I think
gives<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.759> tremendous<00:04:16.269> amount<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.659> value<00:04:16.720> it's
