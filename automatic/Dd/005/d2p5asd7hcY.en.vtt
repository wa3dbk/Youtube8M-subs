00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
don't parry an uppercut alright the the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.359 
don't parry an uppercut alright the the
parry<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:41.360> specifically<00:01:42.360> designed<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:43.369> ward

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
from a hook it should be obvious that

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.540 
from a hook it should be obvious that
the<00:02:04.409> best<00:02:04.799> defense<00:02:05.509> for<00:02:06.509> an<00:02:06.600> uppercut<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.290> not

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
is that the block is specific there are

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.540 
is that the block is specific there are
certain<00:02:28.610> blows<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:30.200> one<00:02:30.650> particular<00:02:31.310> block

will<00:02:32.420> not<00:02:32.780> be<00:02:33.110> best<00:02:33.470> use<00:02:33.860> toward<00:02:34.850> that

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
will not be best use toward that

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.440 
will not be best use toward that
particular<00:02:35.900> tack<00:02:36.320> off<00:02:37.210> okay

South Pole so I'm going to switch them

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.620 
South Pole so I'm going to switch them
and<00:03:58.580> get<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> better<00:03:58.910> idea<00:03:59.030> of<00:03:59.390> what<00:03:59.540> I'm

wouldn't have to block I could just

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.110 
wouldn't have to block I could just
