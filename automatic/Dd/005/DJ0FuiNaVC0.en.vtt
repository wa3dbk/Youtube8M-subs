00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and stuff but it was I think it was

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.800

definitely<00:03:00.320> worth<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:01.130> is<00:03:01.310> very<00:03:01.910> soft<00:03:02.329> it's

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
definitely worth it it is very soft it's

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.930 
definitely worth it it is very soft it's
actually<00:03:03.049> slightly<00:03:03.260> bluish<00:03:03.650> just<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.730> little

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
actually slightly bluish just a little

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.910 
actually slightly bluish just a little
I<00:03:06.970> wonder<00:03:07.600> if<00:03:07.660> they<00:03:07.750> will<00:03:08.020> make<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.290> cave<00:03:08.560> spider

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
I wonder if they will make a cave spider

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
I wonder if they will make a cave spider
like<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.520> just<00:03:09.670> as<00:03:09.820> like<00:03:10.630> one<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.930> baby

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
like it just as like one of the baby

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.660 
like it just as like one of the baby
animals<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:12.480> line<00:03:13.480> thing<00:03:14.340> maybe<00:03:15.340> he's<00:03:15.550> like

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
animals that line thing maybe he's like

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.100 
animals that line thing maybe he's like
they<00:03:15.790> make<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.000> little<00:03:16.330> cave<00:03:16.540> spider<00:03:16.840> that's

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
they make a little cave spider that's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.720 
they make a little cave spider that's
smaller<00:03:17.410> than<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.800> because<00:03:18.430> they<00:03:18.550> are

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
smaller than this because they are

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.790 
smaller than this because they are
smaller<00:03:19.390> than<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.840> normal<00:03:20.050> spiders<00:03:20.620> in

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
smaller than the normal spiders in

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.890 
smaller than the normal spiders in
Minecraft<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:22.210> would<00:03:22.330> be<00:03:22.420> really<00:03:22.630> cool<00:03:22.810> if

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
