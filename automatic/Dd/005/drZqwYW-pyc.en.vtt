00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:13.380
 love shortcuts friends I have the me 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.719
 incredible world wonder stone for 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 you looked at a new movie with Steve 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.430
 Carell in the lead role together with Steve 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.779
 buscemi I say always how you say it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.609
 right 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.260
 i believe that bush amnesty cousine her 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.359
 my time, jim carrey 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.550
 of course as the big opponent of 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.199
 both and a very small mini role 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
 even has michael bully herbig 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.719
 get it byrd and be 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 old school friend ducks since 100 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.010
 Magic is magic in years 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.140
 vegas in a hotel and what probably before 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.270
 Ten years was a spectacular show 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.590
 is rather boring today for the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.980
 that is why most spectators remain 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.980
 empty 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.760
 the ticket sales are and that is one 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.050
 problem of the two especially because there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 the whole program so much 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.010
 routinely undermined and completely his 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.329
 The passion for magic has been lost 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.949
 Friendship of the two is also 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.720
 completely consume only hate each other 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.460
 still at each other's throat 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.080
 you can say then is completely at the end 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.520
 The hotel owner also takes that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 make her show and he either says 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 likes something new or he flies out 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 the big problem of word and say of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 Parents is that a new magic 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.729
 steve gray came to the city 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.830

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.090

 The Burton's board one 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.690

 already finished that you can smell how can 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.260
 I do not, and then again 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.140
 this classic humor slapstick 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.130
 Repeat braking that works 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.350
 I'm fine with myself 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.360
 Totgelacht in the cinema and such has gone 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.610
 he very much this very charming 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.410
 humor and that has me really good 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.140
 like it's silly yeah it is 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.390
 in any case silly and but 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.830
 at the same time very charming meanwhile in 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.420
 america not particularly successful 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.370
 movie I think that then a similar 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.290
 fate will overtake like anchorman 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.030
 in the cinema also not very successful 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.950
 but then was lost later on the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.870
 Suddenly there was a total cult film 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.400
 I'm afraid that blade runner stone 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.780
 that will happen if you so 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.640
 from the front 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.350
 be there from the very beginning 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.609
 I do not want to have to say anything later 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.079
 I've seen horny on dvd now 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.830

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.840
 they say hey 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.920
 I knew that from the beginning 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.780
 you should now go to the cinema and 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.100
 you watch these movies because totally 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:08.930
 It's worth a lot of fun 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:10.160
 horny movie doubts that we have someone 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.880

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:18.580

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.440
 very little bit of air up 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.180

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.650

 if you see another critic 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.420
 wanted to rent for that before 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.740
