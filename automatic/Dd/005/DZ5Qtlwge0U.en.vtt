00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and unusable to the rest of the UK can

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
and unusable to the rest of the UK can
stack<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> solvent<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.539> near

they're<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> clade<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> top

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
they're not on the clade so the top
