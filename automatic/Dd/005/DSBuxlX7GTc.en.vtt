we<00:00:12.360> knew<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.509> wanted<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.929> facility<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.349> can

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
we knew we wanted a facility that can

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.330 
we knew we wanted a facility that can
handle<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.790> new<00:00:15.240> production<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:16.289> also<00:00:16.340> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
handle the new production but also a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.099 
handle the new production but also a
facility<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.150> was<00:00:18.270> close<00:00:18.510> by<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> and

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
facility that was close by so and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.810 
facility that was close by so and
through<00:00:22.109> our<00:00:22.199> search<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.890> know<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.460> went<00:00:23.670> back

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
through our search you know we went back

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.370 
through our search you know we went back
and<00:00:23.850> forth<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.720> know<00:00:24.930> whether<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> be

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and forth with you know whether it be

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.109 
and forth with you know whether it be
our<00:00:25.529> accountant<00:00:25.949> financial<00:00:26.580> advisor<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
our accountant financial advisor and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.630 
our accountant financial advisor and
some<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.390> our<00:00:27.650> you<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.710> Advisory<00:00:29.220> Council<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
some of our you know Advisory Council so

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.279 
some of our you know Advisory Council so
that<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.150> probably<00:00:30.689> best<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.199> stay

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
that it's probably best just to stay

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.470 
that it's probably best just to stay
kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.009> where<00:00:32.189> we're<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:35.270> we<00:00:36.270> made

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
kind of where we're at and so we made

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
kind of where we're at and so we made
the<00:00:36.570> decision<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:37.050> stay<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.129> location

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the decision to stay in this location

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
the decision to stay in this location
and<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.780> kind<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.989> grow<00:00:40.200> up<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.710> one

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and just kind of grow up and out so one

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080 
and just kind of grow up and out so one
of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> things<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.100> did<00:00:44.309> immediately<00:00:44.670> was

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
of the things we did immediately was

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.190 
of the things we did immediately was
purchased<00:00:45.750> new<00:00:45.899> fermenters<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.780> started

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
purchased new fermenters the we started

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
purchased new fermenters the we started
out<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.680> three-and-a-half<00:00:50.460> parameters

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
out with for three-and-a-half parameters

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.959 
out with for three-and-a-half parameters
which<00:00:51.680> obviously<00:00:52.680> will<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.100> too<00:00:53.160> small<00:00:53.520> for

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
which obviously will way too small for

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.229 
which obviously will way too small for
us<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.989> didn't<00:00:55.170> expect<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.520> would<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.850> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
us we didn't expect that we would be so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
us we didn't expect that we would be so
busy<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.719> fast<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> instead<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.469> going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> new

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
busy so fast so instead of going to new

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.660 
busy so fast so instead of going to new
facility<00:01:02.390> we<00:01:03.390> decided<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> build<00:01:03.989> meaning<00:01:04.890> by

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
facility we decided to build meaning by

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.109 
facility we decided to build meaning by
bigger<00:01:05.970> fermenters<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.880> process

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
bigger fermenters so we are in a process

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
bigger fermenters so we are in a process
of<00:01:09.479> replacing<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> our<00:01:10.830> fermenter<00:01:11.220> seven

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
of replacing all of our fermenter seven

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.770 
of replacing all of our fermenter seven
barrels<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.060> three<00:01:12.210> barrel<00:01:12.420> fermenters

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
barrels and three barrel fermenters

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.210 
barrels and three barrel fermenters
going<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> nine<00:01:14.479> timbrel<00:01:15.479> fermenters

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
going up to nine timbrel fermenters

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.499 
going up to nine timbrel fermenters
which<00:01:17.220> allows<00:01:17.580> us<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> stay<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> current

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
which allows us to stay in the current

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.380 
which allows us to stay in the current
location<00:01:19.610> which<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.729> good<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:20.909> us<00:01:21.150> because

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
location which is good for us because

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
location which is good for us because
that<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:22.110> travel<00:01:22.650> halfway<00:01:22.979> across

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that way we don't travel halfway across

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.289 
that way we don't travel halfway across
town<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.810> another<00:01:24.960> location<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
town or to another location and in the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
town or to another location and in the
canning<00:01:27.720> line<00:01:27.900> will<00:01:28.439> also<00:01:28.799> be<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.460> same

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
canning line will also be in this same

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.700 
canning line will also be in this same
facility<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> smaller<00:01:32.909> footprint

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
facility so it's a smaller footprint

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
facility so it's a smaller footprint
it's<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.799> forehead<00:01:35.189> canning<00:01:35.610> line<00:01:36.170> which<00:01:37.170> will

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it's a forehead canning line which will

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
it's a forehead canning line which will
allow<00:01:37.439> us<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.860> roughly<00:01:38.130> about<00:01:38.280> 18<00:01:38.850> cases

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
allow us to do roughly about 18 cases

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.289 
allow us to do roughly about 18 cases
per<00:01:39.479> hour<00:01:40.250> which<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> huge<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.670> us<00:01:41.850> because

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
per hour which is huge for us because

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.569 
per hour which is huge for us because
normally<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> takes<00:01:43.200> us<00:01:43.530> about<00:01:43.680> eight<00:01:44.310> hours

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
normally it takes us about eight hours

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.679 
normally it takes us about eight hours
to<00:01:45.320> follow<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> seven<00:01:46.829> barrel<00:01:47.009> tank<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to follow a seven barrel tank so this

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.730 
to follow a seven barrel tank so this
would<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.290> efficient<00:01:49.710> for

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
would be a little bit more efficient for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.760 
would be a little bit more efficient for
us<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.939> also<00:01:51.090> basically<00:01:53.390> possibly<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
us it also basically possibly can to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039 
us it also basically possibly can to
brands<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.430> day<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.880> versus<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.600> brand<00:01:57.899> in

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
brands in one day or versus one brand in

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:58.760 
brands in one day or versus one brand in
another

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
another

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
another
no<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.640> didn't<00:01:59.880> expect<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> win<00:02:00.359> the<00:02:00.869> rapier

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
no we didn't expect to win the rapier

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.620 
no we didn't expect to win the rapier
award<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.530> 2013<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.240> actually<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
award in 2013 that was actually a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
award in 2013 that was actually a
surprise<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.409> us<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.609> just<00:02:05.759> really<00:02:06.030> made

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
surprise to us and it just really made

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.430 
surprise to us and it just really made
it<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.920> really<00:02:08.190> pushed<00:02:08.759> us<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> higher<00:02:09.300> level

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
it it really pushed us to a higher level

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.540 
it it really pushed us to a higher level
we<00:02:10.440> always<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.830> high<00:02:10.950> expectation<00:02:11.370> when<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
we always have high expectation when it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.259 
we always have high expectation when it
comes<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.819> our<00:02:11.910> beers<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:13.200> we<00:02:13.319> knew<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
comes to our beers but we knew that the

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.210 
comes to our beers but we knew that the
product<00:02:16.700> would<00:02:17.700> basically<00:02:18.319> support<00:02:19.319> attack

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
product would basically support attack

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.400 
product would basically support attack
room<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.790> support<00:02:21.239> what<00:02:21.360> we're<00:02:21.450> doing<00:02:21.750> so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
room and support what we're doing so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.830 
room and support what we're doing so
it's<00:02:22.530> always<00:02:22.680> advantageous<00:02:23.360> for<00:02:24.360> us<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.720> make

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
lunch or buying dinner that's been a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.340 
lunch or buying dinner that's been a
huge<00:03:10.260> factor<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.489> expansion<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:13.230> know

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
huge factor in this expansion you know

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.160 
huge factor in this expansion you know
banks<00:03:14.220> aren't<00:03:14.370> lending<00:03:14.430> money<00:03:14.700> right<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.170> and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
banks aren't lending money right now and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.890 
banks aren't lending money right now and
so<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.680> saw<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.130> beginning<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.900> so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
so we saw that in the beginning and so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.500 
so we saw that in the beginning and so
we<00:03:19.019> just<00:03:19.049> made<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.739> decision<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.510> self

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
we just made the decision to self

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.620 
we just made the decision to self
finance<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.139> operation<00:03:22.170> ourselves<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:24.150> you

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
finance the operation ourselves and you

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.940 
finance the operation ourselves and you
know<00:03:24.750> obviously<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.230> big<00:03:25.440> task<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.920> us

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
know obviously it's a big task for us

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.220 
know obviously it's a big task for us
because<00:03:26.160> we<00:03:26.609> are<00:03:26.730> still<00:03:26.970> small<00:03:27.209> less<00:03:27.989> than<00:03:28.139> a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
because we are still small less than a

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.589 
because we are still small less than a
year<00:03:28.380> into<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.829> but<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.849> was<00:03:29.940> probably<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
year into it but it was probably the

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.319 
year into it but it was probably the
right<00:03:30.750> thing<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:31.230> us<00:03:31.349> at<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.769> point<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
right thing for us at this point and it

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.569 
right thing for us at this point and it
helps<00:03:33.569> keeps<00:03:33.780> keeps<00:03:34.170> us<00:03:34.380> out<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.530> debt<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:35.519> a

helps keeps keeps us out of debt in a
long<00:03:35.760> term
