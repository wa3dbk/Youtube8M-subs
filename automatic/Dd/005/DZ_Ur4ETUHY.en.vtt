00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.880 
in a lot of matches where in that
position<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.509> think<00:01:51.170> if<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.289> wasn't<00:01:51.530> over<00:01:51.619> time

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
position I think if it wasn't over time

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.349 
position I think if it wasn't over time
in<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.159> rep<00:01:52.310> didn't<00:01:52.579> maybe<00:01:52.729> make<00:01:52.969> that<00:01:53.149> quick

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
in the rep didn't maybe make that quick

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.599 
in the rep didn't maybe make that quick
call<00:01:53.740> there's<00:01:54.740> no<00:01:54.829> question<00:01:55.219> that<00:01:55.250> would

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
call there's no question that would

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.190 
call there's no question that would
probably<00:01:55.969> continue<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:56.750> thought<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.049> was<00:01:57.170> a

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
probably continue so we thought it was a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.700 
probably continue so we thought it was a
bad<00:01:58.100> call<00:01:58.340> ended<00:01:59.210> up<00:01:59.359> unfavorable<00:01:59.990> for<00:02:00.229> us<00:02:00.350> but

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
bad call ended up unfavorable for us but

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.490 
bad call ended up unfavorable for us but
and<00:02:01.039> then<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.429> day<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.689> is<00:02:02.810> what<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.079> is<00:02:03.109> and<00:02:03.229> we

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
and then the day it is what it is and we

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.779 
and then the day it is what it is and we
got<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.740> find<00:02:03.859> a<00:02:03.979> way<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.130> score<00:02:04.310> those<00:02:04.520> points

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
got to find a way to score those points

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.130 
got to find a way to score those points
earlier<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.299> doesn't<00:02:05.539> get<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.719> that<00:02:05.840> point

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
earlier so it doesn't get to that point

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.520 
earlier so it doesn't get to that point
but<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:07.820> moving<00:02:08.119> on<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.300> 184<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:09.350> end<00:02:09.470> up

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
but so then moving on to 184 we end up

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.600 
but so then moving on to 184 we end up
dropping<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.979> bout<00:02:10.220> at<00:02:10.399> 184<00:02:11.030> pounds<00:02:12.610> 197

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
dropping the bout at 184 pounds 197

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.200 
dropping the bout at 184 pounds 197

was a tight match I thought she did a
great<00:02:27.890> job<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.220> staying<00:02:28.520> focused<00:02:29.030> just

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
great job of staying focused just

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.930 
great job of staying focused just

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
trying to continue to build position and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.090 
trying to continue to build position and
in<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.960> any<00:02:36.110> ends<00:02:36.290> up<00:02:36.410> scoring<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.740> take<00:02:36.890> down

with a very little time left in the
third<00:02:39.440> period<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.100> that's<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.270> good<00:02:41.390> job

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
another you know great match I think a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.180 
another you know great match I think a
lot<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.930> people<00:02:54.020> wondering<00:02:54.500> about<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.950> there

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
lot of people wondering about and there

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.490 
lot of people wondering about and there
was<00:02:55.310> rumors<00:02:55.670> going<00:02:55.940> all<00:02:56.240> so<00:02:56.630> we<00:02:57.170> had<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> couple

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
was rumors going all so we had a couple

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.870 
was rumors going all so we had a couple
guys<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.740> were<00:02:57.980> sick<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:58.430> one<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.670> them<00:02:58.730> I

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
guys that were sick but one of them I

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.130 
guys that were sick but one of them I
think<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.180> everyone<00:02:59.390> heard<00:02:59.630> about<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.900> little

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
think that everyone heard about a little

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.140 
think that everyone heard about a little
bit<00:03:00.290> was<00:03:00.500> Dylan<00:03:00.770> nest<00:03:00.980> somehow<00:03:01.340> people<00:03:01.970> were

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
bit was Dylan nest somehow people were

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.200 
bit was Dylan nest somehow people were
asking<00:03:02.540> us<00:03:02.720> about<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:03.200> before<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.650> duel

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
asking us about that before the duel

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.070 
asking us about that before the duel
obviously<00:03:05.210> hopefully<00:03:05.480> everyone<00:03:05.720> understands

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
obviously hopefully everyone understands

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.360 
obviously hopefully everyone understands
those<00:03:06.350> are<00:03:06.470> things<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.710> we<00:03:06.800> don't<00:03:07.010> want<00:03:07.250> to

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
those are things that we don't want to

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.250 
those are things that we don't want to
leak<00:03:08.000> out<00:03:08.210> because<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.750> makes<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.050> difference

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
leak out because it makes a difference

that was huge i think it says a lot for
him<00:03:59.090> in<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.930> sense<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.350> your<00:04:00.980> feeling<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.370> way

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
and you're not even close to a hundred

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.280 
and you're not even close to a hundred
percent<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:05.330> come<00:04:05.510> out<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:05.900> find<00:04:06.170> a<00:04:06.260> way

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
percent and you come out and find a way

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.470 
percent and you come out and find a way
in<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.590> big<00:04:06.800> environment<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.330> get
