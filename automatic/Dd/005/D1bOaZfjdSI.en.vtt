if<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.380> support<00:01:13.740> once<00:01:13.920> ago<00:01:14.100> stopped<00:01:14.310> their

if your support once ago stopped their

up<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:16.890> usually<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
up for it then I think it's usually a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
up for it then I think it's usually a
good<00:01:17.670> idea<00:01:17.729> most<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> time<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
good idea most of the time like in this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.929 
good idea most of the time like in this
case<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:20.100> won't<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.340> properly<00:01:20.670> grouped

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
case they won't be properly grouped

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.100 
case they won't be properly grouped
together<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.840> health

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
together and you can get health

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.340 
together and you can get health
advantage<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> lane<00:01:22.950> before<00:01:23.250> even<00:01:23.549> starts<00:01:24.350> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
advantage in lane before even starts so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
pantheon called missing so I asked honor

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.210

toward<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.020> little<00:03:07.290> brush<00:03:07.500> there<00:03:07.770> for

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
toward that little brush there for

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.410 
toward that little brush there for
something<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.730> didn't<00:03:08.970> come<00:03:09.060> into<00:03:09.270> my<00:03:09.390> mind

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
something that didn't come into my mind

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.120 
something that didn't come into my mind
that<00:03:09.810> Zedd<00:03:09.990> could<00:03:10.170> actually<00:03:10.290> come<00:03:10.590> behind<00:03:10.740> our

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that Zedd could actually come behind our

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.010 
that Zedd could actually come behind our
tower<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.640> we<00:03:12.030> didn't<00:03:12.270> quite<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.660> any<00:03:12.810> wars

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
tower and we didn't quite have any wars

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.070 
tower and we didn't quite have any wars
around<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.890> dragon<00:03:14.220> area<00:03:14.490> at<00:03:14.790> all<00:03:14.850> so<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.900> end

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
around the dragon area at all so we end

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.260 
around the dragon area at all so we end
up<00:03:16.200> getting<00:03:16.440> killed<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.790> get<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> little

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
up getting killed in so I get a little

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.670 
up getting killed in so I get a little
bit<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.390> damage<00:03:18.600> off<00:03:18.870> onto<00:03:19.020> Caitlin<00:03:19.380> him<00:03:19.560> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
bit of damage off onto Caitlin him I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560 
bit of damage off onto Caitlin him I
kind<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.010> feel<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.250> wasn't<00:03:20.730> worth<00:03:20.940> for<00:03:21.270> some<00:03:21.450> of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
kind of feel it wasn't worth for some of

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.140 
kind of feel it wasn't worth for some of
the<00:03:21.630> flash<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:22.940> they<00:03:23.940> have

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
the flash for that because they have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.060 
the flash for that because they have
barrier<00:03:24.600> they<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.930> Lulu<00:03:25.320> ulti<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.890> with

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
barrier they have Lulu ulti just with

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.980 
barrier they have Lulu ulti just with
their<00:03:26.220> combo<00:03:26.670> it's<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.480> difficult<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
their combo it's really difficult to

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.440 
their combo it's really difficult to
kill<00:03:28.230> them<00:03:28.440> or<00:03:28.680> why<00:03:29.100> would<00:03:29.310> one<00:03:29.430> go<00:03:29.670> unless

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
kill them or why would one go unless

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.060 
kill them or why would one go unless
they're<00:03:30.750> fairly<00:03:30.960> low<00:03:31.170> health<00:03:31.380> already<00:03:37.070> hello

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
they're fairly low health already hello

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.590 
they're fairly low health already hello
despite<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.610> something<00:03:38.970> good<00:03:39.150> still<00:03:39.390> came

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
despite that something good still came

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.390 
despite that something good still came
out<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.900> in<00:03:39.990> this<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.260> kind<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.560> what<00:03:40.710> i<00:03:40.800> really

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
out of in this is kind of what i really

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.390 
out of in this is kind of what i really
think<00:03:41.660> means<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.900> be<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.050> good<00:03:43.320> jungler<00:03:43.710> is<00:03:43.830> map

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
think means to be a good jungler is map

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.910 
think means to be a good jungler is map
awareness<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:45.060> amumu<00:03:45.450> kind<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.870> knows<00:03:46.110> that

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
awareness so amumu kind of knows that

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.380 
awareness so amumu kind of knows that
Caitlyn's<00:03:47.430> forced<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.850> go<00:03:47.970> back<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.180> he

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
Caitlyn's forced to go back and he

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.880 
Caitlyn's forced to go back and he
thinks<00:03:48.660> lulu<00:03:48.930> might<00:03:49.110> stay<00:03:49.290> at<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.470> tower<00:03:49.650> so

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
thinks lulu might stay at the tower so

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.620 
thinks lulu might stay at the tower so
it<00:03:50.010> comes<00:03:50.220> down<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.700> that's<00:03:50.820> actually<00:03:51.360> what

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
it comes down and that's actually what

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.320 
it comes down and that's actually what
happens<00:03:51.990> all<00:03:52.470> due<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:52.980> map<00:03:53.160> awareness<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:54.180> what

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
happens all due to map awareness so what

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.200 
happens all due to map awareness so what
happens<00:03:54.600> here<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.870> classic<00:03:55.170> example<00:03:55.530> of

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
happens here is a classic example of

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.730 
happens here is a classic example of
overextending<00:03:57.210> too<00:03:57.450> far<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.990> basically

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
overextending too far and basically

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.400 
overextending too far and basically
baiting<00:03:59.310> your<00:03:59.490> team<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.000> death<00:04:00.260> when<00:04:01.260> you're

his<00:06:06.419> team<00:06:06.629> weren't<00:06:06.870> ready<00:06:07.229> to<00:06:07.319> go<00:06:07.620> in<00:06:07.800> yet<00:06:08.009> and

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
his team weren't ready to go in yet and

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.070 
his team weren't ready to go in yet and
once<00:06:08.669> again<00:06:08.759> it's<00:06:09.150> all<00:06:09.270> about<00:06:09.330> initiation

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
once again it's all about initiation

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.860 
once again it's all about initiation
yeah<00:06:10.889> he<00:06:11.789> just<00:06:12.000> gets<00:06:12.180> sana<00:06:12.419> altered<00:06:12.750> it

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
yeah he just gets sana altered it

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.320 
yeah he just gets sana altered it
completely<00:06:13.439> bursted<00:06:13.949> down<00:06:14.159> at<00:06:14.849> this<00:06:14.969> point<00:06:15.240> i

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
completely bursted down at this point i

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.610 
completely bursted down at this point i
wasn't<00:06:15.569> paying<00:06:15.719> enough<00:06:15.900> attention<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.560> I

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
wasn't paying enough attention and I

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.589 
wasn't paying enough attention and I
didn't<00:06:16.889> even<00:06:16.919> expect<00:06:17.190> in<00:06:17.669> Italy<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.419> come

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
didn't even expect in Italy to come

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.290 
didn't even expect in Italy to come
behind<00:06:18.750> us<00:06:19.080> at<00:06:19.259> all<00:06:19.500> and<00:06:19.770> I<00:06:20.430> essentially<00:06:20.969> do

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
behind us at all and I essentially do

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.200 
behind us at all and I essentially do
what<00:06:21.629> is<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:22.169> worst<00:06:22.529> flash<00:06:23.099> I'd<00:06:23.550> probably

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
what is the worst flash I'd probably

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.450 
what is the worst flash I'd probably
ever<00:06:24.569> seen<00:06:25.050> this<00:06:25.590> is<00:06:25.740> just<00:06:25.889> what's<00:06:26.159> called

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
ever seen this is just what's called

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.059 
ever seen this is just what's called
basically<00:06:27.060> a<00:06:27.150> panic<00:06:27.719> flash<00:06:27.990> and<00:06:28.349> to<00:06:28.800> be<00:06:28.919> fair

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
basically a panic flash and to be fair

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.850 
basically a panic flash and to be fair
to<00:06:29.129> myself<00:06:29.339> I<00:06:29.729> don't<00:06:29.969> really<00:06:30.180> do<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.810> all<00:06:31.409> that

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
to myself I don't really do it all that

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.040 
to myself I don't really do it all that
often<00:06:32.099> anymore<00:06:32.520> and<00:06:32.909> it's<00:06:33.360> usually<00:06:33.779> something

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
often anymore and it's usually something

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.459 
often anymore and it's usually something
that<00:06:34.589> I'll<00:06:34.710> T<00:06:34.949> in<00:06:35.219> like<00:06:35.810> players<00:06:36.810> in<00:06:37.050> newer<00:06:37.259> to

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
that I'll T in like players in newer to

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.950 
that I'll T in like players in newer to
a<00:06:37.500> game<00:06:37.650> or<00:06:37.800> whatever<00:06:38.039> but<00:06:38.300> you<00:06:39.300> really<00:06:39.719> just

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
a game or whatever but you really just

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.839 
a game or whatever but you really just
panic<00:06:40.379> and<00:06:40.469> you<00:06:40.560> just<00:06:40.740> instantly<00:06:41.190> flash<00:06:41.460> and<00:06:41.729> I

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
panic and you just instantly flash and I

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:43.850 
panic and you just instantly flash and I
literally<00:06:42.449> end<00:06:42.690> up<00:06:42.839> flashing<00:06:43.199> on<00:06:43.500> top<00:06:43.740> of

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
literally end up flashing on top of

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.260 
literally end up flashing on top of
nidalee<00:06:44.219> which<00:06:44.430> is<00:06:44.610> like<00:06:44.879> the<00:06:44.909> complete

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
nidalee which is like the complete

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.909 
nidalee which is like the complete
opposite<00:06:45.810> of<00:06:45.870> where<00:06:46.110> I<00:06:46.169> wanted<00:06:46.440> to<00:06:46.500> go<00:06:46.589> I

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
opposite of where I wanted to go I

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.790 
opposite of where I wanted to go I
should<00:06:47.279> have<00:06:47.370> flashed<00:06:47.610> over<00:06:48.089> the<00:06:48.180> wall<00:06:48.360> and<00:06:48.800> to

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
should have flashed over the wall and to

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.320 
should have flashed over the wall and to
safety<00:06:50.219> really<00:06:50.460> I<00:06:50.490> would<00:06:50.639> have<00:06:50.759> been<00:06:50.909> okay

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
safety really I would have been okay

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.300 
safety really I would have been okay
then<00:06:51.569> but<00:06:52.050> it<00:06:52.169> actually<00:06:52.289> surprised<00:06:52.860> me<00:06:53.069> how

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
then but it actually surprised me how

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.219 
then but it actually surprised me how
long<00:06:53.580> I<00:06:53.639> actually<00:06:53.819> stayed<00:06:54.270> alive<00:06:54.569> is<00:06:54.839> kind<00:06:55.139> of

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
long I actually stayed alive is kind of

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.800 
long I actually stayed alive is kind of
just<00:06:55.349> shows<00:06:55.529> how<00:06:55.610> strong<00:06:56.610> that<00:06:56.759> build<00:06:57.150> is<00:06:57.330> so

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
just shows how strong that build is so

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.149 
just shows how strong that build is so
one<00:06:57.960> thing<00:06:58.050> I<00:06:58.169> noticed<00:06:58.529> throughout<00:06:58.800> this<00:06:58.949> game

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 
one thing I noticed throughout this game

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.040 
one thing I noticed throughout this game
is<00:06:59.339> that<00:06:59.370> Caitlyn<00:06:59.849> just<00:07:00.029> always<00:07:00.330> wanted<00:07:00.990> to

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050

find all she wanted to do is fun fun fun

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.950 
find all she wanted to do is fun fun fun
fun<00:07:03.690> fun<00:07:03.960> fun<00:07:04.229> fun<00:07:04.710> fun<00:07:04.919> fun<00:07:05.129> and<00:07:05.629> we<00:07:06.629> had<00:07:06.810> the

fun fun fun fun fun fun and we had the
inhibitor<00:07:07.680> at<00:07:07.800> mid<00:07:07.979> due<00:07:08.250> to<00:07:08.400> what<00:07:08.699> happened

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
inhibitor at mid due to what happened

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.300 
inhibitor at mid due to what happened
before<00:07:09.300> and<00:07:09.599> as<00:07:10.199> soon<00:07:10.440> as<00:07:10.560> I<00:07:10.650> noticed<00:07:11.039> that<00:07:11.099> she

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
before and as soon as I noticed that she

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.040 
before and as soon as I noticed that she
was<00:07:11.339> born<00:07:11.580> when<00:07:11.940> we<00:07:12.089> were<00:07:12.210> all<00:07:12.389> around<00:07:12.690> of<00:07:12.900> our

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
was born when we were all around of our

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.860 
was born when we were all around of our
area<00:07:13.440> I<00:07:13.650> just<00:07:14.219> instantly<00:07:14.909> pinned<00:07:15.330> by<00:07:15.569> Iran<00:07:15.719> as

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870 
area I just instantly pinned by Iran as

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.809 
area I just instantly pinned by Iran as
fast<00:07:16.139> as<00:07:16.289> I<00:07:16.379> could<00:07:16.440> and<00:07:16.800> this<00:07:17.639> is<00:07:17.789> just

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 
fast as I could and this is just

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.339 
fast as I could and this is just
something<00:07:18.180> that<00:07:18.389> you<00:07:18.569> can't<00:07:18.810> end<00:07:18.990> up<00:07:19.110> doing

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:19.349 
something that you can't end up doing

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:20.809 
something that you can't end up doing
especially<00:07:19.649> when<00:07:19.919> you've<00:07:20.039> lost<00:07:20.219> an<00:07:20.399> inhibitor

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 
especially when you've lost an inhibitor

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.389 
especially when you've lost an inhibitor
you<00:07:20.909> can't<00:07:21.089> be<00:07:21.240> at<00:07:21.659> bottom<00:07:22.080> that<00:07:22.289> 30<00:07:23.009> minutes

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:23.399 
you can't be at bottom that 30 minutes

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:24.490 
you can't be at bottom that 30 minutes
in<00:07:23.520> the<00:07:23.610> game<00:07:23.759> when<00:07:24.060> I

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500
