00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Have you ever asked me if in that 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.470
 another era I would have liked not to do and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.040
 I said that in the 20s I love the glamor 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.099
 from that time the glitters the fringes a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.920
 little bit of excesses and extravagances like that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.400
 that about the premiere of the great 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.680
 gatsby we bring you this tutorial for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.810
 that travel with us in a while 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.820
 until age 20 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 I'm going to start by applying the base as 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 berman in secret life all over my face 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.290
 I'm going to make up my eyes with the palette 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.000
 current of love in sets and widgets so 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.489
 I'm going to take this dark color from here 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.030
 which is like a dark gray that has a 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.489
 little bit 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.070
 of silver stars and I'm going to apply 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.649
 in all my mobile eyelid I will not do 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.989
 no elongated shape none of that I'm going to 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.660
 follow exactly the shape of my 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.989
 eyelid and guiding me by my account 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.989
 eye 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.609
 I'm going to take this red shadow from here with 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.920
 a brush a little more chubby for 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.200
 blur so I 'm going to apply it and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.750
 same time I'm going to blur 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.719
 gentle movements over the whole basin 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.780
 of the eye to mix these two colors and 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:38.310
 create a third color with a red wine 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.750
 a color there quite sober just like 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.750
 it was makeup in ethics 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.380
 all right 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.590
 and now with the duo mix eyeliner in 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.259
 black mix white I'm going to take the side 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.860
 white to delineate the inner part of 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.790
 my eyes 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.790
 all right 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.349
 I'm going to make a line from one end to the 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.230
 another one of my eyes above the eyelashes 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.989
 higher this to create a little more 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.580
 thick and it seems that our 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.580
 eyelashes are a little longer 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.690
 and so much 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.140
 I'm going to make some adjustments with the base 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.950
 so I'm going to hide the area very well 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.019
 of dark circles when you work with 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.970
 Dark shadows is always necessary 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.640
 To touch up the area of ​​dark circles where 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.940
 possibly shadow residue fell 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.940
 black 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.230
 the dusts checkmate in my confidences 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.880
 they will serve me to seal the base and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.090
 finish hiding all 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.090
 imperfections 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.430
 I'm going to comb my daughters with the mask 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.739
 spectacular eyebrow spectrometer 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.980
 of the time were characterized for being 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.500
 pretty finite very very skinny to me 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.810
 it looks like they are not eyebrows that remain 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.380
 good to all faces to all 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.849
 types of face that exist but then 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.800
 good on this occasion as it is not about 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.160
 of a disguise but of an inspiration 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.470
 I'm just going to comb my brows with 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.590
 the volume and accord mask in black 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.410
 mania I'm going to apply several layers of 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.000
 mask on my lashes lashes 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.670
 of the time they were also super 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.620
 exaggerated and supercharged with lashes 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.630
 or from mascara we say in 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.930
 colombia and good so I 'm going to do 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.030
 several layers to achieve that effect 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.080
 of heavily loaded eyelashes as well as 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.080
 cockroaches 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.769
 in my cheeks I'm going to apply a little 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.769
 of blusher ciccacci a brush 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.520
 I'm going to make a very special mixture 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.790
 on my lips so I'm going to take two 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.360
 tones first the color with powder and 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.989
 then the color mat ford color in network and 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.989
 his forehead 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.100
 to 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.720
 Y 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.250
 we finished with the makeup but 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.500
 This look is not complete without a 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.080
 hairstyle of the time so let's 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.390
 start in this first step that I'm going 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.460
 to show is optional I only did it 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.360
 because I think it's a little more comfortable and it's 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.300
 tie the hair in the lower part of the neck 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.760
 with a pretty thin little piece that 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.540
 then we 're going to get rid of him so 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.050
 I'm going to wrap all that tail in my 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.560
 hide hand under my hair 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.560
 this way 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.900
 secure that with several hooks 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.570
 that are necessary so that the 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.510
 hair is in place all the time 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:20.650
 Now I'm going to bust the little bit that uses 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.650
 and flying short hair instantly 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.080
 I will continue to put some hooks 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.050
 to secure the hair and keep the 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.719
 short that I'm looking for I 'm going to take 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.939
 some fringes in the part of 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.310
 go ahead and with my iron I'm going to 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.129
 pray if you have scaled hair 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.139
 or in layers is going to look much better this 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.860
 I pass when I have a little even 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.719
 is not even scaled until only 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.510
 stitches that I have left over in the part of 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.080
 ahead 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.720
 now an accessory in the head this 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.770
 gives the final touch to our look and here 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.770
 I stay smoking my 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:12.349
