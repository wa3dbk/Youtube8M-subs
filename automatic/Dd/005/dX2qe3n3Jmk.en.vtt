00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
grow in the hangar yeah I think so more

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.949 
grow in the hangar yeah I think so more
or<00:03:45.829> less<00:03:46.129> to<00:03:46.489> like<00:03:46.730> save<00:03:47.359> them<00:03:47.599> some

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
or less to like save them some

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.399 
or less to like save them some
post-production<00:03:48.650> right<00:03:49.459> drama<00:03:50.409> because

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
post-production right drama because

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.110 
post-production right drama because
there's<00:03:51.709> no<00:03:51.829> effects<00:03:52.099> weren't<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.519> great<00:03:52.700> so

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
there's no effects weren't that great so

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.610 
there's no effects weren't that great so
there's<00:03:53.299> like<00:03:53.450> there's<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.870> whole<00:03:54.049> montage

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
there's like there's the whole montage

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.959 
there's like there's the whole montage
though<00:03:54.919> and<00:03:55.069> they<00:03:55.129> get<00:03:55.250> released<00:03:55.489> on<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.730> town

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:55.969
