hi I'm Jose Gonzalez with Trek bicycles

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.720 
hi I'm Jose Gonzalez with Trek bicycles
and<00:00:02.879> we're<00:00:03.000> here<00:00:03.210> in<00:00:03.360> Chatel<00:00:03.750> France

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
and we're here in Chatel France

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.629 
and we're here in Chatel France
introducing<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.940> 2011<00:00:06.779> models<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.639> here

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
introducing the 2011 models and here

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.799 
introducing the 2011 models and here
with<00:00:08.910> me<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:10.580> 2011<00:00:11.580> remedy<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.210> want

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
with me I have the 2011 remedy and want

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.910 
with me I have the 2011 remedy and want
to<00:00:12.870> tell<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:13.290> bit<00:00:13.440> about<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
to tell you a little bit about the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.849 
to tell you a little bit about the
tuning<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.460> did<00:00:15.139> starting<00:00:16.139> off<00:00:16.260> at<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> fork

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
tuning we did starting off at the fork

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.730 
tuning we did starting off at the fork
we<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.789> custom<00:00:18.300> piston<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.990> valve<00:00:19.199> stack

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
we have a custom piston and valve stack

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.509 
we have a custom piston and valve stack
on<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.369> compression<00:00:20.760> side<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.300> things<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
on the compression side of things and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.800 
on the compression side of things and
that<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.670> specifically<00:00:24.119> done<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.689> balance

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
that was specifically done to balance

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.259 
that was specifically done to balance
fork<00:00:25.439> more<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.400> feel<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.060> rear

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
fork more so with the feel of the rear

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.009 
fork more so with the feel of the rear
end<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.720> DRC<00:00:28.260> v<00:00:28.439> rear<00:00:28.710> end<00:00:29.510> what<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.630> does<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
end the DRC v rear end what it does is

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.450 
end the DRC v rear end what it does is
it<00:00:31.140> allows<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.679> run<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> little<00:00:32.040> more<00:00:32.160> low

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it allows you to run a little more low

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.630 
it allows you to run a little more low
speed<00:00:32.759> compression<00:00:33.329> without<00:00:33.590> impacting<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
speed compression without impacting the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.209 
speed compression without impacting the
bump<00:00:35.880> sensitivity<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.559> offers<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> little

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
bump sensitivity so it offers a little

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.810 
bump sensitivity so it offers a little
more<00:00:38.370> chassis<00:00:38.879> control<00:00:39.530> more<00:00:40.530> steep<00:00:41.399> ascent

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
more chassis control more steep ascent

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.600 
more chassis control more steep ascent
control<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.680> still<00:00:43.860> allows<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
control and so on but still allows it to

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.840 
control and so on but still allows it to
respond<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.350> high<00:00:46.500> frequency<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.640> main

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
respond to the high frequency the main

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.639 
respond to the high frequency the main
difference<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.809> goes<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.170> two<00:00:49.379> port

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
difference is that it goes to a two port

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.830 
difference is that it goes to a two port
design<00:00:49.920> versus<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> three<00:00:50.820> port<00:00:51.300> design<00:00:51.449> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
design versus a three port design it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.350 
design versus a three port design it's
on<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> standard<00:00:52.469> system<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.760> uses

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
on the standard system and it also uses

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.979 
on the standard system and it also uses
a<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.809> larger<00:00:55.469> base<00:00:55.980> shim<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.149> allows<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
a much larger base shim that allows the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.490 
a much larger base shim that allows the
valve<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.500> lift<00:00:58.739> quicker<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.600> with<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> greater

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
valve to lift quicker and with a greater

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.770 
valve to lift quicker and with a greater
area<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.579> allows<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> fork<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> respond

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
area so it allows the fork to respond

end<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:08.840> focused<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> tuning<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> rebound

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
end we focused on tuning the rebound

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.240 
end we focused on tuning the rebound
what<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.189> did<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.640> found<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:13.250> small

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
what we did is we found that the small

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.749 
what we did is we found that the small
bump<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.760> small<00:01:15.180> amplitude<00:01:16.189> response<00:01:17.189> was

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
bump or small amplitude response was

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.670 
bump or small amplitude response was
really<00:01:17.790> good<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.780> wanted<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.320> more

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
really good but we wanted a little more

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.470 
really good but we wanted a little more
control<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.700> large<00:01:20.909> amplitude<00:01:21.540> big<00:01:21.900> heads

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
control on the large amplitude big heads

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.590 
control on the large amplitude big heads
such<00:01:23.050> as<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.260> water<00:01:23.560> bar<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.940> we

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
such as a water bar and so on and we

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.050 
such as a water bar and so on and we
came<00:01:25.840> up<00:01:26.050> with<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.980> different<00:01:27.880> configuration

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
came up with a different configuration

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.630 
came up with a different configuration
for<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.500> rebound<00:01:31.170> symbol<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.560> what<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.430> does

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
for the rebound symbol and what it does

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.970 
for the rebound symbol and what it does
is<00:01:33.940> initially<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.840> response<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.770> valve

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
is initially the response of the valve

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.360 
is initially the response of the valve
is<00:01:36.220> similar<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.350> standard<00:01:38.770> one<00:01:39.010> but

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
is similar to the the standard one but

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.650 
is similar to the the standard one but
after<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:41.400> deflects<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.550> given<00:01:42.910> point<00:01:43.150> this

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
after it deflects to a given point this

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.140 
after it deflects to a given point this
additional<00:01:44.730> symbol<00:01:45.730> kicks<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:48.150> restricts

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
additional symbol kicks in and restricts

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.290 
additional symbol kicks in and restricts
the<00:01:49.300> flow<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.780> oil<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.890> little<00:01:51.550> bit<00:01:51.670> more<00:01:51.910> and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
the flow the oil a little bit more and

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.710 
the flow the oil a little bit more and
gives<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.810> more<00:01:53.020> end<00:01:53.350> stroke<00:01:53.680> control

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
gives it more end stroke control

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720 
gives it more end stroke control
eliminating<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.900> kickback<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.950> water<00:01:57.400> bars

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
eliminating that kickback on water bars

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.580 
eliminating that kickback on water bars
and<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.180> on<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.600> allows<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.050> ride<00:01:59.320> more

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
and so on so it allows you to ride more

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.350 
and so on so it allows you to ride more
aggressively<00:02:00.310> through<00:02:00.700> all<00:02:00.850> types<00:02:01.150> of

that we went to the new Fox 36 180 Ford
this<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.190> arguably<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.210> best<00:02:13.570> single<00:02:13.960> clamp

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
this is arguably the best single clamp

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.900 
this is arguably the best single clamp
for<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:15.610> sport<00:02:15.910> SC<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.730> great

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
for the sport SC and it's a great

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.410 
for the sport SC and it's a great
balance<00:02:19.450> between<00:02:19.950> capability<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.420> weight

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
balance between capability and weight

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.900 
balance between capability and weight
and<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.880> has<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.630> new<00:02:25.810> inverted<00:02:26.910> damper

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
and so on it has the new inverted damper

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.540 
and so on it has the new inverted damper
and<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.690> has<00:02:29.110> high<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.680> low<00:02:29.830> speed<00:02:30.130> placed

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
and that has high and low speed placed

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.470 
and that has high and low speed placed
on<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.060> top<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> fork<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.440> much<00:02:32.620> more

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
on the top of the fork so it's much more

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.090 
on the top of the fork so it's much more
readily<00:02:34.480> usable<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.250> easier<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.050> adjust

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
readily usable and and easier to adjust

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.830 
readily usable and and easier to adjust
but<00:02:39.100> really<00:02:39.400> where<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:39.730> focused<00:02:40.150> our<00:02:40.300> work<00:02:40.570> is

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
but really where we focused our work is

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.979 
but really where we focused our work is
on<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.950> rear<00:02:42.160> shock<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:43.030> scratch<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.780> have

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
on the rear shock and scratch we have

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.190 
on the rear shock and scratch we have
the<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.680> rc4<00:02:45.370> which<00:02:46.090> has<00:02:46.300> been<00:02:46.540> extensively

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
the the rc4 which has been extensively

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.860 
the the rc4 which has been extensively
tuned<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:48.010> give<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.870> performance

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
tuned to give it the performance

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.650 
tuned to give it the performance
characteristics<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.950> we<00:02:51.370> were<00:02:51.550> after<00:02:51.730> the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
characteristics that we were after the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.570

in the transfer passageway and then the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.210 
in the transfer passageway and then the
boos<00:03:11.590> foul<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:13.330> housed<00:03:13.600> in<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.510 
reservoir what we did on the main piston
is

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
is

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.070 
is
went<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> lighter<00:03:18.450> bow<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.660> staged<00:03:21.660> so

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
went to a lighter bow that is staged so

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.160 
went to a lighter bow that is staged so
there's<00:03:22.290> two<00:03:22.560> stages<00:03:22.860> one<00:03:23.430> stage<00:03:23.760> works

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.480 
there's two stages one stage works
independent<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.380> other

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.620 
independent of the other
and<00:03:27.210> then<00:03:28.020> we<00:03:28.800> also<00:03:29.070> retune<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.000> high-speed

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
and then we also retune the high-speed

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.810 
and then we also retune the high-speed
bow<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.230> be<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> step<00:03:31.830> piston<00:03:32.340> with<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.520> lighter
