00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.630 
onto the ball of the foot step one step
one<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:38.140> really<00:01:38.320> important<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:39.040> step

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
one it's really important that you step

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.120 
one it's really important that you step
exactly<00:01:40.330> on<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.720> ball<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.260> foot<00:01:41.440> but<00:01:41.980> more

exactly on the ball of the foot but more

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.130 
exactly on the ball of the foot but more
specifically<00:01:42.610> on<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.940> bone<00:01:43.180> of<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.570> ball<00:01:43.900> of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
specifically on the bone of the ball of

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.930 
specifically on the bone of the ball of
the<00:01:44.290> foot<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.190> really<00:01:45.550> press<00:01:45.790> it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
the foot and that you really press it

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.710 
the foot and that you really press it
into<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.180> floor

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
into the floor

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.810 
into the floor
very<00:01:46.960> very<00:01:47.140> strongly<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:48.010> I<00:01:48.130> always<00:01:48.340> say<00:01:48.580> both

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
very very strongly and I always say both

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.180 
very very strongly and I always say both
the<00:01:49.060> foot<00:01:49.240> should<00:01:49.480> be<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:50.140> highest<00:01:50.619> possible

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
the foot should be the highest possible

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.880 
the foot should be the highest possible
ball<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.670> foot<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:53.170> means<00:01:53.470> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
ball of the foot and that means the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.290 
ball of the foot and that means the
highest<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.700> lift<00:01:54.880> your<00:01:54.970> heel<00:01:55.270> up

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
highest that you can lift your heel up

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.109 
highest that you can lift your heel up
without<00:01:56.229> lifting<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:57.010> bone<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.790> ball<00:01:57.970> of

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
without lifting the bone of the ball of

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.920 
without lifting the bone of the ball of
the<00:01:58.240> foot<00:01:58.390> off<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.780> floor<00:01:58.930> so<00:01:59.280> like<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:01.180> with

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
the foot off the floor so like this with

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.990 
the foot off the floor so like this with
the<00:02:02.020> bone<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.350> ball<00:02:02.590> still<00:02:02.979> pushing<00:02:03.729> into

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the bone of the ball still pushing into

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.210 
the bone of the ball still pushing into
the<00:02:04.090> floor<00:02:04.330> with<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.050> hew<00:02:05.290> going<00:02:05.680> as<00:02:05.830> high<00:02:06.040> as

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
the floor with the hew going as high as

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.510 
the floor with the hew going as high as
possible<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.900> reason<00:02:08.170> for<00:02:08.290> this<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.619> this

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
possible the reason for this is this

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.859 
possible the reason for this is this
sort<00:02:09.760> of<00:02:09.850> placement<00:02:10.030> makes<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.540> foot<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
sort of placement makes you foot the

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.630 
sort of placement makes you foot the
strong<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.350> possible<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.130> always<00:02:12.280> want

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
strong is possible and you always want

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.050 
strong is possible and you always want
strength<00:02:12.910> strong<00:02:13.360> feet<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:14.740> go<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:14.950> again<00:02:18.060> step

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
rocking from one foot to the other if

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.380 
rocking from one foot to the other if
you're<00:02:54.820> solid

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
you're solid

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.420 
you're solid
then<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.200> strong<00:02:56.470> enough<00:02:56.500> your<00:02:57.190> knees

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
then it's strong enough your knees

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.890 
then it's strong enough your knees
strong<00:02:57.730> enough<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.390> ball<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> foot

strong enough and the ball of the foot

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.900 
strong enough and the ball of the foot
is<00:02:58.959> fine<00:02:59.290> them<00:02:59.500> also<00:02:59.709> as<00:03:00.100> always<00:03:00.459> your<00:03:00.670> heel

and toes slightly out this means that

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.580 
and toes slightly out this means that

the ball of the foot and one last point
as<00:03:34.240> always<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.080> would<00:03:35.380> like<00:03:35.530> all<00:03:35.770> walks<00:03:36.070> to<00:03:36.280> be

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
as always I would like all walks to be

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.060 
as always I would like all walks to be
done<00:03:36.610> in<00:03:36.880> one<00:03:37.180> line<00:03:37.990> whether<00:03:38.710> you're<00:03:38.920> going

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
done in one line whether you're going

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.520 
done in one line whether you're going
backwards<00:03:39.370> or<00:03:39.730> forward<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:41.020> means<00:03:41.320> that

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
backwards or forward this means that

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.460 
backwards or forward this means that
this<00:03:41.680> first<00:03:42.550> step<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.480> back<00:03:43.630> lock<00:03:43.900> step<00:03:44.140> is

this first step of the back lock step is

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.970 
this first step of the back lock step is
going<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.010> be<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.640> same<00:03:45.910> track<00:03:46.300> as<00:03:46.980> your

going to be on the same track as your

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.140 
going to be on the same track as your

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
front foot step one step one step of the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.520 
front foot step one step one step of the
most<00:03:55.300> common<00:03:55.630> mistakes<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.110> see<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:56.470> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
most common mistakes that I see in the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.290 
most common mistakes that I see in the
back<00:03:56.650> log<00:03:56.950> are<00:03:58.500> step<00:03:59.500> one<00:03:59.740> being<00:04:00.100> done<00:04:00.520> not<00:04:00.970> in

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
back log are step one being done not in

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.990 
back log are step one being done not in
the<00:04:01.390> same<00:04:01.570> track<00:04:01.810> as<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.080> standing<00:04:02.440> foot<00:04:03.000> like

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
the same track as the standing foot like

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.370 
the same track as the standing foot like
this<00:04:05.070> or<00:04:06.070> step<00:04:06.460> one<00:04:06.700> over<00:04:07.510> cross<00:04:07.780> them<00:04:08.050> into

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
this or step one over cross them into

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.870 
this or step one over cross them into
another<00:04:08.680> truck<00:04:09.360> which<00:04:10.360> is<00:04:10.390> also<00:04:10.870> wrong<00:04:11.880> you

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
another truck which is also wrong you

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.229 
another truck which is also wrong you
want<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:14.440> foot<00:04:14.710> to<00:04:15.310> be<00:04:15.340> hidden<00:04:15.730> from<00:04:16.000> your

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
want the foot to be hidden from your

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.410 
want the foot to be hidden from your
view<00:04:16.510> if<00:04:16.750> your<00:04:17.290> looking<00:04:17.620> into<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.010> mirror<00:04:18.420> so

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
view if your looking into the mirror so

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.240 
view if your looking into the mirror so
definitely<00:04:20.080> stepping<00:04:20.350> in<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.680> one<00:04:20.980> track

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
definitely stepping in that one track

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.200 
definitely stepping in that one track
another<00:04:21.790> mistake<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.330> often<00:04:22.480> see<00:04:22.780> is<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
another mistake that I often see is the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.600 
another mistake that I often see is the
answer<00:04:25.510> is<00:04:25.570> going<00:04:26.350> on<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.620> outside<00:04:27.130> edge<00:04:27.370> of

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
answer is going on the outside edge of

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.760 
answer is going on the outside edge of
the<00:04:27.730> bowl<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.150> foot<00:04:28.450> which<00:04:29.320> makes<00:04:29.590> them

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
the bowl of the foot which makes them

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.890 
the bowl of the foot which makes them
quite<00:04:30.100> weak<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.550> not<00:04:30.730> strong<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.330> then<00:04:31.720> for

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
quite weak and not strong and then for

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.530 
quite weak and not strong and then for
our<00:04:31.930> balance<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.730> should<00:04:33.880> definitely<00:04:34.060> be

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
our balance so you should definitely be

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.270 
our balance so you should definitely be
pushing<00:04:34.900> it<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.170> the<00:04:35.200> inside<00:04:35.620> edge<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:36.160> the

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
pushing it to the inside edge of the

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.440 
pushing it to the inside edge of the
ball<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.850> foot<00:04:41.790> another<00:04:42.790> mistake<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.270> I

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
ball of the foot another mistake that I

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.310 
ball of the foot another mistake that I
often<00:04:43.690> see<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.640> dancers<00:04:45.640> not<00:04:46.210> pushing<00:04:47.169> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
often see is dancers not pushing the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.080 
often see is dancers not pushing the
bone<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.040> ball<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.490> foot<00:04:48.669> into<00:04:48.940> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
bone of the ball of the foot into the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.720 
bone of the ball of the foot into the
floor<00:04:49.180> but<00:04:49.810> stepping<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.380> their<00:04:50.530> toes<00:04:50.730> like

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.010 
this is not good instead you want this
onto<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.040> bottom<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:04.120> ball<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.840> foot

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
onto the bottom of the ball of the foot

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.860 
onto the bottom of the ball of the foot
on<00:05:05.620> inside<00:05:06.280> edge<00:05:06.430> aligned<00:05:07.300> with<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.630> front

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
on inside edge aligned with the front

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.140 
on inside edge aligned with the front
foot<00:05:11.250> another<00:05:12.250> mistake<00:05:12.520> that<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:12.730> see<00:05:12.790> is

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
foot another mistake that I see is

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.300 
foot another mistake that I see is
dancers<00:05:13.600> stepping<00:05:14.350> onto<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.770> bone<00:05:14.950> of<00:05:15.190> the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
dancers stepping onto the bone of the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.430 
dancers stepping onto the bone of the
ball<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.730> foot<00:05:15.880> but<00:05:16.570> not<00:05:16.600> losing<00:05:17.290> their

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
ball of the foot but not losing their

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.260 
ball of the foot but not losing their
heel<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.430> highest<00:05:18.669> possible<00:05:21.060> like<00:05:22.060> this

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
heel to the highest possible like this

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.520 
heel to the highest possible like this
this<00:05:22.870> is<00:05:23.020> also<00:05:23.230> a<00:05:23.440> weak<00:05:23.820> foot<00:05:25.080> your<00:05:26.080> foot<00:05:26.350> is

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
this is also a weak foot your foot is

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.440 
this is also a weak foot your foot is
really<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.190> strongest<00:05:27.700> if<00:05:27.940> it's<00:05:28.090> on<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.300> ball

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
really the strongest if it's on the ball

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.870 
really the strongest if it's on the ball
of<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.750> foot<00:05:28.930> when<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.800> heel<00:05:30.070> is<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.430> highest

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
of the foot when the heel is the highest

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.750 
of the foot when the heel is the highest
possible<00:05:31.210> so<00:05:32.020> definitely<00:05:33.010> make<00:05:33.190> sure<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.670> be

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
possible so definitely make sure to be

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.180 
possible so definitely make sure to be
stepping<00:05:34.000> on<00:05:34.360> to<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.840> highest<00:05:35.170> possible<00:05:35.950> ball

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
stepping on to the highest possible ball

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.280 
stepping on to the highest possible ball
of<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.490> foot<00:05:36.670> with<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.450> bore<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.900> ball<00:05:38.110> of

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
of the foot with the bore of the ball of

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:45.060 
of the foot with the bore of the ball of
the<00:05:38.380> foot<00:05:38.530> still<00:05:38.830> pushing<00:05:39.160> into<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.460> floor

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.010 

step<00:05:45.670> two<00:05:45.880> of<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.150> back<00:05:46.330> lock<00:05:46.600> step<00:05:46.810> is

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
step two of the back lock step is

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.820 
step two of the back lock step is
getting<00:05:47.440> into<00:05:47.710> the<00:05:47.830> cubic<00:05:48.190> cross<00:05:48.630> position<00:05:49.830> so

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
getting into the cubic cross position so

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.080 
getting into the cubic cross position so
you<00:05:50.890> get<00:05:51.100> into<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.400> cube<00:05:51.580> across<00:05:51.820> and<00:05:52.030> the

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
you get into the cube across and the

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.410 
you get into the cube across and the
back<00:05:52.240> lock<00:05:52.480> step<00:05:52.750> from<00:05:53.350> step<00:05:53.920> one<00:05:54.220> you<00:05:55.210> will<00:05:55.390> be

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
back lock step from step one you will be

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.580 
back lock step from step one you will be
pushing<00:05:55.840> from<00:05:56.440> your<00:05:57.160> front<00:05:57.490> foot<00:05:57.730> and<00:05:58.590> bring

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
pushing from your front foot and bring

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.410 
pushing from your front foot and bring
it<00:05:59.770> into<00:05:59.980> a<00:06:00.130> cross<00:06:00.840> so<00:06:01.840> as<00:06:02.140> the<00:06:02.710> name<00:06:02.860> suggests

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
it into a cross so as the name suggests

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.230 
it into a cross so as the name suggests
cube<00:06:04.420> across<00:06:04.750> you<00:06:05.440> cross<00:06:05.740> your<00:06:06.040> feet<00:06:06.220> so<00:06:06.790> in<00:06:07.180> a

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
cube across you cross your feet so in a

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.330 
cube across you cross your feet so in a
normal<00:06:07.510> regular<00:06:07.960> walk<00:06:08.410> whether<00:06:08.740> it's<00:06:08.950> back<00:06:09.130> or

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
normal regular walk whether it's back or

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.950 
normal regular walk whether it's back or
forward<00:06:09.580> you're<00:06:10.060> always<00:06:10.240> walking<00:06:10.540> in<00:06:10.840> the

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
forward you're always walking in the

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.900 
forward you're always walking in the
track<00:06:11.230> but<00:06:11.920> in<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.160> cube<00:06:12.370> across<00:06:12.640> you

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
track but in the cube across you

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.290 
track but in the cube across you
actually<00:06:13.300> cross<00:06:13.540> your<00:06:13.780> feet<00:06:13.960> like<00:06:14.260> this
