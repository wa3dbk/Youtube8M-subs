00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
feet may contribute to the problem that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.120 
feet may contribute to the problem that
is<00:01:51.959> correct<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.439> inherited<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.069> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
is correct so you inherited and you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.739 
is correct so you inherited and you
could<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.459> could<00:01:53.639> not<00:01:53.669> develop<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.240> based<00:01:54.419> on<00:01:54.539> so

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
could or could not develop a based on so

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:57.050 
could or could not develop a based on so
so<00:01:55.020> tell<00:01:55.259> us<00:01:55.439> about<00:01:55.709> a<00:01:55.770> typical<00:01:56.249> operation<00:01:56.399> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so tell us about a typical operation to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.089 
so tell us about a typical operation to
fix<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.539> and<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.319> recovery<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.919> like

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
fix it and and what the recovery is like

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.889 
fix it and and what the recovery is like
a<00:01:59.279> typical<00:01:59.549> bunion<00:02:00.060> surgery<00:02:00.090> depending<00:02:00.779> on

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
a typical bunion surgery depending on

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.449 
a typical bunion surgery depending on
the<00:02:00.990> severity<00:02:01.139> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.529> bunion<00:02:01.950> requires<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
the severity of the bunion requires a

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.699 
the severity of the bunion requires a
bone<00:02:02.729> cut<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.240> sometimes<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:04.049> fusion<00:02:04.469> meaning

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
bone cut and sometimes a fusion meaning

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.830 
bone cut and sometimes a fusion meaning
connecting<00:02:05.189> two<00:02:05.340> bones<00:02:05.549> together<00:02:05.789> that's<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
connecting two bones together that's the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.120 
connecting two bones together that's the
difficult<00:02:07.200> part<00:02:07.229> because<00:02:07.499> the<00:02:07.739> patient<00:02:08.039> has

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
difficult part because the patient has

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.130 
difficult part because the patient has
to<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> cast<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.179> two<00:02:09.239> months<00:02:09.810> you're

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
to be in a cast for two months you're

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.809 
to be in a cast for two months you're
here<00:02:10.349> today<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.950> something<00:02:11.400> new<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> new

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
here today with something new a new

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.540 
here today with something new a new
technique<00:02:12.569> called<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:13.260> tightrope<00:02:14.130> yeah<00:02:14.370> tell

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
technique called the tightrope yeah tell

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.740 
technique called the tightrope yeah tell
us<00:02:14.580> about<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.270> tightrope<00:02:15.569> is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
us about that the tightrope is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.570 
us about that the tightrope is
remarkable<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.800> takes<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.310> pretty

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
remarkable because it takes a pretty

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.220 
remarkable because it takes a pretty
simple<00:02:18.030> thought<00:02:18.270> process<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.960> brings<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
simple thought process and brings it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.410 
simple thought process and brings it
into<00:02:19.350> surgery<00:02:19.680> what<00:02:20.490> we<00:02:20.610> do<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.090> tie<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
into surgery what we do is we tie the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.450 
into surgery what we do is we tie the
two<00:02:21.690> metatarsals<00:02:22.290> together<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> material

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
two metatarsals together with a material

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.220 
two metatarsals together with a material
fiber<00:02:23.790> wire<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.080> actual

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
fiber wire now this is the actual

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.710 
fiber wire now this is the actual
tightrope<00:02:25.830> device<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.520> larger<00:02:27.150> version<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.600> it

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
tightrope device a larger version of it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.660 
tightrope device a larger version of it
for<00:02:27.750> demonstration<00:02:28.500> purposes<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.400> fiber

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
for demonstration purposes this fiber

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.180 
for demonstration purposes this fiber
wire<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.210> basically<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.750> suture<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.500> thread<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
wire is basically a suture a thread that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.980 
wire is basically a suture a thread that
has<00:02:32.370> metal<00:02:32.850> impregnated<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.870> it's

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
has metal impregnated in it so it's

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.620 
has metal impregnated in it so it's
really<00:02:34.380> strong<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.950> cannot<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.490> torn<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.060> so

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
really strong this cannot be torn and so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.670 
really strong this cannot be torn and so
what<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.840> do<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.080> with<00:02:37.200> these<00:02:37.320> titanium

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
what we do is with these titanium

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680 
what we do is with these titanium
buttons<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.400> lasso<00:02:38.850> these<00:02:39.030> around<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.480> two

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
buttons we lasso these around the two

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.570 
buttons we lasso these around the two
bones<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:40.530> over<00:02:40.710> here<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> perfect

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
bones so over here you see a perfect

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.730 
bones so over here you see a perfect
representation<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.570> x-ray<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
representation of this x-ray this is the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.140 
representation of this x-ray this is the
bunion<00:02:44.040> deformity<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.700> see<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.940> split

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
bunion deformity and you see the split

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.420 
bunion deformity and you see the split
and<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.020> surgery<00:02:46.530> once<00:02:46.710> we've<00:02:46.890> placed<00:02:47.160> this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and so in surgery once we've placed this

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.550 
and so in surgery once we've placed this
we're<00:02:47.970> able<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.300> tie<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.840> bunion<00:02:49.230> down

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
we're able to tie this bunion down

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.650 
we're able to tie this bunion down
slowly<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.030> actually<00:02:51.180> see<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
slowly and you can actually see the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.630 
slowly and you can actually see the
reduction<00:02:51.930> happening<00:02:52.500> real<00:02:52.680> time<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.190> that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
reduction happening real time and that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.550 
reduction happening real time and that
holds<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.210> bunion<00:02:54.480> correction<00:02:54.870> snug<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.410> acts

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
holds the bunion correction snug it acts

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.620 
holds the bunion correction snug it acts
like<00:02:55.680> an<00:02:55.920> extra<00:02:56.310> ligament<00:02:56.790> holding<00:02:57.360> these<00:02:57.480> two

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
like an extra ligament holding these two

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.330 
like an extra ligament holding these two
bones<00:02:57.780> together<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.590> do<00:02:58.740> this<00:02:58.860> all<00:02:59.130> at

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
bones together and you do this all at

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.150 
bones together and you do this all at
one<00:02:59.940> surgery<00:03:00.450> one<00:03:00.810> procedure<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:01.650> session

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
one surgery one procedure one session

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.790 
one surgery one procedure one session
and<00:03:02.370> they're<00:03:02.490> done<00:03:03.170> recently<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.530> you

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
and they're done recently as you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.710 
and they're done recently as you
actually<00:03:05.310> went<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.820> get<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.240> procedure<00:03:06.570> done

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
actually went to get this procedure done

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.900 
actually went to get this procedure done
with<00:03:07.170> dr.<00:03:07.320> Saad<00:03:07.710> Rey<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.190> they<00:03:08.520> allowed<00:03:08.760> our

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
with dr. Saad Rey and they allowed our

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.290 
with dr. Saad Rey and they allowed our
cameras<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.480> document<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.140> entire<00:03:10.470> process

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
cameras to document the entire process

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.440 
cameras to document the entire process
it's<00:03:12.320> 5:30<00:03:13.320> a.m.<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.340> we're<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.910> our<00:03:14.940> way<00:03:15.390> to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
it's 5:30 a.m. and we're on our way to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.290 
it's 5:30 a.m. and we're on our way to
the<00:03:15.750> surgery<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.710> is<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> big<00:03:17.310> big<00:03:17.670> change<00:03:18.000> for

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
the surgery this is a big big change for

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
we're going to perform a tightrope

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.660 
we're going to perform a tightrope
procedure<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.770> it<00:03:28.920> allows<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.250> patient<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
procedure and it allows the patient to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.250 
procedure and it allows the patient to
get<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.820> bunny<00:03:30.060> impression<00:03:30.600> without<00:03:30.900> having<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
get a bunny impression without having to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.370 
get a bunny impression without having to
have<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.500> fusion<00:03:32.040> or<00:03:32.280> being<00:03:32.460> a<00:03:32.550> cast<00:03:33.230> now<00:03:34.230> we're

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
have a fusion or being a cast now we're

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.130 
have a fusion or being a cast now we're
gonna<00:03:34.500> apply<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:35.340> pneumatic<00:03:36.330> ankle<00:03:36.690> tourniquet

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
gonna apply a pneumatic ankle tourniquet

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.680 
gonna apply a pneumatic ankle tourniquet
what<00:03:37.380> this<00:03:37.560> does<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:38.190> provide<00:03:38.940> us<00:03:39.090> with<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
what this does is provide us with a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.900 
what this does is provide us with a
blood<00:03:40.380> free<00:03:40.770> surgical<00:03:41.430> site

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
blood free surgical site

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.970 
blood free surgical site
we'll<00:03:43.390> make<00:03:43.540> our<00:03:43.750> initial<00:03:44.110> incision<00:03:44.410> directly

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
we'll make our initial incision directly

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.280 
we'll make our initial incision directly
over<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.370> bunion<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:45.940> entire<00:03:46.360> section<00:03:46.810> here

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
over the bunion this entire section here

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.100 
over the bunion this entire section here
has<00:03:47.860> lost<00:03:48.190> his<00:03:48.460> cartilage<00:03:48.940> its<00:03:49.270> eroded<00:03:49.960> and

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
has lost his cartilage its eroded and

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.890 
has lost his cartilage its eroded and
rubbed<00:03:50.650> away<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.790> first<00:03:52.030> bone<00:03:52.240> cut<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.660> going

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
rubbed away the first bone cut is going

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.070 
rubbed away the first bone cut is going
to<00:03:53.020> be<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.200> removal<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.760> actual<00:03:55.270> bump<00:03:55.600> now

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
to be a removal of the actual bump now

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.870 
to be a removal of the actual bump now
we're<00:03:56.230> gonna<00:03:56.320> place<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.770> tightrope<00:03:57.100> this<00:03:57.700> is

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
we're gonna place the tightrope this is

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.480 
we're gonna place the tightrope this is
really<00:03:58.360> really<00:03:58.780> strong<00:03:59.320> it's<00:03:59.890> even<00:04:00.190> hard<00:04:00.370> to

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
really really strong it's even hard to

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.530 
really really strong it's even hard to
cut<00:04:01.800> we're<00:04:02.800> gonna<00:04:02.920> pass<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.610> through<00:04:04.390> the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
cut we're gonna pass this through the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.030 
cut we're gonna pass this through the
hole

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
hole

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.590 
hole
the<00:04:06.040> reason<00:04:06.490> its<00:04:06.640> zigzag<00:04:07.090> like<00:04:07.300> that<00:04:07.450> it

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
the reason its zigzag like that it

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.650 
the reason its zigzag like that it
allows<00:04:07.870> you<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.260> pull<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.280> down<00:04:09.520> and<00:04:09.820> pull

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
allows you to pull that down and pull

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.240 
allows you to pull that down and pull
this<00:04:10.900> suture<00:04:11.350> like<00:04:11.710> that

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
this suture like that

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.740 
this suture like that
now<00:04:12.430> we're<00:04:12.580> gonna<00:04:12.700> tighten<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.090> up<00:04:13.180> as<00:04:13.360> much<00:04:13.570> as

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
now we're gonna tighten it up as much as

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.240 
now we're gonna tighten it up as much as
possible<00:04:13.930> her<00:04:14.530> angle<00:04:14.890> there's<00:04:15.100> now<00:04:15.220> been

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
possible her angle there's now been

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.550 
possible her angle there's now been
reduced<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.900> traditional<00:04:17.290> bunion<00:04:17.530> surgery

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
reduced in a traditional bunion surgery

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.289 
reduced in a traditional bunion surgery
she<00:04:18.160> would<00:04:18.310> have<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.520> be<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.730> cast<00:04:18.970> and

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
she would have to be in a cast and

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.240 
she would have to be in a cast and
immobilize<00:04:20.230> meaning<00:04:20.620> not<00:04:20.770> put<00:04:20.950> any<00:04:21.070> weight<00:04:21.190> on

the foot for about two months with this

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.630 
the foot for about two months with this
procedure<00:04:23.680> she'll<00:04:24.010> be<00:04:24.100> able<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.340> walk<00:04:24.490> out<00:04:24.610> of

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
procedure she'll be able to walk out of

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.690 
procedure she'll be able to walk out of
the<00:04:24.730> operating<00:04:25.060> room<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:27.250> it's<00:04:27.370> been<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> few

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
the operating room so it's been a few

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.510 
the operating room so it's been a few

at<00:04:32.920> her<00:04:33.070> bunions<00:04:33.310> before<00:04:33.940> surgery<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:35.340> this

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
at her bunions before surgery and this

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.860 
at her bunions before surgery and this
is<00:04:36.580> our<00:04:36.760> side-by-side<00:04:37.440> comparison

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
is our side-by-side comparison

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.040 
is our side-by-side comparison

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.320 

and<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.620> great<00:04:44.830> thing<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:45.100> not<00:04:45.760> only<00:04:45.910> can<00:04:46.180> you

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
and the great thing is not only can you

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.450 
and the great thing is not only can you
see<00:04:46.600> it<00:04:46.750> just<00:04:47.350> closely<00:04:47.860> looking<00:04:48.160> at<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.310> foot

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
see it just closely looking at the foot

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.800 
see it just closely looking at the foot
but<00:04:48.580> we<00:04:48.670> have<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.790> before-and-after<00:04:49.210> x-ray<00:04:49.720> to

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
but we have a before-and-after x-ray to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.960 
but we have a before-and-after x-ray to
show<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.050> dramatic<00:04:50.500> difference<00:04:50.950> this<00:04:51.490> truly

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
show the dramatic difference this truly

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.150 
show the dramatic difference this truly
does<00:04:52.150> change<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.170> alignment<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.650> those<00:04:53.830> bones

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
does change the alignment of those bones

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.220 
does change the alignment of those bones
and<00:04:54.700> that<00:04:54.880> tightrope<00:04:55.210> is<00:04:55.690> holding<00:04:56.080> those

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
and that tightrope is holding those

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.620 
and that tightrope is holding those
bones<00:04:56.560> yeah<00:04:56.890> so<00:04:57.370> as<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.610> can<00:04:57.730> see<00:04:57.970> these<00:04:58.480> are

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
bones yeah so as you can see these are

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.940 
bones yeah so as you can see these are
the<00:04:58.660> tightrope<00:04:59.050> buttons<00:04:59.410> holding<00:04:59.830> it

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
the tightrope buttons holding it

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.650 
the tightrope buttons holding it
together<00:05:00.070> acting<00:05:00.610> like<00:05:00.730> that<00:05:00.910> extra<00:05:01.180> ligament

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
together acting like that extra ligament

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.210 
together acting like that extra ligament
and<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:02.230> screw<00:05:02.500> then<00:05:02.680> adjusts<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.190> position

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
and this screw then adjusts the position

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.340 
and this screw then adjusts the position
of<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.760> joint<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.450> this<00:05:04.600> will<00:05:04.750> last<00:05:04.900> her<00:05:05.170> for

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
of the joint so this will last her for

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.080 
of the joint so this will last her for
pretty<00:05:05.770> much<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.950> whole<00:05:06.070> lifetime<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.730> most

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
pretty much a whole lifetime and most

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.960 
pretty much a whole lifetime and most
importantly<00:05:07.600> how<00:05:07.780> are<00:05:07.810> you<00:05:07.900> feeling<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:09.670> have

shoes again and yeah and how was the
recovery<00:05:14.620> it<00:05:15.220> was<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.610> faster<00:05:16.000> than<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.300> thought

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
recovery it was it faster than I thought
