00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
here's the easiest way to apply any type

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.080 
here's the easiest way to apply any type
of<00:00:47.519> case<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:49.219> it<00:00:50.219> goes<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.550> you're

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
of case and it goes like this you're

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.220 
of case and it goes like this you're
just<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.450> take<00:00:51.540> off<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:51.960> tiny

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
just going to take off a little tiny

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.799 
just going to take off a little tiny
section<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.000> you're<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> place<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.450> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
section and you're going to place it so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.920 
section and you're going to place it so
that<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.050> aligned<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:56.300> close<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.660> what

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that it's aligned really close to what

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.860 
that it's aligned really close to what
you<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.620> would<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:59.539> there<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.690> go

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you think you would like there you go

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
you think you would like there you go
and<00:01:01.110> then<00:01:01.550> take<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> would

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and then take a look to see if it would

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
and then take a look to see if it would
fit<00:01:03.629> nicely<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:05.869> any<00:01:06.869> type<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.410> board<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
fit nicely and then any type of board is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.580 
fit nicely and then any type of board is
what<00:01:08.070> i'm<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> use<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.160> you<00:01:11.280> just

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
what i'm going to use and then you just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.380 
what i'm going to use and then you just
line<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.920> straight<00:01:14.399> as<00:01:14.610> possible<00:01:17.390> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390

line it as straight as possible and
there<00:01:18.539> you<00:01:18.660> have<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:21.630> looks<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:21.990> nice

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
but some people rather microfiber this

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.020 
but some people rather microfiber this
is<00:01:34.830> not<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.190> damage<00:01:35.369> anything<00:01:35.759> either

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
is not going to damage anything either

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.029 
is not going to damage anything either
wake<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.840> backing<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:37.500> doesn't<00:01:37.890> really

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
wake the backing so it doesn't really

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.260 
wake the backing so it doesn't really
matter<00:01:38.280> whatever<00:01:38.610> you're<00:01:38.849> comfortable<00:01:39.090> with

make<00:01:40.229> sure<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:40.500> dry<00:01:43.580> now<00:01:44.580> when<00:01:44.910> you're

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
make sure that's dry now when you're

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.690 
make sure that's dry now when you're
applying<00:01:45.410> try<00:01:46.410> to<00:01:46.470> take<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> look<00:01:47.099> at<00:01:47.310> where

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
applying try to take a look at where

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.370 
applying try to take a look at where
things<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.599> going<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> end<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.310> beforehand

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
things are going to end up beforehand

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.330 
things are going to end up beforehand
anytime<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> you're<00:01:52.649> applying<00:01:52.890> something

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
anytime that you're applying something

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
anytime that you're applying something
to<00:01:53.580> such<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:53.940> large<00:01:54.239> surface<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.840> more

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to such a large surface it is more

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.300 
to such a large surface it is more
difficult<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:57.590> I'm<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.800> do<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.130> best

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
difficult so I'm going to do your best

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
difficult so I'm going to do your best
to<00:02:00.270> apply<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.899> evenly<00:02:01.830> as<00:02:01.950> possible<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:03.300> I

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
to apply it as evenly as possible so I

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.609 
to apply it as evenly as possible so I
only<00:02:03.539> take<00:02:03.780> off<00:02:04.099> like<00:02:05.099> one<00:02:05.509> fourth<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
only take off like one fourth of the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.940 
only take off like one fourth of the
backing<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> line<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.470> evenly

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
backing and on the line this as evenly

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.800 
backing and on the line this as evenly
as<00:02:11.069> possible

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.479 

that<00:02:15.810> looks<00:02:16.019> pretty<00:02:16.290> good<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.830> me<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.370> to

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
that looks pretty good to me but just to

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.170 
that looks pretty good to me but just to
make<00:02:17.670> sure<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.290> play<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.530> part<00:02:19.769> on<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.310> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
make sure I play this part on here and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.490 
make sure I play this part on here and
I'm<00:02:21.299> going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> take<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.629> look<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.989> see<00:02:22.019> where<00:02:22.379> it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
I'm going to take a look to see where it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.059 
I'm going to take a look to see where it
comes<00:02:22.650> falls<00:02:23.010> down<00:02:23.280> upon<00:02:23.690> great<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.650> help<00:02:25.860> out

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
comes falls down upon great to help out

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.440 
comes falls down upon great to help out
just<00:02:26.400> there's<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.819> going<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.090> really<00:02:27.360> in

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
just there's not going to be really in

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.350 
just there's not going to be really in
air<00:02:27.659> bubbles<00:02:28.019> but<00:02:28.519> just<00:02:29.519> makes<00:02:29.730> my<00:02:29.879> job<00:02:30.150> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
air bubbles but just makes my job a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.630 
air bubbles but just makes my job a
little<00:02:30.569> bit<00:02:30.930> easier<00:02:31.260> after<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.269> go<00:02:37.640> test

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
little bit easier after there we go test

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.500 
little bit easier after there we go test
out<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.060> edges<00:02:40.160> because<00:02:41.160> there<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> slight

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
out the edges because there is a slight

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.280 
out the edges because there is a slight
curvature<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.640> edges<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> ipad<00:02:45.510> 2<00:02:48.290> there

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
curvature the edges of the ipad 2 there

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.210 
curvature the edges of the ipad 2 there
we<00:02:49.440> go<00:02:52.400> looks<00:02:53.400> really<00:02:53.640> nice<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.890> will<00:02:55.890> protect

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
we go looks really nice and will protect
