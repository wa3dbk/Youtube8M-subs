00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
the field of view well I think after if

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
the field of view well I think after if
you<00:03:49.880> get<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.090> used<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.390> it's<00:03:50.540> kinda<00:03:50.690> like<00:03:50.750> a

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
GoPro and you kind of don't have a

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.400 
GoPro and you kind of don't have a
screen<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:52.670> go<00:03:52.880> with<00:03:53.060> when<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.810> take<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:53.990> dish<00:03:54.230> to

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
screen I go with when you take a dish to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.309 
screen I go with when you take a dish to
pictures<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.520> it's<00:03:56.300> very<00:03:56.540> much<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.230> okay<00:03:57.560> sir

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
pictures and it's very much of okay sir

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.130 
pictures and it's very much of okay sir
point<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.159> shooting<00:04:00.489> hope<00:04:01.209> something<00:04:02.049> is

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
point and shooting hope something is

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.330 
point and shooting hope something is
going<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.319> be<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.700> in<00:04:03.939> focus<00:04:04.269> or<00:04:04.390> in<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.629> frame

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
going to be it in focus or in the frame

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.710 
going to be it in focus or in the frame
but<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.370> think<00:04:06.549> after<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:07.000> get<00:04:07.150> used<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.450> if<00:04:07.629> you

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
but I think after you get used to if you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.220 
but I think after you get used to if you
get<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.970> use<00:04:10.150> it<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.329> lot<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:10.930> think<00:04:11.140> you're
