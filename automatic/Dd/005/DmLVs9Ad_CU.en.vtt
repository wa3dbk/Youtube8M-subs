00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.370
 on youtube welcome people for the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 installation let's see the importance 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.509
 what the giants would be and for many 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.040
 that at the end of accounts do not end 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.169
 coming out well the attacks for not 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.970
 know how to use in a correct way and 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.279
 the giants in this case let's see the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.720
 attack of samuel of latin latino union 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.550
 I do not remember well with good but good 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.790
 something like that to the idea 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 then they realize that first what 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 what you have to do is try to 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.800
 open the road or leave the road 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.899
 free to the giants so they can 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.519
 move quietly with several break 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.510
 walls since at the end of the day the 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.960
 giants are going to be the ones that are going to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.180
 distract the defenses and leave you the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.659
 trans space for both goalkeepers 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.839
 wizards and me that I know you can take 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.750
 barbarians minions can sometimes do 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.129
 you have there not to attack for 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 the strong troops he had makes rod 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.210
 back that you are cleaning the area the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.710
 people will be a great distraction that 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.740
 you will get the attention of all 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 defenses that will protect you more than 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 all your strong troops behind good 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.280
 to be able to go so much going up drinks 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.039
 playing resources more blindness mind 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.920
 having fun then today in mind is 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.050
 quite quite important to try 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.720
 also protect what would be your 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.270
 giant if you can with spells of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.820
 healing or sometimes by a spell of 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.310
 jump why 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.260
 if you realize the giants stay 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.540
 stuck in an area and can not get through 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.700
 then this that makes the defenses 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.620
 attack it faster or that it 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.510
 concentrate faster on them and they'll 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.100
 to eliminate and as soon as possible those 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.900
 giants that at the end of the day you do not go 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.550
 to have a great result like 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.590
 expected that it would be maybe a 100 per 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.590
 a hundred then in this way you have 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.420
 that also visualize the way by 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.880
 where these giants can go forward 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.960
 subsequently initiated the attack to 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.160
 that if this way you do not stay 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.220
 stuck or you're not going to lose troops by 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.380
 at the end of the day we have stuck there 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.380
 and that are not distracting the greater 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.840
 amount of defenses possible enough 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.730
 good this attack too and a clear 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.200
 example for what we are talking about 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.660
 what would be the importance of the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.910
 giants very good for those who believed 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.100
 that the giants are not very important 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.800
 an attack that armen that are pretty 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.019
 quite important and can sometimes 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.269
 mark t either since you make a face 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.580
 until you do 100% the next 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.500
 attack that is well by samuel 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.540
 a pretty good with many resources 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.610
 they have realized the two villages with 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.790
 enough resources to cats groups 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.220
 giant and good as there are always some 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.960
 when he breaks monkeys to start open 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.390
 the compartments that the giants 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.060
 they can go entering little by little 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.850
 then here in this zone loose the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.250
 rest of troops up there and more 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.470
 they break some to also be able to 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.920
 go opening those areas a little bit more 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.709
 around here quite important enough 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.320
 and try to keep alive the greatest 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.600
 number of people is possible more than 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.540
 everything if they realize they are used in their 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.030
 healing spells when the giants 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.790
 are approaching what would be a 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.910
 area where the defenses are rooster and 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.500
 splash type tower of magicians can 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.060
 do death or the dead in both 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.920
 so much damage 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.680
 to these troops so they are pretty 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.850
 life but good a tower of magicians or one 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.670
 This is how you can do it a lot 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.350
 enough damage you also have to have in 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.330
 account and you have to see the rest of 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.190
 the village not only concentrate 100% on the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.959
 people are quite important to keep them 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.180
 alive but you also have to see 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.220
 where are you going to distribute your troops 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.420
 that you see the rest of the troops there already 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.280
 be the heroes as the troops 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.769
 terrestrial or aerial that see support 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.300
 so that in that way they go cleaning 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.280
 in a way 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.530
 quick and better the area than it would be 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.150
 the village both defenses as the rest of 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.920
 buildings that are lying around in this 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.660
 case the collector mines are 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.970
 practically full with all the resource 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.680
 well you must also know where 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.360
 go loosing the troops because if the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.160
 loose all in one area can do 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.390
 that are stuck there do not go 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.630
 to advance is in bombs 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.220
 giant or me that I know of cheating there and going 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.110
 to go losing will be losing everything 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.260
 but then you have to have in 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.580
 mind that is not not just throw away the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.990
 troops over there you have to think a 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.760
 little before but it is in 30 seconds 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.290
 that normally you have to take advantage of them 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.390
 pretty good to think about where 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.800
 enter and how to pose the attack are given 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.750
 pretty pretty good at both 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.180
 attacks of samuel I hope it is liked 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.830
 is this information for those who are 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.210
 more or less how to use them people 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.330
 I hope you served them we do not see the 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.330
 next
