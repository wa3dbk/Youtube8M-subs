00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.880
 ok and second I also did a streaming 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.170
 of the ww on the other channel that is very 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.850
 cool ok 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.710
 the first streaming is that it's going to be 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.670
 chinchÃ³n network and will be in 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.399
 stone goltv okay it's going to be this goltv and 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.170
 the second and that is very important but 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.769
 all that is lost shudders 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.710
 what happened next youtube the next 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.019
 day two days ago is not 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.360
 receiving or is it summarizes the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.930
 streamings but they are the ones their 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.370
 fixed 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.839
 that is, there are several people who have 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.869
 lost several streaming in the past 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.509
 days is not because I did not know it 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.670
 that youtube now seems that at the time 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.979
 just a normal streaming was 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.770
 of it being uploaded as a video and people 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.649
 could see again it seems that now the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.660
 streaming do not come out in the feeds in the 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:26.000
 subscription box so you already know 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.210
 and a string is lost as recommended 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.179
 is to go to the favorite YouTube youtube channel 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.009
 and good and look if I use a streaming 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.369
 not because even the streaming that 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.369
 made 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 and other youtubers do not come out in the pits 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.159
 but when the streaming is just no longer 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.740
 come back out as summarized I 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.560
 they understand so I'm checking their 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.860
 channels to support your youtuber 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.860
 favorites but you will care is networks h 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.030
 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.090
 bye
