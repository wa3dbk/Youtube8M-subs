to<00:00:05.430> call<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.640> but<00:00:06.240> it<00:00:06.299> looks<00:00:06.420> really<00:00:06.629> cool<00:00:06.750> I

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
to call it but it looks really cool I

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.540 
to call it but it looks really cool I
mean<00:00:07.140> obviously<00:00:07.319> it's<00:00:07.740> not<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.919> greatest<00:00:08.220> car

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
mean obviously it's not the greatest car

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.370 
mean obviously it's not the greatest car
I<00:00:08.580> think<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:09.030> actually<00:00:09.150> has<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.780> four<00:00:10.019> or<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
I think it actually has the four or the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.230 
I think it actually has the four or the
the<00:00:10.830> front<00:00:11.190> wheel<00:00:11.429> spinning<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.000> figured

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the front wheel spinning I figured

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.339 
the front wheel spinning I figured
that's<00:00:12.389> call<00:00:12.570> guys<00:00:12.780> I'm<00:00:12.900> not<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.019> freakin<00:00:13.320> car

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
