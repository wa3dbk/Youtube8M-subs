somebody's name is not a regular this is
they<00:00:20.100> were<00:00:21.109> or<00:00:22.400> vacuum<00:00:25.340> flask<00:00:27.050> now<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.710> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
they were or vacuum flask now that is a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
they were or vacuum flask now that is a
leader<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.949> way<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.130> vacuum<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.790> between<00:00:33.239> two

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
leader of a way of vacuum in between two

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.729 
leader of a way of vacuum in between two
layers<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.140> glass<00:00:34.730> all<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.230> on<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
layers of glass all right and on the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.910 
layers of glass all right and on the
inside<00:00:38.010> where<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.700> vacuum<00:00:39.210> they<00:00:39.420> put<00:00:39.920> silver

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
inside where is vacuum they put silver

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.569 
inside where is vacuum they put silver
lining<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.320> look<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
lining so if you can look at this you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.970 
lining so if you can look at this you
will<00:00:44.820> find<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.989> word<00:00:48.989> nidalee

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
will find that this one word nidalee

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:00.310 
will find that this one word nidalee
boil<00:00:51.260> when<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.530> comes<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:57.590> ready

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
boil when it comes out from here ready

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.539 
boil when it comes out from here ready
can<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:02.000> then<00:01:03.470> okay<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> temperature<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
can you see then okay the temperature of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.950 
can you see then okay the temperature of
this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.119> minus<00:01:07.700> 196<00:01:11.420> electric<00:01:12.420> gun<00:01:12.630> class

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
this is minus 196 electric gun class

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.210 
this is minus 196 electric gun class
answer<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.920> no<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.689> this<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.930> hyrax<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
answer is no because this is hyrax and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.359 
answer is no because this is hyrax and
ty'lexus<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.420> call<00:01:18.659> very<00:01:18.990> low<00:01:19.380> expensive

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

our contractor ago when Otto is very
cold<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.380> therefore<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:41.070> suddenly

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
cold and therefore it will not suddenly

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
energy from the outer layer you will

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.789 
energy from the outer layer you will
crack<00:01:48.930> consumer<00:01:49.549> right<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> one<00:01:52.680> is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799

going to detain liquid nitrogen out now
what<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:09.970> see<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.720> not<00:02:10.780> liquid<00:02:11.620> nitrogen<00:02:12.010> what

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
what you see is not liquid nitrogen what

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.589 
what you see is not liquid nitrogen what
you<00:02:12.610> see<00:02:12.880> as<00:02:13.180> smoke<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:14.520> actually<00:02:15.599> condensed

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
you see as smoke is actually condensed

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.949 
you see as smoke is actually condensed
water<00:02:16.930> vapor<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.980> off<00:02:18.370> because<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.360> Singapore

our<00:02:21.150> humidity<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.480> usually<00:02:23.019> more<00:02:23.380> than<00:02:24.269> 60

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
our humidity is usually more than 60

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.030 
our humidity is usually more than 60
even<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> air<00:02:26.050> column<00:02:26.440> but<00:02:26.620> if<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.860> go

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
even in the air column but if you go

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.190 
even in the air column but if you go
outside<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.849> be<00:02:28.000> about<00:02:28.569> eighty<00:02:29.170> percent

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
outside it to be about eighty percent

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.160 
outside it to be about eighty percent
humidity<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.390> course<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.930> learn

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
humidity and of course if you learn

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.610 
humidity and of course if you learn
geography<00:02:32.500> during<00:02:33.430> rainy<00:02:33.930> taste<00:02:34.930> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
geography during rainy taste the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.370 
geography during rainy taste the
humidity<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.250> hundred<00:02:37.120> percent<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> what

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
humidity is hundred percent so what

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.660 
humidity is hundred percent so what
we're<00:02:38.500> going<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.739> do<00:02:38.860> now<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.100> we're<00:02:39.519> gonna

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
we're going to do now is we're gonna

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.190 
we're going to do now is we're gonna
pour<00:02:40.019> liquid<00:02:41.019> nitrogen<00:02:41.410> over<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:43.200> let's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
pour liquid nitrogen over this and let's

00:02:44.200 --> 00:03:00.930 
pour liquid nitrogen over this and let's
see<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:59.200> your<00:02:59.860> balloon<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.760> has

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
see this is your balloon that has

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.979 
see this is your balloon that has
shrunken<00:03:01.540> until<00:03:02.019> later<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.450> if<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.690> want<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
shrunken until later so if you want to

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.430 
shrunken until later so if you want to
shrink<00:03:05.260> we<00:03:05.500> are<00:03:05.799> liquid<00:03:06.130> nitrogen<00:03:06.579> over<00:03:06.850> you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
shrink we are liquid nitrogen over you

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.330 
the net density of helium and the blue

so<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.850> will<00:03:43.540> give<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.959> up<00:03:44.260> trust<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.889> push<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.280> up

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
so a will give it up trust to push it up

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.720 
so a will give it up trust to push it up
and<00:03:45.730> when<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.810> put<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.769> over<00:03:48.069> there<00:03:48.400> and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
and when you put this over there and

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.789 
and when you put this over there and
you'll<00:03:49.720> find<00:03:50.019> that<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.650> will

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:02.149 

stringwriter<00:03:58.730> there's<00:03:59.730> also<00:03:59.909> putting<00:04:00.540> up<00:04:01.159> and

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
stringwriter there's also putting up and

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.350 
stringwriter there's also putting up and
there<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.579> are<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:03.450> slowly<00:04:03.860> coming<00:04:04.860> back

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
there you are it's slowly coming back

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.970 
there you are it's slowly coming back
and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.199 

oh<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:13.290> smarts<00:04:13.819> all<00:04:14.819> right<00:04:15.199> okay
