00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
information change the pathogenesis of

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.160 
information change the pathogenesis of
those<00:02:39.010> disease<00:02:39.490> how<00:02:40.180> we're<00:02:40.390> gonna<00:02:40.510> find<00:02:40.900> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
those disease how we're gonna find the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.130 
those disease how we're gonna find the
tools<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.400> target<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.630> therapy<00:02:43.870> for

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
tools and the target for therapy for

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.310 
tools and the target for therapy for
those<00:02:44.470> diseases<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.690> lab<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:47.290> a
