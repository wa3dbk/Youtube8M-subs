00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.430 
some people they scoop their middle
finger<00:02:20.550> too<00:02:20.760> hard<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.600> doesn't<00:02:21.780> tre

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
finger too hard so that it doesn't tre

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.040 
finger too hard so that it doesn't tre
flip<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.450> revert<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
flip and then you do the revert and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.200 
flip and then you do the revert and
that's<00:02:25.200> not<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.980> backside<00:02:26.430> flip<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:27.000> big

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
that's not a backside flip it's a big

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.150 
that's not a backside flip it's a big
flip<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.410> you're<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.830> want<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.010> do

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
flip so you're not going to want to do

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.210 
flip so you're not going to want to do
that<00:02:29.340> unless<00:02:30.060> you're<00:02:30.330> trying<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.660> do<00:02:30.810> Bigfoot

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
that unless you're trying to do Bigfoot

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.240 
that unless you're trying to do Bigfoot

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
so also what some people do is they'll

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.140 
so also what some people do is they'll
cheat<00:02:35.550> click<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.870> then<00:02:36.960> they'll<00:02:37.140> be<00:02:37.290> like

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
cheat click and then they'll be like

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.320 
cheat click and then they'll be like
then<00:02:39.150> I'll<00:02:39.300> switch<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.200> second<00:02:40.710> later

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
then I'll switch it like a second later

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.540 
then I'll switch it like a second later
and<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.570> looks<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:43.020> really<00:02:43.440> retarded<00:02:43.890> so

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
and that looks like really retarded so

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.780 
and that looks like really retarded so
don't<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:46.980> actually<00:02:47.370> starting

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
don't do that this is actually starting

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.890 
don't do that this is actually starting
to<00:02:47.880> trip<00:02:48.270> down<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.460> do<00:02:50.460> like<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.360> it

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
to trip down and do like that because it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.010 
to trip down and do like that because it
looks<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.230> lot<00:02:52.350> better<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.390> you'll<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.660> more

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
looks a lot better and you'll be more
