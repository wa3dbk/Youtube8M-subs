for less than it is actually worth but
this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.050> always<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.619> case<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.159> is

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
this is not always the case and this is

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.740 
this is not always the case and this is
the<00:01:47.789> topic<00:01:48.179> that<00:01:48.210> we're<00:01:48.390> gonna<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.630> talking

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the topic that we're gonna be talking

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.570 
the topic that we're gonna be talking
about<00:01:48.960> today<00:01:49.080> which<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.009> don't<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
about today which is you don't have to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.040 
about today which is you don't have to
rip<00:01:50.759> someone<00:01:51.060> off<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.330> make<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> profit<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.929> you

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
rip someone off to make a profit in you

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.779 
rip someone off to make a profit in you
yo<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.710> thing<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.069> a<00:01:53.429> lot<00:01:53.610> of

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
yo and that's one thing that a lot of

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.309 
yo and that's one thing that a lot of
people<00:01:54.060> don't<00:01:54.179> understand<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.050> that's

people don't understand and that's

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.359 
people don't understand and that's
probably<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.950> best<00:01:56.130> ways<00:01:56.340> to

actually have to go - which is a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.210 
actually have to go - which is a
completely<00:03:24.840> different<00:03:24.990> video<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.740> topic<00:03:26.130> at

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
completely different video the topic at

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.890 
completely different video the topic at
hand<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.790> don't<00:03:26.970> have<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.360> action<00:03:27.660> ripoff

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
hand is you don't have to action ripoff

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.600 
hand is you don't have to action ripoff
someone<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.590> make<00:03:28.740> it<00:03:28.860> profit<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.460> yeah

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
someone to make it profit and you yeah

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.360 
someone to make it profit and you yeah
so<00:03:29.850> like<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.720> said<00:03:30.930> your<00:03:31.440> gears<00:03:32.010> about<00:03:32.190> four

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so like I said your gears about four

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.650 
so like I said your gears about four
bucks<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:32.670> vendor<00:03:32.910> might<00:03:33.030> buy<00:03:33.240> for<00:03:33.540> like

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
bucks a vendor might buy for like

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.840 
bucks a vendor might buy for like
anywhere<00:03:34.140> from<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:35.130> two<00:03:35.490> bucks<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.820> don't

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
anywhere from one two bucks I don't

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.160 
anywhere from one two bucks I don't
think<00:03:36.060> they<00:03:36.150> would<00:03:36.270> actually<00:03:36.450> pay<00:03:36.780> three<00:03:37.050> the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
think they would actually pay three the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.690 
think they would actually pay three the
profit<00:03:37.530> margin<00:03:37.830> for<00:03:37.890> them<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.220> just<00:03:38.400> too<00:03:38.520> small

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
profit margin for them is just too small

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.820 
profit margin for them is just too small
right<00:03:39.000> there<00:03:39.240> but<00:03:39.930> let's<00:03:40.080> say<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.650> know

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
right there but let's say that you know

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.950 
right there but let's say that you know
the<00:03:41.010> gears<00:03:41.730> are<00:03:42.030> gonna<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.300> more<00:03:42.450> support<00:03:42.870> you

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
the gears are gonna get more support you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.150 
the gears are gonna get more support you
think<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.770> know<00:03:43.860> they<00:03:44.010> obviously

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
think that you know they obviously

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.590 
think that you know they obviously
haven't<00:03:44.550> been<00:03:44.670> touched<00:03:44.910> by<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.120> banlist

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
haven't been touched by the banlist

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.910 
haven't been touched by the banlist
at<00:03:45.660> least<00:03:45.870> by<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.200> time<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.440> video<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.740> out

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
at least by the time this video is out

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.100 
at least by the time this video is out
so<00:03:47.370> you're<00:03:47.640> thinking<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.030> Ghia<00:03:48.480> has<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.690> lot

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
so you're thinking that Ghia has a lot

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.630 
so you're thinking that Ghia has a lot
of<00:03:49.200> potential<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.740> be<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.860> really<00:03:50.250> good<00:03:50.370> actor

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
of potential to be a really good actor

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.340 
of potential to be a really good actor
in<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> future<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.330> from<00:03:51.930> there<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.290> do

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
in the future so from there you can do

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.930 
in the future so from there you can do
that<00:03:52.380> well<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.770> I<00:03:52.860> pick<00:03:53.040> up<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.250> bunch<00:03:53.460> these<00:03:53.640> for

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
that well if I pick up a bunch these for

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.430 
that well if I pick up a bunch these for
let's<00:03:54.270> say<00:03:54.390> four<00:03:54.630> dollars<00:03:54.840> now<00:03:54.990> like<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.290> buy

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
let's say four dollars now like you buy

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.710 
let's say four dollars now like you buy
them<00:03:55.560> at<00:03:55.680> full<00:03:55.920> price<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:56.940> totally<00:03:57.360> okay<00:03:57.660> to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
them at full price it's totally okay to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.990 
them at full price it's totally okay to
do<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.050> is<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.230> risky<00:03:58.650> move<00:03:58.800> but<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.880> more

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
do this is a risky move but if the more

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.520 
do this is a risky move but if the more
money<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.270> have<00:04:00.450> better<00:04:00.930> chance<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.500> have

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
money you have better chance you have

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.410 
money you have better chance you have
that<00:04:01.890> action<00:04:02.310> making<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.640> bigger<00:04:02.940> profit<00:04:03.210> the

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
that action making a bigger profit the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.340 
that action making a bigger profit the
more<00:04:03.540> money<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.780> put<00:04:03.900> into<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.230> more

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
more money you put into it the more

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.660 
more money you put into it the more
money<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.770> you<00:04:04.830> could<00:04:05.010> technically<00:04:05.280> make<00:04:05.460> so

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
money that you could technically make so

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.120 
money that you could technically make so

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
there sometimes things that you can be

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.490 
there sometimes things that you can be
wrong<00:04:48.090> about<00:04:48.360> like<00:04:48.540> if<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.140> pick<00:04:49.290> up<00:04:49.320> a

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
wrong about like if you pick up a

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.540 
wrong about like if you pick up a
hundred<00:04:49.620> these<00:04:49.860> for<00:04:50.070> four<00:04:50.220> dollars<00:04:50.310> each

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
hundred these for four dollars each

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.070 
hundred these for four dollars each
let's<00:04:50.790> say<00:04:50.880> they<00:04:51.150> go<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.420> eight<00:04:51.600> dollars<00:04:51.780> they

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
let's say they go to eight dollars they

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.810 
let's say they go to eight dollars they
double<00:04:52.500> in<00:04:52.620> value<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:53.190> essentially<00:04:53.640> make

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
double in value you essentially make

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.460 
double in value you essentially make
four<00:04:54.060> dollars<00:04:54.240> profit<00:04:54.450> off<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.750> each<00:04:55.050> one<00:04:55.290> that

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
four dollars profit off of each one that

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.560 
four dollars profit off of each one that
means<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.860> you've<00:04:55.980> made<00:04:56.340> how<00:04:57.030> much<00:04:57.210> Florida

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
means that you've made how much Florida

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.810 
means that you've made how much Florida
four<00:04:57.870> dollars<00:04:58.350> each<00:04:58.620> times<00:04:58.950> 100<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.640> means

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
four dollars each times 100 that means

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.610 
four dollars each times 100 that means
you<00:04:59.910> made<00:05:00.030> four<00:05:00.300> hundred<00:05:00.540> dollars<00:05:00.780> and<00:05:00.990> I

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
you made four hundred dollars and I

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.680 
you made four hundred dollars and I
sometimes<00:05:02.280> if<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.550> go<00:05:02.640> to<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.790> vendor<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.540> has

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
sometimes if you go to a vendor that has

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.390 
sometimes if you go to a vendor that has
a<00:05:03.720> lot<00:05:04.169> of<00:05:04.260> these<00:05:04.350> in<00:05:04.530> quantity<00:05:04.950> they'll<00:05:05.160> even

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
a lot of these in quantity they'll even

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.159 
a lot of these in quantity they'll even
sell<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:05.729> them<00:05:05.910> for<00:05:06.090> cheaper<00:05:06.390> vendors<00:05:06.960> can

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
sell you them for cheaper vendors can

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:07.860 
sell you them for cheaper vendors can
work<00:05:07.350> with<00:05:07.470> other

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
work with other

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.080 
work with other
which<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:08.230> another<00:05:08.440> thing<00:05:08.670> which<00:05:09.670> I<00:05:09.760> can<00:05:09.970> talk

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
which is another thing which I can talk

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.700 
which is another thing which I can talk
about<00:05:10.210> in<00:05:10.390> another<00:05:10.570> video<00:05:10.780> but<00:05:11.320> for<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.530> most

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
about in another video but for the most

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.530 
about in another video but for the most
part<00:05:11.770> let's<00:05:12.370> see<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.580> one<00:05:12.760> vendor<00:05:12.940> has<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.240> don't

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
part let's see it one vendor has I don't

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.480 
part let's see it one vendor has I don't
know<00:05:13.630> 200<00:05:13.900> of<00:05:14.470> these<00:05:14.680> in<00:05:14.800> stock<00:05:14.920> they<00:05:15.250> probably

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
know 200 of these in stock they probably

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.430 
know 200 of these in stock they probably
don't<00:05:15.730> want<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.060> have<00:05:16.210> 200<00:05:16.780> these<00:05:16.840> in<00:05:17.110> stocks

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
don't want to have 200 these in stocks

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.350 
don't want to have 200 these in stocks
so<00:05:17.740> they<00:05:18.190> will<00:05:18.370> then<00:05:18.520> sell<00:05:18.760> to<00:05:18.790> another<00:05:19.150> vendor

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
so they will then sell to another vendor

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.890 
so they will then sell to another vendor
for<00:05:19.660> let's<00:05:19.840> say<00:05:20.020> you<00:05:20.890> know<00:05:21.010> 2<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:22.060> 83<00:05:22.780> dollars

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
for let's say you know 2 to 83 dollars

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.260 
for let's say you know 2 to 83 dollars
eat<00:05:23.290> which<00:05:23.500> is<00:05:23.530> still<00:05:23.800> under<00:05:24.040> but<00:05:25.000> it's<00:05:25.120> still

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
eat which is still under but it's still

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.460 
eat which is still under but it's still
not<00:05:25.390> at<00:05:25.600> full<00:05:25.810> price<00:05:25.990> so<00:05:26.140> you<00:05:26.170> can<00:05:26.320> still

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
not at full price so you can still

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.930 
not at full price so you can still
profit<00:05:26.890> off<00:05:26.980> of<00:05:27.010> vendors<00:05:27.430> too<00:05:27.610> which<00:05:27.790> is

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
profit off of vendors too which is

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.520 
profit off of vendors too which is
another<00:05:28.270> topic<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:29.050> mean<00:05:29.230> there's<00:05:29.350> so<00:05:29.440> many

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
another topic I mean there's so many

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.190 
another topic I mean there's so many
topics<00:05:29.950> to<00:05:29.980> talk<00:05:30.640> about<00:05:30.700> but<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.810> most<00:05:31.960> part

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
topics to talk about but the most part

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.270 
topics to talk about but the most part
I'm<00:05:32.290> gonna<00:05:32.440> be<00:05:32.500> making<00:05:32.890> this<00:05:32.950> an<00:05:33.100> ongoing

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.290 
just one example of you know a way where
you<00:05:38.350> can<00:05:38.500> actually<00:05:38.680> make<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.220> profit<00:05:39.580> off<00:05:40.150> the

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
you can actually make a profit off the

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.910 
you can actually make a profit off the
game<00:05:40.450> without<00:05:40.810> actually<00:05:41.320> ripping<00:05:41.560> someone

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
game without actually ripping someone

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.200 
game without actually ripping someone
off<00:05:42.040> because<00:05:42.220> no<00:05:42.460> one<00:05:42.580> likes<00:05:42.790> to<00:05:42.880> feel<00:05:42.970> that

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
off because no one likes to feel that

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.090 
off because no one likes to feel that
they<00:05:43.300> got<00:05:43.450> ripped<00:05:43.630> off<00:05:43.750> if<00:05:44.050> let's<00:05:44.590> say<00:05:44.680> this

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
they got ripped off if let's say this

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.520 
they got ripped off if let's say this
card<00:05:45.340> goes<00:05:45.490> up<00:05:45.670> in<00:05:45.790> price<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.930> person<00:05:47.260> more

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
card goes up in price the person more

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.200 
card goes up in price the person more
likely<00:05:47.560> won't<00:05:48.040> feel<00:05:48.250> bad<00:05:48.430> if<00:05:48.670> it<00:05:48.790> happens<00:05:49.120> to

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
likely won't feel bad if it happens to

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.630 
likely won't feel bad if it happens to
go<00:05:49.300> up<00:05:49.480> in<00:05:49.600> price<00:05:49.720> after<00:05:50.050> weather<00:05:50.860> rather<00:05:51.430> than

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
go up in price after weather rather than

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.220 
go up in price after weather rather than
them<00:05:51.850> finding<00:05:52.540> out<00:05:52.660> that<00:05:52.750> this<00:05:52.840> card's<00:05:53.110> worth

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
them finding out that this card's worth

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.380 
them finding out that this card's worth
$4<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.100> that<00:05:54.400> say<00:05:54.670> that<00:05:54.850> you<00:05:54.940> bought<00:05:55.150> off<00:05:55.360> of

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
$4 and that say that you bought off of

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.820 
$4 and that say that you bought off of
them<00:05:55.600> for<00:05:55.750> a<00:05:55.780> quarter<00:05:55.990> or<00:05:56.290> a<00:05:56.320> dollar<00:05:56.620> or

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
them for a quarter or a dollar or

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.500 
them for a quarter or a dollar or
whatever<00:05:57.010> it<00:05:57.580> really<00:05:57.760> comes<00:05:57.970> down<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.180> you<00:05:58.330> but

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
whatever it really comes down to you but

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.480 
whatever it really comes down to you but
like<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:58.750> said<00:05:58.900> this<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.320> technically<00:05:59.710> a<00:05:59.890> risky

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
like I said this is technically a risky

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.910 
like I said this is technically a risky
move<00:06:00.700> but<00:06:01.330> it's<00:06:01.840> almost<00:06:01.990> like<00:06:02.200> stock<00:06:02.530> except

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
move but it's almost like stock except

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.380 
move but it's almost like stock except
for<00:06:02.950> a<00:06:03.100> more<00:06:03.340> realistic<00:06:03.670> because<00:06:03.970> talk

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
for a more realistic because talk

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.780 
for a more realistic because talk
sometimes<00:06:04.840> if<00:06:05.290> any<00:06:06.070> of<00:06:06.160> you<00:06:06.220> guys<00:06:06.340> know<00:06:06.520> stocks

sometimes if any of you guys know stocks

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.100 
sometimes if any of you guys know stocks
it's<00:06:07.000> sometimes<00:06:07.420> just<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.690> coin<00:06:07.900> toss

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
it's sometimes just a coin toss

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.680 
it's sometimes just a coin toss
