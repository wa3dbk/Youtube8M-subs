00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.620
 Hello everyone, Vova is with you again today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.469
 I want to show you a new build of navara 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.870
 I generally watched watched my old 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.039
 Bill and thought to correct him a little 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 then it will be like this 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.880
 finally make it suitable for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.710
 arenas and up to j 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.019
 donated necessary you just need to get used to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.950
 a little bit if you get used then you will 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:37.500
 just in the arena block so go 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.579
 rush to magic with talents 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.800
 naturally we swing vara 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.800
 so it's on 1 it's on all three 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:59.159
 that means on 1 this is on 5 on 1 on 1 on 2 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.820
 so further we do here on so bye 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.820
 what three 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:23.530
 here means on 3 here on one here on 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:25.960
 one here one more here 411 all this 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.340
 we finish now we still have 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.610
 do we do it here alone 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.610
 pour in there are 3 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.369
 one most important thing is that in general she 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:53.909
 eats for three seconds this you will have 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:58.140
 300 for one-two-three 300 for one for a row 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:03.960
 it's generally awesome plus you slow down 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.600
 rub it on the pancakes of the release 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.970
 but than read carefully in my 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.530
 further slows down so now how is everyone 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.709
 enjoy but arrange everything 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.989
 accordingly so leave it here 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.989
 this here and here 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.390
 wrong watch buy 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.990
 this is what was more comfortable 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.130
 straightens just so you set 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.130
 as you wish 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.770
 tank here 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.790
 one 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.850
 And so, in principle, I'm ready to book in my 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.200
 it is necessary to study 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.770
 maximum already immediately after the upgrade bin 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.560
 it is something that does not need to be improved so everything but everything 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:18.760
 studied and so it means we look like this 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.160
 I have already shown everyone to use it. 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.370
 past video tutorials 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:30.340
 Well, in general, so what does that do 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:36.940
 this skill this skill gives us now 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:39.370
 where it lives written weight gain even 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.209
 in short he heals skills max 8 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.990
 1 to 3 seconds read again 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:51.030
 so interesting 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.050
 so generally when you beat with skill i 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.490
 I will tell you how 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.490
 so so so so 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.780
 so in general when you beat skill 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:07.819
 Bagretz, then you have accumulated charges 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.560
 charges can be used either way you 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:15.750
 use this skill it gives you 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.440
 it means the axis increases the damage that is 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:24.740
 several times it increases damage 2 skill 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:29.550
 this this this this this here 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:33.330
 increases the camp that is to be 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.120
 more they are 3 in my opinion this one but he 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.250
 garbage I don't like him by the way 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.599
 would be here somewhere 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:49.320
 to accommodate since it sometimes helps well 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:51.380
 in general, so ristopii still forgot pancake so 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.840
 so many strapped 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.330
 and yet we need can be 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:03.510
 here it also place links here I will put 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:08.880
 below this is no longer necessary in principle 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:14.180
 the percentage of amps right here that is how we are 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.370
 do we attack we accumulate at least 2 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.210
 2 rage on top of clay by chance me who 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.210
 prevented 1 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.189
 So 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:38.259
 we start to turn on this one and immediately 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:41.259
 start to beat and count 1 2 3 4 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:44.500
 blow as you can see 8000 and struck her plus 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:47.009
 an additional eight thousand years and 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.810
 he also works in the arena 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.110
 that is, in the arena, I will also beat under 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.789
 8000 on the true leaves life menu 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:02.639
 decently so preferably of course 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:02.639
 walk with heal well let's try 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.800
 So 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.780
 try to get to the arena well for me 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:20.590
 show you too arenas if you of course 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:24.480
 will do everything so it will be very 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.890
 easy plus you have so many mills 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:33.330
 therefore it is advisable of course to go with 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.330
 frail so i dress fully c2 and 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.350
 I mean attention now I will say 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:51.720
 48 resistance on pvp that is 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.720
 enough push their roots 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:00.670
 jam means scattered all your 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.780
 the buffs above are not the whole here also not 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:06.780
 can summon a ghoul 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.780
 So 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.039
 here I will not use 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.960
 wanted to 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.759
 well here somehow so here but you must not 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:36.759
 understand what is happening 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:49.150
 in general, that's how it happens here so 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.910
 principle on this all thanks for all 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:56.610
