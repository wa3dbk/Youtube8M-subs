00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 I am the stefan and I introduce you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.629
 today the basket of dominiques before and what 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.309
 that can and how much in this little one 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.000
 box is now visible here 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.000
 musicstar tv 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.199
 that can be expensive is not new but so 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.030
 Being small is often overlooked 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.760
 you can see the hand next to it as well 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.309
 hunters bigger the sounds in there 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.350
 are super good we have all 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.730
 possibilities even for the live 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.230
 if you want to do that 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.730
 otherwise it is probably sooner 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.790
 designed for that one evening 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.989
 still together with friends about 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.089
 headphones neighbors not to bother too 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.620
 play and we have that now 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.850
 looked closer because there are many 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.850
 people do not even know each other 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.540
 There are already 200 presets in the basket 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.190
 that means done sounds with effects 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.860
 we can gamble so here again 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.470
 with the wheel you can see down here 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.580
 also go through the number 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.260
 sometimes even names in which 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.900
 It's going to be if something happens to us 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.150
 I also like it here before 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.160
 Just long on the slip buttons 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.290
 then we can press it 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.820
 liver are sound save and then 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.100
 just for the sake of playing, too 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.170
 a short time in the fall 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.010
 acoustics, for example, upwards again 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.010
 switch over 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.119
 we have a rhythm section here 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.849
 above 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.220
 we have almost 100 different ones 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.459
 that really rhythms everything from 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.810
 metal rock dance pop jazz 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.519
 So it's really all there is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.060
 a few more tactics to practice 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:27.750
 so like metronom and up here the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.860
 Button means tab tuner tab is simple 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.660
 the occupancy so we the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.739
 speed can change easily in 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.950
 press the speed 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.069
 and we have the speed of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.780
 the rhythm accompaniment want what 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.819
 and if we push long then come 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.420
 So we also work on the tuner 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.420
 already in it 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.709
 we 'll just have a look 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.269
 build up from a sound one can on 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.560
 the way its own sound 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.940
 but you can also create those of the 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.310
 saved before is easy 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.549
 change and we like to go 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.420
 for it in the edit function above 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.120
 then I have the one down here 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.040
 Building of this sound and every slot 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.299
 So then has theme for example 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.610
 Cabinet once m 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.709
 the different effects are too 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.700
 We promise over 150 effects in this 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.440
 small device with it 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.110
 we 'll just have a look 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.730
 construction on the now past on the amp 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.760
 and look for a new one we have 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.400
 now here for example we overdrive 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:48.030
 had here now 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:50.390
 15 30 you know now just usa 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.079
 I would never like that game 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.940
 continue 1 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.200
 then we come to the section like wii 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.040
 game down here is always 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.840
 shown in figures how much it is 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.989
 then comes in the middle better then we come 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.310
 here now moment cabinet brings that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.889
 means we are here now 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.329
 another cabinet out of this is 412 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.289
 delete box 412 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.519
 I mean the things are natural 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.590
 always modeled after things you 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.860
 I've been looking for myself now 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.860
 times 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.030
 the Hessian out that I'm fine then 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.100
 we come to the next one 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.050
 Here we have a folder chorus 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.430
 is in there now we are looking for here now 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.310
 even the flanger is here phaser 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.780
 Tremolo really everything you need 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.340
 can already buy more here 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.840
 in it 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.550
 and again a second adorn it 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.650
 Delay stored that could now 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.130
 also the change for example in delay 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.600
 number five the leighton one can 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.110
 then I have now as 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.540
 Effect you can here again from the type 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.530
 Change the top and the one for what you want 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.380

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.610
 on 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.530
 the commander has tried 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.560
 wonder how cheap it is moment 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.910

 you need whether you now out and about 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.110
 or if you just go in the evening 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.530
