00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.610 
barcode but they're they're mounting it
underneath<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:35.660> when<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:35.870> stick<00:01:36.110> your<00:01:36.230> GoPro

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
home you could then stick this through

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.160 
home you could then stick this through
and<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.680> would<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:40.430> would<00:01:40.840> hold<00:01:41.840> itself

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
and it would it would hold itself

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.490 
and it would it would hold itself
underneath<00:01:42.680> which<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.370> pretty<00:01:43.520> neat<00:01:44.290> now<00:01:45.290> when

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500
