parameters and we will revise the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.540 
parameters and we will revise the
tostring<00:00:36.899> method<00:00:36.989> by<00:00:37.980> displaying<00:00:38.340> all

a tax block to a single student object
later<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.390> bind<00:00:45.660> LS<00:00:45.989> box<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> three

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
later we will bind LS box to three

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
later we will bind LS box to three

collection<00:00:49.879> we'll<00:00:50.879> create<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> new<00:00:51.270> project

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
collection we'll create a new project

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.369 
collection we'll create a new project
will<00:00:52.590> name<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:53.809> 15<00:00:54.809> underscore<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:57.379> we

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
will name it up 15 underscore one we

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.580 
will name it up 15 underscore one we
will<00:00:58.530> create<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.800> folder<00:00:59.300> inside<00:01:00.300> our<00:01:00.660> app<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
will create a folder inside our app and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
will create a folder inside our app and
we<00:01:01.760> will<00:01:02.760> name<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.000> atlases<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.400> where

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
we will name it atlases this is where

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
we will name it atlases this is where
we're<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> place<00:01:06.330> our<00:01:06.570> class<00:01:07.110> student

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
we're going to place our class student

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.700 
we're going to place our class student
so<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.369> add<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.939> class<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.140> we'll

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so we will now add a class and we'll

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.240 
so we will now add a class and we'll
name<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.890> student<00:01:11.630> our<00:01:12.630> student<00:01:13.350> class<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
name it student our student class has to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.380 
name it student our student class has to
bribe<00:01:14.790> eat<00:01:14.970> fireballs<00:01:16.250> fry<00:01:17.250> meat<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.909> the
