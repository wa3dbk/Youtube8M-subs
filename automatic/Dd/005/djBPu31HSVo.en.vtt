00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
really ballooned up like a football

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.749 
really ballooned up like a football

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
she's got a massive tummy on her and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.060 
she's got a massive tummy on her and
I've<00:00:18.390> put<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> little<00:00:19.080> needle<00:00:19.680> into<00:00:19.920> that

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
I've put a little needle into that

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.740 
I've put a little needle into that
because<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.640> fluid<00:00:21.000> that's<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
because it's fluid that's in there and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.080 
because it's fluid that's in there and
what<00:00:21.900> we're<00:00:22.050> dealing<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.769> pus

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
what we're dealing with is pus

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
what we're dealing with is pus
looks<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.630> pus<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.350> syringe<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.769> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
looks like pus in the syringe and it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620 
looks like pus in the syringe and it
looks<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.130> pus<00:00:26.400> tamanna<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> microscope<00:00:27.420> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
looks like pus tamanna the microscope so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
looks like pus tamanna the microscope so
I<00:00:27.900> think<00:00:28.230> we've<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.439> an<00:00:28.560> infection<00:00:29.130> somewhere

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
I think we've got an infection somewhere

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.299 
I think we've got an infection somewhere
now<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.599> we're<00:00:30.750> hoping<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.160> owner

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
now what we're hoping is that the owner

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.950 
now what we're hoping is that the owner
reports<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> pus<00:00:33.210> usually<00:00:33.600> comes<00:00:33.809> out

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
reports that the pus usually comes out

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.200 
reports that the pus usually comes out
of<00:00:34.110> her<00:00:34.260> after<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> season<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.670> we're<00:00:35.820> hoping

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
of her after a season so we're hoping

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
of her after a season so we're hoping
that<00:00:36.390> she's<00:00:36.540> got<00:00:36.719> pus<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.350> her<00:00:37.469> uterus<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that she's got pus in her uterus and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459 
that she's got pus in her uterus and
this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.969> craziest<00:00:39.239> PI<00:00:39.840> Mitra<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this is just the craziest PI Mitra you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.660 
this is just the craziest PI Mitra you
know<00:00:40.590> infection<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.100> uterus<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.460> we've

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
know infection of the uterus that we've

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.610 
know infection of the uterus that we've
ever<00:00:41.820> seen<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.480> until<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.590> and

right now because that pressure when
she's<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.360> her<00:01:30.479> back<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:31.470> restricts<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
she's on her back actually restricts the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
she's on her back actually restricts the
the<00:01:32.579> blood<00:01:32.850> return<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> heart<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the blood return to the heart from the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.060 
the blood return to the heart from the
body<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.470> need<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> keep<00:01:34.799> her<00:01:34.920> blood

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
body so we need to keep her blood

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.560 
body so we need to keep her blood
pressure<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.729> high<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:35.970> possible<00:01:36.030> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
pressure up as high as possible so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.149 
pressure up as high as possible so
that's<00:01:37.380> what's<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.920> we'll<00:01:38.009> make<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that's what's going on and we'll make a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
that's what's going on and we'll make a
start<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> few<00:01:38.579> minutes<00:01:38.909> time<00:01:39.060> okay<00:01:39.360> gonna

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
start in a few minutes time okay gonna

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.530 
start in a few minutes time okay gonna
make<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> start<00:01:41.090> take<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.299> station

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
make the start take a little station

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.170 
make the start take a little station
over<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> skin

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:02:21.240 

you<00:01:47.690> stroke<00:01:48.260> down<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.770> muscle<00:01:49.040> there

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.210 

okay<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.260> looks<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.830> an

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
okay so it looks like it is a an

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.800 
okay so it looks like it is a an
infection<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.940> uterus

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.420 

well

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.259 

No<00:02:36.730> everything<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.810> see<00:02:38.019> here<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> uterus

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
No everything you see here is the uterus

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.420 
No everything you see here is the uterus
filled<00:02:40.319> with<00:02:41.319> fluid<00:02:41.739> filled<00:02:42.010> with<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.250> pus

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
filled with fluid filled with the pus

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.390 
filled with fluid filled with the pus
we're<00:02:43.030> going<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.209> be<00:02:43.269> really<00:02:43.450> careful<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:45.280> we

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
we're going to be really careful that we

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400 
we're going to be really careful that we
don't<00:02:45.550> pop<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.720> uterus<00:02:47.080> when<00:02:47.230> we're<00:02:47.319> getting

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
don't pop the uterus when we're getting

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.500 
don't pop the uterus when we're getting
it<00:02:47.650> out<00:02:47.739> because<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.519> pus<00:02:48.849> will<00:02:49.060> go<00:02:49.150> into<00:02:49.330> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
it out because that pus will go into the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.140 
it out because that pus will go into the
abdomen<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.200> you'll<00:02:50.290> get<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.440> peritonitis

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
abdomen and you'll get a peritonitis

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.440 
abdomen and you'll get a peritonitis
which<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.390> fatal<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.049> in<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.410> lot<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.590> cases<00:02:54.450> so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
which is fatal and in a lot of cases so

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:04.170 
which is fatal and in a lot of cases so
just<00:02:55.629> going<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.810> gently<00:02:56.200> tease<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.890> all<00:02:57.010> out<00:03:03.180> so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
just going to gently tease it all out so

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.030 
just going to gently tease it all out so
that's<00:03:04.540> that's<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.260> whole<00:03:05.379> uterus<00:03:05.680> out<00:03:05.860> now

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
that's that's the whole uterus out now

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.130 
that's that's the whole uterus out now
this<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> two<00:03:06.730> horns<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.360> central<00:03:08.019> bit

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
this is the two horns in the central bit

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.050 
this is the two horns in the central bit
in<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.380> middle<00:03:08.680> usually<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.549> uterus<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:09.970> a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
in the middle usually the uterus of a

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.850 
in the middle usually the uterus of a
cat<00:03:10.239> would<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.420> probably<00:03:11.170> smaller<00:03:11.500> than<00:03:11.739> this

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
cat would be probably smaller than this

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.589 
cat would be probably smaller than this
blood<00:03:12.160> vessel<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:12.549> can<00:03:12.730> see<00:03:12.880> here<00:03:13.090> or<00:03:13.299> these

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
blood vessel you can see here or these

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.199 
blood vessel you can see here or these
intestines<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:15.250> because<00:03:15.519> it's<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:15.880> full<00:03:16.150> of

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
intestines but because it's so full of

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.710 
intestines but because it's so full of
this<00:03:16.360> fluid<00:03:17.610> it's<00:03:18.610> filled<00:03:18.940> up<00:03:19.030> massively<00:03:19.450> but

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
this fluid it's filled up massively but

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.350 
this fluid it's filled up massively but
this<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.230> impressive

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
this is impressive

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.559 
this is impressive
now<00:03:22.360> it's<00:03:22.959> popping<00:03:23.470> yeah<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.819> uterus<00:03:28.329> all

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
now it's popping yeah the uterus all

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.780 
now it's popping yeah the uterus all
removed<00:03:28.989> as<00:03:29.319> she's<00:03:29.650> all<00:03:29.829> stitched<00:03:30.099> up<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.700> now

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
removed as she's all stitched up and now

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.240 
removed as she's all stitched up and now
if<00:03:30.879> I<00:03:30.940> take<00:03:31.150> this<00:03:31.269> off<00:03:31.480> hopefully<00:03:32.319> you'll<00:03:33.069> see

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
if I take this off hopefully you'll see

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.150 
if I take this off hopefully you'll see
a<00:03:33.280> bit<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.489> difference<00:03:33.849> in<00:03:33.940> her<00:03:34.120> size<00:03:38.160> it's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
a bit of a difference in her size it's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.510 
a bit of a difference in her size it's
gonna<00:03:39.340> feel<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.609> bit<00:03:39.790> better<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.060> think

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.480 

we've<00:03:47.300> emptied<00:03:47.540> out<00:03:47.720> our<00:03:47.900> uterus<00:03:48.260> now<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:48.680> this

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
we've emptied out our uterus now so this

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.740 
we've emptied out our uterus now so this
is<00:03:49.610> what's<00:03:49.760> left<00:03:49.820> behind<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.240> this<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.600> all

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
is what's left behind and this is all

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.780 
is what's left behind and this is all
the<00:03:50.960> fluid<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.470> came<00:03:51.710> out<00:03:51.890> from<00:03:52.190> inside<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
the fluid that came out from inside the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.810 
the fluid that came out from inside the
uterus<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.420> if<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:53.600> can<00:03:53.750> see<00:03:54.580> but<00:03:55.580> a<00:03:55.640> good

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
uterus and if you can see but a good

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.310 
uterus and if you can see but a good
couple<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.210> liters<00:03:56.570> there<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.930> was<00:03:57.020> inside

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
couple of liters there that was inside

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320 
couple of liters there that was inside
this<00:03:57.530> cat<00:03:57.770> so<00:03:57.980> she<00:03:58.010> said<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.550> lot<00:03:58.880> lighter<00:03:59.060> now

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
this cat so she said a lot lighter now

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.460 
this cat so she said a lot lighter now
we're<00:03:59.480> getting<00:03:59.660> way<00:03:59.750> here<00:03:59.960> in<00:04:00.050> a<00:04:00.110> second<00:04:00.410> and

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
we're getting way here in a second and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.750 
we're getting way here in a second and
see<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:00.740> percentage<00:04:00.890> of<00:04:01.280> her<00:04:01.400> body<00:04:01.580> weight

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
see what percentage of her body weight

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.150 
see what percentage of her body weight
she's<00:04:01.970> lost<00:04:02.200> misty's<00:04:03.200> all<00:04:03.500> come<00:04:03.920> round

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
she's lost misty's all come round

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.740 
she's lost misty's all come round
brilliantly<00:04:04.670> from<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.030> surgery<00:04:05.450> she<00:04:05.510> made<00:04:05.720> a

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
brilliantly from the surgery she made a

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.480 
brilliantly from the surgery she made a
really<00:04:06.050> good<00:04:06.320> recovery<00:04:07.870> she's<00:04:08.870> lost<00:04:09.500> almost

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
really good recovery she's lost almost

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.530 
really good recovery she's lost almost
three<00:04:11.150> kilos<00:04:11.630> in<00:04:11.870> weight<00:04:12.170> in<00:04:12.950> puss<00:04:13.390> which<00:04:14.390> when

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
three kilos in weight in puss which when

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.820 
three kilos in weight in puss which when
he<00:04:14.630> considered<00:04:15.020> that<00:04:15.080> she<00:04:15.140> was<00:04:15.350> only<00:04:15.560> five

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
he considered that she was only five

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.340 
he considered that she was only five
point<00:04:16.160> seven<00:04:16.400> kilos<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:17.120> start<00:04:17.390> with<00:04:17.600> means

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
point seven kilos to start with means

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.350 
point seven kilos to start with means
she's<00:04:18.470> lost<00:04:18.650> over<00:04:18.799> half<00:04:18.980> her<00:04:19.489> body<00:04:19.670> weight<00:04:19.850> in

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
she's lost over half her body weight in

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.290 
she's lost over half her body weight in
pass<00:04:20.870> which<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:22.250> was<00:04:22.490> crazy<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.180> she

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
pass which is it was crazy so she

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.360 
pass which is it was crazy so she
probably<00:04:23.480> feels<00:04:23.840> much<00:04:24.440> lighter<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:25.040> much
