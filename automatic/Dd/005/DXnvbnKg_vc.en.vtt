00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
 very well 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.219
 two 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.910
 if you want to see if there are whales 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.100
 in the movie monsters I perceived the 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.330
 friends michael sheen and sally relive their 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.130
 old days in college and they are 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.770
 marcos auzqui showing us as a 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.380
 single-eyed monster and one thing 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.989
 hairy and gigantic can of some 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.840
 way to become the perfect team 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.910
 of scarers however the ten of 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.160
 Once these guys were not 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 necessarily a scream in the park 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.450
 mike for example was a student 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.370
 pretty hard but too 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.460
 adorable to be taken in 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 serious 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.710

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.590
 frankenstein of fear but his notes 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.629
 they were a complete nightmare only 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.950
 there is an option for them to 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.950
 get your titles 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.619
 they must lead a fraternity full of 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.619
 ships which are as scary as 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.869
 a dirty sponge and win the trophy in 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.600
 scare games if they fail to do so 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.179
 will be reinstated as students of the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.570
 fear if not all your hopes good 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.289
 to graduate he vanishes from this sequel 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.149
 monsters inc combines laughter and laughter 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.640
 monstrous with good lessons about 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.520

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.920
 friends on the other side we see something of 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.770
 somewhat chilling scenes and 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.110
 some visual references to parties 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.569
 of paternity is that they will leave some 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.390
 parents moving their heads from one side
