this<00:00:08.690> is<00:00:08.870> just<00:00:09.049> a<00:00:09.110> quick<00:00:09.290> review<00:00:09.500> for<00:00:09.740> the

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
this is just a quick review for the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.410 
this is just a quick review for the
horican

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.060 

ptoo<00:00:16.900> zoom<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:18.050> on<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.290> screen<00:00:18.619> there<00:00:18.830> so<00:00:18.980> you

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
ptoo zoom in on the screen there so you

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.400 
ptoo zoom in on the screen there so you
can<00:00:19.220> see<00:00:19.430> it<00:00:19.580> hopefully<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.020> you've<00:00:21.140> got<00:00:21.260> your

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
can see it hopefully so you've got your

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.120 
can see it hopefully so you've got your
volts<00:00:21.980> your<00:00:22.310> MC<00:00:23.029> speed<00:00:23.360> you<00:00:23.630> do<00:00:23.810> a<00:00:23.840> cycle<00:00:24.619> time

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
volts your MC speed you do a cycle time

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.200 
volts your MC speed you do a cycle time
and<00:00:25.490> then<00:00:26.390> that's<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.990> B<00:00:27.110> which<00:00:27.290> is<00:00:27.439> stopwatch

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
and then that's the B which is stopwatch

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.650 
and then that's the B which is stopwatch
so<00:00:29.210> I'll<00:00:29.930> just<00:00:30.110> take<00:00:30.320> you<00:00:30.410> from<00:00:30.560> these<00:00:30.860> buttons

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
so I'll just take you from these buttons

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.760 
so I'll just take you from these buttons
obviously<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:32.900> got<00:00:33.050> your<00:00:33.080> stopwatch<00:00:33.350> here

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
obviously you got your stopwatch here

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.410 
obviously you got your stopwatch here
which<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.070> on<00:00:34.220> there<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:34.699> tattooing<00:00:35.210> just

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
which is on there and you tattooing just

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.040 
which is on there and you tattooing just
hit<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:37.239> there<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:38.360> go<00:00:38.540> that's<00:00:38.780> that's

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
hit that and there you go that's that's

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.350 
hit that and there you go that's that's
cloudy<00:00:39.379> no<00:00:39.620> press<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.070> again<00:00:40.220> to<00:00:40.250> stop<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.790> hold

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
cloudy no press it again to stop it hold

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.820 
cloudy no press it again to stop it hold
it<00:00:41.510> in<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.750> reset<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:45.260> obviously<00:00:45.559> you've<00:00:45.800> got

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
it in to reset and obviously you've got

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.009 
it in to reset and obviously you've got
your<00:00:46.100> LMS<00:00:46.699> for<00:00:46.970> liner<00:00:47.210> shader<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:47.900> can

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
your LMS for liner shader so you can

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.280 
your LMS for liner shader so you can
have<00:00:48.110> two<00:00:48.290> presets<00:00:48.860> on<00:00:49.010> here<00:00:49.159> so<00:00:49.870> alpha<00:00:50.870> liner

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
have two presets on here so alpha liner

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.229 
have two presets on here so alpha liner
then<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:52.010> flips<00:00:52.220> that<00:00:52.489> says<00:00:52.670> line<00:00:52.909> on<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
then it flips that says line on the

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.110 
then it flips that says line on the
screen<00:00:53.360> obviously<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.890> volts<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.820> you

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
screen obviously and the volts and you

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.380 
screen obviously and the volts and you
can<00:00:56.299> input<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.019> vault<00:00:57.549> if<00:00:58.549> you<00:00:58.760> want<00:00:58.970> up<00:00:59.180> or

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
can input the vault if you want up or

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.030 
can input the vault if you want up or
down<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.379> then<00:01:01.309> that<00:01:01.489> I'll<00:01:01.640> just<00:01:01.850> save<00:01:02.360> it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
down and then that I'll just save it

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.110 
down and then that I'll just save it
under<00:01:04.040> there<00:01:04.190> even<00:01:04.460> if<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.610> want<00:01:04.790> plugins

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
under there even if you want plugins

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.399 
under there even if you want plugins
which<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:05.420> back<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.750> they'll<00:01:05.900> still<00:01:06.170> save

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
which you back on they'll still save

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.390 
which you back on they'll still save
those<00:01:06.619> volts<00:01:06.979> for<00:01:07.130> you

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
those volts for you

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.520 
those volts for you
and<00:01:07.490> then<00:01:08.150> obviously<00:01:08.500> deflector<00:01:09.500> shader<00:01:11.530> see

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
and then obviously deflector shader see

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.870 
and then obviously deflector shader see
that's<00:01:12.740> what<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.070> shader<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.610> vaults

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
that's what the shader and the vaults

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.120 
that's what the shader and the vaults
have<00:01:14.000> changed<00:01:14.360> again<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:17.740> really<00:01:18.740> simple

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
have changed again and really simple

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.099 
have changed again and really simple
controls<00:01:19.640> down<00:01:19.880> near<00:01:20.149> inputs<00:01:20.719> we've<00:01:20.990> got

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
controls down near inputs we've got

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.920 
controls down near inputs we've got
power<00:01:21.670> obviously<00:01:22.670> power<00:01:22.850> supply<00:01:23.270> machine

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
power obviously power supply machine

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.529 
power obviously power supply machine
pedal<00:01:24.799> receiver<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:27.549> this<00:01:28.549> machine<00:01:29.000> this

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
pedal receiver and this machine this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.429 
pedal receiver and this machine this
power<00:01:29.780> pack<00:01:30.020> comes<00:01:30.259> with<00:01:30.670> suction<00:01:32.439> bottoms

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
power pack comes with suction bottoms

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.679 
power pack comes with suction bottoms
and<00:01:33.829> it<00:01:34.039> also<00:01:34.189> comes<00:01:34.490> with<00:01:34.640> these<00:01:34.850> magnets<00:01:35.450> and

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
and it also comes with these magnets and

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.730 
and it also comes with these magnets and
these<00:01:35.929> magnets<00:01:36.469> are<00:01:36.619> really<00:01:37.399> really<00:01:38.090> strong

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740
