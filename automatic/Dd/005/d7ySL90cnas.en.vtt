00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
a shampooed and conditioned but when you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.350 
a shampooed and conditioned but when you
read<00:02:12.450> wet<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> hair

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
read wet the hair

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.390 
read wet the hair
it<00:02:13.600> goes<00:02:13.840> back<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.410> strong<00:02:14.800> chemical

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
it goes back to that strong chemical

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.760 
it goes back to that strong chemical
smell<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.360> did<00:02:16.630> some<00:02:16.840> research<00:02:17.020> because<00:02:17.620> I'd

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
smell so I did some research because I'd

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.770 
smell so I did some research because I'd
rather<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.340> corn<00:02:18.610> chip<00:02:18.850> smelling<00:02:19.330> than

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
rather have the corn chip smelling than

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.570 
rather have the corn chip smelling than
the<00:02:20.140> chemical<00:02:20.350> smell<00:02:20.740> because<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> corn

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the chemical smell because the corn

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.220 
the chemical smell because the corn
chips<00:02:21.610> smell<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.360> know<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.840> wash<00:02:22.990> that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
chips smell you know you can wash that

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.040 
chips smell you know you can wash that
out<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:24.190> chemical<00:02:24.700> smell<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.240> really<00:02:25.270> hard<00:02:25.870> to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
out the chemical smell is really hard to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.590 
out the chemical smell is really hard to
get<00:02:26.170> rid<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.640> did<00:02:27.880> research<00:02:27.910> trying<00:02:28.540> to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
get rid of so I did research trying to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.500 
get rid of so I did research trying to
figure<00:02:28.750> out<00:02:29.050> why<00:02:29.640> we<00:02:30.640> get<00:02:30.820> this<00:02:30.970> chemical

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
figure out why we get this chemical

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.330 
figure out why we get this chemical
smell<00:02:31.810> with<00:02:32.080> some<00:02:32.290> virgin<00:02:32.680> head<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.190> we're

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
smell with some virgin head that we're

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.160 
smell with some virgin head that we're
purchasing<00:02:33.820> and<00:02:34.120> usually<00:02:34.570> when<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.870> coming

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170

directly from the vendor I'm like the

the ones that usually have that strong
chemical<00:02:42.160> smell<00:02:42.190> because<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:42.910> hasn't<00:02:43.390> been

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
chemical smell because it hasn't been

processed as far as shampooing like most

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.370 
processed as far as shampooing like most
of<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.459> resellers<00:02:49.270> do<00:02:49.480> they<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:50.260> know

shampoo and conditioner hair before they

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.390 
shampoo and conditioner hair before they
send<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:53.410> customers<00:02:54.010> when<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.280> go

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
send it to that customers when you go

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.190 
send it to that customers when you go
straight<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.150> wholesaler<00:02:55.660> or<00:02:55.930> straight

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
straight to the wholesaler or straight

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.050 
straight to the wholesaler or straight
to<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.410> manufacturer<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:57.970> this

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
to the manufacturer you get this

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.020 
to the manufacturer you get this
chemical<00:02:58.390> smell<00:02:59.250> so<00:03:00.250> my<00:03:00.880> research<00:03:01.120> shows<00:03:01.810> that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
chemical smell so my research shows that

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.600 
chemical smell so my research shows that
sound<00:03:04.030> retarded<00:03:04.360> but<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.590> my<00:03:06.010> research<00:03:06.190> I

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
sound retarded but in my research I

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.910 
sound retarded but in my research I
found<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.330> reason<00:03:07.570> we're<00:03:08.530> getting<00:03:08.800> this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
found that the reason we're getting this

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.080 
found that the reason we're getting this
strong<00:03:09.310> chemical<00:03:09.880> smell<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.450> because<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
strong chemical smell is because the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.030 
strong chemical smell is because the
manufacturers<00:03:13.090> are<00:03:13.330> spraying<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.500> hair<00:03:14.770> or

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
manufacturers are spraying the hair or

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.820 
manufacturers are spraying the hair or
dipping<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.700> hair<00:03:15.970> or<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.590> however<00:03:17.590> they're

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
dipping the hair or just however they're

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.160 
dipping the hair or just however they're
getting<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.220> into<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.640> hair<00:03:19.000> they<00:03:19.900> are

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
getting it into the hair they are

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.570 
getting it into the hair they are
getting<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.160> hair<00:03:21.570> I'm<00:03:22.570> spraying<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.230> with

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
getting the hair I'm spraying it with

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.350 
getting the hair I'm spraying it with
pesticides<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:25.500> chemicals<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.590> will<00:03:26.890> kill

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
pesticides and chemicals that will kill

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.380 
pesticides and chemicals that will kill
lice<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:28.989> will<00:03:29.140> kill<00:03:29.549> fly<00:03:30.549> eggs<00:03:30.940> and

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
lice and that will kill fly eggs and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.960 
lice and that will kill fly eggs and
that<00:03:31.510> will<00:03:31.660> kill<00:03:31.989> larvae<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.580> will<00:03:33.730> kill

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
that will kill larvae and that will kill

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.229 
that will kill larvae and that will kill
nets<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:35.019> all<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:36.040> bugs<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.640> we<00:03:36.790> do<00:03:36.970> not

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
nets and all the bugs that we do not

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.110 
nets and all the bugs that we do not
want<00:03:37.299> from<00:03:38.080> China<00:03:38.440> or<00:03:38.920> all<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.310> bugs<00:03:39.519> that<00:03:39.760> we

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
want from China or all the bugs that we

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.100 
want from China or all the bugs that we

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
do not want from overseas so that is why

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.900 
do not want from overseas so that is why
we<00:03:44.320> have<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.530> strong<00:03:45.040> chemical<00:03:45.640> smells

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
we have that strong chemical smells

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.539 
we have that strong chemical smells
because<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:47.260> has<00:03:47.530> been<00:03:47.680> treated<00:03:48.340> with

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
because the has been treated with

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.820 
because the has been treated with
chemicals<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.480> will<00:03:49.780> kill<00:03:50.049> all<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.440> these

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
chemicals that will kill all of these

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.780 
chemicals that will kill all of these
bugs<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.580> that<00:03:51.670> will<00:03:51.880> keep<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.600> hair

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
bugs and that will keep the hair

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.680 
bugs and that will keep the hair
preserved<00:03:54.790> from<00:03:56.400> infestation<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.549> lice<00:03:57.970> and
