00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
price and in doing so you have two

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.910 
price and in doing so you have two
choices<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.210> either<00:01:18.360> buy<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> stock<00:01:19.590> or

second and you know how real life is we

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840 
second and you know how real life is we
never<00:01:30.960> sell<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.710> never<00:01:31.860> buy<00:01:32.130> exactly<00:01:32.460> at<00:01:32.729> the

that's not going to make sense and it's
so<00:03:53.400> counterintuitive<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.440> more<00:03:55.650> you

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
so counterintuitive but the more you

so counterintuitive but the more you
traded<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.940> more<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.329> appreciate<00:03:57.900> it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
traded the the more you appreciate it

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
still in the treat and so at that time

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.839 
still in the treat and so at that time
of<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.409> just<00:04:25.740> because<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.190> gap<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.760> the

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
of that just because of that gap in the

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.900 
of that just because of that gap in the
volatility<00:04:27.510> crash

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
volatility crash

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.230 
volatility crash
in<00:04:28.030> place<00:04:28.240> price<00:04:28.840> he<00:04:29.140> made<00:04:29.610> 6300<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.790> paper

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
in place price he made 6300 on paper

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.810 
in place price he made 6300 on paper
while<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.960> stock<00:04:32.200> was<00:04:32.350> falling<00:04:32.770> now<00:04:33.130> if<00:04:33.520> he

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
while the stock was falling now if he

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.550 
while the stock was falling now if he
stayed<00:04:34.120> in<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.420> which<00:04:34.600> I'm<00:04:34.780> think<00:04:35.020> he<00:04:35.140> did<00:04:35.350> if

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
stayed in it which I'm think he did if

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.440 
stayed in it which I'm think he did if
he<00:04:35.950> stayed<00:04:36.190> in<00:04:36.220> at<00:04:36.430> Pearl<00:04:36.640> exit<00:04:37.060> rules<00:04:37.210> I<00:04:37.420> think

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
he stayed in at Pearl exit rules I think

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.300 
he stayed in at Pearl exit rules I think
he<00:04:37.840> would<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.020> made<00:04:38.140> about<00:04:38.320> 10<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:39.070> 12

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
he would have made about 10 to 12

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.030 
he would have made about 10 to 12
thousand<00:04:39.760> that's<00:04:40.330> what<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:40.990> falling<00:04:41.410> stock<00:04:41.680> now

falling<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.620> way<00:06:02.740> I<00:06:02.770> like<00:06:03.070> to<00:06:03.280> explain<00:06:03.460> it<00:06:03.910> is

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
falling the way I like to explain it is

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.870 
falling the way I like to explain it is
it's<00:06:04.390> like<00:06:04.630> locking<00:06:04.990> in<00:06:05.320> a<00:06:05.410> sales<00:06:05.770> price<00:06:06.160> let's

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
it's like locking in a sales price let's

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.640 
it's like locking in a sales price let's
say<00:06:07.120> you<00:06:07.570> know<00:06:07.690> you<00:06:07.750> knew<00:06:08.080> the<00:06:08.230> stock<00:06:08.470> was

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
say you know you knew the stock was

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.240 
say you know you knew the stock was
going<00:06:08.710> to<00:06:08.980> fall<00:06:09.220> it's<00:06:09.550> at<00:06:10.030> 135<00:06:11.020> so<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:11.680> lock<00:06:12.010> in

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
going to fall it's at 135 so you lock in

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.670 
going to fall it's at 135 so you lock in
that<00:06:12.370> sales<00:06:12.700> price<00:06:13.030> giving<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:14.020> right<00:06:14.320> to

that sales price giving you the right to

the Blues because they have to sell

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.760 
the Blues because they have to sell
their<00:06:21.670> stock<00:06:21.940> at<00:06:22.090> a<00:06:22.150> loss<00:06:22.330> however<00:06:23.110> you<00:06:23.290> have<00:06:23.560> a

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
their stock at a loss however you have a

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.310 
their stock at a loss however you have a
contract<00:06:24.580> that<00:06:24.640> says<00:06:24.760> nobody<00:06:25.540> is<00:06:25.720> trading<00:06:26.260> at

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.320 
contract that says nobody is trading at
90<00:06:26.680> dollars<00:06:26.980> but<00:06:27.220> I<00:06:27.250> still<00:06:27.670> get<00:06:27.910> to<00:06:28.030> sell<00:06:28.240> it

90 dollars but I still get to sell it

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.870 
90 dollars but I still get to sell it
for<00:06:28.450> 135<00:06:28.990> so<00:06:29.620> it's<00:06:29.770> like<00:06:29.890> locking<00:06:30.190> in<00:06:30.460> a<00:06:30.550> sales

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.570 
for 135 so it's like locking in a sales
price<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.570> you<00:06:32.380> know<00:06:32.500> just<00:06:32.980> the<00:06:33.100> rights<00:06:33.370> that
