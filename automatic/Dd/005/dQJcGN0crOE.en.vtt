00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.769
 friends of mister gadgets and welcome not 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.840
 you live on only galaxy s 4 you don't live 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.139
 of only htc one 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.119
 there is also a huge phone market 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.039
 which are called in london low cost 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.189
 and those with a price in excess of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.660
 under $ 250 then you know that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.240
 now they are habitually converted 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.580
 also in euros even if the rate of 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.920
 change is not correct yesterday was 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.170
 published a search 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.940
 I say yesterday for those who see first 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.649
 beat this video 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.730
 a research by abi research that says that 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.620
 in 2018 you think they will even be 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.960
 will even count for 46.8 per 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.390
 one hundred of the market the end phones 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 very low perhaps for this all 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.699
 companies are going to saturate this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.989
 market with many type products 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.510
 different is what i show you is a tiny 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.989
 the euroform of only is called sony xperia 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.979
 and and it is the product that is handling in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.960
 this moment which I demonstrate in position 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.130
 frontal and now I also show to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.619
 goodness of our room on a room 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.920
 this product with a 3 screen 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:26.640
 inches and a half with a size of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:31.670
 320 x 480 pixels has a diagonal of 3.5 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.479
 inches is a density of 165 pixels per 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.689
 inch 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.579
 also supports multi touch with a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.420
 maximum of two fingers also because more 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.829
 easy they would be that we have to do for 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.680
 as for others 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.850
 features has a processor 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.330
 snapdragon from a 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:02:00.860
 jig a5 cortex has a ram memory 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.630
 exactly 512 mega must 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.080
 remember that it has an internal memory from 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.580
 4 gigabytes with 2 gigabytes available 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.289
 user but there is always expansion 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.900
 micro sd indeed let's take a look at that 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.630
 which is under the body like it 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.250
 once said we have over 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.709
 1500 milian battery for 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.800
 the insertion for the sim card and here 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.330
 the coupling for the micro sd that 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.260
 the memory expansion that can be done 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.110
 use up to 32gb 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.410
 let's see the phone up close like 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.930
 we always do on this side you see 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.540
 only and exclusively the connector 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.959
 dedicated micro usb top only 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.890
 to the connection for 3 mm headphones e 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.690
 half this with the button 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.959
 now it's becoming a symbol 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.970
 sony callback is the version 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.650
 Lilliputian license of the big button 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.900
 of ignition which is also found on 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.079
 experia on the top valium 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.470
 rocker and on the lower part instead of the 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.090
 camera button on the part 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.180
 lower there is absolutely nothing 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.280
 on the back only and exclusively beyond 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.660
 al the speaker obviously this is 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.700
 still the inter by a small piece 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.620
 little but concealed talking below and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.780
 then on the back is also the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.000
 camera you see not a flash led and one 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:26.120
 3.5 megapixel camera 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.050
 that makes decent photos but this one 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.170
 phone is easily found online at 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.040
 300 to 149 euros yes 300 three hundred from 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.890
 box with inside 07 there is the sense 149 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.760
 euro is the price you find online is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.610
 for a product we say from dai 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.770
 performance a little contained but of other 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.370
 I sing in short from what he receives not 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.740
 compared to the now market level 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.500
 better see what is also inside the 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:05.620
 pack apart from all my mine 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:09.230
 little bags left around headphones 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.120
 charger and usb cable that all 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.460
 sometimes I ask you who knows what those 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.110
 boxing what to expect 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.940
 find ourselves in the boxes so much now 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.830
 what's inside is that someone there 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.630
 give nothing more you remember one 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.940
 time when the phones had 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.220
 even inside the boxes 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.220
 the cases then even in some 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.500
 cases the supports for the phone the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.440
 desktop charger there is these things 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.060
 that now in the packages you don't 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.040
 they see more I open times I wonder if there 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.720
 the phone will say because I expect it 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.400
 a day when they will tell you another 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.490
 we give it to you in a second box 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.690
 but in fact three inches in short 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.000
 half see a little also the 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:52.160
 operation of some basic functions ho 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.270
 took the evening courier that is 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.210
 always a benchmark you see in short is not 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.260
 very easy for the 1 gig processor 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.080
 be able to support this genre 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.120
 of sites then among other things I must say that it is 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.080
 all in all with a phone like 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.450
 this makes little sense to go to 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.800
 browse the site in its version 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.000
 desktop should go exploit 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.750
 especially for the size of the 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.460
 screen the mobile versions of the various sites 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.650
 internet if it were not sum that courier 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.760
 in some cases it then asks for access to 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.210
 payment 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.560
 as for the other functions there 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.090
 they are all obviously the functions that 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.010
 are available to android including 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.130
 the navigator 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.930
 sure with this screen size 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.890
 it is not easy to succeed in 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.270
 solve all the problems of 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.190
 display in during 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.590
 navigation so I know but maybe it's not the 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.310
 maximum comfort but still time 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.100
 also in this case the telephone from 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.700
 exactly what he asks with 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:05.440
 a very low cost is difficult 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.300
 expect more 1500 milian battery 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.490
 for it is not so much however it is also true 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.970
 that the screen is very small then in 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.160
 reality has a very good yield as far as 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.750
 it concerns the quality in call the audio 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.520
 it's also good on this veil sometimes 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.690
 there are no abysmal differences 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.880
 some phones maybe that have a 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.550
 sound a little metallic or when you do 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.250
 phone reproduce sound so 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.170
 not really pleasant but then line of 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.700
 principle I think they look a little alike 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.600
 all the phones are not these 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.280
 differences that make the void on 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.070
 market regarding reception 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.140
 in the norm I also see in this case 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.690
 motorola and blackberry ahead respect 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.910
 to the others for the rest all in all the 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.890
 other brands are quite level 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.480
 with a surprise attention that concerns 

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:58.050
 instead the samsung galaxy s 4 because mi 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.980
 they say have a reception absolutely 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:03.750
 amazing and we're going to test in 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.940
 coming days but returning to the experia e 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:10.030
 a product told me 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:13.690
 I apologize but maybe great for people 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.340
 old or for maybe for kids from 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.020
 kids who don't have much need 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.390
 if not to call maybe every 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.250
 so much fiddle with the phone 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.890
 for today I see very difficult 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.050
 positioning of a is produced with one 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.290
 3 inch screen and a half if not 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.000
 else because in a price range 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.400
 less than 200 euros you can buy 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.110
 products that are no longer the latest 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.270
 generation who are doing theirs 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.830
 descent phase their descent curve 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.230
 of the price and therefore find anyway 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.150
 larger screens and more products 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.910
 complete even at a great price 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.860
 competitive and therefore we say that this 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:53.260
 it is more an informative note you don't know 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.920
 that there is the xperia sony and if you own 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.360
 I must tell you 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.460
 it's not that I've been a few nights 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.210
 sleepless to wait for her to arrive 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:04.410
 but this box is nice to know 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.410
 that there is hello
