place<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> them<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:51.060> rows<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.540> them

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
place two of them or two rows of them

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.840 
place two of them or two rows of them
like<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.670> road<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
like this as you can see this the road I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
like this as you can see this the road I
want<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.899> three<00:01:55.320> blocks<00:01:55.530> wide

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
want to have here is three blocks wide

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.940 
want to have here is three blocks wide
like<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> irregular<00:01:57.479> roads<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.500> server<00:01:58.740> or

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
like the irregular roads on my server or

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.870 
like the irregular roads on my server or
at<00:01:59.070> least<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.399> my<00:01:59.430> city<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:01.159> then<00:02:02.159> take<00:02:02.520> stone

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
at least in my city and then take stone

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.510 
at least in my city and then take stone
slabs<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.719> place<00:02:04.380> them<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> way<00:02:05.070> across

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
slabs and place them all the way across

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.529 
slabs and place them all the way across
here<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.790> two<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.840> two<00:02:07.350> makes<00:02:07.829> four<00:02:08.000> -<00:02:09.000> yes

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
here so two and two makes four - yes

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.190 
here so two and two makes four - yes
this<00:02:09.840> distance<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.590> five

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
this distance is five

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.699 
this distance is five
long<00:02:12.220> even<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.640> do<00:02:13.849> that<00:02:14.000> with<00:02:14.360> my<00:02:14.709> really

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
long even I can do that with my really

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.000 
long even I can do that with my really
bad<00:02:15.920> math<00:02:16.310> skills<00:02:16.870> okay<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.349> next<00:02:18.500> thing

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
bad math skills okay so the next thing

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.820 
bad math skills okay so the next thing
is<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.310> take<00:02:19.879> well<00:02:20.750> first<00:02:20.959> of<00:02:21.049> all<00:02:21.140> some<00:02:21.349> stone

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
is to take well first of all some stone

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.570 
is to take well first of all some stone
bricks<00:02:22.099> this<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.459> going<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.730> be<00:02:22.909> like<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
bricks this is going to be like the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.789 
bricks this is going to be like the
borders<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.940> bridge<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.620> stone<00:02:27.620> brick

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
borders of the bridge and stone brick

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.149 
borders of the bridge and stone brick
stairs<00:02:27.829> and<00:02:28.430> start<00:02:29.000> here<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.659> then<00:02:29.840> I'm<00:02:29.959> just

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
stairs and start here and then I'm just

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.069 
stairs and start here and then I'm just
just<00:02:31.159> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.340> make<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.670> row<00:02:31.970> all<00:02:32.510> across<00:02:33.019> here

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
just going to make a row all across here

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.170 
just going to make a row all across here
just<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.159> make<00:02:34.280> things<00:02:34.459> easy<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.909> then<00:02:35.030> I'm

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
just to make things easy and then I'm

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.449 
just to make things easy and then I'm
going<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.360> get<00:02:35.480> rid<00:02:35.659> of<00:02:35.720> every<00:02:36.260> second<00:02:36.920> block

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
going to get rid of every second block

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.259 
going to get rid of every second block
so<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> others<00:02:38.060> were<00:02:38.299> just<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.690> build<00:02:39.620> those

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
so the others were just to build those

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.800 
so the others were just to build those
Center<00:02:41.269> three<00:02:41.629> blocks<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.980> that's<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.540> far

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
Center three blocks so that's it so far

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.050 
Center three blocks so that's it so far
and<00:02:45.079> now<00:02:45.620> what<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> want<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.310> do<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.819> take

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
and now what I want to do is to take

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.860 
and now what I want to do is to take
logs<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.079> place<00:02:49.040> them<00:02:49.430> exactly<00:02:49.819> like<00:02:50.299> this<00:02:50.629> so

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
logs and place them exactly like this so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.809 
logs and place them exactly like this so
in<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.500> gaps<00:02:51.709> between<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.190> stone<00:02:52.609> brick

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
in the gaps between the stone brick

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.099 
in the gaps between the stone brick
stairs<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:55.190> an<00:02:55.370> overhang<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.940> one<00:02:56.269> block<00:02:56.599> if

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
stairs with an overhang of one block if

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.039 
stairs with an overhang of one block if
you<00:02:57.260> are<00:02:57.859> counting<00:02:58.519> from<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.000> from<00:02:59.930> the

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
you are counting from the from the

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.660 
you are counting from the from the
corner<00:03:00.349> of<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:02.290> stairs<00:03:03.430> scarce<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.579> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
corner of the the stairs scarce is the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.809 
corner of the the stairs scarce is the
name<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:06.040> down<00:03:07.040> here<00:03:07.250> we're<00:03:07.489> going<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.640> go

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
name and down here we're going to go

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.000 
name and down here we're going to go
down<00:03:08.269> one<00:03:08.750> block<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.290> do<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.500> same<00:03:09.709> thing

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
down one block and do the same thing

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.599 
down one block and do the same thing
here<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.670> then<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.989> all<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.440> way<00:03:12.470> across<00:03:13.250> to

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
here and then just all the way across to

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.680 
here and then just all the way across to
the<00:03:13.640> other<00:03:13.819> side<00:03:14.919> repeat<00:03:15.919> that<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:17.480> same

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
the other side repeat that and the same

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.030 
the other side repeat that and the same
thing<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.230> course<00:03:18.260> here<00:03:21.220> okay<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:23.560> now<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.620> want

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
thing of course here okay and now I want

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.449 
thing of course here okay and now I want
to<00:03:25.069> add<00:03:25.220> three<00:03:25.819> logs<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.510> each<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.769> those<00:03:28.069> log

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
to add three logs on each of those log

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.199 
to add three logs on each of those log
loops<00:03:28.989> on<00:03:29.989> top<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.230> each<00:03:30.379> of<00:03:30.560> those<00:03:30.739> logs<00:03:31.209> like

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
loops on top of each of those logs like

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.759 
loops on top of each of those logs like
this<00:03:33.129> then<00:03:34.129> it's<00:03:34.639> more<00:03:34.970> stone<00:03:35.209> brick<00:03:35.419> stairs

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
this then it's more stone brick stairs

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.009 
this then it's more stone brick stairs
here<00:03:36.769> but<00:03:37.760> only<00:03:37.940> in<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.299> middle<00:03:38.540> with<00:03:38.840> these

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
here but only in the middle with these

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.330 
here but only in the middle with these
three<00:03:39.349> and<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:40.370> it's<00:03:40.579> fences<00:03:41.829> between<00:03:42.829> them

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
three and then it's fences between them

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.449 
three and then it's fences between them
and<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.579> is<00:03:44.180> pretty<00:03:44.449> much<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:45.220> basic<00:03:46.220> design

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
and that is pretty much the basic design

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.400 
and that is pretty much the basic design
so<00:03:47.060> I'm<00:03:47.389> going<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.599> repeat<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.900> same<00:03:48.109> thing<00:03:48.319> on

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
so I'm going to repeat the same thing on

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.750 
so I'm going to repeat the same thing on
the<00:03:48.530> other<00:03:48.560> side<00:03:48.769> so<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:49.129> can<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.579> once

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
the other side so you can see it once

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.170 
the other side so you can see it once
more<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.810> we<00:03:51.319> already<00:03:51.919> placed<00:03:52.250> those<00:03:52.549> take

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
more so we already placed those take

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.710 
more so we already placed those take
stone<00:03:53.480> brick<00:03:53.660> stairs<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.290> place<00:03:54.709> them<00:03:55.720> every

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
stone brick stairs and place them every

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.100 
stone brick stairs and place them every
other<00:03:56.840> block<00:03:58.419> like<00:03:59.419> here

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
other block like here

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.650 
other block like here
then<00:04:02.510> three<00:04:03.510> logs<00:04:03.780> on<00:04:04.080> top<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.410> each<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.980> those

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
then three logs on top of each of those

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.910 
then three logs on top of each of those
beams<00:04:08.540> stone<00:04:09.540> brick<00:04:09.720> stairs<00:04:09.750> placed<00:04:10.650> upside

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
beams stone brick stairs placed upside

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.759 
beams stone brick stairs placed upside
down<00:04:11.370> again<00:04:11.730> here<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.870> then<00:04:13.770> fences<00:04:15.739> in<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
down again here and then fences in the

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.160 
down again here and then fences in the
gaps<00:04:17.100> like<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.480> as<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.630> said<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
gaps like this so as I said this is the

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.110 
gaps like this so as I said this is the
basic<00:04:19.650> design<00:04:19.739> now<00:04:20.100> now<00:04:20.579> we<00:04:20.640> want<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> make<00:04:21.030> it

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
basic design now now we want to make it

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.790 
basic design now now we want to make it
a<00:04:21.180> little<00:04:21.299> bit<00:04:21.450> prettier<00:04:21.840> first<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.470> all<00:04:22.620> I'm

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800

going<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.010> start<00:04:23.280> by<00:04:25.310> getting<00:04:26.310> rid<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.490> that

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
going to start by getting rid of that

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.640 
going to start by getting rid of that
and<00:04:26.970> placing<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:28.050> whole<00:04:28.560> row<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.390> oops<00:04:30.390> of<00:04:31.230> stone

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and placing a whole row of oops of stone

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
brick just to stabilize the bridge and

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.120 
brick just to stabilize the bridge and
here<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.140> want<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.380> go<00:04:37.740> down<00:04:38.010> one<00:04:38.370> block<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:40.130> add

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
here I want to go down one block and add

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.540 
here I want to go down one block and add
that<00:04:41.640> no<00:04:42.030> no<00:04:42.330> right<00:04:42.870> at<00:04:43.800> these<00:04:43.950> places<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.400> want

to add an upside down stair like this

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.990 
to add an upside down stair like this
like<00:04:48.690> here<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.470> same<00:04:50.430> thing<00:04:50.460> on<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:50.970> other

side yeah other side like this okay and
now<00:04:55.200> to<00:04:55.260> cover<00:04:55.590> up<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:56.010> because<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.550> is

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
now to cover up this because this is

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.650 
now to cover up this because this is
looking<00:04:57.060> really<00:04:57.450> really<00:04:57.930> ugly<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.760> start<00:05:00.210> I

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
looking really really ugly so to start I

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.380 
looking really really ugly so to start I
want<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.500> take<00:05:01.710> stone<00:05:02.130> bricks<00:05:02.490> slabs<00:05:02.970> and

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
want to take stone bricks slabs and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.670 
want to take stone bricks slabs and
place<00:05:03.870> them<00:05:04.700> here<00:05:05.700> so<00:05:06.300> one<00:05:06.960> block<00:05:07.169> set<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.560> the

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
place them here so one block set to the

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.830 
place them here so one block set to the
inside<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.370> here<00:05:09.180> as<00:05:09.300> well<00:05:09.540> on<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.810> other

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
inside and here as well on the other

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.880 
inside and here as well on the other
side<00:05:11.180> then<00:05:12.180> stone<00:05:12.510> brick<00:05:12.750> blocks<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.770> the

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
side then stone brick blocks to the

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.740 
side then stone brick blocks to the
outside

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
outside

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.210 
outside
then<00:05:16.750> stone<00:05:17.050> brick<00:05:17.260> stairs<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:19.950> then<00:05:20.950> stone

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
then stone brick stairs and then stone

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.340 
then stone brick stairs and then stone
brick<00:05:21.400> blocks<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:21.970> let's<00:05:22.510> take<00:05:22.990> them<00:05:23.110> all<00:05:23.320> the

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
brick blocks and let's take them all the

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.980 
brick blocks and let's take them all the
way<00:05:23.680> down<00:05:23.920> here<00:05:24.490> except<00:05:24.970> for<00:05:25.240> this<00:05:25.540> one<00:05:25.810> I

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
way down here except for this one I

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.130 
way down here except for this one I
think<00:05:26.940> yeah<00:05:27.940> let's<00:05:28.270> just<00:05:28.450> end<00:05:28.720> them<00:05:28.930> right

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
think yeah let's just end them right

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.100 
think yeah let's just end them right
here<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:29.830> let's<00:05:30.010> replace<00:05:30.880> this<00:05:31.210> lower<00:05:31.780> block

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
here so let's replace this lower block

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.020 
here so let's replace this lower block
with<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.410> stone<00:05:32.680> bricks<00:05:32.950> let<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.730> stair

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
with a stone bricks let that stair

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.680 
with a stone bricks let that stair
placed<00:05:34.480> upside<00:05:34.720> down<00:05:35.130> otherwise<00:05:36.130> if<00:05:36.460> you<00:05:36.850> draw

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
placed upside down otherwise if you draw

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.790 
placed upside down otherwise if you draw
that<00:05:37.960> line<00:05:38.230> to<00:05:39.010> loot<00:05:39.250> too<00:05:39.850> much<00:05:40.030> down<00:05:40.390> here

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
that line to loot too much down here

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.410 
that line to loot too much down here
it'll<00:05:41.800> probably<00:05:42.250> look<00:05:42.610> weird<00:05:42.970> because<00:05:43.180> the

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
it'll probably look weird because the

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.530 
it'll probably look weird because the
bridge<00:05:43.630> is<00:05:43.660> relatively<00:05:44.620> small<00:05:45.070> and<00:05:45.390> yeah<00:05:46.390> that

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
bridge is relatively small and yeah that

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.270 
bridge is relatively small and yeah that
would<00:05:46.660> wind<00:05:46.900> up<00:05:46.990> just<00:05:47.410> being<00:05:49.050> mad<00:05:50.100> that<00:05:51.100> would

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
would wind up just being mad that would

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.540 
would wind up just being mad that would
be<00:05:51.430> madness<00:05:53.220> okay<00:05:54.690> so<00:05:55.690> that<00:05:56.230> is<00:05:56.410> it<00:05:56.800> so<00:05:57.070> far<00:05:57.370> and

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
be madness okay so that is it so far and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.260 
be madness okay so that is it so far and
now<00:05:58.420> more<00:05:58.960> stone<00:05:59.410> bricks<00:05:59.710> to<00:06:00.400> to<00:06:01.060> up<00:06:01.240> here<00:06:01.510> and

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
now more stone bricks to to up here and

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.600 
now more stone bricks to to up here and
then<00:06:04.270> I'm<00:06:04.510> gonna<00:06:04.930> take<00:06:05.260> cobblestone<00:06:06.130> slabs<00:06:06.280> to

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
then I'm gonna take cobblestone slabs to

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.870 
then I'm gonna take cobblestone slabs to
bring<00:06:06.850> in<00:06:07.060> not<00:06:07.780> color<00:06:08.170> but<00:06:08.710> I<00:06:08.740> always<00:06:09.400> tend<00:06:09.670> to

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
bring in not color but I always tend to

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.520 
bring in not color but I always tend to
say<00:06:10.180> that<00:06:10.390> it's<00:06:10.540> color<00:06:10.840> because<00:06:11.260> it's<00:06:11.440> a

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
say that it's color because it's a

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.230 
say that it's color because it's a
different<00:06:11.830> simply<00:06:12.490> a<00:06:12.550> different<00:06:12.880> kind<00:06:13.120> of

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
different simply a different kind of

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.940 
different simply a different kind of
greyish<00:06:14.730> color<00:06:15.730> so<00:06:16.510> I'm<00:06:16.720> gonna<00:06:16.870> place<00:06:17.500> them<00:06:17.710> as

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
greyish color so I'm gonna place them as

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.470 
greyish color so I'm gonna place them as
top<00:06:18.400> slabs<00:06:18.730> oops<00:06:19.420> as<00:06:19.810> top<00:06:20.140> slabs<00:06:20.650> as<00:06:20.950> I<00:06:21.190> said

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
top slabs oops as top slabs as I said

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.990 
top slabs oops as top slabs as I said
right<00:06:22.480> here<00:06:23.170> in<00:06:23.290> these<00:06:23.440> positions<00:06:23.740> that<00:06:24.220> way

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
right here in these positions that way

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.570 
right here in these positions that way
we<00:06:25.180> simply<00:06:25.780> bring<00:06:25.900> in<00:06:26.380> a<00:06:26.740> little<00:06:27.040> bit<00:06:27.130> more

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
we simply bring in a little bit more

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.830 
we simply bring in a little bit more
variety<00:06:27.760> of<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:29.200> materials<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:30.300> now<00:06:31.300> it

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
variety of the materials and now it

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.480 
variety of the materials and now it
starts<00:06:32.170> to<00:06:32.560> look<00:06:32.910> kind<00:06:33.910> of<00:06:34.030> good<00:06:34.210> and<00:06:35.490> yeah

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
starts to look kind of good and yeah

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.670 
starts to look kind of good and yeah
that's<00:06:37.000> just<00:06:37.300> good<00:06:37.870> timing<00:06:38.110> because<00:06:38.290> we<00:06:38.590> are

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
that's just good timing because we are

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.920 
that's just good timing because we are
almost<00:06:38.890> done<00:06:39.640> so<00:06:40.060> I'm<00:06:40.090> just<00:06:40.390> going<00:06:40.540> to<00:06:40.570> take<00:06:40.780> a

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930

that

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.719 
that
okay<00:07:02.740> no<00:07:02.889> no<00:07:04.020> oops

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 
okay no no oops

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.420 
okay no no oops
that<00:07:06.729> was<00:07:06.819> too<00:07:07.030> much<00:07:07.539> unfortunately<00:07:08.469> yeah<00:07:09.189> and

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430 
that was too much unfortunately yeah and

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.360 
that was too much unfortunately yeah and
that<00:07:09.580> is<00:07:09.789> pretty<00:07:10.629> much<00:07:10.749> it<00:07:10.930> already<00:07:11.650> so<00:07:11.979> it's<00:07:12.279> a

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
that is pretty much it already so it's a

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.700 
that is pretty much it already so it's a
pretty<00:07:12.759> simple<00:07:13.060> design<00:07:13.389> even<00:07:14.020> though<00:07:14.379> it

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710 
pretty simple design even though it

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.390 
pretty simple design even though it
looks<00:07:15.009> kind<00:07:15.460> of<00:07:15.580> fancy<00:07:15.819> and<00:07:16.439> I<00:07:17.439> simply<00:07:18.189> like

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
looks kind of fancy and I simply like

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.399 
looks kind of fancy and I simply like
the<00:07:18.580> bridge<00:07:18.789> because<00:07:19.210> it's<00:07:19.539> only<00:07:19.870> going<00:07:20.289> up

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:20.409 
the bridge because it's only going up

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:23.519 
the bridge because it's only going up
like<00:07:20.860> half<00:07:21.129> a<00:07:21.219> block<00:07:21.370> here<00:07:21.759> and<00:07:22.139> so<00:07:23.139> you<00:07:23.229> can

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529 
like half a block here and so you can

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:26.550 
like half a block here and so you can
also<00:07:23.710> take<00:07:24.779> transport<00:07:25.779> things<00:07:26.050> across<00:07:26.319> the

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
also take transport things across the

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.459 
also take transport things across the
bridge<00:07:26.740> without<00:07:26.919> worrying<00:07:27.460> that<00:07:27.699> maybe<00:07:28.469> your

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.469 
bridge without worrying that maybe your

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:31.920 
bridge without worrying that maybe your
your<00:07:29.800> cart<00:07:30.129> will<00:07:30.400> fall<00:07:30.909> to<00:07:31.060> the<00:07:31.150> side<00:07:31.330> I<00:07:31.749> don't

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930
