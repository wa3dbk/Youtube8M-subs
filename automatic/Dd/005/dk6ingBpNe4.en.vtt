braces at some point but why spend years

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.130 
braces at some point but why spend years
to<00:00:26.609> straighten<00:00:27.000> their<00:00:27.119> teeth<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> can

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
to straighten their teeth and you can

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.900 
to straighten their teeth and you can
actually<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> few<00:00:28.890> months<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.760> is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
actually do it just a few months this is

actually do it just a few months this is
pretty<00:00:30.119> cool<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:31.080> possible<00:00:31.560> with

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
pretty cool it's actually possible with

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
pretty cool it's actually possible with

here to show us the beautiful results of
fast<00:00:43.950> braces<00:00:44.309> good<00:00:44.430> morning<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> both<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
fast braces good morning to both of you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
fast braces good morning to both of you
good<00:00:45.780> morning<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.500> dr.<00:00:46.770> Smith<00:00:46.950> tell<00:00:47.160> me<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
good morning that so dr. Smith tell me a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
good morning that so dr. Smith tell me a
little<00:00:47.550> bit<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:48.030> fast<00:00:48.660> braces<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> how

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
little bit about fast braces and how

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
little bit about fast braces and how
they<00:00:49.530> differ<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> traditional<00:00:50.340> braces

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
they differ from the traditional braces

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
they differ from the traditional braces
well<00:00:51.719> fast<00:00:51.960> braces<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.500> amazing<00:00:52.980> technology

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
well fast braces are amazing technology

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.400 
well fast braces are amazing technology
that<00:00:53.879> allows<00:00:54.120> children<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.840> adults<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that allows children and adults to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
that allows children and adults to
straighten<00:00:55.739> their<00:00:55.860> teeth<00:00:55.890> quicker<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:57.090> cost

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
straighten their teeth quicker they cost

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
straighten their teeth quicker they cost
less<00:00:57.780> they<00:00:58.350> come<00:00:58.530> with<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.680> lifetime<00:00:58.890> guarantee

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
less they come with a lifetime guarantee

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.580 
less they come with a lifetime guarantee
and<00:00:59.969> there's<00:01:00.359> no<00:01:00.570> more<00:01:00.780> sensitivity<00:01:01.260> than

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and there's no more sensitivity than

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.039 
and there's no more sensitivity than
regular<00:01:01.800> braces<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.719> difference

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
regular braces and so the the difference

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.509 
regular braces and so the the difference
in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> technology<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
in the technology is really that it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.120 
in the technology is really that it
allows<00:01:05.820> us<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:07.409> year<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
allows us to do in one year what it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.250 
allows us to do in one year what it
takes<00:01:08.340> traditional<00:01:08.880> braces<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.540> years<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.110> do

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
takes traditional braces two years to do

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.620 
takes traditional braces two years to do
so<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:11.010> example<00:01:11.070> Laurens<00:01:11.760> case<00:01:12.000> her<00:01:12.299> mom<00:01:12.479> was

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so for example Laurens case her mom was

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
so for example Laurens case her mom was
reminding<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.260> morning<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> they

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
reminding me this morning that they

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
reminding me this morning that they
actually<00:01:14.220> had<00:01:14.369> orthodontist<00:01:14.939> tell<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
actually had orthodontist tell them it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.420 
actually had orthodontist tell them it
would<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.600> probably<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.409> three<00:01:16.439> years<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
would be probably two to three years to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
would be probably two to three years to
straighten<00:01:17.790> her<00:01:17.880> teeth<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> range

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
straighten her teeth and be in the range

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
straighten her teeth and be in the range
of<00:01:19.409> five<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.860> eight<00:01:19.979> thousand<00:01:20.430> dollars<00:01:20.759> well

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
of five to eight thousand dollars well

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.940 
of five to eight thousand dollars well
what<00:01:21.420> fast<00:01:21.659> races<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.200> did<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> less<00:01:22.740> than

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
what fast races we did it in less than

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440 
what fast races we did it in less than
nine<00:01:23.189> months<00:01:23.610> she<00:01:23.790> has<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> great<00:01:24.180> bite

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
nine months she has a great bite

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.320 
nine months she has a great bite
straight<00:01:25.170> teeth<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.580> was<00:01:26.700> about<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.939> forty

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
straight teeth and it was about a forty

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.880 
straight teeth and it was about a forty
five<00:01:27.450> hundred<00:01:27.840> dollar<00:01:27.990> case<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.500> save<00:01:28.710> them

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
five hundred dollar case so save them

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
five hundred dollar case so save them
thousands<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.549> dollars<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:30.119> well<00:01:30.270> so

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
thousands of dollars as well so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330 
thousands of dollars as well so
literally<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> guess<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.130> more

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
literally like I guess a little more

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.580 
literally like I guess a little more
than<00:01:32.490> half<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> price<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.420> little<00:01:33.990> less<00:01:34.290> than

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
than half the price a little less than

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
than half the price a little less than
half<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.829> time<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.670> she<00:01:35.700> was<00:01:35.939> being<00:01:36.150> that

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
half the time that she was being that

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.580 
half the time that she was being that
hurt<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.750> her<00:01:36.840> mom<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.170> talking<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> be

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
hurt you know her mom was talking to be

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.080 
hurt you know her mom was talking to be
before<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> show<00:01:38.100> couldn't<00:01:38.579> believe<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
before the show couldn't believe it I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.370 
before the show couldn't believe it I
mean<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.270> seemed<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> no-brainer<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
mean it seemed like a no-brainer and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.899 
mean it seemed like a no-brainer and
Lori<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.950> got<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.280> before<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.610> after

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
sounds like it's worth it doctor I have

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.990 
sounds like it's worth it doctor I have
to<00:02:28.530> think<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:29.010> had<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.520> have<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.849> think

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
to think I had just have to think

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.370 
to think I had just have to think
logically<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:30.840> you're<00:02:30.959> moving<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
logically that if you're moving the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.160 
logically that if you're moving the
teeth<00:02:31.640> twice<00:02:32.640> as<00:02:32.970> fast<00:02:33.209> or<00:02:33.420> even<00:02:33.630> more<00:02:33.780> rapidly

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
teeth twice as fast or even more rapidly

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.259 
teeth twice as fast or even more rapidly
than<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.530> traditional<00:02:34.769> braces<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.730> there's

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
than the traditional braces that there's

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.030 
than the traditional braces that there's
got<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.599> be<00:02:36.630> an<00:02:36.900> added<00:02:37.260> element<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.650> pain<00:02:37.830> but

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
got to be an added element of pain but

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.080 
got to be an added element of pain but
it<00:02:38.099> sounds<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.489> that's<00:02:38.640> not<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.970> deal

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
it sounds like that's not the deal

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.470 
it sounds like that's not the deal
there's<00:02:39.480> really<00:02:39.630> not<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:42.150> doesn't

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
there's really not and it it doesn't

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.699 
there's really not and it it doesn't
mean<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> has<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.410> more<00:02:43.560> sensitive

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
mean that it has to be more sensitive

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.070 
mean that it has to be more sensitive
just<00:02:44.130> because<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:44.580> faster<00:02:44.819> if<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.840> look<00:02:45.989> at

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
just because it's faster if you look at

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.449 
just because it's faster if you look at
her<00:02:46.170> before<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.530> afters<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> big

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
her before and afters one of the big

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.759 
her before and afters one of the big
things<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.970> Lauren<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:48.569> her<00:02:48.720> bite<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.380> she

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
things with Lauren was her bite and she

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.020 
things with Lauren was her bite and she
actually<00:02:49.860> had<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.489> almost<00:02:50.670> laid<00:02:50.910> on

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
actually had a to that almost laid on

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.539 
actually had a to that almost laid on
its<00:02:51.209> side<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.380> we<00:02:52.470> were<00:02:52.590> able<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.920> upright<00:02:53.400> it

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
its side and we were able to upright it

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.699 
its side and we were able to upright it
that's<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.850> major<00:02:54.060> movement<00:02:54.810> with<00:02:54.989> braces<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that's a major movement with braces and

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.620 
that's a major movement with braces and
she<00:02:56.069> had<00:02:56.250> she<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.819> say<00:02:57.060> she<00:02:57.269> had<00:02:57.360> less

she had she can say she had less

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.089 
she had she can say she had less
sensitivity<00:02:58.080> than<00:02:58.380> what<00:02:58.530> her<00:02:58.620> friends<00:02:58.830> are

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
sensitivity than what her friends are
