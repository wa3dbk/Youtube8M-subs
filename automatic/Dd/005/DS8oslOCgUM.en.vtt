money<00:00:10.650> on<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.070> project<00:00:11.389> so<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> decided<00:00:12.960> to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
money on this project so I decided to

to<00:00:25.500> turn<00:00:25.710> about<00:00:25.949> three<00:00:26.369> rpm<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.330> should<00:00:27.599> be

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
to turn about three rpm so it should be

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:43.340 
to turn about three rpm so it should be
perfect<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.260> project<00:00:41.870> do<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> couple<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
drive wheel to the little motor all I

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
drive wheel to the little motor all I
did<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.770> drill<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> hole<00:00:47.340> through<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.879> tea<00:00:48.210> nut

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
did was drill a hole through a tea nut

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
did was drill a hole through a tea nut
and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.469> able<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.710> thread<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and then I was able to thread and a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
and then I was able to thread and a
number<00:00:51.149> eight<00:00:51.360> bolt<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.989> hold<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.559> place

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
number eight bolt to hold that in place

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.670 
number eight bolt to hold that in place
and<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.610> 5/16<00:00:54.300> bolt<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.870> act<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and then a 5/16 bolt will act as the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.099 
and then a 5/16 bolt will act as the
drive<00:00:56.010> wheel<00:00:56.280> axle<00:00:59.600> next<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.690> put<00:01:00.960> some

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
drive wheel axle next I just put some

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.439 
drive wheel axle next I just put some

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
I think the rear axle I'm going to make

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.010 
I think the rear axle I'm going to make
two<00:01:16.350> inches<00:01:16.650> wide<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.150> front<00:01:18.600> axle<00:01:18.900> which

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
two inches wide but the front axle which

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
two inches wide but the front axle which
will<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> drive<00:01:19.619> axle<00:01:20.189> has<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> about<00:01:21.090> 4

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
will be a drive axle has to be about 4

inches<00:01:21.689> wide<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.350> end<00:01:22.590> house<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.520> motor<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
inches wide a one end house the motor so

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
inches wide a one end house the motor so
I<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.720> ran<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.080> taper<00:01:25.350> Santa<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> make<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189

the<00:02:23.080> wing<00:02:23.170> nut<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.640> next<00:02:36.850> thing<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.030> need<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.209> do

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the wing nut the next thing I need to do

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.660 
the wing nut the next thing I need to do
is<00:02:37.570> build<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.900> motor<00:02:38.109> mount<00:02:38.350> all<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.250> did<00:02:39.519> was

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
is build a motor mount all I did was

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.819 
is build a motor mount all I did was
take<00:02:39.790> two<00:02:40.000> pieces<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.480> 3/4<00:02:40.900> plywood<00:02:41.140> sandwich

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
take two pieces of 3/4 plywood sandwich

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.560 
take two pieces of 3/4 plywood sandwich
together<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.519> drill<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.940> 2<00:02:43.120> inch<00:02:43.299> hole

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
together and drill the 2 inch hole

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.199 
together and drill the 2 inch hole
through<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.109> this<00:02:44.920> would<00:02:45.160> allow<00:02:45.430> my<00:02:45.760> motor<00:02:46.000> be

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
through it this would allow my motor be

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.250 
through it this would allow my motor be
recessed<00:02:46.690> in

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.390 

that<00:02:53.260> was<00:02:53.379> just<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.620> matter<00:02:53.769> of<00:02:53.860> marking<00:02:54.280> where

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
that was just a matter of marking where

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.890 
that was just a matter of marking where
the<00:02:54.430> screw<00:02:54.819> holes<00:02:55.030> are<00:02:55.180> going<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.329> be<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
the screw holes are going to be and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.750 
the screw holes are going to be and
cutting<00:02:56.439> a<00:02:56.530> relief<00:02:56.860> cut<00:02:57.159> so<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> can<00:02:57.610> easily

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
cutting a relief cut so I can easily

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.520 
cutting a relief cut so I can easily
feed<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.239> wire<00:02:58.420> trip<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.959> then<00:03:02.049> pre-drilled

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
feed the wire trip and then pre-drilled

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.199 
feed the wire trip and then pre-drilled
holes<00:03:02.799> for<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.159> little<00:03:03.340> screws<00:03:03.640> will<00:03:03.879> hold

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
holes for the little screws will hold

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.940 
holes for the little screws will hold
the<00:03:04.329> motor<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.110> mount<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:11.349> then<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:11.739> use

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
the motor to the mount and then just use

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.550 
the motor to the mount and then just use
an<00:03:12.159> inch<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.579> a<00:03:12.609> half<00:03:12.640> door<00:03:13.269> hinge<00:03:13.689> to<00:03:14.230> mount

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
an inch and a half door hinge to mount

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:31.729 
an inch and a half door hinge to mount
the<00:03:15.519> motor<00:03:16.239> mount<00:03:16.480> itself<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.319> buggy<00:03:17.530> axle

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.319 

so<00:03:32.739> by<00:03:32.859> threading<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.370> 5/16<00:03:34.030> bolt<00:03:34.239> just

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
so by threading in a 5/16 bolt just

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.849 
so by threading in a 5/16 bolt just
wrapping<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.930> little<00:03:35.109> electrical<00:03:35.530> tape<00:03:35.709> around

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
wrapping a little electrical tape around

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.770 
wrapping a little electrical tape around
it<00:03:36.129> that's<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.549> give<00:03:36.670> me<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:37.389> smallest

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
it that's going to give me the smallest

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.199 
it that's going to give me the smallest
drive<00:03:38.230> wheel<00:03:38.530> possible<00:03:39.189> which<00:03:39.879> will<00:03:39.909> in<00:03:40.180> turn

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
drive wheel possible which will in turn

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.500 
drive wheel possible which will in turn
give<00:03:40.629> me<00:03:40.720> my<00:03:40.870> slowest<00:03:41.439> speed<00:03:42.040> possible<00:03:42.790> now<00:03:43.450> I

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
give me my slowest speed possible now I

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.509 
give me my slowest speed possible now I
can<00:03:43.780> increase<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.379> speed<00:03:44.620> by<00:03:44.859> increasing<00:03:45.459> the

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
can increase the speed by increasing the

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.970 
can increase the speed by increasing the
size<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.909> the<00:03:46.030> drive<00:03:46.239> axle<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.290> if<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.769> cut<00:03:47.950> out

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
size of the drive axle so if I cut out

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.050 
size of the drive axle so if I cut out
some<00:03:48.720> ground<00:03:49.720> circles<00:03:50.409> by<00:03:50.889> just<00:03:51.400> using<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.849> hole

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
some ground circles by just using a hole

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.689 
some ground circles by just using a hole
saw<00:03:52.389> and<00:03:52.919> increasing<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.010> size<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.609> can

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
saw and increasing the size I can

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:00.659 
saw and increasing the size I can
increase<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.660> speed<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.319> dolly<00:03:59.639> here<00:04:00.639> I

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
increase the speed of the dolly here I

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.159 
increase the speed of the dolly here I
just<00:04:00.760> put<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.180> an<00:04:01.329> incline<00:04:01.660> just<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.989> see

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
just put it on an incline just to see

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.289 
just put it on an incline just to see
how<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.620> would<00:04:02.799> do<00:04:03.040> when<00:04:03.459> they're<00:04:03.669> slipping<00:04:04.180> it

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
how it would do when they're slipping it

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.879 
how it would do when they're slipping it
seems<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:04.750> be<00:04:04.989> climbing<00:04:05.349> this<00:04:05.440> without<00:04:05.709> any

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
seems to be climbing this without any

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:11.399 
seems to be climbing this without any
issues<00:04:09.359> next<00:04:10.359> for<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.569> cameraman<00:04:10.870> all<00:04:11.139> I<00:04:11.169> did

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
issues next for the cameraman all I did

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.770 
issues next for the cameraman all I did

at the bottom I can screw right into the
t-nut<00:04:27.210> this<00:04:28.210> makes<00:04:28.449> it<00:04:28.630> quite<00:04:28.840> high<00:04:29.199> so<00:04:29.650> I

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
t-nut this makes it quite high so I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.409 
t-nut this makes it quite high so I
don't<00:04:29.919> know<00:04:30.010> if<00:04:30.099> I'm<00:04:30.190> gonna<00:04:30.310> continue<00:04:31.270> with

bit shorter but for the meantime I think

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.139
