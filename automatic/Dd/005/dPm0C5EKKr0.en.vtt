put<00:01:07.750> my<00:01:07.869> mic<00:01:08.049> flat<00:01:08.380> in<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.590> clip<00:01:08.859> I<00:01:09.189> know<00:01:09.429> where

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
put my mic flat in the clip I know where

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.459 
put my mic flat in the clip I know where
that<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:09.909> it's<00:01:10.270> using<00:01:10.479> my<00:01:10.659> stairs<00:01:11.079> but<00:01:11.320> that

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
that is it's using my stairs but that

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:12.690 
that is it's using my stairs but that
would<00:01:11.590> mean<00:01:11.799> that<00:01:11.829> my<00:01:12.070> wedding<00:01:12.310> would<00:01:12.640> be

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
would mean that my wedding would be

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.630 
would mean that my wedding would be
optimally<00:01:13.420> located<00:01:14.140> if<00:01:14.649> I<00:01:14.770> put<00:01:15.009> them<00:01:15.159> about<00:01:15.369> 10

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
optimally located if I put them about 10

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
you know put our weddings there we put

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.830 
you know put our weddings there we put
