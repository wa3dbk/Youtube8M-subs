00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello hello what are the real 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 human ability to endure the cold 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.750
 they are almost limitless ie 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 very very large at least by 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.799
 compared to how civilized live 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.719
 people they absolutely do not use their 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.240
 potential potential is huge 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.189
 potential to temper to endure cold and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.529
 live practically without clothes 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.900
 but let it go to zero degrees 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.650
 to zero degrees okay let in 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.289
 T-shirt live but walk and walk or in 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.930
 light clothes but it is possible and paradox 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.260
 in what it sounds like a sensation like 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.210
 something unreal strange but now 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.370
 the modern world is already full 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.980
 information that this is realistic 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 very many people have proved it in their 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.440
 Of course, there are yogis who create 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.629
 wonders that can and sleep in the snow and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.239
 walking on the coals is understandable but not all 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.590
 understand yoga not everyone believes in it but 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.660
 there is a sport 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.059
 winter swimming is called everyone with 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.879
 childhood accustomed to the fact that sport is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.979
 well sport develops a person like 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.049
 as usual all sport winter swimming but 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.549
 doing this sport people discover 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.470
 yourself such opportunities that you 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.260
 a lot sensational for ordinary 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.299
 people though it is not surprising because ordinary 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880
 people live in greenhouse conditions that is 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.340
 we are like greenhouse plants in greenhouses 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 conditions live since birth and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.869
 do not develop themselves not to exploit their 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.909
 potential but by the laws of nature that not 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 works that is not involved from 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.210
 atrophy let our atrophy 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 cold tolerance 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.890
 naturally so about blue 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.640
 swimming this sport is not 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.939
 rarity 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 I want to show that these are not some gurus 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.140
 quenching only reached perfection 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.509
 many many people winter swimming 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.020
 developed and in Russia very happy by the way 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.750
 many champions because of Russia and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.640
 Canada in Northern Europe in 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.670
 Finland is very very developed and often 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.020
 It is Finland that holds the competition. 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.299
 for people who are doing this winter 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.490
 swimming walrus brushes call it 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.520
 in the order of things to spend in icy water 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.350
 5 minutes is normal 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.349
 on her record of records is about two 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.080
 hours when they swim in the ice pull 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.239
 just cold in ice water so here 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.550
 if a person can basically okay 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.319
 things to train yourself so that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.280
 swim five minutes in cold water 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.519
 ice water 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.590
 how much can he spend outside the water then 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.129
 there is just on the surface he goes 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.150
 long enough on the surface 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.120
 let's say at zero degrees 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.299
 walk walk and if t-shirts something else 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 longer if in light clothes then in general 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.569
 long enough that is a person can 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.130
 bring cold, in principle, not worse 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.950
 animals but at least hairless 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.750
 animals such as cow elephants for example 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.459
 show you some interesting people 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.250
 who are engaged in winter swimming 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.260
 for example, natalya is everything to them swims with 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.380
 white whales are very beautiful photos 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.459
 get it no record with her she spent 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.019
 in ice water 10 minutes 40 seconds 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.220
 water temperature and a half degrees 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.920
 it's just ice water but everything 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.980
 equally indicative of a good example she 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.720
 serves and what's interesting is that she 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.389
 quite recently began to engage 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.750
 far from birth not from a young age 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.150
 and she had cold sickness she 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.880
 she was afraid of cold and still prevailed 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.370
 this and her got such a degree 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.200
 develop your swimming abilities 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.170
 cold water and tolerate cold 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.530
 another interesting person is lewis gordon 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.010
 he set a world record record 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.549
 water temperature minus 1 and 7 degrees 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.680
 minus this at the north pole was he 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.569
 swam at the north pole swam 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.169
 1000 meter kilometer in 18 minutes 50 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.480
 seconds 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.790
 there is an interesting film quality film 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.530
 about his record about how ready he is to sleep 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.680
 carefully prepared spent 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.660
 experiments in ice pools 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.669
 coached myself to be confident 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.859
 that he can do this record 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.049
 commit he generally does a lot 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.599
 winter swimming in the winter 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.910
 places across the land swam always 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.520
 dreamed of conquering the north pole and and 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.370
 a cartoon 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.880
 Elk one more Russian record holder 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.970
 Andrei Sychev set a world record 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:25.270
 swam two kilometers 250 meters in 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.680
 fifty six minutes 56 minutes he spent 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.510
 in ice water 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.100
 that's how people put records 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.950
 who are engaged in winter swimming 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.830
 winter swimming is all real and such 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.410
 Quite a lot of people 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.780
 addicted to winter swimming spend 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.960
 competition and just swimming for 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.270
 lovers it is interesting and very 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.010
 effectively of course from a little 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.960
 age harden children because 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.240
 it is at a very young age 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.360
 functions that allow 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.100
 adapt to the environment 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.410
 for example i'm kut tempered actively very 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.600
 their children from infancy do not even 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.820
 just for osmotic in childhood 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.060
 babies dipping in cold water in 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.360
 icy i like go to bed every day 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.280

 I live now apartment in the summer we always 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.840
 cottage we live but will move this year 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.670
 plan yourself planned year-round 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.370
 I will already live in the country cottage 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.340
 swim necessarily all winter under 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.010
 open air in open water 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.560
 it is much more efficient and more pleasant it 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:33.280
 in general, heaven and earth are incomparable bath 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:37.330
 and when you're in on closed air on 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.460
 fresh air in the pond present 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.560
 bathe it's just awesome 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.540
 Dima just needs to be engaged 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.500
 hardening then summer comes and 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.860
 already all 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.080
 in the summer we will swim long but in 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.240
 ponds too leto beautiful order 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.630
 that you can not spend hours out of the water but 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.300
 until winter you need to develop yourself and 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:02.080
 and this will give us not only the opportunity 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.330
 walk more lightly dressed with less 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.970
 quantity of clothes but the most important thing is 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.490
 huge health gives and cheerfulness 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.280
 just incredible wisdom after 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.140
 swimming in ice water is natural 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.060
 everyone knows who is doing this but 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.550
 health 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.840
 The protective functions of the body are very 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.480
 increased immunity increases 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.940
