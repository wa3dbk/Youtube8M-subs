00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.770
 video is shot for the project of the ladle 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.460
 dot ru 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.010
 Today I will talk about how to install 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.120
 lock and door handle confidently 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.930
 the fact that we already have this cutout 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.920
 will be attention for this we need 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.920
 screwdriver 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.670
 6 books 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.480
 set of door handles 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.320
 directly lock 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.579
 the first step is to insert our cutout lock 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:58.519
 if that doesn't fit the neckline 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:01:01.699
 we increase everything fixed further 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.430
 we take and bag on the handle and insert into 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.800
 grooves 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.580
 This is how it is important for this. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.289
 have to make some effort 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.110
 mean after we hit the slots 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.110
 we twist here 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.939
 empty we screw the screws here we 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 pushed here too screw means 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:40.200
 so further well means next 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 step we insert put it on the handle 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.149
 somehow since downloaded 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.899
 screws 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:57.880
 we check God today we are adjusting 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:02.670
 then divide the lock knob insert 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:08.049
 him in the panel so considering 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.910
 the part was vertically take the second 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:15.900
 Part of the castle looking for a hexagon hole 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.900
 but you need to look down 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.709
 like this 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.320
 take the hexagon and twist this 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.320
 lock to fix it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.680
 check how our lock works if 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:46.200
 walks too tight on a little bit 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.200
 spin now works fine 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.770
 next we can tighten the screws already here 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.770
 me you 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:09.380
 twisted screws take expensive as we see 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:20.420
 the castle has a lot to give 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:32.269
 hex even twist twisted 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:36.940
 check how it works without video 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:39.080
 anyone absolutely willing can collect 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.630
 lock for this does not need to have 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.630
 some supernatural ambassador title
