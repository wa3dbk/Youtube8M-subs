00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
tricky to find the good way so I'm gonna

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
tricky to find the good way so I'm gonna
let<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.770> two<00:00:37.920> ago<00:00:38.130> but<00:00:38.460> um<00:00:38.640> yeah<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> found

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
let one or two ago but um yeah I found

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.960 
let one or two ago but um yeah I found
my<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.080> found<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.680> share<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.460> got<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> scores

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
my I found my share and I got the scores

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.090

but<00:00:42.300> uh<00:00:42.330> I<00:00:42.720> certainly<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.590> easy<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
but uh I certainly not easy right now I

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.380 
but uh I certainly not easy right now I
think<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.340> can<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.580> the<00:00:44.880> conditions<00:00:45.300> will

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
think they can do the conditions will

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.010 
think they can do the conditions will
get<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.540> lot<00:00:45.660> better<00:00:45.810> though<00:00:47.750> heat<00:00:48.750> number<00:00:48.780> 2
