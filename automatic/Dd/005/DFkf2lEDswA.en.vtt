00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
going to be a little bit different than

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.880 
going to be a little bit different than
any<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.659> rubber<00:01:57.810> ones<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> rubber<00:01:58.350> ones

any of the rubber ones the rubber ones
what's<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> advantage<00:01:59.340> it's<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> be

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
what's the advantage it's going to be

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.359 
what's the advantage it's going to be
considerably<00:02:00.659> softer<00:02:01.020> considerably<00:02:02.009> softer

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
considerably softer considerably softer

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
considerably softer considerably softer
than<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> rubber<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> rubbers<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.540> rubber

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
than the rubber the rubbers the rubber

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
than the rubber the rubbers the rubber
ones<00:02:03.960> were<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.409> harder<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> little

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
ones were a little bit harder a little

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.859 
ones were a little bit harder a little
stiffer<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.299> those<00:02:06.450> were<00:02:06.570> installed

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
stiffer so when those were installed

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
stiffer so when those were installed
sometimes<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.590> some<00:02:07.890> toys<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.459> quite<00:02:08.640> go

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
sometimes that some toys don't quite go

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.969 
sometimes that some toys don't quite go
well<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> trunk<00:02:10.049> look<00:02:10.229> more<00:02:10.439> difficult<00:02:10.860> all

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
well the trunk look more difficult all

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.170

going to eliminate that now these are

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.399 
going to eliminate that now these are
all<00:02:14.250> made<00:02:14.519> from<00:02:14.790> original<00:02:15.329> molds<00:02:15.900> yeah<00:02:16.200> these

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
all made from original molds yeah these

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.690 
all made from original molds yeah these
are<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.769> made<00:02:16.890> from<00:02:17.069> original<00:02:17.129> molds

are going to be made from original molds

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.890 
are going to be made from original molds
they're<00:02:17.790> going<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.060> made<00:02:18.209> from<00:02:18.299> copies<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
they're going to be made from copies of

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.300 
they're going to be made from copies of
the<00:02:18.989> original<00:02:19.319> molds<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.680> there's<00:02:20.040> an<00:02:20.189> issue

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the original molds if there's an issue

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.860 
the original molds if there's an issue
there<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:21.120> neat<00:02:21.269> thing<00:02:21.420> about<00:02:21.450> these<00:02:21.810> is

you're going to replace this piece in
here<00:02:38.599> neat<00:02:39.599> thing<00:02:39.780> about<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.409> front

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
here neat thing about these is a front

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.349 
here neat thing about these is a front
and<00:02:41.099> back<00:02:41.159> there's<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.579> piece<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.819> metal<00:02:42.090> that's

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
and back there's a piece of metal that's

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.479 
and back there's a piece of metal that's
been<00:02:42.540> actually<00:02:42.959> formed<00:02:43.889> into<00:02:44.069> there<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
been actually formed into there so you

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.069 
been actually formed into there so you
can<00:02:44.609> go<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> little<00:02:44.819> bend<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.359> of<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.569> and

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
can go a little bend out of that and

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.420 
can go a little bend out of that and
it's<00:02:46.379> going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> contour<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:46.980> everything<00:02:47.340> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it's going to contour it everything you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
it's going to contour it everything you
need<00:02:47.549> you're<00:02:47.670> going<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.849> put<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.090> pins<00:02:48.269> in

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
need you're going to put your pins in

new but when we get these things in we

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.059 
new but when we get these things in we
go<00:03:40.109> ahead<00:03:40.169> and<00:03:40.319> test<00:03:40.500> fit<00:03:40.620> them<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:40.889> check

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
go ahead and test fit them and check

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.589 
go ahead and test fit them and check
them<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.220> make<00:03:41.310> sure<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.669> by<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.150> time<00:03:42.239> you

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
them to make sure that by the time you

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.390

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
and it's going to be a good fit before

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.969 
and it's going to be a good fit before
the<00:03:45.720> other<00:03:45.810> thing<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.139> is<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.470> take<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.829> lot

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
of the guesswork out because there's a

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.330 
of the guesswork out because there's a
lot<00:03:48.569> of<00:03:48.750> little<00:03:48.959> doodads<00:03:49.409> and<00:03:49.590> stuff<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.250> know
