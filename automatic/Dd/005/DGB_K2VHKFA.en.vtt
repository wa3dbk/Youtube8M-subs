00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:12.390
 for death tennis for death at 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.390
 best terrible style slice 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:21.680
 there are many and very good marconi technique 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.680
 they are chatruc windshield wipers 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 look at that chatruc network please 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.910
 I hope you have taken the camera killed 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910
 a mole 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.650
 one equal 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 the brand marks the marconi pike the 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:52.570
 favors 40 equal 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.570
 this was the pique 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.200
 that is 40 equal 40 same we are going to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.420
 explain to people what 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.090
 stewart is there were two brands a good and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.370
 a bad one but the brand when in a 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.460
 serve is longer 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.200
 and marconi frame an amp that you're worth 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.890
 what seemed 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.890
 it's a balloon 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.840
 it's a little overkill 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.570
 of having a row of 6000 types that what 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.980
 they want trumpeted reasons and he has 25 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.350
 recent years images of reconciling the 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.230
 30 and the 40 does not move the legs play 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.160
 very well neither nor roger correct either 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.170
 take out 1540 first break point let's see 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.580
 What does José Chatruc do under a lot of 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.580
 pressure joseph chatruc 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.800
 does not want to go from tactical error to 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.840
 favor 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.110
 good attack by josé chatruc in this great 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.450
 tomorrow in this tennis why is 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.130
 incredible because they are playing this great 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.899
 final 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.430
 of great life story the great 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.330
 life story 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.130
 marconi has a hardware store 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.140
 and gets up every day at 5 the 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.140
 morning hong kong 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.520
 It's a fat lipton 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.600
 we learned fire I want to tell you that it is 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.190
 elector party that I saw in my life since 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:33.060
 1952 nervous in roland garros 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.700
 that a match was going 31 and alfredo that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.700
 there were 630 good forced 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.270
 point of marconi that is reaching 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.090
 high level very clearly in this 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.560
 moment of the match marked marconi nico 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.560
 he is driving in his head 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.300
 before good theater that is impressive 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.000
 By the way, and I think there are two rules 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.990
 basic first and second inland 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.990
 they do not comply 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.120
 no no no he stuck against the fence 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.980
 in this point 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.520
 falconí that applauds I can believe it 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.690
 the point that he lost 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.360
 it can affect a lot psychologically 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.640
 of three equal terrible comeback from 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.110
 josé chatruc 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.550
 with many variants marconi 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.740
 now physically understood 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.890
 mentally that about solid very strong 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.440
 physically 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.910
 I say your match I'm not very 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.209
 surprised with what is happening in 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.209
 instead of 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.000
 43 for chatruc is very similar to the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.250
 final of coria gaudio 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.350
 with all the candies for expenses of 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.450
 half an hour gets us a better handle the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.760
 pressures and chatruc depressions 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.920
 he's used to being used to being 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.000
 televised to play with a lot of public to 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.000
 point it out a lot 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:30.060
 sometimes it 's so important never 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.479
 Rafael Nadal 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.479
 do not 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.560
 the debate was technically talented and 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.629
 stroke technique who is above 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.340
 on the other it took six seconds 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.169
 only in saying that it is a winner 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.289
 families or djellaba to his delight paste the 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.289
 min 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:05.000
 I want to say that from the third 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:09.500
 rally ball I realized I had 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.470
 white technically frame nor the top 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.270
 it's February but I consider 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.780
 which is a great variant that you have in your 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.230
 tennis 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.160
 Marconi and do not move your legs for anything 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.930
 I totally agree with you 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.810
 I hope the guys do not stay 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.210
 technically technically I think that 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.710
 marconi is a little step higher was born 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.810
 with that luck because he did nothing else 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.670
 to have talent from that technique was born with 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.590
 a little bit of talent that obviously 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.060
 he threw away all his life 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.100
 because he has not done any sports many 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.710
 thanks to you and good with this 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.550
 we close this great championship that 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.730
 was tennis for death and suicide 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.730
 see you later
