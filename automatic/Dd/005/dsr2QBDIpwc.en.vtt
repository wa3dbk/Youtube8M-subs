silent<00:00:13.910> hill's<00:00:14.060> theory<00:00:14.330> so<00:00:14.540> I<00:00:14.600> thought<00:00:14.810> I'd<00:00:14.990> do

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
silent hill's theory so I thought I'd do

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.859 
silent hill's theory so I thought I'd do
one<00:00:15.320> small<00:00:15.590> follow-up<00:00:16.550> now<00:00:16.939> everybody

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
one small follow-up now everybody

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.570 
one small follow-up now everybody
thought<00:00:18.110> that<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.500> multiverse<00:00:19.040> theory<00:00:19.369> was

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
thought that the multiverse theory was

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.130 
thought that the multiverse theory was
spot-on<00:00:20.119> but<00:00:20.540> I<00:00:20.570> had<00:00:20.689> a<00:00:20.720> lot<00:00:20.869> of<00:00:20.930> questions

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
spot-on but I had a lot of questions

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.839 
spot-on but I had a lot of questions
about<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.590> gamer<00:00:21.800> theory<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:22.430> you<00:00:22.550> know<00:00:22.610> what

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
about the gamer theory and you know what

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.330 
about the gamer theory and you know what
I<00:00:23.029> agreed<00:00:23.599> seeing<00:00:24.380> everybody's<00:00:24.770> comments<00:00:25.250> and

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
I agreed seeing everybody's comments and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.310 
I agreed seeing everybody's comments and
a<00:00:25.369> lot<00:00:25.489> of<00:00:25.520> the<00:00:25.640> great<00:00:25.820> conversations<00:00:26.540> I<00:00:26.779> have

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
changed my mind and I retract my gamer

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.749 
changed my mind and I retract my gamer
theory<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:29.900> instead<00:00:30.259> I<00:00:30.590> want<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:31.220> pose<00:00:31.430> what<00:00:31.730> I

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
theory and instead I want to pose what I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.080 
theory and instead I want to pose what I
call<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.419> real<00:00:33.050> Silent<00:00:33.980> Hill<00:00:34.160> theory<00:00:34.640> Before

we<00:00:35.120> jump<00:00:35.180> in<00:00:35.480> this<00:00:35.630> theory<00:00:35.899> let's<00:00:36.110> talk<00:00:36.380> about

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
we jump in this theory let's talk about

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.529 
we jump in this theory let's talk about
another<00:00:36.859> horror<00:00:37.160> game<00:00:37.430> which<00:00:37.670> is<00:00:37.850> Alan<00:00:38.300> Wake

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
another horror game which is Alan Wake

another horror game which is Alan Wake
now<00:00:38.960> an<00:00:39.109> Alan<00:00:39.410> Wake<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:39.769> play<00:00:39.980> as<00:00:40.129> an<00:00:40.340> author

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
now an Alan Wake you play as an author

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.330 
now an Alan Wake you play as an author
trapped<00:00:41.329> in<00:00:41.539> a<00:00:41.629> horrific<00:00:41.899> town<00:00:42.530> taken<00:00:43.160> by<00:00:43.309> a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
trapped in a horrific town taken by a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.939 
trapped in a horrific town taken by a
darkness<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.600> darkness<00:00:44.960> doesn't<00:00:45.260> truly<00:00:45.620> have

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
darkness the darkness doesn't truly have

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.340 
darkness the darkness doesn't truly have
an<00:00:46.190> intention<00:00:46.609> it<00:00:47.059> doesn't<00:00:47.329> have<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.449> goal<00:00:47.840> it

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
an intention it doesn't have a goal it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.020 
an intention it doesn't have a goal it
doesn't<00:00:48.649> even<00:00:48.710> have<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.980> form<00:00:49.489> it's<00:00:49.820> not<00:00:49.910> a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
doesn't even have a form it's not a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.900 
doesn't even have a form it's not a
monster<00:00:50.480> instead<00:00:51.230> it's<00:00:51.649> more<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.070> an<00:00:52.190> ideal

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
monster instead it's more of an ideal

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.119 
monster instead it's more of an ideal
but<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.629> only<00:00:53.809> way<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.230> manifest<00:00:54.440> itself

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
but the only way it can manifest itself

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.509 
but the only way it can manifest itself
at<00:00:55.309> all<00:00:55.429> is<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:56.239> possess<00:00:57.010> artists<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.280> be

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
at all is to possess artists and be

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.000 
at all is to possess artists and be
created<00:00:59.210> through<00:00:59.420> their<00:00:59.839> art<00:01:00.199> basically<00:01:00.620> be

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
created through their art basically be

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.509 
created through their art basically be
to<00:01:01.399> be<00:01:01.550> willed<00:01:01.879> into<00:01:02.329> existence<00:01:02.890> by<00:01:03.890> somebody

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
to be willed into existence by somebody
