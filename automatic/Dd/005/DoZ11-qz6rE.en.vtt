00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.860
 the loss of a tooth can generate a series of problems in our mouth 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.300
 if over time they will be aggravated in mallorca or lesser extent 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.949
 during chewing there is an impact of food against 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.949
 drought that can damage the tic generate annoying 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.399
 this makes this function difficult and uncomfortable, so we tend to chew 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.219
 only on the other side causing greater wear of the latter 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.530
 the absence of contacts provoked the mobilization of the attacking clients 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.769
 to the empty space looking for contact with the lost lynx 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.520
 leaning and closing the space 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.140
 in the same way the opposite tooth that looking for the corresponding contact 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.830
 this generalized mobilization can trigger other problems as well 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.130
 interdental contacts become irregular even open facilitating 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.680
 thus the retention of food between the teeth and therefore the appearance of 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.000
 cavities 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.270
 In addition, the new position of the teeth hinders hygiene and generates 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.010
 spaces in which tartar can easily be formed favoring the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.870
 occurrence of periodontitis 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.250
 this is especially serious in the case of the opposite tooth since the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 eruption was excessively decreasing the portion of the country that remains inside 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 of the bone can even present mobility 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.010
 the alteration of the position of the teeth generates numerous contacts 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.230
 undue during chewing by forcing load on them and causing 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.030
 Wear is premature 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.180
 the chewing overload causes in turn a worsening of the state 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.909
 periodontal of the tooth generating more mobility and pain 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.299
 even to put in danger its continuity in the mouth 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.920
 to correct this situation we must not only replace it understands what is missing but 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.420
 also restore the bite ratio to your digital point 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.820
 Forcing us in many cases to perform complex treatments in which 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.849
 We may even need to make complaints from customers that have been most 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.939
 moved 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.519
 for all this it is very important that before the loss of a tooth we do not restore 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.199
 as soon as possible avoiding as much as possible all the problems that 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.849
 May cause
