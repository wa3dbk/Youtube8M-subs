00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
Excel calculate the difference so we'll

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.069 
Excel calculate the difference so we'll
know<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.850> we're<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:45.299> budget<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.960> what

can see it's been relative in that it is

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.700 
can see it's been relative in that it is
actually<00:02:23.580> totaling<00:02:24.210> this<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.900> row<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> goes

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
actually totaling this the row that goes

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.040

along<00:02:25.860> with<00:02:25.980> where<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.340> copied<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.900> see

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
along with where we copied it we can see

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.990
