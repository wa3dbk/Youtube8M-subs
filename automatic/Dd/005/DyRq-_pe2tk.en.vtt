00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.880
 and here it is described and the 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.940
 pathology and children but what 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:31.650
 theoretically possible in fischenthal

 I know that I should oppose it 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.290
 Okay then you could do that with it 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.120
 ensure that the patient on a 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:46.280
 he can pullback on the wound 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.280
 be mobilized and over the cost 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.240
 I also thank you
