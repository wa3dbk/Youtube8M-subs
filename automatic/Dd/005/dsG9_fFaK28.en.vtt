scottsdale arizona we're going to talk a
little<00:00:11.299> bit<00:00:11.510> today<00:00:11.660> about<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:12.349> importance<00:00:12.830> of

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
little bit today about the importance of

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.269 
little bit today about the importance of
block<00:00:13.760> scheduling<00:00:14.360> in<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.960> 8020<00:00:15.590> prints<00:00:15.920> okay

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
block scheduling in the 8020 prints okay

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.689 
block scheduling in the 8020 prints okay
so<00:00:16.640> I<00:00:17.500> know<00:00:18.500> a<00:00:18.590> lot<00:00:18.740> of<00:00:18.800> dust<00:00:19.099> really<00:00:19.490> aren't

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
so I know a lot of dust really aren't

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.310 
so I know a lot of dust really aren't
doing<00:00:19.820> block<00:00:20.150> scheduling<00:00:20.630> why<00:00:20.840> is<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:21.020> such<00:00:21.289> a

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
doing block scheduling why is it such a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.760 
doing block scheduling why is it such a
big<00:00:21.920> thing<00:00:21.949> to<00:00:22.310> you<00:00:22.400> well<00:00:23.080> block<00:00:24.080> scheduling

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
big thing to you well block scheduling

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.700 
big thing to you well block scheduling
gets<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:26.119> immediately<00:00:26.750> gets<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:27.380> what's<00:00:27.619> the

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
gets to immediately gets to what's the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.830 
gets to immediately gets to what's the
highest<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.160> best<00:00:28.250> use<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.519> my<00:00:29.119> time<00:00:29.330> what's

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
highest and best use of my time what's

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.589 
highest and best use of my time what's
the<00:00:29.930> highest<00:00:30.170> and<00:00:30.500> best<00:00:30.619> use<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:30.980> my<00:00:31.599> practices

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
the highest and best use of my practices

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.439 
the highest and best use of my practices
time<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.650> it<00:00:33.949> starts<00:00:34.280> off<00:00:34.460> with<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.000> idea<00:00:35.360> that

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
time so it starts off with the idea that

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.650 
time so it starts off with the idea that
twenty<00:00:36.170> percent<00:00:36.559> of<00:00:37.489> what<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:37.880> do<00:00:38.120> produces

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
twenty percent of what we do produces

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.510 
twenty percent of what we do produces
eighty<00:00:38.840> percent<00:00:39.020> of<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.950> results<00:00:40.340> we<00:00:40.489> have

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
eighty percent of the results we have

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.360 
eighty percent of the results we have
now<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:41.780> is<00:00:42.020> not<00:00:42.260> necessarily<00:00:42.410> true<00:00:43.160> in

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
now this is not necessarily true in

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.639 
now this is not necessarily true in
every<00:00:43.610> kind<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.120> business<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:44.719> every<00:00:45.350> kind<00:00:45.500> of

every kind of business and every kind of

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.049 
every kind of business and every kind of
practice<00:00:46.040> because<00:00:46.399> if<00:00:46.579> we're<00:00:46.760> dealing<00:00:47.030> with

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
practice because if we're dealing with

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.470 
practice because if we're dealing with
the<00:00:47.239> specialist<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:48.219> specialist<00:00:49.219> by

the specialist a specialist by

the specialist a specialist by

theoretically has already eliminated a
lot<00:00:51.590> of<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.010> other<00:00:53.000> things<00:00:53.450> that<00:00:53.750> go<00:00:54.410> on<00:00:54.440> and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
lot of the other things that go on and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.920 
lot of the other things that go on and
its<00:00:55.070> really<00:00:55.309> focusing<00:00:56.000> on<00:00:56.149> doing<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:56.690> which

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
its really focusing on doing that which

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.139 
its really focusing on doing that which
is<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.770> highest<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.219> best<00:00:58.399> use<00:00:58.550> of<00:00:58.670> his<00:00:59.030> or

is in the highest and best use of his or
her<00:00:59.180> time<00:00:59.539> but<00:01:00.320> when<00:01:00.469> we<00:01:00.590> look<00:01:00.800> at<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.070> general

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
her time but when we look at a general

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.910 
her time but when we look at a general
practice<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.329> we<00:01:02.870> look<00:01:03.109> at<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.469> mix<00:01:03.710> of

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
practice and we look at the mix of

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.740 
practice and we look at the mix of
services<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.729> general<00:01:05.119> practice<00:01:05.570> is

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
services that a general practice is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.859 
services that a general practice is
doing<00:01:06.110> having<00:01:06.830> evaluated<00:01:07.750> thousands<00:01:08.750> of

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
doing having evaluated thousands of

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.649 
doing having evaluated thousands of
practices<00:01:09.590> every<00:01:10.430> general<00:01:11.030> practice<00:01:11.510> is

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
practices every general practice is

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.440 
practices every general practice is
doing<00:01:12.020> about<00:01:12.140> eight<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.740> ten<00:01:13.040> things<00:01:13.670> over<00:01:14.270> and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
doing about eight to ten things over and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.219 
doing about eight to ten things over and
over<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.229> over<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:17.030> I've<00:01:17.390> often<00:01:17.600> said<00:01:18.020> you

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
over and over so I've often said you

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.660 
over and over so I've often said you
know<00:01:18.350> if<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:18.530> only<00:01:18.680> do<00:01:18.890> in<00:01:19.009> one<00:01:19.189> day<00:01:19.220> or<00:01:19.369> a

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
know if you only do in one day or a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.830 
know if you only do in one day or a
month<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:20.090> probably<00:01:20.360> doesn't<00:01:20.509> make<00:01:20.659> any

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
month it probably doesn't make any

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.120 
month it probably doesn't make any
difference<00:01:21.020> what<00:01:21.320> you're<00:01:21.470> charging<00:01:21.770> for<00:01:22.100> it

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
difference what you're charging for it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.920 
difference what you're charging for it
but<00:01:22.280> if<00:01:22.340> you're<00:01:22.460> doing<00:01:22.670> 10<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:22.970> month<00:01:23.060> it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
but if you're doing 10 a month it

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.510 
but if you're doing 10 a month it
probably<00:01:24.259> makes<00:01:24.409> a<00:01:24.650> big<00:01:24.920> difference<00:01:25.310> which

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
probably makes a big difference which

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.310 
probably makes a big difference which
because<00:01:26.000> it's<00:01:26.180> consuming<00:01:26.689> more<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:26.960> your<00:01:27.080> time

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
because it's consuming more of your time

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.300 
because it's consuming more of your time
so<00:01:28.189> is<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.970> first<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> 8020<00:01:30.080> gets<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.590> okay<00:01:31.070> if

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
so is you first the 8020 gets to okay if

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.539 
so is you first the 8020 gets to okay if
if<00:01:32.030> twenty<00:01:32.509> percent<00:01:32.900> or<00:01:33.200> ten<00:01:33.770> percent<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.430> what

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
if twenty percent or ten percent of what

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.340 
if twenty percent or ten percent of what
i'm<00:01:34.640> doing<00:01:34.970> is<00:01:35.090> producing<00:01:35.630> eighty<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.079> ninety

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
i'm doing is producing eighty to ninety

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.960 
i'm doing is producing eighty to ninety
percent<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.740> my<00:01:36.860> results<00:01:37.340> why<00:01:37.759> aren't<00:01:37.939> I

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
percent of my results why aren't I

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.170 
percent of my results why aren't I
focusing<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.920> idea<00:01:40.040> block<00:01:40.490> scheduling

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
focusing on so the idea block scheduling

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.120 
focusing on so the idea block scheduling
is<00:01:41.329> something<00:01:41.750> that<00:01:41.990> I've<00:01:42.170> been<00:01:42.409> doing<00:01:42.890> myself

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
is something that I've been doing myself

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.240 
is something that I've been doing myself
and<00:01:43.610> my<00:01:43.700> own<00:01:43.729> practice<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.390> recommending<00:01:45.140> for

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
and my own practice and recommending for

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.340 
and my own practice and recommending for
30-some<00:01:46.250> years<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:47.840> goes<00:01:47.869> something

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
30-some years and so it goes something

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.550 
30-some years and so it goes something
like<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:48.649> my<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.369> work<00:01:49.930> by<00:01:50.930> eight<00:01:51.170> which<00:01:51.409> has

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
like this my a work by eight which has

that mature so when I when you get into
block<00:02:18.890> scheduling<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:20.080> practice<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.950> know<00:02:22.099> you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
block scheduling a practice you know you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.100 
block scheduling a practice you know you
have<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.970> have<00:02:23.120> some<00:02:23.360> ideal<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.959> you're

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
have to have some ideal that you're

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.910 
have to have some ideal that you're
shooting<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:26.000> may<00:02:26.390> put<00:02:26.780> in<00:02:26.959> my<00:02:27.379> ideal

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
shooting and so I may put in my ideal

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.170 
shooting and so I may put in my ideal
because<00:02:28.430> let's<00:02:28.760> say<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:29.090> week<00:02:29.420> from

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
because let's say a week from

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.110 
because let's say a week from
today<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.950> block<00:02:32.280> schedule<00:02:32.849> for<00:02:33.030> that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
today I have a block schedule for that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.399 
today I have a block schedule for that
day<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.450> what<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.569> wanted<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.109> haven't

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
day of what I wanted but if I haven't

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.830 
day of what I wanted but if I haven't
filled<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.890> schedule<00:02:35.489> then<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> week<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.659> can

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
filled that schedule then a week I can

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.899 
filled that schedule then a week I can
break<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.170> down<00:02:37.349> but<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:38.189> don't<00:02:38.250> hold<00:02:38.670> that

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
break it down but if I don't hold that

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.300 
break it down but if I don't hold that
ideal<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.629> what<00:02:39.659> I'm<00:02:39.870> after<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.469> never<00:02:40.859> happens

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
ideal of what I'm after it never happens

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.349 
ideal of what I'm after it never happens
so<00:02:41.909> then<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.329> just<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:42.870> just<00:02:42.930> get<00:02:43.319> busy<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:45.030> may

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
so then I just I just get busy and I may

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.330 
so then I just I just get busy and I may
be<00:02:45.420> busy<00:02:45.750> but<00:02:46.109> I'm<00:02:46.439> not<00:02:46.620> productive<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.310> the

be busy but I'm not productive at the
end<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.670> day<00:02:47.819> I'm<00:02:47.909> worn<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.299> because<00:02:48.689> i'm

it<00:03:22.680> or<00:03:22.829> have<00:03:23.099> someone<00:03:23.400> else<00:03:23.609> do<00:03:23.879> it<00:03:23.909> so<00:03:24.689> it<00:03:25.290> gets

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it or have someone else do it so it gets

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.250 
it or have someone else do it so it gets
to<00:03:25.859> Pareto's<00:03:26.310> principle<00:03:26.969> which<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:28.079> even

out<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.290> ninety<00:03:34.620> eight<00:03:34.709> percent<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:35.159> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
out that ninety eight percent of the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.399 
out that ninety eight percent of the
wealth<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.699> Italy<00:03:36.269> was<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> hands<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.229> two

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
wealth of Italy was in the hands of two

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.670 
wealth of Italy was in the hands of two
percent<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.859> population<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:39.150> wealth<00:03:40.019> like

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
percent of the population so wealth like

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.000 
percent of the population so wealth like
time<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.370> unequally<00:03:41.970> distributed<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.560> it

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
time is unequally distributed so it

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.890 
time is unequally distributed so it
comes<00:03:44.190> back<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.760> have<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.150> say<00:03:45.359> well<00:03:45.629> what's<00:03:45.810> the

over<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.840> block<00:05:14.110> scheduling<00:05:14.650> is<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:15.040> is<00:05:15.460> it

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
over to a block scheduling is it is it

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.510 
over to a block scheduling is it is it
pretty<00:05:15.880> laborious<00:05:16.570> is<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.080> something<00:05:17.320> that

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
pretty laborious is it something that

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.670 
pretty laborious is it something that
isn't<00:05:18.520> difficult<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.210> do<00:05:19.360> i<00:05:19.630> I<00:05:19.750> think<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.410> think

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
isn't difficult to do i I think I think

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.740 
isn't difficult to do i I think I think
it<00:05:20.770> requires<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:21.700> that's<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.060> great<00:05:22.180> question<00:05:22.479> i

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
it requires it that's a great question i

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.440 
it requires it that's a great question i
think<00:05:22.780> you<00:05:23.710> know<00:05:23.800> what<00:05:23.979> when<00:05:24.760> I<00:05:24.790> think<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.210> block

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
think you know what when I think a block

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.190 
think you know what when I think a block
scheduling<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:26.139> I<00:05:26.200> do<00:05:26.260> you<00:05:26.590> know<00:05:26.680> today<00:05:27.070> I

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
scheduling and I do you know today I

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.390 
scheduling and I do you know today I
recommend<00:05:29.200> people<00:05:29.320> block<00:05:29.650> schedule<00:05:30.190> out<00:05:30.340> of

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
recommend people block schedule out of

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.279 
recommend people block schedule out of
their<00:05:30.729> practice<00:05:31.120> as<00:05:31.270> well<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.960> google

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
their practice as well and the google

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.110 
their practice as well and the google
calendar<00:05:32.800> I<00:05:32.949> mean<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.280> sound<00:05:33.520> like<00:05:33.639> I'm<00:05:33.789> saw<00:05:33.970> in

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
calendar I mean it sound like I'm saw in

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.939 
calendar I mean it sound like I'm saw in
google<00:05:34.419> calendar<00:05:34.840> but<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.199> google<00:05:35.530> calendar

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
google calendar but the google calendar

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.189 
google calendar but the google calendar
is<00:05:36.010> phenomenal<00:05:36.580> for<00:05:36.610> them<00:05:36.880> because<00:05:37.690> i<00:05:37.990> can

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
is phenomenal for them because i can

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.620 
is phenomenal for them because i can
schedule<00:05:38.530> part<00:05:39.400> of<00:05:39.520> one<00:05:39.850> part<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.120> my<00:05:40.240> life<00:05:40.450> in

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
schedule part of one part of my life in

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.360 
schedule part of one part of my life in
one<00:05:40.810> color<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.289> can<00:05:41.470> schedule<00:05:41.710> another<00:05:41.860> part<00:05:42.310> of

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
one color I can schedule another part of

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.480 
one color I can schedule another part of
my<00:05:42.460> life<00:05:42.669> in<00:05:42.820> another<00:05:43.090> color<00:05:43.389> and<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:44.650> I'm<00:05:45.130> sure

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
my life in another color and so I'm sure

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.760 
my life in another color and so I'm sure
that<00:05:45.700> it's<00:05:45.820> not<00:05:45.940> overlapping<00:05:46.510> so<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:47.139> first

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
that it's not overlapping so I first

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.640 
that it's not overlapping so I first
have<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.100> really<00:05:48.580> think<00:05:48.610> through<00:05:48.910> what<00:05:49.450> if<00:05:50.410> I'm

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
have to really think through what if I'm

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.409 
have to really think through what if I'm
thinking<00:05:51.010> about<00:05:51.070> my<00:05:51.340> practice<00:05:51.880> I<00:05:52.000> think<00:05:52.330> you

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
thinking about my practice I think you

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.589 
thinking about my practice I think you
know<00:05:52.539> how<00:05:52.870> do<00:05:52.930> i<00:05:53.080> create<00:05:53.229> the<00:05:53.740> most<00:05:53.889> value<00:05:54.599> for

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
know how do i create the most value for

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.810 
know how do i create the most value for
your<00:05:55.720> people<00:05:56.110> in<00:05:56.530> my<00:05:56.830> practice<00:05:57.130> what<00:05:57.700> do<00:05:57.760> I

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
your people in my practice what do I

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.510 
your people in my practice what do I
really<00:05:58.180> love<00:05:58.510> to<00:05:58.750> do<00:05:58.930> what<00:05:59.740> am<00:05:59.860> I<00:05:59.919> reading<00:06:00.160> good

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
really love to do what am I reading good

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.460 
really love to do what am I reading good

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
difficult no but I've got I'm going to

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.180 
difficult no but I've got I'm going to
do<00:06:08.050> that<00:06:08.200> and<00:06:08.380> then<00:06:08.500> I<00:06:08.590> got<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:08.830> figure<00:06:09.010> out

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
do that and then I got to figure out

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.250 
do that and then I got to figure out
what<00:06:09.400> what<00:06:09.639> other<00:06:09.910> things<00:06:10.360> so<00:06:10.630> I<00:06:10.660> need<00:06:10.990> to<00:06:11.139> be

doing so that i can do a and one of the

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.290 
doing so that i can do a and one of the
things<00:06:14.680> I<00:06:14.979> really<00:06:15.010> don't<00:06:15.610> want<00:06:15.789> to<00:06:15.880> do<00:06:16.000> what<00:06:16.240> do

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
things I really don't want to do what do

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.969 
things I really don't want to do what do
I<00:06:16.389> want<00:06:16.510> to<00:06:16.660> delegate<00:06:17.080> what<00:06:17.289> I<00:06:17.320> want<00:06:17.590> to<00:06:17.650> refer

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
I want to delegate what I want to refer

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.240 
I want to delegate what I want to refer
and<00:06:18.580> so<00:06:19.139> what<00:06:20.139> I<00:06:20.169> want<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.470> try<00:06:20.740> to<00:06:20.770> do<00:06:21.039> then

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
and so what I want to try to do then

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
when i do that i'm going to block it and

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.080 
when i do that i'm going to block it and
then<00:06:23.500> it<00:06:23.770> may<00:06:24.010> take<00:06:24.250> a<00:06:24.280> while<00:06:24.550> for<00:06:24.610> that<00:06:24.910> to

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
then it may take a while for that to

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.330 
then it may take a while for that to
really<00:06:25.389> begin<00:06:25.630> to<00:06:25.780> happen<00:06:26.050> but<00:06:26.830> i<00:06:27.039> have<00:06:27.310> to

what I'm going to be putting into those

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.700 
what I'm going to be putting into those
spaces<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:31.420> gradually<00:06:31.990> it<00:06:32.080> fills<00:06:32.320> in<00:06:34.710> Thanks
