 Ambient LED on GIGABYTE X99 Motherboards 

00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:15.405
 On the new X99 motherboards, GIGABYTE introduced a new feature called Ambient LED. 

00:00:15.406 --> 00:00:17.382
 The Ambient LED is basically ... 

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:20.199
 As you can see, we have placed many LEDs on the board 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.364
 Some of them serve a practical purpose, 

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:25.196
 others have purely aesthetic significance. 

00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:28.625
 But of course, as you can see, we have a radiator that has been shining all over September 

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:33.409
 this is the GAMING G1 WiFi motherboard, the X99 GAMING G1 WiFi, 

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.622
 so the radiator is lit, 

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:37.908
 we also have LEDs to mark the path of audio separation 

00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:40.291
 what we had in the previous generation 

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:46.234
 it actually separates the analog part of the board from the digital one 

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:51.053
 and we also have a new convenience, this backlit LED backlit panel. 

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:57.240
 Now I turn off the lighting and show you a variety of unique LED backlight functions. 

00:00:58.532 --> 00:01:01.301
 As you can see, it is quite impressive to look at the plate in the dark. 

00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:05.350
 We have a GAMING G1 logo that shines, that eye here, 

00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:08.294
 There is also an LED audio separation path, as I mentioned 

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:10.454
 and back panel LED backlight. 

00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:13.366
 These are programmed LEDs 

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.113
 We have the app in the GIGABYTE APP Center 

00:01:16.114 --> 00:01:19.265
 which allows various LED functions to be set. 

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:22.391
 First of all, of course, I will introduce Still. 

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:26.026
 Still mode ensures that the LEDs are always on. 

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:29.482
 Another mode I would like to show is Pulse Mode 

00:01:29.647 --> 00:01:35.854
 this will cause the LEDs to breathe, turn on and off slowly, 

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:38.252
 so it's a soothing, soothing effect. 

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:42.740
 And another mode that I would like to show is that Beat mode. 

00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:49.441
 Beat mode allows you to control the LEDs according to the music you are listening to on your computer. 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.339
 Or by sound while playing the game. 

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:55.537
 The first thing I want to show you is the stretch in Battlefield. 

00:01:57.312 --> 00:02:04.965
 As you can see here, various shooting sounds, movement in the game, all this affects the LED's. 

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:14.222
 This causes amazing effects while playing any game 

00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:18.297
 and also while listening to any music. 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.874
 Let me play some music and see that the LEDs are flashing to the rhythm of music ... 

00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:36.047
 OK, that's GIGABYTE Ambient LED, 

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:38.942
 obviously a pretty useful feature 

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:42.860
 for example, if you have a glass cabinet, 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.288
 where LED lighting can be seen 

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:46.865
 and this feature gives you automatic LED lighting. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.400
 Each row of GIGABYTE boards has a different LED backlight color 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.348
 here's the game line, so you have a red topic here 

00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:57.370
 Overclocking series has an orange theme 

00:02:57.417 --> 00:03:00.691
 and the Ultra Durable series will have a yellow theme. 

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:04.557
 And, of course, if you are one of those people who don't like LED lighting, 

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.368
 is a mode called Off. 

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:09.380
 With it you can easily turn off all illuminating LEDs.
