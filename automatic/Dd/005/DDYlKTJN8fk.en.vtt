you don't use paint glasses you have to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.450 
you don't use paint glasses you have to
use<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:35.020> Boston<00:01:35.380> glass<00:01:35.560> that's<00:01:35.920> meant<00:01:36.130> for<00:01:36.220> it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
use a Boston glass that's meant for it

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.090 
use a Boston glass that's meant for it
the<00:01:37.299> first<00:01:37.540> thing<00:01:37.659> you'll<00:01:37.840> do<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.260> led<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:38.950> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
the first thing you'll do is led to the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.160 
the first thing you'll do is led to the
left<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.790> from<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.000> top<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.990> a<00:01:41.080> wee

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
left it from the top just a wee

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.850 
left it from the top just a wee
centimeter

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
centimeter

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.080 
centimeter
until<00:01:42.159> you're<00:01:42.280> comfortable<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:42.820> know<00:01:42.940> how

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
until you're comfortable you know how

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.180 
until you're comfortable you know how
strong<00:01:43.720> you're<00:01:43.869> hitting<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.770> left<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.159> a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
strong you're hitting it just left it a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.560 
strong you're hitting it just left it a
little<00:01:45.220> bit<00:01:45.580> just<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.820> make<00:01:45.850> sure<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.240> vacuum

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
little bit just to make sure the vacuum

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.719 
little bit just to make sure the vacuum
must<00:01:46.690> actually<00:01:46.810> pull<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.290> together<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.460> next

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
must actually pull it together the next

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.430 
must actually pull it together the next
thing<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:49.150> most<00:01:49.330> important<00:01:49.690> thing<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:50.080> to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
thing the most important thing is to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.350 
thing the most important thing is to
turn<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.130> way<00:01:51.250> around<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.850> glass<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.330> a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
turn it that way around the glass is a

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.359 
turn it that way around the glass is a
lot<00:01:52.570> heavier<00:01:52.750> than<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.080> ten<00:01:53.290> so<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.250> glass

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
lot heavier than the ten so the glass

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.130 
lot heavier than the ten so the glass
has<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:54.760> be<00:01:54.850> on<00:01:54.940> top<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.390> gravity<00:01:55.840> will<00:01:55.960> work

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
has to be on top the gravity will work

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.350 
has to be on top the gravity will work
that<00:01:56.320> way<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.710> lot<00:01:56.920> better<00:01:57.130> I'll<00:01:58.060> hold<00:01:58.240> it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
that way a lot better I'll hold it

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.539 
that way a lot better I'll hold it
together<00:01:58.510> and<00:01:58.960> also<00:01:59.500> liquids<00:02:00.070> can<00:02:00.220> fall<00:02:00.400> out

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
together and also liquids can fall out

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.730 
together and also liquids can fall out
if<00:02:00.850> there's<00:02:01.060> anything<00:02:01.270> there<00:02:01.510> whereas<00:02:02.229> any

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
if there's anything there whereas any

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.929 
if there's anything there whereas any
liquid<00:02:03.100> as<00:02:03.189> there<00:02:03.310> are<00:02:03.520> going<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.700> be<00:02:03.760> quite

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
liquid as there are going to be quite

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.630 
liquid as there are going to be quite
rate<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.540> say<00:02:04.689> that<00:02:05.220> next<00:02:06.220> whether<00:02:06.490> you're

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
rate and say that next whether you're

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.669 
rate and say that next whether you're
right<00:02:06.760> or<00:02:06.790> left-handed<00:02:07.420> who<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.750> st.<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.200> which

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
right or left-handed who the st. a which

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.749 
right or left-handed who the st. a which
way<00:02:08.860> you're<00:02:09.009> going<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.190> hold<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.550> I'm

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
way you're going to hold it I'm

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.339 
way you're going to hold it I'm
right-handed<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.780> would<00:02:10.990> have<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> right

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
right-handed so I would have a right

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.809 
right-handed so I would have a right
hand<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.709> glass<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.280> left

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
hand on the glass and left

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.819 
hand on the glass and left
the<00:02:12.969> 10<00:02:13.150> if<00:02:13.360> you're<00:02:13.810> comfortable<00:02:14.349> holding

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
the 10 if you're comfortable holding

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.380 
the 10 if you're comfortable holding
either<00:02:15.010> end<00:02:15.280> or<00:02:15.519> just<00:02:15.939> right<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.269> middle

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
either end or just right in the middle

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.110 
either end or just right in the middle
like<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.709> whatever<00:02:17.709> comfortable<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.849> do<00:02:19.000> it
