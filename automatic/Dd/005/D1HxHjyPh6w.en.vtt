00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.450
 hello and welcome to the kedougou blog 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:09.360
 today on the program hdcp 43 53 although he touched the range 2006 and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.749
 communicating tonga islands at htc 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.989
 so higher level on the side of the gym we can find ourselves 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.439
 the little finger 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.419
 so the box 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.980
 opens 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.300
 parents children 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.649
 time for meaning 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.800
 so the pdr 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.380
 is available juliette longuet 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.030
 it avoids 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
 in fact proves the hac 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
 so here is pedersen 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.210
 so it's a percent of both points 0 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.130
 camera 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.580
 2 megapixels it is compatible wifi 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.580
 he embarks good dose of humility 5 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.460
 a mini usb 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.720
 he allows percent of this committee 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.050
 intermedia missive 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.280
 it also integrates the software suite of boune doses 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.660
 so power since he knows the political course 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.230
 a viewer of the pdr 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.230
 as well as the fight against terrorism 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.110
 so the packaging but relatively neat 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.330
 we find in the front the software and all that is staggering 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.430
 maintain the user manual 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.600
 so the originality of the packaging and those that opens on both sides 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.450
 to leave room for all the accessories delivered with the device 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.610
 so we find in this first goal his first box 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.600
 we find the happening evening 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.910
 leather ccn 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.340
 my earphones 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.170
 stereo 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.550
 as well as the battery 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.090
 he will do what he is 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.490
 so both styles 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.190
 so also from the fiq 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.140
 in the second we will find 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.670
 the heart this sector 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.229
 as well as the chorus of usb sticks 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.119
 but the usb cord to connect 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.189
 the 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:13.289
 fcc 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.399
 and 43 50 to the computer in the minds 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.089
 so here the mains charger 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.089
 the big advantage of the crash gc 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.169
 43 50 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.169
 of course the sliding keyboard 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.039
 azerty 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.069
 which makes it possible to read before working for them 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.399
 as on the cassandra 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.399
 and it's very handy for the law creating and editing documents 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.420
 more what is at stake here if you can connect to it on the internet 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.119
 so for a hundred starting from your box for example 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.549
 this one knew under foot by priests 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.439
 and if you are an optical freebox with a customer cit 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.219
 for example gossip 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.879
 you can make calls directly via the freebox 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.769
 the soft price pole of communications prices 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.680
 to know more about their music everything that was only early childhood and in 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.079
 certain countries 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.419
 seen the cost is of course we can go on appeal of his classic for a 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.149
 portable 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.259
 with% between operators 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.030

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.359
 it's your subscription 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.499
