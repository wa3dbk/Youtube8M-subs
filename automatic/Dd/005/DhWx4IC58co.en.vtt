00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 friends my name is giancarlo today we go 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.569
 to draw bonnie's face then 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.160
 Let's start the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.870
 it's going to be your nose 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.870
 it's going to be something triangular 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.150
 in this way then we will download a 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.750
 line 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.039
 and we are going to do with some cheeks in 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.039
 this part of the sheet good 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.080
 now we have these two curves now 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.960
 let's go down this side of the nose 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.610
 to finish and now let's draw 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.680
 the eyes of our pony then to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 we're going to do three circles 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.270
 and one smaller than the other 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 thus 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.950
 let's paint the center 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:00.250
 now we go with the other the same thing we are 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.250
 what did we think 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.580
 let's do the same three circles 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.500
 we painted the center 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.500
 also the nose we are going to paint 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.590
 and now let's draw the outline like this 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.590
 of the face 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.460
 then something would have to 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.180
 follow more or less as the curve of the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.790
 face then here it closes a little and 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.370
 now let's do the head here 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.630
 we went up in close here in the part of the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.600
 eye a little and then come back and open 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.789
 and closes more or less on this side something 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.539
 so it does not have to stay and now we're going to 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:45.329
 draw the ears would come here in this 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.100
 hand he is holding the ear let 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.530
 do so long enough 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.819
 as long as they are not let out 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.240
 draw them completely but it would come 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.240
 something like that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.870
 on this side 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.420
 we will do the inner part of the ear and 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.420
 ready now let's do the mouth 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.450
 would come something like this corner in this 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.940
 another corner 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.239
 now let's go over the much more 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.239
 big 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.960
 thus 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.610
 now let's draw the bowtie as 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.500
 not then let's make a circle 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.090
 trying to stay the most focused 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.920
 possible 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.070
 would come something like the way a 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.960
 heart 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.910
 [Music] 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.920
 now let's go over here this 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 line that we're going to make two lines for 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.400
 that is more real our curve you do not 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.230
 let's do the same 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.180
 more or less it has been for my heart 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.040
 and ready good we have our 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 bowtie now let's draw the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.590
 onis teeth 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.590
 well in something like that 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.270
 like paddles then we're going to be like that 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.270
 the winds 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.829
 and we finished 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.319
