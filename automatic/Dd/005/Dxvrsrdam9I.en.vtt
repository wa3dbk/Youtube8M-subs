00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.189
 good evening to all friends of food channel 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:17.300
 we are here with the professor of georgia taken of the faculty of pharmacy a 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.599
 pressure and density of the Trieste studies 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.429
 consortia tales why he decided to make this edition of 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.029
 railway station 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 but basically because the students asked me 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.000
 they wanted to give a good sign of participation in the faculty of pharmacy 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.760
 dear the problems that are troubling the world 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 universities wanted to show 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.630
 at least in Trieste it is not true that at the university 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.730
 teachers do not teach 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.860
 it was an opportunity 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.690
 to come down among the people who say 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.740
 I can see that you can cent 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 and that perhaps he could also be interested in that 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.880
 what do you think of the gelmini reform 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.060
 given what I know the gelmini reform is essentially concerned 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.820
 secondary school 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 it's not about college 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.110
 as far as I could see it seems to me 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.800
 sisi art for some aspects going back to the school of the past 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.900
 whether this is a good yes or a bad one will probably depend on I think 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.010
 click it 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.910
 of good teachers and make a good school whatever the standards 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.610
 whatever the color of the aprons has gone 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.410
 bad teachers make a bad school 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 how to see the eagle university 10 years 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.060
 dario probably no longer exists 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.060
 from thanks to heaven 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.030
 I am slightly pessimistic 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.270
 I'm afraid 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.439
 and those forces they brought but 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.319
 a situation in which there are so many dark spots in the universities 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.979
 for they will not be easily defeated 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.389
 certainly the senses will never be defeated will continue to make every herb a 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:27.879
 beam 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.669
 represent all the universities as of the uncleanness 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.729
 all full professors like barons 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.579
 I must say that this is in the faculty of pharmacy 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.209
 I personally went to the chair 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.549
 because the list of my publications was much longer than that of 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.759
 competitors 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:58.989
 I didn't have godparents I didn't have grandparents addresses in and others I fuck 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.879
 portable 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.260
 the product that we supply the pharmacists who come out of the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.099
 faculty of pharmacy 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.689
 I have 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.949
 appreciated by the market 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.090
 find ours 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.719
 immediately work and sociology 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.129
 everything is holla 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.379
 category 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 to what for example the Corriere della Sera published 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.009
 most appreciated 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.779
 from the public 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.219
 the professionals 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.649
 people have more confidence 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.649
 compared to all the others 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.529
 this is why I think that the faculties of pharmacy in particular here in Trieste 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.999
 you can't talk about lost university 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.329
 Professor, thank you very much for this interview 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.199
 thank you 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.199
 from his tuition and a warm greeting to all 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.239
 your viewers thanks and goodbye 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.780
 everything from the central station of Trieste wins 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.230
 a greeting and the next
