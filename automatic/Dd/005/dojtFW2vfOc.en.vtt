here<00:03:03.250> comes<00:03:03.280> these<00:03:03.670> guys<00:03:06.120> got<00:03:07.120> some<00:03:07.330> zealots

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.059 

all<00:03:12.050> right<00:03:12.200> take<00:03:12.349> those<00:03:12.560> gonna<00:03:12.770> take<00:03:12.950> those

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
all right take those gonna take those

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.720 
all right take those gonna take those
noodles<00:03:13.459> out<00:03:13.550> take<00:03:13.760> those<00:03:13.879> meters<00:03:14.090> out<00:03:15.730> all

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
noodles out take those meters out all

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.400 
noodles out take those meters out all
right<00:03:16.879> so<00:03:17.180> he's<00:03:17.420> still<00:03:17.660> got<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> lot<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.080> noodles

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
right so he's still got a lot of noodles

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.830 
right so he's still got a lot of noodles
and<00:03:18.500> he's<00:03:18.590> got<00:03:18.739> another<00:03:18.920> base<00:03:19.129> somewhere<00:03:19.400> else

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
and he's got another base somewhere else

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.559 
and he's got another base somewhere else
let's<00:03:20.840> go<00:03:20.959> find<00:03:21.200> Sid<00:03:21.620> base<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:22.450> probably<00:03:23.450> use

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
let's go find Sid base I probably use

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.910 
let's go find Sid base I probably use
observers<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.110> find<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.560> because<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.769> should

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
observers to find that because I should

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.259 
observers to find that because I should
just<00:03:25.040> get<00:03:25.099> out<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.220> whole<00:03:25.489> bunch<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.849> observers

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
just get out a whole bunch of observers

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.089 
just get out a whole bunch of observers
right<00:03:26.420> now<00:03:26.590> because<00:03:27.590> he's<00:03:27.739> no<00:03:27.950> longer

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
right now because he's no longer

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.410 
right now because he's no longer
building<00:03:28.430> ground<00:03:28.670> units<00:03:29.000> because<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.330> my

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
building ground units because of my

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.610 
building ground units because of my
colossi<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.470> it's<00:03:30.560> got<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.709> bunch<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.010> observers

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
colossi so it's got a bunch of observers

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.580 
colossi so it's got a bunch of observers
what<00:03:33.620> oh<00:03:34.750> my<00:03:35.750> god<00:03:35.900> did<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.050> run<00:03:36.200> out<00:03:36.260> over<00:03:36.440> here<00:03:36.530> I

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.229 
expand I know I've got a battle going on
over<00:03:42.379> there<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:42.620> I've<00:03:42.709> got<00:03:43.069> to<00:03:44.590> do<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.769> first

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
over there but I've got to do this first

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.940 
over there but I've got to do this first
dang<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.390> all<00:03:48.170> right<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.410> he's<00:03:48.530> got<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.650> bunch<00:03:48.860> of

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
dang it all right so he's got a bunch of

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.420 
dang it all right so he's got a bunch of
roaches<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.549> bunch<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.790> other<00:03:49.970> stuff<00:03:51.430> all

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
roaches and a bunch of other stuff all

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.559 
roaches and a bunch of other stuff all
right<00:03:52.549> let's<00:03:52.670> uncute<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.299> lot<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.510> these

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
right let's uncute a lot of these

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:54.729 
right let's uncute a lot of these
observers<00:03:53.930> because<00:03:54.200> those<00:03:54.319> are<00:03:54.440> just<00:03:54.500> taking

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
observers because those are just taking

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.039 
observers because those are just taking
up<00:03:54.860> resources<00:03:55.160> right<00:03:55.519> now<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.780> could<00:03:56.900> be

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
up resources right now that I could be

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.640 
up resources right now that I could be
using<00:03:57.200> for<00:03:57.290> other<00:03:57.560> things<00:03:59.319> and<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.410> don't<00:04:00.560> have

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
using for other things and I don't have

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.539 
using for other things and I don't have
enough<00:04:00.829> for<00:04:00.980> that<00:04:02.530> all<00:04:03.530> right<00:04:03.769> so<00:04:04.310> he's<00:04:04.430> got

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
enough for that all right so he's got

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.160 
enough for that all right so he's got
another<00:04:04.670> base<00:04:04.880> over<00:04:05.090> there<00:04:05.239> East<00:04:05.420> I<00:04:05.630> left<00:04:05.930> most

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
another base over there East I left most

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.410 
another base over there East I left most
of<00:04:06.290> his<00:04:06.410> tech<00:04:06.650> buildings<00:04:07.060> that's<00:04:08.060> not<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> good

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.309 

about<00:04:19.759> a<00:04:19.789> lot<00:04:19.969> of<00:04:20.090> gas<00:04:20.449> and<00:04:20.840> I<00:04:20.900> don't<00:04:21.109> know<00:04:21.199> what

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:21.319 
about a lot of gas and I don't know what

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:25.240 
about a lot of gas and I don't know what
to<00:04:21.349> do<00:04:21.500> with<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:22.960> warp<00:04:23.960> gates<00:04:24.229> can't<00:04:25.129> do

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
to do with it warp gates can't do

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.529 
to do with it warp gates can't do
anything<00:04:25.400> with<00:04:25.610> them<00:04:25.699> right<00:04:25.849> now<00:04:28.449> for<00:04:29.449> the

moment from a bunch of roaches get those

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.360 
moment from a bunch of roaches get those
mutants<00:04:36.349> get<00:04:36.469> those<00:04:36.620> meters<00:04:36.800> take<00:04:37.069> out<00:04:37.219> those

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
mutants get those meters take out those

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.760 
mutants get those meters take out those

of<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.139> match<00:05:00.380> I<00:05:00.620> think<00:05:00.919> though<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.729> the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
of the match I think though that the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.750 
of the match I think though that the
match<00:05:02.419> went<00:05:03.100> for<00:05:04.100> my<00:05:04.190> first<00:05:04.220> time<00:05:04.580> playing

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
match went for my first time playing

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.000 
match went for my first time playing
Protoss<00:05:05.210> like<00:05:05.930> really<00:05:06.290> playing<00:05:06.530> Protoss<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:06.949> a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
Protoss like really playing Protoss in a

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.350 
Protoss like really playing Protoss in a
multiplayer<00:05:07.280> match<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.669> think<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.030> match<00:05:08.180> went

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
multiplayer match I think the match went

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.060 
multiplayer match I think the match went
fairly<00:05:08.630> well<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:09.080> think<00:05:09.440> if<00:05:09.650> I<00:05:09.710> just<00:05:09.919> knew<00:05:10.040> a

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
fairly well I think if I just knew a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.379 
fairly well I think if I just knew a
little<00:05:10.220> bit<00:05:10.340> more<00:05:10.610> about<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.940> race<00:05:11.090> they'd<00:05:11.270> be

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
little bit more about the race they'd be

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.840 
little bit more about the race they'd be
very<00:05:11.660> fun<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:11.990> play<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.620> might<00:05:13.430> end<00:05:13.460> up<00:05:13.639> doing
