working<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:13.950> way<00:01:14.010> through<00:01:14.400> Town<00:01:14.729> Hall<00:01:14.970> 8<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.750> do

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
working our way through Town Hall 8 I do

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.140 
working our way through Town Hall 8 I do
think<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:16.950> probably<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> matter

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
think it's probably going to be a matter

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270 
think it's probably going to be a matter
of<00:01:18.240> months<00:01:18.720> before<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.830> town<00:01:19.979> hall<00:01:20.189> 9

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
of months before I get to town hall 9

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
of months before I get to town hall 9

there

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.920 
there
slowly<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.430> surely<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> long<00:01:27.330> grind<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
slowly but surely it is a long grind I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.510 
slowly but surely it is a long grind I
haven't<00:01:28.259> had<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> chance<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> attack<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.340> much

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
haven't had a chance to attack as much

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
haven't had a chance to attack as much
as<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.210> season<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:31.979> getting

as I like this season but we are getting

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.710 
as I like this season but we are getting

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
there and so we're going to take a look

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
there and so we're going to take a look
at<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:33.960> recent<00:01:34.200> attacks<00:01:34.740> where<00:01:34.979> I've<00:01:35.100> been

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
at some recent attacks where I've been

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.910

incorporating balloons and one example

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.789 
incorporating balloons and one example
right<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.579> where<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> attacked<00:01:39.479> Johnny<00:01:39.900> K<00:01:40.170> 25

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
right here where I attacked Johnny K 25

rid of these outer defences and I've
brought<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.630> much<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> smaller<00:02:07.320> contingent<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
brought in much a smaller contingent of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.669 
brought in much a smaller contingent of
Barch<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> help<00:02:09.539> clean<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> idea
