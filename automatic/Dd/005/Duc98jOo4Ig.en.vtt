00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 phytosanitary products are 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.360
 composed of hazardous materials for the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 human health and the environment 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.939
 they must be stored in a local 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.980
 appropriate and in a closet closed to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.640
 mandatory key on holdings 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 agricultural 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.000
 the phytosanitary plant allows the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.780
 safe storage of products 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.239
 it's by month there's all that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 I use fully to engage myself 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.370
 There are all the visual approved products 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.410
 and we 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
 there is on the other hand a practice 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 reserved for products we have what we call 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.590
 that the ppm u phytosanitary products no 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 usable 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.170
 a room that must also answer 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.879
 to a very specific regulation this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.739
 that one must know in the first place a 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.239
 Phytosanitary cabinet serves only 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.070
 store phytosanitary products 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.379
 we can not have in this cabinet 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.369
 fertilizers or other products 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.840
 it's really products 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.710
 phytosanitary products used to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.090
 the farm 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.280
 that's the first important point 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.200
 then it's a standard that has to be 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.049
 locked to avoid effectively 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.180
 that there is a risk vis-Ã -vis a 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.250
 foreign person the family can 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.479
 penetrate use products that are 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.490
 first dangerous products it takes 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.080
 remember it is then it's a 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 wardrobe that must be ventilated 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.600
 so actually to avoid particular 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 health problems of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.610
 the user especially when he goes 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.930
 use your phytosanitary products 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 mandatory for all farmers 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.540
 the secure phytosanitary plant serves 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.670
 also the storage of ppn had 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.200
 chemicals become for various 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.680
 reasons 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.380
 unusable ppm u they understand 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.119
 first of all products that have lost their 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.610
 marketing authorization 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.320
 so these are these the first category 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.670
 in which we can find the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.380
 barefoot or if they are products that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 have been degraded by the conditions of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.149
 storage that can no longer be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.530
 used by the farmer so no 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.080
 especially at the meeting we know the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.759
 terms 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.770
 difficult to store these products there 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.940
 and these are also products that 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.930
 may be that they can no longer be 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.090
 used by farmers 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.890
 because they have a certain moment to change 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.420
 production on the farm 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.040
 so these are products that can only 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.830
 more be used on some 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.060
 cultures in order to eliminate in a way 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.520
 regulatory its products 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.290
 unusable the phytosanitary 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.630
 Chamber of Agriculture and its partners 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.950
 regularly organize collections 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.800
 of these dangerous products 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.560
 an operation that mobilizes a number 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.970
 growing farmers 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.460
 it's a great interest in the sense of 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 donations is in a gait to truth 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.030
 reasoned therefore for the exploitation and 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.950
 then I think we see it 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.900
 farmers should not have a 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.330
 responsible and sustainable image for 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.680
 the environment to know that these 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.760
 products the adjustment if today 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.650
 it's a colleague it's very important 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.520
 for us because the difficult ones for 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.250
 we and stored here he can he can 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.560
 to fall he can have an accident and everything 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.240
 that and these products there can not put 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.330
 in the trash if the details see or 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.959
 whatever the most in the the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.790
 limit of regulation for for 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.920
 use can not put in trash 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.540
 in the garbage so the very 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.930
 important that we in a message on 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.080
 one of the appropriate collections for his 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.570
 products and goods recovered in various 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.540
 collection points to cpp naked are 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.980
 sorted and stored according to their nature in 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.590
 appropriate containers that's the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.750
 approved fungicides 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.130
 clothes cdp a little insecticides of 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.230
 remaining radio cans growing 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.459
 sensitive to these protection issues 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.010
 of the environment so we are 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.269
 actually in sleeves 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.320
 sustainable agriculture is becoming 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.840
 plus these opinions as to the price of 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.050
 aware of the importance for them of 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.360
 participate in this movement so to 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.340
 help preserve particular 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.310
 water resources that are extremely 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.720
 important for our marines in absence 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.730
 to finish local treatment 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.000
 these special wastes are sent in 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.770
 metropolis to be eliminated these 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.180
 products are therefore toxic waste 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.370
 dangerous 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.650
 which are obligatorily treated in 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.060
 specialized facilities these 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.729
 facilities is not found at the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.889
 meeting we are obliged to send them by 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.440
 boat in metropolitan France in 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.910
 hazardous waste incinerators 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.940
 so it's through this regulatory route 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.520
 who will be eliminated these wastes so he 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.590
 It should be noted that the incinerator 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.330
 metropolis also has a function of 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.580
 energy production so there are these 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.650
 couples and energy recovery 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.509
 burning them will also allow 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.410
 to recover energy to produce 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.539
 electricity 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.830
 it's still there we're still 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.419
 really in a process of 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.550
 sustainable development we are in front 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.880
 of a product a hazardous waste that is 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.419
 then at the end of the valued cycle 2 on 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.419
 the energy plan
