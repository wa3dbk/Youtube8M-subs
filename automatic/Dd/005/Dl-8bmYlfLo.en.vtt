visualize the action sequences and there

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.150 
visualize the action sequences and there
are<00:04:25.029> some<00:04:25.150> awesome<00:04:25.360> ones<00:04:25.659> in<00:04:25.870> this

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
unique I think I've said unique about a

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.250 
unique I think I've said unique about a
thousand<00:04:45.540> times<00:04:45.690> already<00:04:45.870> in<00:04:45.960> this<00:04:46.050> review

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
thousand times already in this review

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.410

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
but it but it it's something that I want

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.740 
but it but it it's something that I want
to<00:04:48.480> underscore<00:04:48.840> because<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:50.700> rarely<00:04:51.330> do<00:04:51.690> we

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
to underscore because so rarely do we

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
about what makes them tick what how

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.740 
about what makes them tick what how
their<00:05:29.070> social<00:05:29.550> structure<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:30.060> made<00:05:30.360> up<00:05:30.570> and

assume these different forms and again

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.160 
assume these different forms and again
these<00:05:35.430> are<00:05:35.490> ideas<00:05:36.030> that<00:05:36.120> I've<00:05:36.420> never<00:05:36.540> seen<00:05:36.660> in

a in a novel before and are so
interesting<00:05:40.290> so<00:05:40.500> fascinating<00:05:41.220> in<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.430> of

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
interesting so fascinating in and of

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.150 
interesting so fascinating in and of
themselves<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:42.330> just<00:05:42.870> wish<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.200> book<00:05:43.770> moved

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
themselves I just wish the book moved

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.580 
themselves I just wish the book moved
forward<00:05:44.730> at<00:05:44.850> a<00:05:45.240> better<00:05:45.600> clip<00:05:45.900> and<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.290> there
