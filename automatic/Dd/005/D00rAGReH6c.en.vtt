00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.670
 good good friends and again be 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.040
 33 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.430
 this time you will have the unboxing of the huawei 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.529
 ascend from 511 of a range phone 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.960
 medium that offers us phones for a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.359
 approximate price of 4 thousand 500 bolivars 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 which can already be obtained in the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.859
 showcases of this cooperator that is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.650
 movilnet well watching the box a little 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.559
 we see that it is a fairly compact house 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.170
 it's small and good if we check in this 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.870
 side part we can see the following 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.800
 we have a 4.5 inch lcd screen 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.120
 tactile 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.870
 efe w a dual core cpu to 1.3 giga hertz 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.520
 4.2 4.2 gigabytes of ROM memory in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.070
 As for multimedia we have a camera 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.040
 front and rear camera we have capture 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.320
 video at 720p has service 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.510
 that's basically what all the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.940
 Android phones as for the 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.590
 connectivity has bluetooth 4.0 and in the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.630
 good network is 3g h more 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.850
 in the other part of the box we have the 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.299
 Huawei logo and here we have no more 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.409
 nothing ok we are going to then take it out of the 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 box to see what it is that brings 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 here is the phone this is the version 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:30.090
 white of Huawei 511 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.950
 how they can be fixed is a telephone with 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.060
 a layout quite similar to all the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.860
 series and it does not differ from many things here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
 in the back you can see that it has 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.580
 your camera does not have flash and here is the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.540
 cornet on top 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.480
 we have the 3.5 mm jack and the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.610
 input for the usb cable which is micro 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.740
 usb as you can see there in the part 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.440
 lower we have absolutely nothing and 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.160
 on this side we do not have anything of the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.530
 right side 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.890
 we have the power button turned off and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.440
 lock and volume buttons here 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.800
 forward we have the front camera and 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.700
 we have the sensors although it is a 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.030
 phone very 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.319
 but very simple ok let's see what it is 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.319
 what it brings inside the box 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.069
 here is the battery which we will 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.319
 check it well 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.819
 is one thousand seven hundred thirty thousand 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.209
 companies see you here thousand 730 thousand 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.209
 euros 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.580
 here is the charger adapter a 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.580
 classic 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.800
 We have 3.5 mm hands-free 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.800
 here is the jack 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.280
 its cable that is micro usb 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.379
 and finally certified warranty and guidance 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.190
 Quick start does not bring anything else not 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.420
 bring a memory 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.250
 or anything like that let's reorder 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.050
 a little here in this part is 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.680
 they can set the slot for the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.420
 sim card used without common for 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.640
 enter it you must remove the battery and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.100
 then the sim is introduced and in the part 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.430
 here we have the slot for a 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.430
 micro SD card it supports up to 32 GB 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.230
 let's turn it on and let's know a little 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.230
 more of this phone 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.670
 to this your bus screen 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.730
 let's unlock it and upload it 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.250
 little brightness to the screen 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.440
 so you can see better there 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.960
 there is the interface 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.870
 it's a little different from the emotion and wii 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.440
 that we are used to seeing is a 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.989
 little more like the android stock or the 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.209
 basic android to pure android 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.209
 however, we are going here 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.830
 and let's see what to bring the phone and 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.900
 we have the version of android 4.2.2 that 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.900
 is the living there is 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.460
 over here it does not give me any kind of 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.860
 information about emotion u and so 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.620
 As you can see, we do not have 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.689
 this characteristic is not something that 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.310
 is very desirable part of the game and not 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:58.820
 it's a very efficient launcher 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.820
 and let's see what this team tells us 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.650
 he marks the info and tells us that we have 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.660
 a wow the 511 125 1 a system 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:17.050
 operating 4.2.2 a cpu mt 6 572 is 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.790
 one hits every 6 572 the same coincidentally 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.560
 that we got on phones like in 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:26.920
 the jet 330 or in the jet 321 a gp a bad 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.590
 and 400 a resolution of 480 x 854 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.160
 pixels a rear camera 3.2 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.980
 megapixels a total ram of 512 megabytes 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.150
 of which we only have 479 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.880
 internal memory for the installation of 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.790
 applications of 127 gigas and the 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.730
 internal multimedia that would come 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.280
 124 as for the good cpu is 32 bits 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.190
 two cores and run a frequency of 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:56.020
 1.3 giga hertz and on the screen we have 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:58.510
 240 dp and the resolution of 480 x 854 were going 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.950
 him in an evil and 400 we had already spoken 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.510
 of that 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.350
 when the good camera here we do have 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:08.800
 a front camera and a rear camera 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.380
 well seeing it a little bit I'm just 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.830
 noticing that we have one more version 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:18.370
 large of the already known and 321 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.440
 hey 330 let's see then in the 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.540
 thorough review how does it work 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.310
 this team to see if we have a 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.590
 team better or we just have a 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.950
 bigger team you know then we 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.640
 missing the review thoroughly and see you 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.640
 until the next video
