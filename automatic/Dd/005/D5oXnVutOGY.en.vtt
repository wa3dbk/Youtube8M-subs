I<00:03:26.329> think<00:03:26.780> we<00:03:26.870> should<00:03:27.049> be<00:03:27.140> best<00:03:27.290> friends<00:03:27.500> I'm

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
I think we should be best friends I'm

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.020 
I think we should be best friends I'm
just<00:03:28.040> putting<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.370> out<00:03:28.489> there

just putting that out there

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.250 
just putting that out there
because<00:03:29.299> we<00:03:29.450> both<00:03:29.570> write<00:03:29.840> books<00:03:30.079> about

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
because we both write books about

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.190 
because we both write books about
characters<00:03:31.100> who<00:03:31.130> have<00:03:32.090> situations<00:03:32.630> involving

donate everything I own to Goodwill if

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.789 
donate everything I own to Goodwill if
it<00:03:38.329> meant<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.570> I<00:03:38.959> could<00:03:39.320> date<00:03:39.470> this
