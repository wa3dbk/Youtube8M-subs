00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.359 
make sure that when you put the blade in
your<00:01:42.600> blade<00:01:43.049> stays<00:01:43.439> nice<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.920> straight<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
your blade stays nice and straight and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.830 
your blade stays nice and straight and
it's<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.759> curved<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.420> side<00:01:45.659> because

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it's not curved to one side because

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's not curved to one side because
that's<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.439> make<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.130> blade<00:01:47.399> break<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that's going to make your blade break a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.789 
that's going to make your blade break a
little<00:01:48.030> bit<00:01:48.119> easier<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.259> plate<00:01:49.560> back

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
little bit easier on this plate back

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
little bit easier on this plate back
here<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> wheel<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.540> will<00:01:51.869> help

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
here you have a wheel this will help

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.350 
here you have a wheel this will help
support<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.189> back<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> blade<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
support the back of the blade so it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
support the back of the blade so it
doesn't<00:01:54.630> snap<00:01:54.899> when<00:01:55.110> you're<00:01:55.229> using<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.710> it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
doesn't snap when you're using it it's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.550 
doesn't snap when you're using it it's
going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> loosen<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:59.009> same<00:01:59.450> screws<00:02:00.560> that

you don't want to push it too much to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.750 
you don't want to push it too much to
where<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.229> bends<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> blade<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.430> you'll<00:02:11.610> go

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
where it bends the blade then you'll go

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
where it bends the blade then you'll go
ahead<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> tighten<00:02:12.660> up<00:02:12.720> your<00:02:12.870> screws

jigsaw<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.060> good<00:03:18.210> idea<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> drill

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
jigsaw it's a good idea to have a drill

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.740 
jigsaw it's a good idea to have a drill
and<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:20.490> bit<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.940> want<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> make<00:03:21.270> sure<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.600> the

and a bit you want to make sure that the
bit<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.650> little<00:03:22.980> bit<00:03:23.100> bigger<00:03:23.310> than<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
bit is a little bit bigger than the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
lot more time from cutting just around

your blade you can put a couple holes in
there<00:03:43.620> especially<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:44.220> your<00:03:44.490> receptacles<00:03:45.120> on

there's a lot of dust that gathers up on
those<00:03:58.500> lines<00:03:58.740> it's<00:03:59.010> going<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.280> harder<00:03:59.610> to

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
those lines it's going to be harder to

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.920 
those lines it's going to be harder to
see<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.300> wanna<00:04:00.420> make<00:04:00.540> sure<00:04:00.570> they're<00:04:00.780> nice
