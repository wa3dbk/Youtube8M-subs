put all the accessories back on this is

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.370 
put all the accessories back on this is
an<00:00:17.609> idle<00:00:17.880> stop<00:00:18.090> solenoid<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.020> kick<00:00:19.199> up

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
an idle stop solenoid it's a kick up

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.900 
an idle stop solenoid it's a kick up
actually<00:00:19.830> where's<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> air<00:00:20.340> conditioning<00:00:20.789> on

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
actually where's the air conditioning on

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.029 
actually where's the air conditioning on
and<00:00:24.050> got<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> choke<00:00:25.410> put<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.900> these

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
and got the choke put on and these

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.450 
and got the choke put on and these
sometimes<00:00:29.039> these<00:00:30.710> screw<00:00:31.710> holes<00:00:31.740> looser

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
sometimes these screw holes looser

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
sometimes these screw holes looser
threads<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> quadric<00:00:34.260> jets<00:00:34.469> i've

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
threads out of all the quadric jets i've

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.610 
threads out of all the quadric jets i've
got<00:00:34.910> on<00:00:35.910> hand<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.719> about<00:00:37.020> ten<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.290> them

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
got on hand which is about ten of them

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220 
got on hand which is about ten of them
this<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> only<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.020> had

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
this this was the only one that had

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.369 
this this was the only one that had
strip<00:00:40.770> threads<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.450> these

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
strip threads here so I just use these

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.950 
strip threads here so I just use these
Oh<00:00:46.820> self<00:00:47.820> drilling<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> self<00:00:48.390> tapping<00:00:48.570> payin

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
Oh self drilling and self tapping payin

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.790 
Oh self drilling and self tapping payin
screws<00:00:49.379> guess<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> 18<00:00:50.910> by<00:00:51.149> 3/4<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.440> they

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
screws guess that's a 18 by 3/4 and they

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
screws guess that's a 18 by 3/4 and they
work<00:00:52.949> perfectly<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.360> did<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
work perfectly and so I just did that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
work perfectly and so I just did that
when<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> did<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> preliminary<00:00:58.340> choke

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
when I did a preliminary choke

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.610 
when I did a preliminary choke
adjustment<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.000> don't<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.660> adjust<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
adjustment I don't I just adjust it you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
adjustment I don't I just adjust it you
know<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.850> put<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.809> just

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
know you just put it on here and just

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.810 
know you just put it on here and just
turn<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.710> way<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.159> tightens<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> play

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
turn it this way that tightens to play

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.270 
turn it this way that tightens to play
that<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.780> leave<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.979> little

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that and I just leave you know a little

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
that and I just leave you know a little
gap<00:01:08.549> pairs<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.330> all<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.810> way<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.170> for

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
gap pairs it's not all the way just for

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
gap pairs it's not all the way just for
clothes<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.130> that's<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> good<00:01:11.460> baseline<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
clothes and that's a good baseline and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.120 
clothes and that's a good baseline and
you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.140> how<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.380> behaves<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:13.920> you

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you can just see how it behaves when you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
you can just see how it behaves when you
started<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.600> starts<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> goes

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
started if it's if it starts and goes

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
started if it's if it starts and goes
back<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.799> again<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> may<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
back that again and you may have the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.490 
back that again and you may have the
other<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.659> two<00:01:18.780> before<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.110> takes<00:01:19.290> off

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
other time or two before it takes off

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.109 
other time or two before it takes off
and<00:01:19.650> run<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.920> may<00:01:20.009> need<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.310> reaching<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and run you may need to reaching the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.160 
and run you may need to reaching the
choke<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.380> bit<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.570> there<00:01:24.810> again<00:01:24.990> if

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
choke up a little bit and there again if

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770 
choke up a little bit and there again if
it<00:01:25.320> seems<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> takes<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.189> while<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.780> come

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it seems like it takes a while to come

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
it seems like it takes a while to come
off<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> choke<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.740> may<00:01:29.400> run<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:29.700> bit

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
off the choke and may run a little bit

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.179 
off the choke and may run a little bit
rich<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> your<00:01:31.650> vacuum<00:01:31.829> break

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
rich and you know that your vacuum break

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
rich and you know that your vacuum break
is<00:01:32.340> working<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.750> may<00:01:33.869> need<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
is working good then you may need to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.910 
is working good then you may need to
lean<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:37.500> between<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.460> study<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.920> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
lean it but between that study in and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.030 
lean it but between that study in and
I'm<00:01:41.130> still<00:01:41.369> playing<00:01:41.640> around<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.329> my<00:01:43.040> vacuum

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I'm still playing around with my vacuum

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.609 
I'm still playing around with my vacuum
break<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.479> had<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> good<00:01:45.899> use<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.470> put

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
break here I had a good use when I put

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.389 
break here I had a good use when I put
on<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.340> right<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.000> I've<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.450> set<00:01:48.750> up

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
on here and right now I've got set up

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.210 
on here and right now I've got set up
this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.610> controlling<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> choke<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.259> when

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
this is controlling the choke so when

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.770 
this is controlling the choke so when
this

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.990 
this
pulls<00:01:54.200> back<00:01:54.470> pops<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.250> choke<00:01:55.460> open<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.880> little

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
pulls back pops the choke open a little

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.830 
pulls back pops the choke open a little
bit<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:58.280> that'll<00:01:58.580> work<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:59.450> I'm<00:01:59.510> still<00:01:59.570> gonna

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
bit so that'll work but I'm still gonna

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.070 
bit so that'll work but I'm still gonna
get<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.110> one<00:02:00.410> for<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:01.780> damper<00:02:02.780> for<00:02:02.990> the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
get the one for the damper for the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.870 
get the one for the damper for the
secondaries<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:03.950> know<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.130> told<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:04.670> guys

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
secondaries and you know I told you guys

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.210 
secondaries and you know I told you guys
about<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:05.840> I<00:02:06.110> think<00:02:06.770> what<00:02:07.070> I'm<00:02:07.130> gonna

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
about that so I think what I'm gonna

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.380 
about that so I think what I'm gonna
have<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.430> do<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.760> I'm<00:02:07.850> gonna<00:02:07.940> have<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.270> order

have to do is I'm gonna have to order

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.730 
have to do is I'm gonna have to order
one<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.690> these<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:10.459> this<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.000> woman<00:02:11.150> that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
one of these and this is the woman that

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.340 
one of these and this is the woman that
was<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.450> what<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.690> found<00:02:15.080> out<00:02:15.320> I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
was on it and what I found out I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.080 
was on it and what I found out I
probably<00:02:15.680> knew<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.070> before<00:02:16.490> but<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.760> forgot

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
probably knew this before but I forgot

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.290 
probably knew this before but I forgot
about<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.390> these<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:19.459> can<00:02:19.610> always<00:02:19.760> tell<00:02:20.120> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
about it these you can always tell the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.240 
about it these you can always tell the
ones<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.200> want<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.680> rear<00:02:21.860> vacuum

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
ones that I want have a rear vacuum

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.830 
ones that I want have a rear vacuum
break<00:02:22.430> because<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.910> an<00:02:23.000> unusual<00:02:23.480> arm

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
break because I have an unusual arm

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.860 
break because I have an unusual arm
right<00:02:24.140> here<00:02:24.470> most<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.670> them<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.360> connection

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
right here most of them the connection

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.860 
right here most of them the connection
is<00:02:27.020> up<00:02:27.200> here<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:28.640> rotates<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.270> way<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:29.690> this

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
is up here it rotates this way with this

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.050 
is up here it rotates this way with this
one's<00:02:30.080> on<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.800> OP<00:02:30.950> that's<00:02:31.340> kind<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.580> like<00:02:31.670> you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
one's on the OP that's kind of like you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.040 
one's on the OP that's kind of like you
know<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:34.030> quickly<00:02:35.030> realized<00:02:35.390> again

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
know this and I quickly realized again

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.570 
know this and I quickly realized again
that<00:02:36.110> there's<00:02:36.530> no<00:02:36.739> way<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:36.950> put<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.220> front<00:02:37.520> of

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
that there's no way to put a front of

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.010 
that there's no way to put a front of
vacuum<00:02:37.850> break<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.180> these<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> rod

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
vacuum break on these and have a rod

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.720 
vacuum break on these and have a rod
it'll<00:02:39.380> go<00:02:39.470> across<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.220> because<00:02:40.550> it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
it'll go across to this because it

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.390 
it'll go across to this because it
chokes<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.209> way<00:02:41.360> see<00:02:41.840> there<00:02:42.250> there's<00:02:43.250> no

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
chokes in the way see there there's no

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100 
chokes in the way see there there's no
way<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.030> work<00:02:44.209> because<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.750> has<00:02:44.959> to

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
way for that to work because this has to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.100 
way for that to work because this has to
go<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.500> way<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.600> has<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.080> a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
go this way you know so it has to have a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.930 
go this way you know so it has to have a
vacant<00:02:48.620> rear<00:02:48.800> vacuum<00:02:49.160> break<00:02:49.310> only<00:02:49.520> that's<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
vacant rear vacuum break only that's a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.440 
vacant rear vacuum break only that's a
good<00:02:50.090> way<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.330> tell<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.270> one's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
good way to tell that and so this one's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.060 
good way to tell that and so this one's
bad<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.959> I'll<00:02:54.080> have<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.350> order<00:02:54.380> one<00:02:54.739> against

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
bad and I'll have to order one against

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.370 
bad and I'll have to order one against
at<00:02:55.250> $40<00:02:55.760> right<00:02:56.209> now<00:02:56.420> just<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.780> start<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.110> up<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
at $40 right now just to start it up and

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.860 
at $40 right now just to start it up and
run<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.620> I'm<00:02:58.160> just<00:02:58.250> gonna<00:02:58.370> use<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.910> one<00:02:58.970> and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
run it I'm just gonna use this one and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.270 
run it I'm just gonna use this one and
go<00:03:02.870> with<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.470> then<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.769> course<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:04.130> will
