have two mounting holes to deal with
what<00:00:15.389> we'll<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.839> take<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.350> drop<00:00:16.949> our

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
what we'll do is take in drop our

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
what we'll do is take in drop our
alternator<00:00:17.930> down<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> approximate

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
alternator down in the approximate

location of where it goes

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.890 
location of where it goes
we'll<00:00:22.439> grab<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> bolts<00:00:23.300> we<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.539> here

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
we'll grab one of the bolts we got here

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560 
we'll grab one of the bolts we got here
and<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> line<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.539> what<00:00:27.539> I

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and we're going to line it up what I

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.420 
and we're going to line it up what I
like<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:29.570> is<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:31.050> both<00:00:31.349> bolts<00:00:31.710> started

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
like to do is to get both bolts started

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
like to do is to get both bolts started
before<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.930> tighten<00:00:34.530> either<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:36.020> that<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.200> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
before I tighten either one that way you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.950 
before I tighten either one that way you
secure<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> nice<00:00:38.160> good<00:00:38.579> fit<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.780> were<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
secure a nice good fit if you were to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.500 
secure a nice good fit if you were to
just<00:00:40.230> throw<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.399> bolt<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.120> run<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> down

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
just throw one bolt in and run it down

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.130

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.389 
the other bolt once we got the first one
started<00:00:55.649> we'll<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.860> ahead<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.280> the

while the bolts are loose it's going to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350

save your ratchet time your fingers will
operate<00:01:12.750> faster<00:01:13.470> than<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> ratchet<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.430> long<00:01:15.150> as

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
operate faster than a ratchet as long as

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320
