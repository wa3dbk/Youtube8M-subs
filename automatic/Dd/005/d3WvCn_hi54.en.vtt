getting hard numbers on how much China
imports<00:01:36.810> has<00:01:36.960> been<00:01:37.110> difficult<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
imports has been difficult you know a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.010 
imports has been difficult you know a
lot<00:01:38.370> of<00:01:38.490> analysts<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.090> been<00:01:39.120> using<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
lot of analysts have been using the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
lot of analysts have been using the
metric<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> exports<00:01:41.130> from<00:01:41.220> Hong<00:01:41.580> Kong<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
metric of exports from Hong Kong to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.570 
metric of exports from Hong Kong to
mainland<00:01:42.480> China<00:01:42.660> as<00:01:43.470> sort<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.920> gauge<00:01:44.190> on<00:01:44.520> how

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
mainland China as sort of a gauge on how

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.420 
mainland China as sort of a gauge on how
much<00:01:44.820> China<00:01:45.150> is<00:01:45.300> importing<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:46.440> directly

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
much China is importing now directly

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.420 
much China is importing now directly
importing<00:01:48.140> bypassing<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.530> Hong<00:01:49.860> Kong<00:01:49.890> hub

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
importing bypassing the Hong Kong hub

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.810 
importing bypassing the Hong Kong hub
might<00:01:50.880> indicate<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:51.540> they're<00:01:51.870> trying<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
might indicate that they're trying to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.250 
might indicate that they're trying to
fudge<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> numbers<00:01:54.120> or<00:01:54.630> keep<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> numbers<00:01:55.230> a

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
fudge the numbers or keep the numbers a

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.560 
fudge the numbers or keep the numbers a
bit<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:55.710> secret<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.940> again<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.270> could<00:01:57.390> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
bit more secret but again it could just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.300 
bit more secret but again it could just
be<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> much<00:01:58.230> more<00:01:58.410> efficient<00:01:58.830> way<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.100> Chinese

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
be a much more efficient way the Chinese

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.920 
be a much more efficient way the Chinese
have<00:01:59.580> found<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.850> get<00:01:59.940> gold<00:02:00.210> into<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> country

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
have found to get gold into the country

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
have found to get gold into the country
so<00:02:01.080> it's<00:02:01.380> difficult<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.920> come<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.580> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so it's difficult to come down to a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
so it's difficult to come down to a
conclusion<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.900> right<00:02:04.050> Peter<00:02:04.470> let's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
conclusion but all right Peter let's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.140 
conclusion but all right Peter let's
talk<00:02:04.860> silver<00:02:05.250> now<00:02:05.370> I<00:02:05.400> had<00:02:05.670> an<00:02:05.760> interesting

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.550 
talk silver now I had an interesting
interview<00:02:06.360> last<00:02:06.659> week<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:06.930> an<00:02:07.020> analyst<00:02:07.409> who

be<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.350> risk<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.460> party<00:02:17.880> do<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.420> agree<00:02:18.600> with

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
be a risk to the party do you agree with

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.350 
be a risk to the party do you agree with
that<00:02:18.870> mindset<00:02:19.470> yeah<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> think<00:02:20.400> silver<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.060> mean

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
that mindset yeah I think silver I mean

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.920 
that mindset yeah I think silver I mean
in

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
in

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.229 
in
sympathy<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.680> trade<00:02:23.099> with<00:02:23.310> gold<00:02:23.609> most<00:02:24.000> of

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
sympathy is a trade with gold most of

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.009 
sympathy is a trade with gold most of
the<00:02:24.359> time<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:26.010> does<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.430> an<00:02:26.549> industrial

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
the time and it does have an industrial

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.270 
the time and it does have an industrial
factor<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.260> plays<00:02:28.680> into<00:02:29.040> silver

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
factor that that plays into silver

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.420 
factor that that plays into silver
directly<00:02:29.969> that's<00:02:30.870> based<00:02:31.469> on<00:02:31.590> ik<00:02:31.739> on<00:02:31.920> supply

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
directly that's based on ik on supply

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.179 
directly that's based on ik on supply
and<00:02:32.459> demand<00:02:32.579> fundamentals<00:02:33.620> global<00:02:34.620> economies

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
and demand fundamentals global economies

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.490 
and demand fundamentals global economies
are<00:02:35.370> starting<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:36.030> improve<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:37.109> I'm<00:02:37.230> still

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
are starting to improve but I'm still

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.959 
are starting to improve but I'm still
not<00:02:37.650> seeing<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.219> off<00:02:38.340> taken<00:02:38.730> in

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
not seeing that and off taken in

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.509 
not seeing that and off taken in
industrial<00:02:39.719> silver<00:02:40.019> demand<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:41.159> the

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
industrial silver demand I think the

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.220 
industrial silver demand I think the
market<00:02:41.849> is<00:02:41.969> heavy<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.569> metals<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.049> mean

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
market is heavy in the metals I mean

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.990 
market is heavy in the metals I mean
there's<00:02:43.439> it's<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.889> difficult<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.549> find<00:02:44.819> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
there's it's it's difficult to find a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.440 
there's it's it's difficult to find a
short-term<00:02:45.810> reason<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.349> be<00:02:46.469> long<00:02:46.939> and<00:02:47.939> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
short-term reason to be long and the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.759 
short-term reason to be long and the
equity<00:02:48.840> markets<00:02:49.170> are<00:02:49.290> still<00:02:49.469> performing

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
equity markets are still performing

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.160 
equity markets are still performing
relatively<00:02:50.459> well<00:02:50.639> in<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.849> states<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.900> there's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
relatively well in the states so there's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.190 
relatively well in the states so there's
a<00:02:52.639> there's<00:02:53.639> a<00:02:53.760> competition<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.689> cash<00:02:54.870> and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
a there's a competition for cash and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.110 
a there's a competition for cash and
right<00:02:55.379> now<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.590> market<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.730> cash<00:02:56.939> is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
right now the market is the cash is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.629 
right now the market is the cash is
flowing<00:02:57.480> into<00:02:57.629> equities<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.500> bonds<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.099> away

you've<00:03:58.769> really<00:03:59.129> got<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.430> sensitive<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.909> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
you've really got to be sensitive to the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.080 
you've really got to be sensitive to the
1278<00:04:00.780> level<00:04:01.199> and<00:04:01.349> if<00:04:01.409> it<00:04:01.530> breaches<00:04:02.030> there's<00:04:03.030> a

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
1278 level and if it breaches there's a

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.330 
1278 level and if it breaches there's a
potential<00:04:03.479> of<00:04:03.689> seeing<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:04.439> know<00:04:04.560> 12:55

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
potential of seeing it you know 12:55

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.399 
potential of seeing it you know 12:55
and<00:04:05.579> if<00:04:05.669> we<00:04:05.819> lose<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.180> level<00:04:06.569> then<00:04:06.750> it's

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
and if we lose that level then it's

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.929 
and if we lose that level then it's
possible<00:04:07.919> we<00:04:08.009> might<00:04:08.159> see<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.400> test<00:04:08.699> of<00:04:08.849> the
