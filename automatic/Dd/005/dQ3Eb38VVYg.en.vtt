kind of fights where you know it's just
a<00:02:00.719> bunch<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.049> striking<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.860> used<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> really

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
a bunch of striking I used to really

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.300 
a bunch of striking I used to really
really<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> wrestling

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
really just do you know the wrestling

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
really just do you know the wrestling
takedowns<00:02:05.790> work<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> ground<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.600> town<00:02:06.750> but<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
takedowns work the ground in town but I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.339 
takedowns work the ground in town but I
really<00:02:08.090> kind<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:09.300> sick<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> now

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
really kind of got sick of that and now

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.350 
really kind of got sick of that and now
I<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.950> really<00:02:11.430> liked<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> understand

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
I just really liked you understand

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.350 
I just really liked you understand
working<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.350> sways<00:02:13.650> counters<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:15.180> know

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
working the sways counters you know

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.020 
working the sways counters you know
picking<00:02:16.200> finding<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> time<00:02:16.980> because<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
picking finding the time because you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.050 
picking finding the time because you
know<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.600> may<00:02:18.750> look<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:20.190> bunch<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.700> crazy

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
know it may look like a bunch of crazy

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.690 
know it may look like a bunch of crazy
random<00:02:21.780> things<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.040> lot<00:02:23.190> there's<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
random things but it's a lot there's a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.280 
random things but it's a lot there's a
lot<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.910> timing<00:02:24.390> involved<00:02:24.660> with<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
lot of timing involved with in the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.560 
lot of timing involved with in the
striking<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:25.950> game<00:02:26.160> as<00:02:26.430> well<00:02:27.090> as<00:02:27.270> range

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
striking in this game as well as range

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.570 
striking in this game as well as range
those<00:02:28.290> are<00:02:28.530> pretty<00:02:28.830> much<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.100> two<00:02:29.370> big

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
those are pretty much the two big

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.740 
those are pretty much the two big
factors<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.240> timing<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.790> probably

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
factors but timing is you know probably

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.400 
factors but timing is you know probably
even<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.290> bigger<00:02:34.800> factor<00:02:36.110> because<00:02:37.110> there<00:02:37.260> are

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
even a bigger factor because there are

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.250 
even a bigger factor because there are
strikes<00:02:37.710> from<00:02:37.830> all<00:02:38.100> different<00:02:39.020> ranges<00:02:40.020> but

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
strikes from all different ranges but

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.199 
strikes from all different ranges but
when<00:02:40.950> you're<00:02:41.040> striking<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:41.910> don't<00:02:42.090> want

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
when you're striking you just don't want

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.670 
when you're striking you just don't want
to<00:02:42.240> be<00:02:42.360> predictable<00:02:42.780> that's<00:02:43.020> all<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.380> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to be predictable that's all it is you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.710 
to be predictable that's all it is you
don't<00:02:44.100> want<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> do<00:02:44.820> too<00:02:45.120> many<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.510> same

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
don't want to do too many of the same

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.520 
don't want to do too many of the same
strikes<00:02:46.200> too<00:02:46.440> many<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.740> same<00:02:46.920> combos<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
strikes too many the same combos and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.380 
strikes too many the same combos and
that's<00:02:49.530> pretty<00:02:49.709> much<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.060> second

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
that's pretty much it but the second

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.130 
that's pretty much it but the second
round<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:51.840> comes<00:02:52.650> out<00:02:52.860> playing<00:02:53.340> two<00:02:53.580> strikes

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
round here comes out playing two strikes

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.710 
round here comes out playing two strikes
get<00:02:55.140> another<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> fourth<00:02:57.360> to

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
get another one and in the fourth to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.070 
get another one and in the fourth to
rock<00:02:58.200> him<00:02:59.000> he<00:03:00.000> puts<00:03:00.209> me<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> clinch<00:03:00.690> really

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
rock him he puts me to clinch really

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.160 
rock him he puts me to clinch really
smart<00:03:01.350> move<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:02.010> right<00:03:02.790> here<00:03:02.940> I'm<00:03:03.180> power<00:03:03.930> him

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
smart move but right here I'm power him

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.229 
smart move but right here I'm power him

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
couple head shot but he is blocking the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.390 
couple head shot but he is blocking the
head<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:09.090> he<00:03:09.180> gets<00:03:09.390> me<00:03:09.570> off<00:03:09.750> goes<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.950> head

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
head so he gets me off goes for the head

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.190 
head so he gets me off goes for the head
kick<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.030> that's<00:03:12.330> where<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.630> get<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.959> big

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
kick and that's where I get the big

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.280 
kick and that's where I get the big
right<00:03:13.500> hand<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.640> then<00:03:15.020> finish<00:03:16.020> them<00:03:16.050> off

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
right hand and then finish them off

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.680 
right hand and then finish them off
there<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.160> notice<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.730> don't<00:03:18.360> just

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
there and if you notice I don't just

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.710 
there and if you notice I don't just
span<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.200> strikes<00:03:19.500> when<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.830> get<00:03:20.010> them<00:03:20.100> down

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
span the strikes when I get them down

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.229 
span the strikes when I get them down
delay<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.410> I'm<00:03:22.530> able<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.920> actually<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.120> he

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
delay so I'm able to actually so he

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.360 
delay so I'm able to actually so he
doesn't<00:03:24.450> catch<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.750> but<00:03:25.410> that's<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.130> match

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
