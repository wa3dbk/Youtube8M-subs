00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
look like on a simple passcode you go

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.130 
look like on a simple passcode you go
switch<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.960> off<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.849> don't<00:02:08.849> ask<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> type<00:02:09.929> in
