00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
of the speeder bikes with the Clone
Trooper<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:20.420> he<00:00:21.420> has<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:22.260> tte<00:00:22.859> symbol<00:00:23.519> on

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
Trooper on it he has the a tte symbol on

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.359 
Trooper on it he has the a tte symbol on
the<00:00:24.570> side<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> his<00:00:24.960> arm<00:00:25.609> like<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:27.769> HT<00:00:28.769> te<00:00:28.949> clone

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the side of his arm like the HT te clone

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.640 
the side of his arm like the HT te clone
so<00:00:29.820> i'll<00:00:30.269> probably<00:00:30.539> keep<00:00:30.750> them<00:00:30.990> inside<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.349> AC

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
so i'll probably keep them inside the AC

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.180 
so i'll probably keep them inside the AC
tease<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.420> there's<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.750> acte<00:00:34.290> symbol<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
tease and there's the acte symbol on the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.910 
tease and there's the acte symbol on the
front<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.850> bigger<00:00:36.480> bike<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.649> I'm

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
front of the bigger bike so I'm

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160 
front of the bigger bike so I'm
wondering<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.790> somehow<00:00:39.149> these<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.780> supposed

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
wondering if somehow these are supposed

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950 
wondering if somehow these are supposed
to<00:00:40.320> like<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.820> attached<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> bottom<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to like be attached to the bottom of the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.040 
to like be attached to the bottom of the
eighth<00:00:43.079> ite<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.510> take<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
eighth ite and I think you can take the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
eighth ite and I think you can take the
front<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.590> off<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.579> really<00:00:47.730> like

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
front of it off but I don't really like

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
front of it off but I don't really like
that<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.530> scared

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that I think you kind of look scared

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.090 
that I think you kind of look scared
that<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:51.289> here's<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.649> actual

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.459 
that way and here's one of the actual
figures<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:54.180> there's<00:00:54.690> something<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.410> little

before<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.540> only<00:01:33.689> thing<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> don't

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
before and the only thing that I don't

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.350 
before and the only thing that I don't
like<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> think<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.060> could<00:01:36.270> have

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
like about it is I think they could have

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.350 
like about it is I think they could have
added<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.689> few<00:01:36.840> more<00:01:36.900> figures<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.119> had<00:01:39.119> them

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
added a few more figures and had them

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.230 
added a few more figures and had them
off<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.220> speeder<00:01:41.220> bike<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> they<00:01:42.060> did

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
off the speeder bike so that they did

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.350 
off the speeder bike so that they did
not<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.540> bowlegged<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.970> other<00:01:44.970> than<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
not get bowlegged but other than that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.200 
not get bowlegged but other than that
it's<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> pretty<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:46.200> battle<00:01:46.409> pack<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.210> heard
