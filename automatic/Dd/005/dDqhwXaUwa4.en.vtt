00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
with my machine gun it doesn't really

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.120

matter<00:02:15.330> how<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.690> guys<00:02:16.020> take<00:02:16.620> them<00:02:16.770> out<00:02:16.920> but

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.800 
matter how you guys take them out but
I'd<00:02:17.220> recommend<00:02:17.550> something<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.270> could<00:02:18.420> hit

them<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> distance<00:02:19.580> because<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.880> people

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
them at a distance because of people

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.540 
them at a distance because of people
with<00:02:21.960> pistols<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.560> be<00:02:22.710> accurate<00:02:23.160> at<00:02:23.340> times

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
with pistols can be accurate at times

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.050 
with pistols can be accurate at times
and<00:02:23.820> guns<00:02:24.720> still<00:02:25.050> do<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> lot<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.440> damage<00:02:26.060> so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and guns still do a lot of damage so

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.330 
and guns still do a lot of damage so
I'll<00:02:27.750> come<00:02:28.050> back<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.380> second<00:02:28.830> when<00:02:29.010> we<00:02:29.190> get

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
