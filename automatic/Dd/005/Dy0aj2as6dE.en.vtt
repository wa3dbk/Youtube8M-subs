 a pig and goku is supposed then as 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.510

 so interesting Mr. Pego cv which 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 We are going to be watching and we are going to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 be seeing how to turn them into the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739
 supersabio peak covers mind we are in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.180
 an epic adventure and ramÃ³n those signals 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 good before the re with check if we can 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.989
 use the challenge of the video they are going to make 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.570
 1700 I like it and well let's start 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.879
 out of rodeos then good first 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.680
 with we is to take a new order ok 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.350
 what is this parrot that we have to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.789
 llama vigo covers then we're taking out 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.440
 many of these that are obviously going to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.940
 being in the mines are not going to be in the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.009
 surface like I'm fine then 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.210
 right now then they're going to have to 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:14.850
 look for an ore rositas and clarito and bonito 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.430
 you can be the great peak that is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.260
 legendary we already have many of these 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 Now what can we do with these 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.460
 envelopes is to cook them then in any 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.890
 oven and he's going to give us our ingot 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.990
 peak ok with ingot of the pib 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 we can access here that comes 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.340
 being our armor we can 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.070
 create the helmet with the fret 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.880
 standard of helmets putting ingots 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.490
 instead 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.860
 in this way we can also create you 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.320
 the front of the pants and boots 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.880
 Mr. vigo q then good here 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.300
 I already have my armor as you can see it 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.429
 see very much thanks to when you put it on and 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.710
 eventually he has 2 more than 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.390
 resistance is the double resistant 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.520
 that the diamond so you 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.020
 they imagine that the armado de no 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.509
 has effects like many calls from 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.759
 which is super fast and you jump every 10 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.380
 meters and so now everything but it has 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.970
 much resistance then as some 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.190
 normalito because I already after both 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.780
 Armor effect that also tires 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.110
 because all the time so super fast 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.900
 it's normal here 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.670
 and call to be so powerful between 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.960
 quotes but because this is power or if 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.350
 But give what would then have 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.300
 the coupe peak and with the food of procuro 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.790
 I do not know but good would be created with 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.660
 normal pork chop the presentation of 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.820
 Castilla as I say coupÃ© with raw then 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.490
 we have to cook it and it gives us something 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.910
 q bacon and a little more red and that 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.610
 so as we can this glacier which 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.530
 it would be the tools because it asks you 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.120
 ingots and also hit q bacon so that 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.860
 we can grasp the tools that 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.140
 we have on this side are the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.900
 normal tools that we can then 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.550
 get out of any side then I can 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.950
 see any way because when you have 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.489
 a lot of damage as they can see 10 damage 8 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.170
 of the year 97 and well what the sada 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.209
 then let's kill those horses that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.920
 they are over there maybe they can see your 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.540
 good power because until then like 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.160
 you can see it's like it's a sword 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.470
 standard only with you cupey with 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.140
 then this way is also what 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.220
 the ax will be the peak 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.130
 the shovel and then the juve the cage 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.260
 yes yes I know roasted I think so yes I know 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.300
 I get the names wrong, I'm wrong 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.390
 and the branch months you are a little uncultivated 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.180
 Menso menso then you can see two 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.200
 hit the poor horse for here what 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.120
 that the first one we had put 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.190
 critical for jumping without criticism 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.770
 criticism psoe but not enough 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.470
 stuck 10 years later is a new 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.020
 option if they want to be the powerful but 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.000
 legendary kurt then well if I eat 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.709
 you can see this keeps everything 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.060
 that brings the mode because then here I know that 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.580
 we go to the section because I taught them 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.320
 everything because the smell in which it occupies and with 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.450
 the ingot the armor and the 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.150
 tools then sure that given 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.010
 that is barely there when creating more 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.709
 things about the mod then I imagine that 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.989
 not in a couple of weeks or I do not know if a 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.670
 couple of months or something like that you see here as 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.310
 than an update and you're going to make a 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.930
 uncle with more powerful yet then it 's 30 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.220
 de santes is interesting but they are going to 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.739
 session the mod today to those 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.019

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.640
 very good gentlemen and good the description 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.720
 and they have the mode for what it is that he wants 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.940
 install comes with installer 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.020
 as I do not understand anything install the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.940
 leading page with description 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.270
 download in the installer and read 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.980
