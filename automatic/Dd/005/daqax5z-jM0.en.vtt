00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
where gas can't spawn and get to go get

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.560 
where gas can't spawn and get to go get
them<00:00:22.770> it's<00:00:23.550> basically<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:23.940> like<00:00:24.090> savage<00:00:24.420> by

want them to fill them up because that's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.400 
want them to fill them up because that's
bad<00:01:01.739> um<00:01:02.360> you<00:01:03.360> see<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> gas<00:01:04.050> can<00:01:04.259> is

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
bad um you see that the gas can is

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.530 
bad um you see that the gas can is
yellow<00:01:04.739> or<00:01:04.920> orange<00:01:04.949> whatever<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
yellow or orange whatever when that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240 
yellow or orange whatever when that
happens<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.560> spitter<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
happens and your spitter you can

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.570 
happens and your spitter you can
actually<00:01:08.369> spit<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.890> if

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
actually spit on that and the and if

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
actually spit on that and the and if
it's<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.540> certain<00:01:12.869> amount<00:01:12.960> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it's in there for a certain amount of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
it's in there for a certain amount of
seconds<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> will<00:01:13.830> start<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.490> light<00:01:14.640> on

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
seconds it will start little light on

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
seconds it will start little light on
fire<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.119> disappear<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.630> can't<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
fire and disappear and they can't use it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
fire and disappear and they can't use it
and<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.220> crucial<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.180> winning<00:01:18.450> if

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and that's a very crucial to winning if

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060 
and that's a very crucial to winning if
they<00:01:18.659> ever<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.410> what<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.039> really

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
they ever do that but what you really

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700 
they ever do that but what you really
want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.399> do<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.580> spitter<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.229> right<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
want to do as a spitter is right like a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.460 
want to do as a spitter is right like a
a<00:01:23.130> second<00:01:24.090> before<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.479> start<00:01:24.720> filling<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> up

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a second before they start filling it up

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
a second before they start filling it up
spit<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> area<00:01:27.210> where<00:01:27.390> they're<00:01:27.899> filling

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
spit on the area where they're filling

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.930 
spit on the area where they're filling
it<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> spit<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.880> theyre

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
it up because if you spit as theyre

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.180 
it up because if you spit as theyre
filling<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.780> they're<00:01:31.200> gonna<00:01:31.350> finish

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
filling up and they're gonna finish

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.180 
filling up and they're gonna finish
filling<00:01:33.149> it<00:01:33.330> up<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.800> your<00:01:34.800> space<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.160> be

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
filling it up in your space can be

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.560 
filling it up in your space can be
worthless<00:01:35.399> you<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.789> this<00:01:35.940> bit<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
worthless you have this bit just a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.469 
worthless you have this bit just a
second<00:01:37.170> before<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.530> start<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.970> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
second before they start and then that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.370 
second before they start and then that
reduces<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> time<00:01:40.649> they<00:01:40.830> have<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
reduces the time they have and so on

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.330 
reduces the time they have and so on
because<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.800> bit<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> minute

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
because you only have a bit of a minute

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.400 
because you only have a bit of a minute
and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.550> each<00:01:44.729> gas<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.330> has<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.780> think<00:01:46.020> 45

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
and then each gas can has a I think 45

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.889 
and then each gas can has a I think 45
seconds<00:01:46.800> or<00:01:46.890> something<00:01:47.160> um<00:01:47.479> also<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.780> know

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
seconds or something um also to know

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.210 
seconds or something um also to know
because<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.410> was<00:01:49.440> unaware<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:49.979> until<00:01:50.190> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
because I was unaware of this until a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.779 
because I was unaware of this until a
couple<00:01:50.369> days<00:01:50.490> ago<00:01:50.610> um<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.800> clock<00:01:53.310> reaches

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
couple days ago um if the clock reaches

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.059 
couple days ago um if the clock reaches
zero<00:01:53.819> a<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.599> your<00:01:54.780> team<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.200> still<00:01:55.410> holding<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
zero a but your team is still holding a

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.969 
zero a but your team is still holding a
gas<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.209> still<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> pour<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
gas can you can still go and pour that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.469 
gas can you can still go and pour that
in<00:01:59.130> unless<00:01:59.550> you<00:01:59.700> drop<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.179> at<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> which

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
probably school I can over time but

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.539 
probably school I can over time but
there's<00:03:00.380> something<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:00.650> um<00:03:01.010> yeah<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.140> um<00:03:03.549> also

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
you get the advantage if you play second

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.590 
you get the advantage if you play second
of<00:03:07.010> knowing<00:03:07.489> where<00:03:07.730> everything<00:03:07.880> spawns

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
of knowing where everything spawns

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.069 
of knowing where everything spawns
because<00:03:10.209> there<00:03:11.209> are<00:03:11.299> they<00:03:11.510> respond<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.049> the

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
because there are they respond in the

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.420 
because there are they respond in the
same<00:03:12.170> place<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.040> that's<00:03:13.220> cool

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
same place so that's cool

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.030 
same place so that's cool
yeah<00:03:16.090> gah<00:03:16.870> don't<00:03:17.019> buy<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.319> charge<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.739> great

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.089 
yeah gah don't buy that charge a great
spot<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.640> charger<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.329> thought<00:03:19.750> as<00:03:20.469> much<00:03:20.680> as

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
spot for a charger I thought as much as

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.660 
spot for a charger I thought as much as
I<00:03:21.280> got<00:03:21.459> owned<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:22.120> was<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.239> great<00:03:22.359> spot

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.600 

so<00:03:28.240> this<00:03:28.750> like<00:03:29.410> every<00:03:29.709> game<00:03:29.920> Oh<00:03:29.950> basically

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
so this like every game Oh basically

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.160 
so this like every game Oh basically
requires<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:31.120> lot<00:03:31.270> of<00:03:31.300> teamwork<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.840> lot<00:03:32.020> of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
requires a lot of teamwork a lot of

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.550 
requires a lot of teamwork a lot of
coordinate<00:03:32.830> coordination<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:34.260> mics<00:03:35.260> are

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
coordinate coordination and mics are

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.670 
coordinate coordination and mics are
always<00:03:36.489> handy<00:03:37.920> yeah

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.630 

sometimes<00:03:44.349> your<00:03:45.349> team<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:45.829> gonna<00:03:45.980> split<00:03:46.430> up

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
sometimes your team is gonna split up

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.130 
sometimes your team is gonna split up
and<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.180> don't<00:03:47.329> want<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.510> happen<00:03:47.959> because

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
and you don't want that happen because

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.470 
and you don't want that happen because
that's<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:49.099> but<00:03:49.700> one<00:03:49.909> thing<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.269> found

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
that's just that but one thing I found

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.039 
that's just that but one thing I found
to<00:03:50.810> be<00:03:50.840> very<00:03:50.989> effective<00:03:51.590> in<00:03:52.750> especially<00:03:53.750> in

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
to be very effective in especially in
