 attached to the vehicles so you have to do is 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.880
 must put into practice put into operation each of 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.570
 the elements above all elements this mechanical as is the impulse pump 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.950
 the year we come to the tic 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.700
 an example of revision 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.830
 with each of the elements that are in it in the vehicles of the different 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
 vehicles for this art this checking your post 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.300
 tracy mainly crazy makes compiled the data of the avenues 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.560
 of two vehicles of all two are the modern goalkeepers 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.930
 It was a procedure based on car wishes 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.240
 owned or suddenly prepared others some of them 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.210
 despite the fact that the most accurate probes above all fires 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.960
 and then if there is a traffic accident 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.020
 coordination 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.940
 ea - so far the summer months 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.070
 take a camera 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.860
 Ivana camera 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.180
 it's enough strength and for real 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.370
 to the control center 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.429
 of the fireman 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.910
 gives all the information run abc 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.200
 it's fire coordinates of these two vehicles hot spots 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.980
 the fire have moved more
