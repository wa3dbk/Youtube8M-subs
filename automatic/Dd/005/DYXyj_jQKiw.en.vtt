00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.219
 hello friends welcome once again to a 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.320
 new 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.299
 vitoria on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.970
 teach them how they can start their 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.520
 Windows 8 computer in Safe Mode to 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.500
 request of many users that end 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.099
 of acquiring the operating system and 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.230
 they ask if any way to start in 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.119
 Safe mode before or in versions 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.930
 previous windows 8 simply with the 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.620
 narrow key can enter the mode 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.960
 sure but apparently this option is 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.270
 disabled so let's teach them 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.120
 how can they do it there are two ways 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.730
 one using the ones that is the commands 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.370
 of the system that is a bit more tedious 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.739
 especially for non- advanced users and 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.770
 the other is using the command 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.980
 execute is very easy I simply carry 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.739
 already using a shortcut on the keyboard there 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.620
 I'm going to put here on the virtual keyboard 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.649
 with the windows key plus the letter r 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.229
 let's remove the keyboard here we go 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.929
 to open this window to execute and there 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.550
 that write this command more conflict 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.790
 once described 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 we are and we open another window where 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.180
 we have to go to the start option and 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.610
 normally this option is disabled 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.570
 activate this boot to proof of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.550
 mistakes and usually usually 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.440
 activate this option that is minimal that you 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.290
 is going to start the operating system but 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.880
 almost almost Colombia in the programs 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.070
 basic almost without most of the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.750
 drivers or the drivers I advise 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.540
 always says on the internet and now 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.670
 I advise you to start the safe mode in 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.340
 this option the network so that you 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.800
 can access at the same time the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.590
 Internet connection and can by 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.660
 example do a check of your disk 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.450
 hard to uninstall some program that are 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.550
 difficult to install in normal mode 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.320
 but if they appear in safe mode they can 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.690
 distar like antivirus and things like that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.000
 once you have selected the mode 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.610
 although they want to start their system 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.130
 operative we click on do in 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.110
 apply and then accept and we will 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.360
 ask us to start the operating system 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.490
 the safe way that once they restart 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.650
 the operating system is going to appear this 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.020
 image so you can appreciate here 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.970
 because I'm not going to restart 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.740
 the computer but once you 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.050
 restart is going to restart in this 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.170
 screen where you can choose the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.530
 option that you want to start your 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.940
 computer for already once you activate 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.980
 this option every time you start the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.920
 ordered is going to start in that mode 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.480
 insurance and they're going to have to go back to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 do the same procedure we are going to 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.300
 say go out and start the same 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.760
 procedure with with the shortcut remember 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.990
 which is the windows key + the letter r and 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.720
 return to the same 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.000
 we accept and we go to the option of 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.880
 start and you have to turn it off again 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.040
 so that the computer can start 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.460
 every time they restart it restarts in 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.530
 Normal mode we accept apply and we will 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.350
 to ask us to restart you already 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.120
 restart and it will restart now 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.040
 normally in normal mode with all the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.290
 attributes and characteristics 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.549
 that acquires the operating system I hope 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.040
 that you like this video tutorials about 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.290
 everything that is useful to you especially 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.560
 those users who ask what 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.450
 way there is to enter or start the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.640
 operating system windows 8 in mode 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.209
 sure see you next 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.209
