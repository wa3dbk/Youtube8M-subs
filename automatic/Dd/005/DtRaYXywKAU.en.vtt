flame test we tested our product against
competition<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.990> see<00:01:57.260> if<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:58.280> retains<00:01:58.820> the

heat better the results are pretty

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.770 
heat better the results are pretty
amazing<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:03.200> one<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.830> stays<00:02:04.640> hot<00:02:05.119> longer<00:02:05.570> is

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
amazing the one that stays hot longer is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.430 
amazing the one that stays hot longer is
the<00:02:06.619> flame<00:02:06.860> from<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.580> memory<00:02:07.880> then<00:02:08.630> comes<00:02:09.110> cast

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the flame from a memory then comes cast

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.670 
the flame from a memory then comes cast
iron<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:09.950> then<00:02:10.640> comes<00:02:11.000> cast<00:02:11.690> aluminum

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
iron and then comes cast aluminum

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.149 
iron and then comes cast aluminum
that<00:02:14.519> goes<00:02:14.730> down<00:02:14.939> pretty<00:02:15.180> quickly<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.829> on<00:02:16.829> top

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
that goes down pretty quickly and on top

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.000 
that goes down pretty quickly and on top
of<00:02:17.189> that<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.959> thirty<00:02:19.650> percent<00:02:20.870> lighter

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
of that it is thirty percent lighter

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.720 
of that it is thirty percent lighter
than<00:02:23.010> cast<00:02:23.700> iron

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.140 

the<00:02:28.269> other<00:02:28.420> test<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:30.159> mechanical<00:02:30.489> tests

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the other test is the mechanical tests

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.449 
the other test is the mechanical tests
we<00:02:31.840> want<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.200> make<00:02:32.349> sure<00:02:32.379> that<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.069> doesn't

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
we want to make sure that it doesn't

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.940 
we want to make sure that it doesn't
chip<00:02:33.760> even<00:02:34.269> when<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.599> bang<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.900> begins<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> the
