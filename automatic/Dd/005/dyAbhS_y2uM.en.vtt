00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.780 
character so there was one upside to it
and<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:55.150> also<00:03:55.389> pretty<00:03:55.959> catchy<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:56.919> i<00:03:57.160> won't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
and it's also pretty catchy but i won't

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.099 
and it's also pretty catchy but i won't
say<00:03:57.970> it's<00:03:58.090> really<00:03:58.150> catching<00:03:58.599> in<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.750> good<00:03:58.930> way

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
say it's really catching in a good way

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.599 
say it's really catching in a good way
it<00:03:59.349> can<00:03:59.530> get<00:03:59.650> stuck<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.099> your<00:04:00.190> head<00:04:00.370> pretty

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
it can get stuck in your head pretty

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.119 
it can get stuck in your head pretty
easily<00:04:00.879> I<00:04:01.329> had<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.379> find<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.709> one<00:04:02.769> out<00:04:02.980> the

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
easily I had to find that one out the

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.210 
easily I had to find that one out the
hard<00:04:03.280> way<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:04.480> next<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:05.290> one<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.739> one<00:04:05.949> is<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
hard way but next this one is one is the

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.199 
hard way but next this one is one is the
worst<00:04:06.720> tal<00:04:07.720> hopper<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.730> don't<00:04:09.730> even<00:04:09.879> know<00:04:10.120> what

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
worst tal hopper I don't even know what

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.960 
worst tal hopper I don't even know what
this<00:04:10.329> one<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.569> called<00:04:10.959> if<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:12.400> don't<00:04:12.609> know<00:04:12.790> who

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
this one is called if you don't know who

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.720 
this one is called if you don't know who
TL<00:04:13.329> hopper<00:04:13.720> was<00:04:14.010> well<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.129> probably<00:04:15.430> didn't

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
TL hopper was well you probably didn't

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.569 
TL hopper was well you probably didn't
want<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:16.199> but<00:04:17.370> he<00:04:18.370> has<00:04:18.669> this<00:04:19.030> plumber<00:04:19.989> gimmick

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
want to but he has this plumber gimmick

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.040 
want to but he has this plumber gimmick
so<00:04:21.579> you<00:04:21.669> can<00:04:21.940> probably<00:04:22.270> guess<00:04:22.419> right<00:04:22.780> off<00:04:22.900> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
so you can probably guess right off the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.459 
so you can probably guess right off the
bat<00:04:23.229> what<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.680> kind<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.520> theme<00:04:24.729> song<00:04:25.000> would<00:04:25.180> be
