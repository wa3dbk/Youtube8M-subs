00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello everyone today we are here in dragon 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.870
 city ​​in the video of the third quest of 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.750
 the Egyptian island and 1 and I 've had it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.240
 very fast the second quest and it's because 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.090
 I had to pay gems definitely 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.740
 for jema 251 if there were not really 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.960
 if not the gems that I had already gone 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.880
 saving for that I have now three for 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 buy the mummy lake that I have here 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.610
 incubating is this you see a little more 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 big I do not know why I guess because I do not 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.920
 the drawing will be well done and then as 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.800
 It's special because they have done it 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.550
 but well I notice it as different I do not know 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.199
 how you will see it and you have six hours left 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 I'm going to accelerate it because I like the 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.340
 things 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.220
 and the third quest in this in which we 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.380
 dan 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.610
 this dragon that I saw here 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.080
 it is the dragon sphinx that what is called 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.570
 I'm not going to put that dragon name 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.430
 sphinx 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 but that is what they ask us is 96 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.600
 which is mating dragons 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.930
 was asking us 2700 the last time I think 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.759
 that were 900 and for every amount of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 hours that you need to match what 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.850
 they give you a quantity of gold 6 I do not know 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.009
 how much exactly but an amount 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 now a new object that are the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.590
 sphinxes and we have to win tournaments 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.780
 to collect it I have three but 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.060
 I think since I have this quest 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.979
 open on the cattle a bone that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.869
 they accumulate and like the other objects 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.759
 although I do not put you the cattle but 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.950
 I'll accumulating it now no 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.649
 may l 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.420
 give the stadium up to two 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.070
 hours but good I'll do it and with getting 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.320
 in one of these and what it asks of us 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.049
 that bothers me so much because food 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.119
 they do not have food again this time in 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.980
 more quantity as it was not quite before 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.780
 for more quantity 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.850
 and well I think that this one 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.159
 the last one that I'll buy myself I do not know if it's going 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.270
 to get the gem are 19 days and 20 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.509
 hours 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.519
 and earning more or less two gems per day 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.930
 I would not get there, I'll have to earn some 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.090
 three gems per day which is very 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.470
 complicated so I do not know what to say 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.260
 besides, I not only win all the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 I lose some fights so I do not have 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.470
 no idea what to say or if I'm going to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.959
 buy me the same this I do not have it 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.099
 be sure not unless it's something 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.840
 very very easy last position but as 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.849
 keep asking for this amount of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.459
 food I do not get it 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.310
 I guess it's the price without paying the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:44.440
 food will be in a more or less in some 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.349
 55 gems I guess at the same are 94 to these 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.690
 94 gems you have to subtract three times two 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.709
 fiefdoms and 14-14 of the other three that 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.709
 I will surely get 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:02.540
 20 614 are 40 50 then 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.129
 94 - 50 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.129
 they are 44 not 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.069
 It seems to me very little or I was wrong I do not know 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.069
 the facts and memory 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:22.040
 the program 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.040
 94 - minus 50 are 44 then that 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.030
 good if they are 44 and I was not wrong or 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.280
 ok because 44 is no longer is still 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.490
 pretty good but there are fifty and 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.720
 peak I do not know how much will be left if you want 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.850
 go so that when you have completed everything 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.470
 less in the food record a video for 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.660
 see how many gems are really because 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.200
 he wants I do it although I see it a bit 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.239
 nonsense but good 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.550
 what else to say is something else in the world 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.190
 of the combats that I do not have either 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.250
 now available to teach it but 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.950
 Well, many of you told me that life 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.599
 of the dragons that now fight 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.129
 they are different if it is a different one I do not know if 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.099
 It will be the same during the event 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.769
 then they remove it but they take it away and leave 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.269
 accustoming some we have asked 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.090
 why you have so little life to your 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.650
 dragons that easy now life if I 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.030
 I give this dragon for example you see 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.389
 that has two bronze stars and 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.180
 the more fights you win the more 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.060
 more attack had that in front now not 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.099
 now it's more attack more life I say 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.110
 because my dragon soccer player who is the 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.529
 that I use for fight I think that one level 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.569
 15 is 330 silver that you just finished 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.610
 win before ni to 2 and had four thousand 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.960
 a hundred and a half of life and nothing else has 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.660
 got a little star pl the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.820
 next and had 4200 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.900
 the belts of life that is to say it increased me 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.880
 a little why there is that difference 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.160
 I suppose they have done it on their own 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.510
 because I for example is something that 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.110
 bothered and it was that I was fighting with the 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.050
 Chameleon is always that I have a gold 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.460
 and all because I use it always no longer what 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.380
 I use so much because I have better ones 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.140
 but I used it before and had 4000 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.510
 of life and is that I came out a hybrid 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.700
 rare if I had the hybrid for about 6 thousand 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.820
 and peak of life and over in memory of a 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.510
 hit and I had it very complicated because 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.400
 what 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.200
 the rare hybrids were interested in the idea 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.120
 It does not have many lives there 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.910
 a little bit of opportunity to win with 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.290
 normal dragons those normal dragons 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.740
 is that they have gold stars because the 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.080
 my own 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.819
 without gold stars I think they would have 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.069
 very little life I have found a dragon 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.910
 alpine like this one as he had a thousand 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.310
 of lives 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.080
 I stayed the same because I do not know what it is that 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.509
 you will see balanced the game but 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.289
 good good that's all I wanted 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.349
 comment you have already seen here what 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.580
 ask you explained how you get it if 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.860
 you have any doubt put it in the 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.509
 comments that you answered or I see 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.040
 that even among yourselves 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.570
 Answer , which I really like 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.650
 if I have to not be responding to 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.389
 the best 20 comments there 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.560
 and nothing else I hope you liked it 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.860
 this new video 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.840
 and see you in the next 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.849
 I do not know what I'll do anymore because 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.300
 I have thought more dragon city cdc to 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.069
 air living but I guess only 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.249
 upload videos of dragon city when there 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.899
 something special or when there are events 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.159
 and as in this event I do not know if it's going to 

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:27.699
 get to the room for the same thing this is the 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:29.979
 last video of the event we'll see if 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.199
 you want is attentive to the videos that 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.050
 I upload subscribe to my channel that I have 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:38.060
