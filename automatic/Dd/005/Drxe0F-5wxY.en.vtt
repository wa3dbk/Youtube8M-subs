actually<00:00:18.840> beat<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> 8800<00:00:20.250> GTX<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> 3d

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
actually beat the 8800 GTX in the 3d

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.960 
actually beat the 8800 GTX in the 3d
mark<00:00:21.900> oh<00:00:22.080> six<00:00:22.710> now<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.310> may<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.460> beat<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.880> in

the<00:00:25.740> Nvidia<00:00:26.130> engine<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.119> fully

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the Nvidia engine this one is fully

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.710 
the Nvidia engine this one is fully
DirectX<00:00:28.170> 10<00:00:28.349> compatible<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.609> smokes<00:00:30.240> I'm

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
DirectX 10 compatible and it smokes I'm

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
DirectX 10 compatible and it smokes I'm
not<00:00:30.900> sure<00:00:31.019> what<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.289> did<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:31.710> but

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
not sure what they did to this one but

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.940 
not sure what they did to this one but
it's<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:33.480> fast<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> when<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> run<00:00:34.649> two<00:00:34.860> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it's really fast and when you run two of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.010 
it's really fast and when you run two of
these<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.219> crossfire<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> huge

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
these in crossfire that you get a huge

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.330 
these in crossfire that you get a huge
performance<00:00:37.290> boost<00:00:37.649> cuz<00:00:37.800> these<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.100> more

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
performance boost cuz these are more

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
performance boost cuz these are more
scalable<00:00:38.730> than<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> Nvidia<00:00:39.510> ones<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:40.230> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
scalable than the Nvidia ones now you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.900 
scalable than the Nvidia ones now you
guys<00:00:40.739> are<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.250> arguing<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.700> this

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
guys are going to be arguing about this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.040 
guys are going to be arguing about this
I<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.210> already<00:00:42.360> hear<00:00:42.450> right<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:42.930> going
