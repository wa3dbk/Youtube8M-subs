 feel special attractive and desirable 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.370

 with the right foot however the level 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.280
 of appropriate flirting will depend a lot on 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.860
 If you still do not know how strong they are 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.530
 your thoughts for him have to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.200
 know because I wanted to feel something serious

 no one takes a more important step yet if 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.010
 is not able to correspond to your 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.130
 feelings it 's better that you know what

 idea to tell him that you love him in the relationship 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.690
