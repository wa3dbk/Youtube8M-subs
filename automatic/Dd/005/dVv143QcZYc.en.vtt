00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.340
 it seems wonderful to me in a madman that in 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.110
 different videos he talks to his friend 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.110
 read the crazy 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.160
 well there is a game in which I did not want 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 but we will play as an exception 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.260
 I had been traumatized with this 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.540
 stanley game of the mouse pitzalis and that 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.890
 real game 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:34.090
 that is, it was one of the most 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.090
 how can you tell him 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 strong crashes that I've had throughout 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.390
 my filthy life and we're going to start the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.129
 video since there are 1000 cuts are not 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.660
 I had forgotten this video is for the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.300
 1000 the cuts had already asked me about 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.730
 how many crazy I will tell you thousands and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.260
 thousands but about 34 you take it out there 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.329
 they told me he hears but after so many 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.329
 things like we did with the video 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:11.130
 let's give it if I was in that I put it 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.950
 make a land of the whore by the way 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.040
 humble and little we're going at least a little 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.159
 because I'm using the lamp tip 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.190
 from my humble phone and I'm also 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.030
 using remember my room camera 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 of megapixels or is it the crap plays 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.060
 let's start with the video 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.450
 I want to continue / type like that 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.240
 suffers from cocaine overdose I do not know why 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.690
 what if Mariano himself but a little more 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.690
 advanced 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.720
 by the way it is at night it does not happen that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.880
 this time I hope I did not get burned 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.880
 light bulb or any of this we go 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.190
 the state was not playing I do not know about that 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.190
 scare that is already not immune 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.460
 God has wrecked that they remember that a 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.460
 point 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.590
 all the time 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.380
 the sounds are what you gave us 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.690
 for me 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.650
 giving away better 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.110
