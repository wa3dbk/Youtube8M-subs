our top story mikado the company heading
the<00:00:10.840> international<00:00:11.440> space<00:00:11.680> project

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
the international space project

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.650 
the international space project
announced<00:00:12.490> the<00:00:12.790> launch<00:00:12.969> of<00:00:13.150> an<00:00:13.240> additional

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
announced the launch of an additional

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.590 
announced the launch of an additional
solar<00:00:13.960> power<00:00:14.260> generator<00:00:14.799> satellite<00:00:15.600> the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
solar power generator satellite the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.160 
solar power generator satellite the
announcement<00:00:17.140> comes<00:00:17.350> as<00:00:17.500> a<00:00:17.530> surprise<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.949> many

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
announcement comes as a surprise to many

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.870 
announcement comes as a surprise to many
so<00:00:20.170> what<00:00:20.410> exactly<00:00:20.860> is<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.100> solar<00:00:21.550> power

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
so what exactly is a solar power

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:32.010 
so what exactly is a solar power
generator<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:30.220> an<00:00:30.670> earth-based<00:00:31.270> station

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
generator first an earth-based station

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.060 
generator first an earth-based station
transmits<00:00:32.320> a<00:00:32.800> guidance<00:00:33.190> signal<00:00:35.070> upon

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
transmits a guidance signal upon

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.700 
transmits a guidance signal upon
receiving<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.760> signal<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.840> satellite<00:00:38.320> uses

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
receiving the signal the satellite uses

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.800 
receiving the signal the satellite uses
a<00:00:38.739> large<00:00:39.100> mirror<00:00:39.579> to<00:00:39.940> generate<00:00:40.329> electricity

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
a large mirror to generate electricity

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.479 
a large mirror to generate electricity
from<00:00:41.410> solar<00:00:41.680> power<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:44.010> electricity<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.220> then

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
from solar power the electricity is then

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.910 
from solar power the electricity is then
converted<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:46.300> microwave<00:00:46.870> radiation<00:00:47.649> and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
converted to microwave radiation and

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.240 
converted to microwave radiation and
sent<00:00:48.340> down<00:00:48.579> to<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.970> ground<00:00:49.210> station<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
sent down to the ground station the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.280 
sent down to the ground station the
ground<00:00:51.550> station<00:00:52.180> then<00:00:52.480> converts<00:00:53.079> the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
ground station then converts the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.470 
ground station then converts the
microwave<00:00:53.860> radiation<00:00:54.489> back<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:55.030> electricity

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
microwave radiation back to electricity

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.260 
microwave radiation back to electricity
which<00:00:56.200> can<00:00:56.410> then<00:00:56.590> be<00:00:56.649> used<00:00:59.610> the<00:01:00.610> question<00:01:01.059> is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
which can then be used the question is

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:32.130 
which can then be used the question is
