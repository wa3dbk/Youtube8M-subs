00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.860
 Hello. I saw the Lego mailbox today. 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.660
 It's all about knowing that a friend is a house or an old house , but what is it? 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 I'll dig it when I get there. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.180
 If you see a little hair at that time 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:27.300
 Well, it's a little different from the characters, 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.580
 I've seen two practice sessions in the Conor Olivia. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.100
 Like this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:41.790
 b but little in the middle so the two suspects'm so kkat the world 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:47.219
 I've laid it on again, and it's like a rosy piece of room. 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.969
 He said nothing like your own network is laid here, some people here see Olivia. 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.829
 Do not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:58.920
 I took my hair off Libya's hair and changed my hair like this. 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.719
 It's the same as Bolivia, but the hair is the hair of the great mother. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.440
 I'm out of shape. 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.370
 He has a man with a stone pink color. 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.920
 There is 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:18.799
 Wait a minute, please. 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.150
 I have a salty bay. I have a weak faculty and I have a living room . 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:27.710
 I changed a lot. 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:32.720
 That's a lot like that. 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:37.070
 I can not do this. Well , here's some good people here . 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.420

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.720

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.720

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.789
 So I have to make sure of the existing main pool. 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:00.420
 And I just like this place then huh haebwatneunde towards this slippery village r 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.979
 You can appreciate the trip next to the approach line of the crime here. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.679
 Next've heard tell once again dressed up in the colors of our study 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.789
 The strength of the pawn was 5 paul 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.789
 Poplet AS 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.660
 That's what makes the pair so 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.630
 Make it . 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.600
 Now Olivia's room 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:33.540
 I made it the same as before. 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.290
 This is, I've created a new one in the master bedroom which has two beds u dolpi 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.700
 Will 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:44.250
 It's not a souvenir . 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.550
 This is also what I had to do. Readers originally taken Olivia's original 6 o'clock 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.810
 it is 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:56.480

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:00.470
 So everyone says that, as everyone in this way do so once 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.349
 I heard a mixed phrase 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.290
 I think it would be nice. 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.290
 Then Yang Yang 1 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.420
