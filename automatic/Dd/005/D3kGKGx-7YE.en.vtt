it<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:44.960> little<00:04:45.050> bit<00:04:45.409> so<00:04:46.370> that's<00:04:46.729> my<00:04:47.120> box<00:04:47.330> it's

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
it a little bit so that's my box it's

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.510 
it a little bit so that's my box it's
the<00:04:48.020> front<00:04:48.379> that<00:04:48.529> I<00:04:48.650> had<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.949> trouble<00:04:49.370> with

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
the front that I had the trouble with

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.129 
the front that I had the trouble with
though<00:04:50.110> okay<00:04:51.110> so<00:04:55.300> it's<00:04:56.300> straight<00:04:56.719> it<00:04:56.870> doesn't

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
though okay so it's straight it doesn't

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.740 
though okay so it's straight it doesn't
look<00:04:57.199> presentable<00:04:57.789> okay<00:04:58.789> so<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.270> is<00:04:59.539> the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
look presentable okay so this is the

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.619 
look presentable okay so this is the
lock<00:05:00.279> this<00:05:01.279> is<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> bottom<00:05:01.879> part<00:05:02.060> of<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.389> lock

in<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.669> end<00:05:49.789> I<00:05:49.969> ended<00:05:50.149> up<00:05:50.270> finding<00:05:50.479> this

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:50.689 
in the end I ended up finding this

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.740 
in the end I ended up finding this
little<00:05:50.899> bit<00:05:51.139> of<00:05:51.169> trim<00:05:51.889> here<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.659> putting<00:05:53.659> it

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
little bit of trim here and putting it

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.839 
little bit of trim here and putting it
around<00:05:53.839> the<00:05:54.169> lock<00:05:54.379> just<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.889> tidy<00:05:55.219> up<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.490> mess

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
around the lock just to tidy up the mess

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.399 
around the lock just to tidy up the mess
that<00:05:55.879> I'd<00:05:56.210> made<00:05:56.479> I'm<00:05:56.659> still<00:05:56.960> not<00:05:57.110> a<00:05:57.139> hundred

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
that I'd made I'm still not a hundred

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.429 
that I'd made I'm still not a hundred
percent<00:05:57.620> happy<00:05:57.860> with<00:05:58.219> it<00:05:58.339> but<00:05:58.490> I<00:05:58.520> think<00:05:58.849> it's

00:05:59.429 --> 00:05:59.439 
percent happy with it but I think it's

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.559 
percent happy with it but I think it's
it's<00:06:00.439> you<00:06:00.979> know<00:06:01.069> kind<00:06:01.430> of<00:06:01.550> acceptable<00:06:02.270> I<00:06:02.300> think

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
it's you know kind of acceptable I think

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.570 
it's you know kind of acceptable I think
and<00:06:02.750> then<00:06:03.289> I've<00:06:03.439> made<00:06:03.649> this<00:06:03.800> little<00:06:03.979> crystal

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
and then I've made this little crystal

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.399 
and then I've made this little crystal
