00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
know what I would call it a issue maybe

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.339 
know what I would call it a issue maybe
it<00:00:20.020> has<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:21.009> do<00:00:21.160> with<00:00:21.189> the<00:00:21.840> anti-lock<00:00:22.840> braking

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
it has to do with the anti-lock braking

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.499 
it has to do with the anti-lock braking
system<00:00:23.860> and<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.689> xtronic<00:00:27.509> continuously

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
system and the xtronic continuously

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.620 
system and the xtronic continuously
variable<00:00:28.989> transmission<00:00:29.829> on<00:00:30.070> this<00:00:30.970> model<00:00:31.300> and

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
variable transmission on this model and

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.520 
variable transmission on this model and
basically<00:00:32.500> what<00:00:32.800> happened<00:00:33.250> as<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:34.630> was<00:00:34.960> driving

short at a yellow light and there was
almost<00:00:41.380> a<00:00:41.820> six-car<00:00:42.820> pileup<00:00:43.300> so<00:00:44.170> full<00:00:44.530> antilock

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
almost a six-car pileup so full antilock

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.090 
almost a six-car pileup so full antilock
braking<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.580> stuff<00:00:46.230> Stan<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.470> wanted<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:47.860> try

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
braking and stuff Stan I wanted to try

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.890 
braking and stuff Stan I wanted to try
out<00:00:48.130> again<00:00:48.400> just<00:00:48.730> test<00:00:49.060> my<00:00:49.210> brakes<00:00:49.510> see<00:00:49.750> what

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
out again just test my brakes see what

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.830 
out again just test my brakes see what
it<00:00:49.990> was<00:00:50.079> like<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.760> remembered<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.480> saw<00:00:52.810> a

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
it was like and I remembered I saw a

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.690 
it was like and I remembered I saw a
video<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.320> couple<00:00:53.680> years<00:00:53.890> back<00:00:54.100> featuring<00:00:54.640> a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
video a couple years back featuring a

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.770 
video a couple years back featuring a
Nissan<00:00:55.120> Versa

Nissan Versa

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.760 
Nissan Versa
of<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.770> same<00:00:57.040> CVT<00:00:57.850> transmission<00:00:58.630> and<00:00:58.870> when<00:00:59.590> he

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
of the same CVT transmission and when he

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
of the same CVT transmission and when he
stopped<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.550> went<00:01:01.090> directly<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:02.310> throttle<00:01:03.310> it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
stopped and went directly to throttle it

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.370 
stopped and went directly to throttle it
would<00:01:05.110> just<00:01:05.409> hover<00:01:05.860> around<00:01:06.070> 2,000<00:01:06.970> rpm<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.720> a

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
would just hover around 2,000 rpm in a

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.340 
would just hover around 2,000 rpm in a
wooden<00:01:08.770> accelerate<00:01:09.640> swiftly<00:01:10.360> or<00:01:10.630> like<00:01:10.900> normal

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
wooden accelerate swiftly or like normal

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.700 
wooden accelerate swiftly or like normal
where<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.530> would<00:01:11.770> jump<00:01:12.370> up<00:01:12.550> to<00:01:12.790> about<00:01:13.030> 4<00:01:13.710> 4500

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
where I would jump up to about 4 4500

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.770 
where I would jump up to about 4 4500
rpm<00:01:15.100> as<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.610> normally<00:01:15.729> does<00:01:16.150> in<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.450> CVT

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
rpm as it normally does in the CVT

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.960 
rpm as it normally does in the CVT
transmission<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.380> tried<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.790> was

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
transmission so I tried it and it was

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.430 
transmission so I tried it and it was
true<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:23.110> did<00:01:23.470> happen<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.780> kind<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.229> like

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
true this did happen and it kind of like

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.030 
true this did happen and it kind of like
I<00:01:26.710> don't<00:01:27.340> see<00:01:27.640> why<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:29.290> just<00:01:29.440> an<00:01:29.560> issue<00:01:29.770> that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
I don't see why it's just an issue that

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.130 
I don't see why it's just an issue that
I<00:01:30.159> want<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.580> see<00:01:30.760> if<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:30.970> can<00:01:31.150> address<00:01:31.360> on<00:01:31.630> camera

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
I want to see if I can address on camera

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.710 
I want to see if I can address on camera
because<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.890> previous<00:01:33.549> video<00:01:34.090> if<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:34.479> find

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
because the previous video if you find

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.880 
because the previous video if you find
it<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.680> show<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.490> kind<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:37.030> low-quality

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it it show it on a kind of low-quality

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.990 
it it show it on a kind of low-quality

that blah blah blah but then I tried it
it<00:01:45.220> did<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:46.500> nice<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.619> see<00:01:47.799> so<00:01:47.830> we're<00:01:48.549> going<00:01:48.670> to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
it did so nice to see so we're going to

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.380 
it did so nice to see so we're going to
go<00:01:48.850> try<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.119> out<00:01:49.299> alright<00:01:50.610> ok<00:01:51.610> now<00:01:51.790> as<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.240> can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
go try it out alright ok now as you can

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.890 
go try it out alright ok now as you can
see<00:01:52.630> there's<00:01:53.229> in<00:01:53.380> this<00:01:54.100> cars<00:01:54.369> stalk<00:01:55.180> nothing

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
see there's in this cars stalk nothing

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.260 
see there's in this cars stalk nothing
wrong<00:01:56.080> with<00:01:56.320> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
wrong with it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.210 
wrong with it
transmission<00:01:58.270> acts<00:01:58.510> like<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:59.020> normal<00:01:59.470> CVT

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
transmission acts like a normal CVT

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.880 
transmission acts like a normal CVT
would<00:02:00.460> kind<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:01.540> know<00:02:01.659> increases<00:02:02.259> rpm<00:02:02.710> and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
would kind of you know increases rpm and

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.070 
would kind of you know increases rpm and
then<00:02:02.979> as<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.340> belt<00:02:03.520> rotates<00:02:03.970> around<00:02:04.150> it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
then as the belt rotates around it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.130 
then as the belt rotates around it
reduces<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:06.360> since<00:02:07.360> there<00:02:07.509> actually<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.110> no

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
reduces it since there actually is no

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.289 
reduces it since there actually is no
set<00:02:08.649> gear<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.459> want<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.729> show<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.200> know

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
set gear so I just want to show you know

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.670 
set gear so I just want to show you know
that<00:02:13.299> I<00:02:13.329> don't<00:02:13.689> like<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:14.230> know<00:02:14.319> I'm<00:02:14.439> driving
