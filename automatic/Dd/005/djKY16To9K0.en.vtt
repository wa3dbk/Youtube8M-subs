let's<00:00:04.700> get<00:00:04.850> started<00:00:05.330> under<00:00:05.600> the<00:00:05.630> hood<00:00:11.230> all<00:00:12.230> of

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
let's get started under the hood all of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.039 
let's get started under the hood all of
the<00:00:12.530> daily<00:00:12.889> driver<00:00:13.219> CDL<00:00:13.910> checks<00:00:14.299> are<00:00:14.480> located

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
the daily driver CDL checks are located

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.720 
the daily driver CDL checks are located
here<00:00:15.320> at<00:00:15.499> the<00:00:15.559> left-hand<00:00:15.919> side<00:00:16.340> of<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.580> engine

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
here at the left-hand side of the engine

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.330 
here at the left-hand side of the engine
this<00:00:17.600> makes<00:00:17.930> it<00:00:18.110> easy<00:00:18.440> and<00:00:18.590> quick<00:00:18.980> for<00:00:19.220> the
