00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
right in and it just sort of pushes down

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.410 
right in and it just sort of pushes down
and<00:02:09.440> then<00:02:10.440> we've<00:02:10.649> got<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.860> top<00:02:11.190> case<00:02:11.459> which

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420

and then we've got the top case which
slides<00:02:12.720> down

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
slides down

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.350 
slides down
walks<00:02:13.740> together<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.580> fits<00:02:14.820> really<00:02:15.060> nicely

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
