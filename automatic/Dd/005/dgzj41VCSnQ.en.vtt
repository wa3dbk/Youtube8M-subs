00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
like to go too close to this edge over

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.210 
like to go too close to this edge over
here<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> chisel<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.290> shoot<00:01:22.950> into

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
here because the chisel can shoot into

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.180 
here because the chisel can shoot into
that<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.900> just<00:01:24.900> come<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.260> there<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.010> can

that so just come right there you can
trim<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> later<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.280> make<00:01:29.550> sure

don't<00:01:30.540> hold<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:32.010> you<00:01:32.130> don't

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
don't hold up here because you don't

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.440 
don't hold up here because you don't
have<00:01:32.400> control<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.790> your<00:01:32.850> chisel<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.330> sure

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
yourself and then set it on and then hit

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
yourself and then set it on and then hit
it<00:01:46.409> down<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.650> few<00:01:46.890> times<00:01:47.250> hardly<00:01:49.670> when<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.760> turn

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it down a few times hardly when you turn

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.289 
it down a few times hardly when you turn
it<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.240> side<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:53.060> because<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it to the side you see that because you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.539 
it to the side you see that because you
don't<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.690> dig<00:01:54.870> into<00:01:55.049> into<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.100> part

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
don't want to dig into into that part

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.649 
don't want to dig into into that part
right<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
right there so you're going to be

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.990 
right there so you're going to be
hitting<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.860> probably<00:01:59.430> probably<00:01:59.729> should

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
hitting it in probably probably should

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.640 
hitting it in probably probably should
just<00:02:00.030> hit<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.299> down<00:02:00.450> once<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.260> turn<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
just hit it down once and then turn the

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.980 
just hit it down once and then turn the
angle<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.190> then<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.610> down<00:02:02.760> deeper<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:03.780> hitting

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
angle and then go down deeper so hitting

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.360 
angle and then go down deeper so hitting
it<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.500> time<00:02:04.740> will<00:02:04.860> set<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
it the first time will set it in the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.600 
it the first time will set it in the
wood<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.760> it's<00:02:05.880> stable<00:02:07.369> like<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:10.430> or<00:02:11.430> two

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
wood so it's stable like this or two

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.240 
wood so it's stable like this or two
light<00:02:11.819> ones<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.239> turn<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.890> then<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.129> down

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
light ones then turn it then you go down

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.830 
light ones then turn it then you go down
you<00:02:14.400> don't<00:02:14.549> go<00:02:14.670> all<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.819> way<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.690> we're

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you don't go all the way because we're

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.069 
you don't go all the way because we're
gonna<00:02:15.930> come<00:02:16.680> back<00:02:16.879> from<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:17.999> other<00:02:18.060> side<00:02:18.389> so

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
gonna come back from the other side so

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.289 
gonna come back from the other side so
just<00:02:19.109> go<00:02:19.349> ahead<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:19.769> do<00:02:19.889> that<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:21.150> other

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
just go ahead and do that on your other

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.119 
just go ahead and do that on your other
ones<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.719> take<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.989> fairly<00:02:22.650> close<00:02:22.889> to<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
ones and take it fairly close to the

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:31.179 
ones and take it fairly close to the
line

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.319 

and<00:02:32.189> then<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.489> all<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.670> way<00:02:32.730> across<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
and then do it all the way across and

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.140 
and then do it all the way across and
then<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.590> will<00:02:34.709> go<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.129> flip<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> board<00:02:35.970> over

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
then we will go and flip the board over

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.390 
then we will go and flip the board over
and<00:02:36.480> come<00:02:36.720> well<00:02:37.379> actually<00:02:37.560> be<00:02:37.799> instead<00:02:38.340> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
and come well actually be instead of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.710 
and come well actually be instead of
flipping<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.939> over<00:02:39.150> we'll<00:02:39.269> go<00:02:39.360> ahead<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.569> do

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
flipping it over we'll go ahead and do

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.680 
flipping it over we'll go ahead and do
the<00:02:39.840> undercut<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.829> I'll<00:02:41.129> go<00:02:41.250> ahead<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.690> remove

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the undercut so I'll go ahead and remove

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.550 
the undercut so I'll go ahead and remove
some<00:02:42.720> more<00:02:42.959> waste<00:02:43.170> here<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:46.019> now<00:02:46.290> we're<00:02:46.409> going

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
some more waste here so now we're going

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.530 
some more waste here so now we're going
to<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.459> precise<00:02:47.849> cuts<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.269> got<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.480> be

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to do the precise cuts you got to be

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.479 
to do the precise cuts you got to be
really<00:02:48.780> careful<00:02:48.959> here<00:02:49.409> so<00:02:50.129> go<00:02:50.250> ahead<00:02:50.370> and

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
really careful here so go ahead and

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.259 
really careful here so go ahead and
place<00:02:50.819> your<00:02:50.849> chisel<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.659> that<00:02:52.049> scribe<00:02:52.620> line

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
place your chisel in that scribe line

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.429 
place your chisel in that scribe line
that<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.359> have<00:02:54.569> that's<00:02:54.750> why<00:02:54.959> it's<00:02:55.140> so

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
that you have that's why it's so

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.960 
that you have that's why it's so
important<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.950> use<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.549> high-quality<00:02:58.970> marking

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
important to use a high-quality marking

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.839 
important to use a high-quality marking
gauge<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.359> this<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.810> will<00:03:00.930> leave<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.349> good

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
gauge like this that will leave a a good

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.330 
gauge like this that will leave a a good
mark<00:03:02.849> in<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.239> because<00:03:04.099> otherwise<00:03:05.099> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
mark in there because otherwise you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.589 
mark in there because otherwise you
won't<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.609> place<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.970> rest<00:03:06.120> your<00:03:06.209> chisel

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
won't have a place to rest your chisel

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.960 
won't have a place to rest your chisel
and<00:03:06.690> you'll<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.900> kind<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.470> will<00:03:07.950> wobble<00:03:08.549> so

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
and you'll be kind of it will wobble so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
and you'll be kind of it will wobble so
I'm<00:03:09.420> gonna<00:03:09.690> get<00:03:09.870> close<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.950> line<00:03:11.099> there<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
I'm gonna get close to line there and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.160 
I'm gonna get close to line there and
then<00:03:11.459> right<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.849> your<00:03:12.000> baseline<00:03:12.540> let<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.049> just

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
then right in your baseline let it just

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.449 
then right in your baseline let it just
sit<00:03:13.760> in<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.239> then<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:17.069> we're

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
sit in there and then in this we're

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.680 
sit in there and then in this we're
gonna<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.760> something<00:03:17.940> called<00:03:18.060> undercutting

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
gonna do something called undercutting

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.990 
gonna do something called undercutting
so<00:03:18.959> see<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:19.739> it's<00:03:19.889> straight<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:20.970> down

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
so see here it's straight up and down

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.399 
so see here it's straight up and down
we're<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.359> tilt<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.379> little

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
we're going to tilt it in just a little

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.770 
we're going to tilt it in just a little
bit<00:03:22.650> maybe<00:03:22.980> 10<00:03:23.280> or<00:03:23.370> 15<00:03:23.670> degrees<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.299> then<00:03:24.569> hit

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
bit maybe 10 or 15 degrees and then hit

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.909 
bit maybe 10 or 15 degrees and then hit
it<00:03:25.220> once<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.549> set<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.109> tilt<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.379> side

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.970 

okay<00:03:32.150> it's<00:03:33.150> got<00:03:33.449> a<00:03:33.480> nice<00:03:33.629> clean<00:03:34.139> line<00:03:34.379> I've

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
okay it's got a nice clean line I've

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.770 
okay it's got a nice clean line I've
zoomed<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.430> really<00:03:35.609> closely<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.329> can<00:03:36.599> see

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
zoomed in really closely so you can see

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.460 
zoomed in really closely so you can see
this<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.109> many<00:03:38.120> videos<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.449> very<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.410> I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
this not many videos are very that I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.960 
this not many videos are very that I
found<00:03:40.739> on<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:40.949> subject<00:03:41.190> are<00:03:41.430> very<00:03:41.639> close<00:03:41.940> up

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
found on this subject are very close up

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.150 
found on this subject are very close up
you<00:03:42.389> see<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.079> lot<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.470> face<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.010> person

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
you see a lot of the face of the person

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.650 
you see a lot of the face of the person
doing<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.699> but<00:03:44.819> you<00:03:44.849> don't<00:03:45.000> see<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> lot<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
doing it but you don't see a lot of the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.360 
doing it but you don't see a lot of the
details<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.379> want<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.650> make<00:03:46.769> sure<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.220> see

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
details so I want to make sure you see

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.569 
details so I want to make sure you see
the<00:03:47.489> details<00:03:47.849> so<00:03:48.720> again<00:03:48.930> put<00:03:49.169> this<00:03:49.400> right<00:03:50.400> in

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
the details so again put this right in

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.379 
the details so again put this right in
the<00:03:50.609> baseline<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.959> kind<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.530> tap

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
the baseline and you can kind of tap

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.430 
the baseline and you can kind of tap
that<00:03:54.389> edge<00:03:54.569> up<00:03:54.750> against<00:03:55.049> there<00:03:55.169> to<00:03:55.260> make<00:03:55.410> sure

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
that edge up against there to make sure

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.789 
that edge up against there to make sure
that<00:03:55.739> you're<00:03:57.139> you're<00:03:58.139> where<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.410> want<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.650> be

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
that you're you're where you want to be

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.059 
that you're you're where you want to be
so<00:03:59.340> tilt<00:03:59.609> it<00:03:59.730> back<00:03:59.879> tap<00:04:00.449> a<00:04:00.870> little<00:04:01.680> bit<00:04:01.919> then

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
so tilt it back tap a little bit then

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.020 
so tilt it back tap a little bit then
tilt<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.459> up<00:04:03.949> there<00:04:04.949> you<00:04:05.010> go<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.549> you<00:04:05.609> see<00:04:05.910> how

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
tilt it up there you go so you see how

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.659 
tilt it up there you go so you see how
that<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.180> perfect<00:04:06.720> across<00:04:07.139> there<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:07.669> we're
