if I just pop this off take a look at

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.009 
if I just pop this off take a look at
the<00:03:27.470> back<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.480> where<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.840> battery

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
the back so this is where the battery

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.440 
the back so this is where the battery
will<00:03:30.290> be<00:03:30.320> going<00:03:30.590> along<00:03:31.190> with<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.790> SIM<00:03:32.000> card<00:03:32.030> I

have my Vodafone SIM card right here so

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.729 
have my Vodafone SIM card right here so
if<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.519> just<00:03:34.670> pop<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:34.850> in<00:03:38.170> Fiddler's<00:03:39.170> pop<00:03:39.380> in

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.970 

there<00:03:42.739> we<00:03:42.860> go<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.660> battery<00:03:45.080> azar<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:48.260> I'm

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
there we go and the battery azar so I'm

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.080 
there we go and the battery azar so I'm
not<00:03:49.190> gonna<00:03:50.980> well<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.010> will<00:03:52.280> switch<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.670> on<00:03:52.820> but

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
not gonna well I will switch it on but

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.400

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
I'm not going to wait till it turns on

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.410 
I'm not going to wait till it turns on
because<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.860> phone<00:03:55.100> does<00:03:55.790> actually<00:03:56.030> take<00:03:56.269> a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
because this phone does actually take a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.970 
because this phone does actually take a
while<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.750> think<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.110> watched<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.470> video<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.920> it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
while I think I watched a video and it

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.340 
while I think I watched a video and it
was<00:03:58.040> three<00:03:58.310> minutes<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:59.360> actually<00:03:59.690> come<00:04:00.170> on

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
was three minutes to actually come on

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.690 
was three minutes to actually come on
which<00:04:00.739> does<00:04:01.010> take<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.280> while

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
which does take a while

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.270 
which does take a while
standard<00:04:02.660> blackberry<00:04:03.080> but<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.100> the

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
standard blackberry but this is the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.039 
standard blackberry but this is the
upgrade<00:04:04.820> from<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.120> previous<00:04:05.540> curve<00:04:05.810> and

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
upgrade from the previous curve and

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.170 
upgrade from the previous curve and
there<00:04:06.170> are<00:04:06.260> certain<00:04:06.739> differences<00:04:07.400> we<00:04:08.000> have<00:04:08.150> a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
there are certain differences we have a
