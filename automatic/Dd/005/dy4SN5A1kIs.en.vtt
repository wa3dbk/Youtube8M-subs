00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
would work and drive the other one but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.729 
would work and drive the other one but
not<00:00:56.580> until<00:00:56.879> about<00:00:57.030> ten<00:00:57.449> years<00:00:57.690> ago<00:00:57.900> that<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
not until about ten years ago that I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.410 
not until about ten years ago that I
really<00:00:58.830> started<00:00:59.010> collecting<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.390> muscle<00:01:00.809> I

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
really started collecting the muscle I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.060 
really started collecting the muscle I
try<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> collect<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.440> something<00:01:04.830> unusual

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
try and collect is something unusual

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.090 
try and collect is something unusual
whatever<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.770> sixty

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
whatever that here is so like in sixty

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.460 
whatever that here is so like in sixty
four<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.460> half<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.600> an<00:01:09.750> Indy<00:01:09.960> pace<00:01:10.140> car

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
four and a half it was an Indy pace car

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190 
four and a half it was an Indy pace car
right<00:01:10.710> they<00:01:10.830> made<00:01:10.979> 190<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> those<00:01:12.200> replica

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
right they made 190 of those replica

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
right they made 190 of those replica
cars<00:01:13.380> at<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.920> time<00:01:14.190> so<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:15.060> kind<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
cars at that time so that's kind of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.950 
cars at that time so that's kind of
something

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.700 

so<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.240> 1966<00:01:21.240> Hertz<00:01:21.630> Shelby<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.290> one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so this is a 1966 Hertz Shelby it's one

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.850 
so this is a 1966 Hertz Shelby it's one
of<00:01:22.860> 500<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.540> made<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.930> rental<00:01:25.260> cars<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of 500 that they made for rental cars so

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.770 
of 500 that they made for rental cars so
customers<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.760> rent<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.480> cars

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
customers can actually rent these cars

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.440 
customers can actually rent these cars
back<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.160> 1966<00:01:29.160> through<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.640> automatics<00:01:30.300> and
