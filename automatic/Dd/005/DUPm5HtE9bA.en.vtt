00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
 ah 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.470
 hello very good I am bi tejeiro and we are 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.290
 as you see in another mode for gta for pc 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.940
 and this mode is like the one I already showed you 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.770
 to the one we could put the 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.380
 intermittent but good as you are already 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.690
 seeing clearly you have more options than 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.150
 the intermittent one is one that 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.700
 comes a little more advanced the truth 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.559
 is that this is very good and I was cool 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.629
 of itself the intermittent 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.400
 now this one more because with this since it 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.500
 we can make beautiful photos as you see 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.200
 can open because the capo can be opened 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.210
 the trunk and it's very very well apart 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.340
 well you know I have the mod menu that already 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.350
 I taught and that's why the police car 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.390
 is finished with this color quoted well 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.120
 handsome is good and we can do more 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.950
 things as you see, that we can open 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.260
 the doors are worth let's let's go 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.579
 to the car in a little while I go to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.750
 start to teach you what it is that has 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.730
 good as you can see I have the indicators 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.970
 activated that like the other 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.220
 we can activate one as you see there 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.380
 I'm activating one we can activate in 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.150
 the other side or we can activate the two 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.830
 how he had us and now 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.570
 then what else do we have we have things 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.260
 cool is the truth in this way we have 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.290
 also that we can things as you are 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.840
 seeing we can close the trunk to 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.550
 lose the hood or open it you see let's 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.330
 open it to close it to our liking 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.490
 that the trunk is closed 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.710
 Take us on a trip with the car of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.690
 police and good also has more 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.160
 little things have more things as you are 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.620
 seeing on the left side of top 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.890
 has an odometer and that's very 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.710
 but that very, very good because 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.090
 as you know in the gta thanks to the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.100
 first person we can know the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.540
 speed at which we go but of course only 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.180
 We can know it in the first person and 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.700
 we can also only know it in miles 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.950
 which I do not like anything but nothing 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.260
 know the speed miles I do not like 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.540
 nothing because I have to be thinking about 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.340
 how much is in kilometers for it more or 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.770
 least to really know at what speed 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.660
 I'm going her now I 'm going to 180 with 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.840
 this car is not bad at all it's nothing 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.640
 bad 180 it is good to tell you that the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.440
 cars run less than what they charge in 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.180
 the reality because you have crashed the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.400
 180 is hard to get through 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.560
 and this is a carraco and it would have to happen 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.290
 quite a lot of the 180 that I had to spend 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.909
 the long street we go and good 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.489
 have more things have more things 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.989
 apart from the speed to be able to know 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.239
 the speed at which we can open the 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.180
 doors and so on what else does it have 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.370
 also cruise control people do not 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.930
 It is very good if we want, because you do not have 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 what to drive go taking a walk the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.010
 cruise control for the subjects of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.439
 country because it is that the car is just me 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.760
 now I 'm going to give it to late and there you see 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.079
 the left that has put me in control 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.090
 cruise 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.250
 I am not accelerating now and the only thing 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.870
 what I have to do is turn and as you see 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.879
 the car is kept all the time 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.220
 more or less at the same speed the 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.720
 really cool very cool because good 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.129
 is another piece to edit as 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.959
 we had the intermittent ones now 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.120
 we have many more things the same as 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.489
 things that more grace has done is to be able 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.680
 open the hood and be able to know the speed 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.599
 real I'm going to not have to be 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.019
 calculating how many kilometers it is 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.900
 seeds and all that I liked a lot 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.349
 but very 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.730
 and good finally we would also have to 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.409
 see I'm going to turn off the control of 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.150
 cruises and that because if I do not I can not 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.620
 slow down finally we would also have 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.110
 So we can get off with the car 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.069
 in motion now you will see let's activate 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.019
 the capo the boot and with lage to this one 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.510
 we got off the car in gear as 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.700
 you see with the doors open and everything 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.230
 working is worth the truth is all this 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.879
 it's cool for me to get down like that 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.010
 directly with the car running without 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.750
 have to pull the car you know 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.579
 that if you want to leave it open like that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.620
 you have to throw away not with this mode 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.720
 it does not need good finally have 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.120
 a last option and now reality not the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.340
 I've seen so let's try it let's go 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.829
 to call the taxis and we are going to ask for a 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.720
 taxi because with the taxis it has some 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:09.140
 special lights so let's try 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.750
 6 please one of the best I do not want 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.750
 none of the bad none 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.280
 what 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.370
 and is that according to the payment of the world in the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.520
 helicopters in taxis and more things 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.440
 It says that it has some special colors or 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.120
 something weird that is used with the and now what 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.550
 we'll see we'll see him come to the taxi 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.409
 look at it, it's already there we're going to take these 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.339
 days 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.339
 ostias yo 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.790
 it has taken me ahead as it 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.520
 note that it is in spring in this area 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.129
 no no 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.319
 as it shows in this area I will go 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.750
 as always because it does not give him time to remove 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.740
 work 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.530
 it is assumed that with the and we will see it 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.009
 assumes that some 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.610
 special taxi lights 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:04.629
 if it's nobody the l2 out there or the l but 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.449
 it seems that he does not just suck anything no no 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.020
 he does not suck anything he said that to the pegs if 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.520
 they are sucking 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.759
 no no no no it is an intermittent 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.800
 there is no one to do a service 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.110
 do not wait, let's try it because 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.310
 violate if the payment does not work here 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.650
 in the way he explains that with the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.960
 helicopters can also do something 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.300
 so let's take out a diver and let's 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.340
 try let's see what it is that 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.090
 can do 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.070
 I do not see the change that makes it 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.949
 suppose that 's how we're going to put it on 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:42.560
 night supposed to be lights so let's go 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.560
 to go to put it at night in a little while 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.980
 because they're supposed to be what they are 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.780
 lights what what you light with like 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.270
 but I do not think it changes anything I see 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.610
 something I see the helicopter equal the 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.480
 uruguay the particles are like this with the 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.010
 lights I have not seen it yet 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.010
 to see a moment that I'm going to remove 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.060
 well it seems that this last option does not 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.160
 the actions have just worked very well 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.130
 extra of extras I do not know very well what is 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.790
 because the guy puts taxi light or the 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.620
 helicopter 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.150
 spotlight I do not understand very well to 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.000
 what does it mean but it seems that the last 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.650
 option does not work well then we will 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.570
 to leave here to install it is super easy 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.600
 it has no mystery other than to pass it 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.600
 to the folder as always and even my 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.900
 favorites 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.400
 crazy fucking 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.400
 common
