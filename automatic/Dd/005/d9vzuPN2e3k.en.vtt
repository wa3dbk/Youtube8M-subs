putting it back in we're going to show
you<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:32.910> bit<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.630> how<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.140> work

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
you a little bit about how they work

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.850 
you a little bit about how they work
what<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> looks<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.030> they<00:00:36.180> were<00:00:36.860> but

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
what it looks like when they were but

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
what it looks like when they were but
before<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.370> anything<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.510> turn

before we do anything we want to turn
off<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.100> computer<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.239> back<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.930> should

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
off the computer on the back it should

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:53.020 
off the computer on the back it should
be<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.530> switch

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.630 

and<00:00:53.510> then<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:54.379> want<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.770> run<00:00:55.070> from<00:00:55.399> the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.910 

and<00:01:25.690> then<00:01:25.840> we'll<00:01:25.960> get<00:01:26.140> your<00:01:26.290> way<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.590> try<00:01:26.860> to

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
and then we'll get your way and try to

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.970 
and then we'll get your way and try to
open<00:01:27.100> up<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.490> case

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.860 

but<00:01:33.880> make<00:01:34.150> sure<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.540> have<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.750> right

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
but make sure you have the right

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.340 
but make sure you have the right
screwdriver<00:01:35.620> you<00:01:36.430> get<00:01:36.580> into<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.000> case

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
screwdriver you get into the case

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.679 
screwdriver you get into the case
otherwise<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:40.030> might<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.299> well<00:01:40.450> just<00:01:40.570> forget

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
otherwise you might as well just forget

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:55.420 
otherwise you might as well just forget
about

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.930 

and<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:57.150> sure<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> right<00:01:57.780> side<00:01:58.940> but

and make sure you got the right side but

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.030 
and make sure you got the right side but
because<00:02:00.330> we're<00:02:00.510> moving<00:02:00.870> but<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.860> are

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because we're moving but because we are

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.820 
because we're moving but because we are
removing<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.909> hard<00:02:03.119> drive<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:04.170> probably<00:02:04.500> want

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
removing the hard drive we probably want

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.230 
removing the hard drive we probably want
to<00:02:05.010> go<00:02:05.130> ahead<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.700> pick<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:05.940> set<00:02:06.270> off<00:02:06.300> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.400 
to go ahead and pick that set off to
some<00:02:09.240> computers<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> may<00:02:09.929> not<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
some odd reason if you know you could

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.250 
some odd reason if you know you could
hit<00:02:56.220> when<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.460> platters<00:02:57.030> inside<00:02:57.750> you'll<00:02:58.080> see

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
hit when the platters inside you'll see

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.470 
hit when the platters inside you'll see
that<00:02:58.380> later<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.070> mess<00:02:59.970> up<00:03:00.120> some<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.420> your
