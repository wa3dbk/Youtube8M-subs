00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello fair motif our program now 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.320
 about enem 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.960
 Let's discuss here today with the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.250
 chemistry and biology on the part of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.230
 science and nature 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300
 starting with chemical pulled Holland 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 how was the chemistry test and how many 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.080
 issues fell in the part of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.180
 gustavo nature 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.960
 Good evening, Eduardo, good night, my friends. 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.750
 of the table 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.610
 good evening was a good enough proof 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.590
 calm a test with 12 questions 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 covering almost all the content then the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.760
 proof we do not have much to complain about 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
 now disliked the part of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.170
 content nor is there a theory that enem 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 need not have content to study is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.219
 only issues is what you reading you 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.930
 responds to the student who does not 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 chemistry no more content it would make 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.190
 quiet proof right next see the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.750
 latest evidence from enem on the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.960
 chemistry was not enough, it 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.649
 proof that it escaped that theory of enem 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.420
 and this was a complete proof 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.460
 content that the student 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.909
 have heard that just reading here 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.710
 They're playing this time. 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.570
 he does not have to go to study the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.640
 content will tell you that you have 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.170
 the issues that still matters for 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.270
 example of subjects that we have as 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.180
 is a matter of reactions 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.270
 organic issues of piles 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.820
 ph and all in the calculation as well as 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.579
 stoichiometric calculation questions that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 came three questions in the test of 12 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.250
 so it was a pretty face-to- 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.229
 vestibular is that since the enem propagates 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.110
 which is one more proof that will have 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.240
 interpretation that is not proof that it is not 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 content test the student who was not 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.850
 for the book did not pay attention to the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.409
 study 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.049
 probably did not make a good 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.810
 Proof is not a physical show apart 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.939
 professor rogério andrade will comment 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.740
 Rogéria can calculate the physical was very 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.509
 difficult value you have to talk about 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.299
 Enemy physics test 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.469
 good evening, good evening, good evening, my 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.689
 companions 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.939
 Good evening, Beast, watch the physics test. 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.560
 it was very peaceful, it was very peaceful, I 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.459
 I agree with Gustavo when he says that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 she ran away from what enem and proposed to the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.780
 over the other issues 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.640
 in other years it has been 16 issues 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.440
 distribution is basically the same as you 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.800
 It's mechanical, you have a question. 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.300
 has an electric start is 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.490
 conservation of energy that people 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.460
 always talk only that it was a test with 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.660
 more expensive first stage than it should 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.550
 nor itself 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.410
 now you notice what is very important 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.730
 stress that a test without rigor 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.420
 scientific 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.330
 The student has to study has to 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.400
 to know the physical phenomenon has that it is not 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.110
 it is not interpretive it only has the part of 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.500
 interpretation but he has to know the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.120
 phenomenon and have to get out of the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 there as it does not have much scientific rigor 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.980
 You get two days' questions here that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.370
 you use the data do not have how to 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.800
 answer he fumbles it there he 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.130
 confuse but how the issue is theoretical 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.470
 You leave tangent kept a song 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.510
 what for God's sake here if you go 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.810
 use the scientific detail or the student 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.840
 which is technical and he would lose the question 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.190
 or is it to have a footprint, then, what a bisa 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.660
 who can not even get the money can 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.720
 be rational you think you have a catch 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.540
 is a trap for the student who is 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.430
 technician or student he does not know 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.320
 well the phenomenon he has more chance of 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.350
 to strike the question seems absurd 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.540
 but the truth is you are not caught 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.730
 so at least that's what I have friends and 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.500
 finalizing now to discuss the proof of 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.390
 biology with professor leandro gomes and 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.690
 there, the new technology was the one that 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.010
 questions 12 with 16 then biology won 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.040
 got 18 that's right 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.170
 seventeen that good night everyone good 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.530
 night was motive we have a 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.140
 between 17 and 18 questions is 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.400
 it is important to do in relation to ecology 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.590
 generates cliché in relation to these 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.640
 we were expecting a greater number of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.730
 of ecology issues 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.500
 we have five questions and 2 nd place 3 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.030
 we had biotechnology program there 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.489
 approximately 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.830
 said in questions like it was spoken here 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.170
 both in chemistry and physics 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.600
 biology was also a little bit the rule 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.030
 we had more direct questions there was 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.769
 advertised but it requires a 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.960
 little prior knowledge of 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.360
 biology for the beast 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.069
 only that none 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.379
 no any question there was 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.699
 thus directly linked to content 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.560
 very far-fetched 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.719
 but in if it comes out a little 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.400
 skills and competences so widely spoken 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.860
 are worked by us in the classroom 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.659
 with more direct content more 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.180
 also accessible to the public. 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.770
 student what leandro pulled the rock 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.659
 rogério valeu ferreira 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.669
 stay tuned, now it's going to be like this 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.930
 hit the ball here with the college 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.930
