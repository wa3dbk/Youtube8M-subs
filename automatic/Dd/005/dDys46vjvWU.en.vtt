happens if I end up not using it but

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.160 
happens if I end up not using it but
like<00:01:44.579> once<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> pink<00:01:45.180> moon<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.930> waste

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170

money<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:46.920> HD<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.390> goes<00:01:48.630> 1080p<00:01:49.290> 720p<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.270 

one<00:01:53.579> cool<00:01:53.820> thing<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.509> about<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
one cool thing I really like about it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.859 
one cool thing I really like about it
personally<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.450> replace<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
personally is that you can replace the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.980 
personally is that you can replace the
battery<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.759> flip<00:01:59.969> doesn't<00:02:00.450> allow<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.869> do

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
battery the flip doesn't allow you to do

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.280 
battery the flip doesn't allow you to do
that<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.119> battery<00:02:03.509> did<00:02:03.750> happen<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.170> go

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that so if the battery did happen and go

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.980 
that so if the battery did happen and go
bad<00:02:04.500> or<00:02:04.770> die<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.600> send<00:02:06.899> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
bad or die you would have to send it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.690 
bad or die you would have to send it
back<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.890> were<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.399> battery

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
back or if you were out in the battery

back or if you were out in the battery
died<00:02:08.849> then<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> would<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.720> charge

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
died then you would just have to charge

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.229 
died then you would just have to charge
it<00:02:10.200> we're<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.250> case<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:11.910> out<00:02:12.120> in

it we're in this case if I was out in

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.490 
it we're in this case if I was out in
the<00:02:12.330> battery<00:02:12.569> did<00:02:12.780> die<00:02:12.930> I

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the battery did die I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.680 
the battery did die I
can<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.830> buy<00:02:14.580> an<00:02:14.790> extra<00:02:15.090> battery<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.540> plug

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
can just buy an extra battery and plug

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.720 
can just buy an extra battery and plug
it<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.230> should<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.470> very<00:02:16.680> cool<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.100> know

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
it in that should be very cool I know

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.370 
it in that should be very cool I know
the<00:02:17.910> flip<00:02:18.150> HD<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.690> can<00:02:18.870> buy<00:02:19.020> an<00:02:19.170> additional

the flip HD you can buy an additional

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.930 
the flip HD you can buy an additional
battery<00:02:19.860> but<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.100> flip<00:02:20.310> min<00:02:20.460> are<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.610> cannot

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
battery but the flip min are you cannot

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300 
battery but the flip min are you cannot
thing<00:02:21.090> about<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.470> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
thing about this is that you can I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.070 
thing about this is that you can I
haven't<00:02:23.880> bought<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:24.060> yet<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.540> haven't<00:02:24.900> needed

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
haven't bought one yet I haven't needed

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.020 
haven't bought one yet I haven't needed
it<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.920> me<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.220> battery<00:02:26.520> life<00:02:26.670> has<00:02:26.880> been

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
it for me the battery life has been

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.410 
it for me the battery life has been
about<00:02:27.180> five<00:02:27.510> hours<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.680> works<00:02:29.100> me<00:02:29.460> but

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
about five hours so that works me but

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.240 
about five hours so that works me but
that's<00:02:30.570> not<00:02:30.720> continuously<00:02:31.530> recording<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
that's not continuously recording the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.890 
that's not continuously recording the
entire<00:02:32.340> time<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.970> kind<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.330> turn<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.810> off

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
entire time I kind of turn on and off

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.930 
entire time I kind of turn on and off
turn<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.440> off<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> think<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.700> if<00:02:35.820> you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
turn on and off but I think that if you

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.820 
turn on and off but I think that if you
continuously<00:02:36.480> record<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.260> manual<00:02:37.590> says<00:02:37.620> it's

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
continuously record the manual says it's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.210 
continuously record the manual says it's
two<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> half<00:02:38.520> hours<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.270> if<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.890> need<00:02:41.100> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
two and a half hours so if you need the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.860 
two and a half hours so if you need the
extra<00:02:41.400> battery<00:02:41.760> then<00:02:41.970> use<00:02:42.120> by<00:02:42.330> holding<00:02:42.840> your

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
extra battery then use by holding your

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.990 
extra battery then use by holding your
pocket<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.740> one<00:02:43.950> has<00:02:44.130> cubicle<00:02:44.580> 82-foot<00:02:44.940> a

card an sdhc card and I got a gigabyte

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.360 
card an sdhc card and I got a gigabyte
sdhc<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:51.510> works<00:02:51.690> good<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:51.900> me<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.290> got<00:02:53.100> an<00:02:53.190> 8

gigabyte that goes my island song line
as<00:02:55.950> far<00:02:56.130> as<00:02:56.220> 32<00:02:56.640> I'm<00:02:56.760> sure<00:02:56.970> maybe<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.390> goes

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
as far as 32 I'm sure maybe it goes

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.840 
as far as 32 I'm sure maybe it goes
higher<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.750> don't<00:02:57.959> know<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:59.459> eight<00:02:59.610> gig
