00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
and here it is unwrapped we put a petal

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.749 
and here it is unwrapped we put a petal
on<00:00:06.310> the<00:00:06.490> findings

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:08.759 
on the findings

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.760 
on the findings
here's<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.540> front

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
here's the front

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.290 
here's the front
I<00:00:11.800> could<00:00:12.340> see<00:00:12.520> you<00:00:12.700> could<00:00:12.820> see<00:00:12.880> you<00:00:13.120> like<00:00:13.270> a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
I could see you could see you like a

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.790 
I could see you could see you like a
nice<00:00:14.190> Sheen<00:00:15.190> to<00:00:15.220> it<00:00:15.580> and<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:17.770> did<00:00:18.010> this<00:00:18.190> 7d<00:00:19.800> me

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
nice Sheen to it and we did this 7d me

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.749 
nice Sheen to it and we did this 7d me
two<00:00:21.099> pages<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.580> think<00:00:21.820> are<00:00:22.060> so<00:00:22.240> many<00:00:22.390> six<00:00:22.660> pages

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
two pages I think are so many six pages

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.800 
two pages I think are so many six pages
so<00:00:24.759> it's<00:00:25.320> pretty<00:00:26.320> thick<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:28.029> a<00:00:28.300> twelve<00:00:28.630> by

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
so it's pretty thick it's a twelve by

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:40.310 
so it's pretty thick it's a twelve by
twelve<00:00:32.910> first<00:00:33.910> page

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 

and<00:00:40.740> as<00:00:41.100> everyone<00:00:41.640> says<00:00:41.880> the<00:00:42.180> pages<00:00:42.870> are

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and as everyone says the pages are

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:56.040 
and as everyone says the pages are
pretty<00:00:43.740> thick<00:00:44.130> in<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.990> page

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.590 

you<00:00:56.620> want<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:56.860> compare<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.969> slap<00:00:58.329> sheet

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
you want to compare it to a slap sheet

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:11.990 
you want to compare it to a slap sheet
of<00:00:58.750> paper<00:00:59.020> like<00:01:04.920> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.540 

see<00:01:12.510> there's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.840> difference<00:01:15.380> hopefully

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
see there's a difference hopefully

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.960 
see there's a difference hopefully
triple<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> thickness<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.970> regular

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
triple the thickness of a regular

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.830 
triple the thickness of a regular
photobook<00:01:24.090> page<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.800> these<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:30.630> do

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
photobook page and these you do

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.860 
photobook page and these you do
a<00:01:31.700> double-sided<00:01:32.700> layout<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:33.480> it<00:01:33.630> stretches

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
a double-sided layout where it stretches

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.440 
a double-sided layout where it stretches
across<00:01:34.850> not<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:38.610> one's<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.060> double

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
across not this one this one's a double

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:50.429 
across not this one this one's a double
side<00:01:41.690> as<00:01:42.690> well<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.489 

and<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.130> do<00:01:51.369> neat<00:01:51.759> you<00:01:52.329> know<00:01:52.359> color<00:01:52.719> combos

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
and you do neat you know color combos

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.139 
and you do neat you know color combos
like<00:01:53.679> this<00:01:53.979> when<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.249> picked<00:01:54.880> out<00:01:55.090> myself<00:01:57.149> this

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
like this when I picked out myself this

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.940 
like this when I picked out myself this
nice<00:01:58.390> little<00:01:58.689> green<00:01:59.020> edge<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:04.270> one<00:02:04.600> with

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
nice little green edge this one with

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.870 
nice little green edge this one with
definitely<00:02:05.950> looks<00:02:06.369> too<00:02:06.579> dark

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
definitely looks too dark

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.670 
definitely looks too dark
it's<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.420> lime<00:02:07.630> green<00:02:07.769> swirl<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:12.069> that<00:02:12.459> one<00:02:12.700> too

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's a lime green swirl and that one too

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.559 
it's a lime green swirl and that one too
so<00:02:14.680> there's<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.920> lot<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.250> variation<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.390> could

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
so there's a lot of variation you could

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:25.470 
so there's a lot of variation you could
do<00:02:21.090> pretty<00:02:22.090> cool

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.320 

that's<00:02:26.480> nice

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.759 

and<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.930> got<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.800> Kodak<00:02:33.340> finish<00:02:33.910> which<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
and I got the Kodak finish which is the

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.470 
and I got the Kodak finish which is the
paper<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.220> comes<00:02:36.489> with<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:37.000> know<00:02:37.060> they<00:02:37.300> have<00:02:37.450> a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
paper it comes with I know they have a

paper it comes with I know they have a
new<00:02:37.780> cloth<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.290> HD<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:40.269> this<00:02:40.450> looks<00:02:40.690> pretty

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
new cloth the HD but this looks pretty

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:50.479 
new cloth the HD but this looks pretty
nice<00:02:41.700> between<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> matte<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.269> glossy<00:02:43.480> so

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.430 

they<00:02:51.489> shipped<00:02:51.819> pretty<00:02:52.180> fast<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.870> they

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
