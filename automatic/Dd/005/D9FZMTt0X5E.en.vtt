00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
off to the side but not completely take

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.299 
off to the side but not completely take
just<00:01:02.690> like<00:01:02.810> a<00:01:02.840> one<00:01:03.200> to<00:01:03.380> two<00:01:03.560> inch<00:01:03.739> section<00:01:04.190> of

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
just like a one to two inch section of

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.130 
just like a one to two inch section of
hair<00:01:04.489> at<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.790> top<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.150> your<00:01:05.180> head<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.840> you're

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
hair at the top of your head and you're

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.690 
hair at the top of your head and you're
going<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.320> split<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:06.740> into<00:01:07.130> three<00:01:07.430> sections

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
going to split that into three sections

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.610 
going to split that into three sections
and<00:01:08.270> then<00:01:08.720> you're<00:01:08.870> just<00:01:08.960> going<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.200> braid<00:01:09.410> it

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
and then you're just going to braid it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.760 
and then you're just going to braid it
once<00:01:09.890> or<00:01:10.100> twice<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.729> like<00:01:10.790> normal<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.780> then

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
once or twice just like normal and then

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.920 
once or twice just like normal and then
we're<00:01:12.979> going<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.190> start<00:01:13.430> picking<00:01:13.790> up<00:01:13.940> little

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
we're going to start picking up little

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.109 
we're going to start picking up little
pieces<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.440> hair<00:01:15.860> actually<00:01:16.130> kind<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.729> 1<00:01:16.940> inch

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
pieces of hair actually kind of 1 inch

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.660 
pieces of hair actually kind of 1 inch
section<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:17.810> actually<00:01:18.560> kind<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.860> big<00:01:19.070> sections

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
section so actually kind of big sections

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.370 
section so actually kind of big sections
and<00:01:19.940> you're<00:01:20.390> going<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.570> go<00:01:20.690> ahead<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.170> braid

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
and you're going to go ahead and braid

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.100 
and you're going to go ahead and braid
that<00:01:21.560> in<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:22.250> then<00:01:23.180> take<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.600> piece<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.840> hair

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
that in and then take a piece of hair

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.690 
that in and then take a piece of hair
from<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.410> back<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.890> add<00:01:25.010> that<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.490> back

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
from the back and add that to the back

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.570 
from the back and add that to the back
section<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.800> then<00:01:29.470> write<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.740> in<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:34.460> then

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
section and then write that in and then

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.010 
section and then write that in and then
take<00:01:34.759> another<00:01:34.940> piece<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.420> hair<00:01:35.690> from<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
take another piece of hair from the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.969 
take another piece of hair from the
front<00:01:36.170> section<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.720> braid<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:39.830> we're

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
front section and braid that in so we're

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:49.920 
front section and braid that in so we're
creating<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.670> very<00:01:41.450> simple<00:01:41.930> French<00:01:42.259> braid

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.920 

keep<00:01:50.800> on<00:01:50.950> adding<00:01:51.280> little<00:01:51.820> pieces<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.510> hair<00:01:52.720> to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
keep on adding little pieces of hair to

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.750 
keep on adding little pieces of hair to
each<00:01:53.080> section<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.860> then<00:01:53.980> bring<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.370> in<00:01:54.520> and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
each section and then bring it in and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.310 
each section and then bring it in and
this<00:01:55.180> is<00:01:55.270> what<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.540> going<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.780> create<00:01:56.050> that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
this is what is going to create that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.070 
this is what is going to create that
French<00:01:56.650> braid<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.270> then<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:58.720> just<00:01:58.870> braid

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
French braid and then you can just braid

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.840
