so<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.759> d-link<00:00:09.209> is<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:10.019> full<00:00:10.440> service<00:00:10.619> provider

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129 
so a d-link is a full service provider

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.730 
so a d-link is a full service provider
we<00:00:11.639> engage<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.570> embedded<00:00:13.320> computing

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
we engage in embedded computing

platforms<00:00:16.289> over<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.070> years<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.610> a<00:00:17.640> strong

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
platforms over the years we see a strong

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.630 
platforms over the years we see a strong
trend<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.660> every<00:00:19.230> device<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.890> connected<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
trend that every device is connected to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.749 
trend that every device is connected to
network<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> devices<00:00:22.400> have<00:00:23.400> data

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
network and all the devices have data

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.780 
network and all the devices have data
that<00:00:23.849> need<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.329> be<00:00:24.360> shared<00:00:25.110> and<00:00:25.439> managed<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.640> we

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
that need to be shared and managed so we

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.940 
that need to be shared and managed so we
see<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.059> more<00:00:27.450> and<00:00:27.509> more<00:00:27.660> devices<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.770> used

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
see that more and more devices that used

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.560 
see that more and more devices that used

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.700 
example of an intelligent transportation
system<00:00:41.550> think<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.600> bus<00:00:42.839> and<00:00:43.170> goes<00:00:43.440> from<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
system think of a bus and goes from the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.770 
system think of a bus and goes from the
city<00:00:43.949> or<00:00:44.159> an<00:00:44.339> airport<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.999> matter<00:00:45.179> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
city or an airport for that matter you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840 
city or an airport for that matter you
can<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.170> online<00:00:46.499> vital<00:00:47.069> stats<00:00:47.339> off<00:00:47.519> your

can have online vital stats off your

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
can have online vital stats off your
vehicle<00:00:48.269> go<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.749> back<00:00:48.989> office<00:00:49.289> so

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
vehicle go on to the back office so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.209 
vehicle go on to the back office so
let's<00:00:50.550> back<00:00:50.819> office<00:00:51.179> they<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.480> see<00:00:51.839> that<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
let's back office they can see that the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.529 
let's back office they can see that the
oil<00:00:53.249> is<00:00:53.489> getting<00:00:53.640> too<00:00:53.850> hard<00:00:54.120> they're<00:00:54.329> running

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
oil is getting too hard they're running

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
oil is getting too hard they're running
low<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.659> fuel<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.379> bus<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.679> going<00:00:55.859> too<00:00:56.190> slow<00:00:56.429> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
low on fuel the bus is going too slow to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.660 
low on fuel the bus is going too slow to
fast<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.510> track<00:00:57.929> the<00:00:58.170> GPS<00:00:58.739> therefore

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
fast so they can track the GPS therefore

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
fast so they can track the GPS therefore
control<00:01:00.059> over<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> vehicle<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
control over the vehicle but this is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.930 
control over the vehicle but this is
will<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:01.889> unit<00:01:02.159> there<00:01:02.550> will<00:01:02.639> be<00:01:02.789> actually

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
will be the unit there will be actually

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
will be the unit there will be actually
on<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.420> bus<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.620> our<00:01:04.830> matrix

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
on the bus so it's one of our matrix

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550 
on the bus so it's one of our matrix
systems<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.940> that<00:01:06.690> communicates<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> certain

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
systems and that communicates a certain

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.070 
systems and that communicates a certain
sensors<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.940> display<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
sensors and we have one display that it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.980 
sensors and we have one display that it
would<00:01:10.260> be<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:11.190> passenger<00:01:11.790> cabin<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.870> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
would be on passenger cabin or as you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
would be on passenger cabin or as you
see<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.860> trip<00:01:14.220> would<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
see here this trip would be for the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.810 
see here this trip would be for the
driver<00:01:15.450> terminal<00:01:16.080> down<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.670> gets

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
driver terminal down here it gets

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.180 
driver terminal down here it gets
information<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:18.960> next<00:01:19.260> stop<00:01:19.590> based<00:01:20.010> on

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
information for the next stop based on

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.800 
information for the next stop based on

tracked on the back end system and the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.290 
tracked on the back end system and the
operator<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.750> observe<00:01:25.490> where's<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.790> vehicle

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
operator can observe where's the vehicle

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.720 
operator can observe where's the vehicle
located<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.200> GPS<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.980> map<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.610> get

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
located by the GPS can map it you get

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.550 
located by the GPS can map it you get
some<00:01:29.880> alarms<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.870> corridor<00:01:31.380> or

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
some alarms if you're out of corridor or

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230 
some alarms if you're out of corridor or
something<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.190> so<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.060> data

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
something like that so it's all the data

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.970 
something like that so it's all the data
comes<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:33.990> front<00:01:34.140> from<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.680> unit
