techniques were perfect my joinery was

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.950 
techniques were perfect my joinery was
excellent<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.570> could<00:00:19.400> create<00:00:20.570> nice<00:00:21.570> tight

excellent I could create nice tight
fitting<00:00:22.320> joints<00:00:22.740> when<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> assembled<00:00:24.300> my

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
fitting joints when I assembled my

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:51.380 
fitting joints when I assembled my
joints<00:00:25.849> together<00:00:28.189> perfectly<00:00:33.680> perfectly<00:00:50.390> when

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
joints together perfectly perfectly when

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.049 
joints together perfectly perfectly when
I<00:00:51.420> assembled<00:00:51.899> my<00:00:51.930> joints<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.440> went<00:00:52.620> together

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
I assembled my joints that went together

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.930 
I assembled my joints that went together
perfectly<00:00:58.219> every<00:00:59.219> time<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> put<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> joint

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
perfectly every time I put a joint

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.090 
perfectly every time I put a joint
together<00:01:00.120> went<00:01:00.539> together<00:01:00.690> perfectly<00:01:04.100> hold

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
together went together perfectly hold

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.219 
together went together perfectly hold
still<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.520> nice<00:01:08.670> clean

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
still you can see that's a nice clean

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.450 
still you can see that's a nice clean
seamless<00:01:10.229> joint<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.220> my

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
seamless joint that's the way all my

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.969 
seamless joint that's the way all my
joints<00:01:11.790> were<00:01:12.350> but<00:01:13.350> there's<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.650> thing<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
joints were but there's one thing I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:23.210 
joints were but there's one thing I
could<00:01:14.040> never<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:21.049> no<00:01:22.049> matter<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.560> did<00:01:22.680> my

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
could never get no matter what I did my

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.490 
could never get no matter what I did my
joints<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.119> didn't<00:01:24.420> come<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.630> square<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
joints just didn't come out square it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
joints just didn't come out square it
was<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.430> frustrating<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.330> would<00:01:27.720> prepare

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
was just so frustrating I would prepare

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
was just so frustrating I would prepare
my<00:01:28.350> stock<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.280> carefully<00:01:29.850> make<00:01:30.210> sure

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
my stock so carefully make sure

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.480 
my stock so carefully make sure
everything<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.930> Square<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.950> flat<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
everything was Square and flat and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.200 
everything was Square and flat and
smooth<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.270> shiny<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.829> I'd<00:01:34.979> cut<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.250> joint<00:01:35.670> my

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
smooth and shiny and I'd cut my joint my

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
smooth and shiny and I'd cut my joint my
time<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> setup<00:01:36.990> check<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> all<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:38.040> test

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
time with the setup check it all do test

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.550 
time with the setup check it all do test
cuts<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.909> then<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> put<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.900> together<00:01:40.079> if

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
cuts and then when I put it together if

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.350 
cuts and then when I put it together if
they<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.070> didn't<00:01:41.369> end<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.579> square<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.210> would

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
they just didn't end up square I would

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.240 
they just didn't end up square I would
always<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.140> little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.890> light<00:01:44.070> at

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
always have a little bit of light at

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.740 
always have a little bit of light at
this<00:01:44.399> end<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.030> bit<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> light<00:01:45.390> here

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
this end or a little bit of light here

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.240 
this end or a little bit of light here
when<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> checked<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.590> my<00:01:46.710> square<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
when I checked it with my square and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.670 
when I checked it with my square and
that<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.240> disappointing<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.259> wanted<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that was so disappointing I I wanted to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
that was so disappointing I I wanted to
give<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.700> discovered<00:01:50.939> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
give up that's when I discovered this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.870 
give up that's when I discovered this
tool

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.969 

this<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.299> magic<00:01:55.479> square<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.409> changed

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
this is the magic square and it changed

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.099 
this is the magic square and it changed
the<00:01:57.280> way<00:01:57.429> that<00:01:57.609> I<00:01:57.670> do<00:01:57.789> woodwork<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.719> magic

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
the way that I do woodwork the magic

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.870 
the way that I do woodwork the magic
square<00:01:59.439> relies<00:01:59.859> on<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.159> principle<00:02:00.340> of

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
square relies on the principle of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.279 
square relies on the principle of
context<00:02:01.869> we<00:02:02.860> know<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.490> square<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.289> square

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
context we know that a square is square

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.770 
context we know that a square is square
we<00:02:06.250> know<00:02:06.369> that<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.549> bicycle<00:02:07.000> tire<00:02:07.270> is<00:02:07.479> round

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
we know that a bicycle tire is round

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.690 
we know that a bicycle tire is round
that<00:02:08.200> principle<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:08.890> makes<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.340> magic

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
that principle that makes the magic

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.369 
that principle that makes the magic
square<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.299> amazing<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.019> take<00:02:11.200> for

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
square so amazing and so take for

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.070 
square so amazing and so take for
example<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.950> joint<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.489> when<00:02:12.670> we<00:02:12.819> saw<00:02:13.080> that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
example this joint is when we saw that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.530 
example this joint is when we saw that
is<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.620> square<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.670> ordinary<00:02:16.180> square

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
is it square with this ordinary square

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.119 
is it square with this ordinary square
that's<00:02:16.840> what<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.110> magic<00:02:17.440> square<00:02:17.709> comes<00:02:17.950> and

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
that's what the magic square comes and

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:18.690 
that's what the magic square comes and
check<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.400> out

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
check this out

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.759 
check this out
but<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.879> set<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.330> magic<00:02:19.660> square<00:02:19.989> in<00:02:20.140> press<00:02:20.620> it

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
but I set the magic square in press it

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.930 
but I set the magic square in press it
into<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:21.010> corner<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.549> voila

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
into my corner and voila

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.300 
into my corner and voila
I<00:02:22.060> get<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.269> perfect<00:02:22.750> fit<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.140> see<00:02:23.410> no<00:02:23.620> light<00:02:23.830> along

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
I get a perfect fit I see no light along

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.729 
I get a perfect fit I see no light along
