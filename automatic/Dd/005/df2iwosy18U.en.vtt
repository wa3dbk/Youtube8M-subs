00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.590 
of love and light since they are so far
up<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:07.600> close<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.409> light<00:01:08.620> of<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.220> Sun

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
up and so close to the light of the Sun

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.980 
up and so close to the light of the Sun
then<00:01:10.600> they<00:01:10.900> are<00:01:10.930> drinking<00:01:11.620> that<00:01:12.010> light

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
then they are drinking that light

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.570 
then they are drinking that light
because<00:01:13.990> you<00:01:14.200> know<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.500> sunlight<00:01:14.979> has<00:01:15.220> two

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
because you know the sunlight has two

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.390 
because you know the sunlight has two
different<00:01:15.880> lights<00:01:16.869> one<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.950> physical

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
different lights one is the physical

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.690 
different lights one is the physical
light<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.380> other<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.070> spiritual

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
light and the other is the spiritual

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.280 
light and the other is the spiritual
light<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:24.100> these<00:01:24.700> two<00:01:25.150> lights<00:01:25.450> then<00:01:25.840> when

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
light so that these two lights then when

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.260 
light so that these two lights then when
being<00:01:27.280> swallowed<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.170> taken<00:01:29.170> in<00:01:29.380> as<00:01:29.619> food<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
being swallowed and taken in as food it

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.930 
being swallowed and taken in as food it
nurtures<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.830> soul<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:36.040> soul<00:01:36.370> wants

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
nurtures the soul and all the soul wants

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.770 
nurtures the soul and all the soul wants
to<00:01:37.180> do<00:01:37.360> for<00:01:37.810> all<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.410> time<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.040> is
