I am feeling that this could have

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.570 
I am feeling that this could have
lasting<00:03:15.840> effects<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.410> actual<00:03:16.920> franchise

won't<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.590> much<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.950> problem<00:03:35.160> with<00:03:35.460> it<00:03:35.580> I

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
won't have much of a problem with it I

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.860 
won't have much of a problem with it I
think<00:03:35.820> some<00:03:35.940> honorable<00:03:36.150> mentions<00:03:36.300> could<00:03:36.780> have

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
think some honorable mentions could have

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.840 
think some honorable mentions could have
been<00:03:36.960> AJ<00:03:37.260> Green<00:03:39.650> Demaryius<00:03:40.650> Thomas<00:03:40.820> but<00:03:41.820> I

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
been AJ Green Demaryius Thomas but I

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.280 
been AJ Green Demaryius Thomas but I
think<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:42.270> pretty<00:03:42.420> fair<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> think<00:03:42.960> it's

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
think it's pretty fair I think it's

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.690 
think it's pretty fair I think it's
pretty<00:03:43.410> clear<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.680> Antonio<00:03:44.010> Brown<00:03:44.370> has<00:03:44.550> been

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
pretty clear that Antonio Brown has been

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.920 
pretty clear that Antonio Brown has been
the<00:03:44.790> best<00:03:44.880> wide<00:03:45.090> receiver<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.420> football<00:03:45.510> for

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
the best wide receiver in football for

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.200 
the best wide receiver in football for
the<00:03:45.960> past<00:03:46.140> two<00:03:46.320> seasons<00:03:46.670> Calvin<00:03:47.670> when<00:03:47.850> healthy

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
the past two seasons Calvin when healthy

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.700 
the past two seasons Calvin when healthy
can<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.570> up<00:03:48.690> there<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:49.170> he<00:03:49.350> hasn't<00:03:49.620> been

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
can be up there but he hasn't been

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.830 
can be up there but he hasn't been
extremely<00:03:49.980> healthy<00:03:50.220> des<00:03:51.120> I'm<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.450> little<00:03:51.750> bit

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
extremely healthy des I'm a little bit

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.380 
extremely healthy des I'm a little bit
surprised<00:03:52.170> by<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.890> think<00:03:53.640> he's<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> little<00:03:54.120> bit

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
surprised by I think he's a little bit

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.690 
surprised by I think he's a little bit
overrated<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:55.110> terms<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.830> his<00:03:55.980> overall<00:03:56.340> stats

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
overrated in terms of his overall stats

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.350 
overrated in terms of his overall stats
but<00:03:57.480> at<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.110> same<00:03:58.320> time<00:03:58.560> they<00:03:59.490> wait<00:03:59.760> certain

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
but at the same time they wait certain

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.640 
but at the same time they wait certain
things<00:04:00.510> more<00:04:00.750> heavily<00:04:01.050> in<00:04:01.170> terms<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.500> wide

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
things more heavily in terms of wide

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.900 
things more heavily in terms of wide
receiver<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.040> think<00:04:02.250> des<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.430> probably<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
receiver I think des is probably the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.700 
receiver I think des is probably the
third<00:04:03.210> or<00:04:03.360> maybe<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.930> fourth<00:04:04.170> or<00:04:04.290> fifth<00:04:04.500> best

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
third or maybe the fourth or fifth best

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.240 
third or maybe the fourth or fifth best
wide<00:04:04.890> receiver<00:04:04.920> in<00:04:05.250> football<00:04:05.780> I<00:04:06.980> think<00:04:07.980> Julio

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
wide receiver in football I think Julio

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.460 
wide receiver in football I think Julio
is<00:04:08.310> better<00:04:08.610> than<00:04:08.790> des<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.330> terms<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.320> ability

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
is better than des in terms of ability

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.080 
is better than des in terms of ability
to<00:04:10.680> get<00:04:10.770> open<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.220> terms<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.520> things<00:04:11.700> like<00:04:11.790> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
to get open in terms of things like that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.699 
to get open in terms of things like that
I'm<00:04:12.360> pretty<00:04:12.959> sure<00:04:13.110> his<00:04:13.200> route-running<00:04:13.410> is

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
I'm pretty sure his route-running is

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.680 
I'm pretty sure his route-running is
better<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:15.060> fact<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:15.330> it's<00:04:15.510> catching

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
better and the fact that it's catching

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.380 
better and the fact that it's catching
is<00:04:15.959> lower<00:04:16.170> kind<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:16.950> his<00:04:17.270> little<00:04:18.270> bit

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
is lower kind of his little bit

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.760 
is lower kind of his little bit
mind-boggling<00:04:18.750> he<00:04:19.020> has<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.170> few<00:04:19.380> more<00:04:19.470> drops

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
mind-boggling he has a few more drops

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.450 
mind-boggling he has a few more drops
but<00:04:20.160> his<00:04:20.310> drop<00:04:20.580> rate<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.000> not<00:04:21.150> bad<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.860> he<00:04:23.250> gets

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
but his drop rate is not bad and he gets

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.610 
but his drop rate is not bad and he gets
over<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.180> he's<00:04:24.360> worn<00:04:24.630> out<00:04:24.780> more<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.590> I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
over you so he's worn out more so I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.230 
over you so he's worn out more so I
guess<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:25.919> could<00:04:26.040> say<00:04:26.160> a<00:04:26.190> stamina<00:04:26.610> might<00:04:26.970> be

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
guess you could say a stamina might be

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.850 
guess you could say a stamina might be
me<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.569> Sam<00:04:28.080> is<00:04:28.199> probably<00:04:28.410> even<00:04:28.500> better<00:04:28.590> than

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
me and Sam is probably even better than

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.469 
me and Sam is probably even better than
desert<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:29.280> he<00:04:29.460> has<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.330> many

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
desert because he has to have so many

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.360 
desert because he has to have so many
targets<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:31.199> he<00:04:31.259> he's<00:04:31.620> always<00:04:31.919> double<00:04:32.220> team

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
targets and he he's always double team

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.339 
targets and he he's always double team
because<00:04:32.759> everybody<00:04:33.599> knows<00:04:33.750> it's<00:04:34.020> going<00:04:34.259> to
