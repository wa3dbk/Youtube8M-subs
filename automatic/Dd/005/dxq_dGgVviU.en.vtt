volume<00:04:30.090> will<00:04:30.330> be<00:04:30.510> maybe<00:04:30.900> seven<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.620> nine<00:04:31.770> hours

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
volume will be maybe seven to nine hours

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.920 
volume will be maybe seven to nine hours
of<00:04:32.070> training<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.669> lot<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.450> though<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:33.900> just

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930

of training a lot of that though is just
practicing<00:04:34.680> techniques<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:35.370> imagine<00:04:35.970> if

practicing techniques so imagine if

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.940 
practicing techniques so imagine if
you're<00:04:36.360> squatting<00:04:36.720> or<00:04:36.930> deadlift<00:04:37.260> thing<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.620> lot

of that time you're only squatting or

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.150 
of that time you're only squatting or
dead<00:04:39.600> lifting<00:04:39.900> like<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.139> plate<00:04:40.440> or<00:04:40.470> two<00:04:40.889> plates
