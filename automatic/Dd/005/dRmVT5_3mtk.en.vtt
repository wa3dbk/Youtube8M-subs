that<00:01:32.920> putting<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.310> shimmery<00:01:33.729> color<00:01:34.030> down<00:01:34.210> first

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
that putting a shimmery color down first

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.590 
that putting a shimmery color down first
and<00:01:34.899> then<00:01:35.020> overlaying<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.890> with<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.069> matte

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and then overlaying it with a matte

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.899 
and then overlaying it with a matte
creates<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.689> really<00:01:37.960> cool<00:01:38.469> effect<00:01:38.909> it
