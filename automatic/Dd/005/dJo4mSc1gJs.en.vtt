00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
rack plugins so that's what I'm going to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.660 
rack plugins so that's what I'm going to
show<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.899> today<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.430> wanted

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
show you here today and so if I wanted

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150 
show you here today and so if I wanted
to<00:00:47.730> insert<00:00:48.180> an<00:00:48.360> analog<00:00:48.870> compressor<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.590> my

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
to insert an analog compressor on my

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
to insert an analog compressor on my
analog<00:00:50.670> console<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.420> old<00:00:51.660> days<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.199> would

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
analog console in the old days I would

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.889 
analog console in the old days I would
plug<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.920> an<00:00:53.070> insert<00:00:53.430> cable<00:00:53.820> which<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.629> tap

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
plug in an insert cable which would tap

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
plug in an insert cable which would tap
the<00:00:55.110> signal<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.770> after<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> mic<00:00:56.399> preamp<00:00:56.879> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the signal just after the mic preamp it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.110 
the signal just after the mic preamp it
would<00:00:57.600> send<00:00:57.930> my<00:00:58.410> vocal<00:00:58.829> signal<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
would send my vocal signal out to the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.660 
would send my vocal signal out to the
compressor<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> return<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
compressor and then the return of the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.160 
compressor and then the return of the
compressor<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.270> come<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
compressor would come back in on that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.109 
compressor would come back in on that
insert<00:01:04.650> cable<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.760> feed<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
insert cable and then feed that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.260 
insert cable and then feed that
processed<00:01:07.110> signal<00:01:07.350> back<00:01:08.159> down<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:08.820> channel

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
processed signal back down my channel

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.289 
processed signal back down my channel

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.750 
strip and out the faders to be mixed
well<00:01:13.200> we're<00:01:13.439> doing<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> exact<00:01:14.189> same<00:01:14.430> thing

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
well we're doing the exact same thing

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.320 
well we're doing the exact same thing
with<00:01:15.180> our<00:01:15.210> USB<00:01:15.990> recording<00:01:16.890> interface<00:01:17.790> option

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
with our USB recording interface option

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.960 
with our USB recording interface option
that<00:01:18.570> comes<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> XR<00:01:19.560> 18<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> first

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that comes with the XR 18 so the first

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.219 
that comes with the XR 18 so the first
thing<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.750> some<00:01:21.869> basic

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
thing we have to do is some basic

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.600 
thing we have to do is some basic
routing<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.430> over<00:01:23.580> here

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
routing and that's going to be over here

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.719 
routing and that's going to be over here
in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> routing<00:01:24.090> tab<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.570> course<00:01:25.220> by<00:01:26.220> default

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
in the routing tab of course by default

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.179 
in the routing tab of course by default
we're<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.479> ahead<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.189> channel

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
we're going to go ahead and have channel

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.740 
we're going to go ahead and have channel
16<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.930> USB<00:01:31.229> channel<00:01:31.799> 16<00:01:32.220> ok<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
16 go out the USB channel 16 ok that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.410 
16 go out the USB channel 16 ok that
means<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.860> appear<00:01:35.369> over<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> waves

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
means it's going to appear over in waves

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.550 
means it's going to appear over in waves
multi<00:01:36.869> rack<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.259> input<00:01:37.829> 16<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:39.090> USB<00:01:39.990> return<00:01:40.320> in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.889 
multi rack on input 16 the USB return in
this<00:01:40.950> case<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.119> 16<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.720> well

this case is going to be on 16 as well

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.859 
this case is going to be on 16 as well

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
rack is just a blank screen and then you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.740 
rack is just a blank screen and then you
double<00:01:59.040> click<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> add<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> rack<00:01:59.939> I've<00:02:00.240> done

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that your reverb unit so in waves multi

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.970 
that your reverb unit so in waves multi
rack<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.680> next<00:02:16.980> thing<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.250> want<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.790> do<00:02:17.970> is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
rack the next thing you want to do is

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.800 
rack the next thing you want to do is
route<00:02:19.980> your<00:02:20.190> ends<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.610> outs<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.630> this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
route your ends and outs and in this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
route your ends and outs and in this
case<00:02:22.050> it's<00:02:22.230> pretty<00:02:22.410> simple<00:02:22.800> again<00:02:23.100> we're<00:02:23.310> one

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
case it's pretty simple again we're one

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.870 
case it's pretty simple again we're one
to<00:02:23.730> one<00:02:23.940> channel<00:02:24.360> 16<00:02:24.960> is<00:02:25.190> sending<00:02:26.190> its<00:02:26.400> signal

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to one channel 16 is sending its signal

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.070 
to one channel 16 is sending its signal
out<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.270> USB<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.680> channel<00:02:29.160> 16<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.880> as<00:02:30.810> soon<00:02:30.960> as

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
out the USB to channel 16 and as soon as

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.670 
out the USB to channel 16 and as soon as
I<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:31.200> that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I do that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250 
I do that
of<00:02:31.770> course<00:02:32.070> you'll<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:32.880> sending<00:02:33.780> signal

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
of course you'll see I'm sending signal

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.800 
of course you'll see I'm sending signal
into<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.830> unit<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.400> then<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.850> course<00:02:36.090> we

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
into this unit and then of course we

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.240 
into this unit and then of course we
want<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.170> send<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.650> signal<00:02:37.710> out<00:02:38.250> 16<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:40.250> now

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
want to send that signal out 16 and now

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.310 
want to send that signal out 16 and now
it's<00:02:41.490> coming<00:02:41.850> back<00:02:42.120> into<00:02:42.390> my<00:02:42.570> channel<00:02:42.960> strip

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
it's coming back into my channel strip

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.040 
it's coming back into my channel strip
on<00:02:43.470> 16<00:02:43.980> now<00:02:44.670> don't<00:02:45.120> get<00:02:45.210> confused<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.870> not

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
on 16 now don't get confused this is not

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.000 
on 16 now don't get confused this is not
causing<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.860> feedback<00:02:47.760> loop<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.470> exactly

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
causing a feedback loop this is exactly

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.590 
causing a feedback loop this is exactly
the<00:02:50.160> same<00:02:50.340> thing<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.790> are<00:02:50.820> doing<00:02:51.240> with<00:02:51.480> an

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the same thing you are doing with an

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.830 
the same thing you are doing with an
analog<00:02:52.050> insert<00:02:52.530> cable<00:02:52.980> you're<00:02:53.580> coming<00:02:54.270> out<00:02:54.420> of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
analog insert cable you're coming out of

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.200 
analog insert cable you're coming out of
the<00:02:54.960> channel<00:02:55.200> 16<00:02:55.770> into<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:56.790> analog

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
the channel 16 into your analog

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.000 
the channel 16 into your analog
compressor<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.960> then<00:02:58.410> you're<00:02:58.650> putting<00:02:58.770> it

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
compressor and then you're putting it

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.980 
compressor and then you're putting it
right<00:02:59.040> back<00:02:59.430> into<00:02:59.610> channel<00:02:59.940> 16<00:03:00.390> for<00:03:00.750> further

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
right back into channel 16 for further

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.800 
right back into channel 16 for further
processing<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:02.850> all<00:03:03.030> we've<00:03:03.360> done<00:03:03.390> here

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
processing so that's all we've done here

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.930 
processing so that's all we've done here
is<00:03:04.050> just<00:03:04.350> set<00:03:04.470> up<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.800> rack<00:03:05.070> as<00:03:05.340> an<00:03:05.550> insert

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
is just set up this rack as an insert

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.610 
is just set up this rack as an insert
now<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.750> course<00:03:07.020> we're<00:03:07.170> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.320> be<00:03:07.440> able<00:03:07.500> to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
now of course we're going to be able to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.940 
now of course we're going to be able to
add<00:03:07.890> our<00:03:08.400> plugins<00:03:09.060> here<00:03:09.210> and<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:10.320> this<00:03:10.470> case<00:03:10.710> I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
add our plugins here and in this case I

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.330 
add our plugins here and in this case I
have<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.990> channel<00:03:12.990> strip<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:14.040> first<00:03:14.220> thing

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
have a channel strip the first thing

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.610 
have a channel strip the first thing
you'll<00:03:14.490> notice<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.910> I've<00:03:15.120> got<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.600> quite<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.470> bit

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
you'll notice is I've got a quite a bit

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.830 
you'll notice is I've got a quite a bit
of<00:03:16.650> EQ<00:03:16.830> going<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.400> here<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.390> certainly

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
of EQ going on here and it certainly

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.870 
of EQ going on here and it certainly
doesn't<00:03:19.080> seem<00:03:19.380> like<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.800> have<00:03:20.130> I'm<00:03:20.490> hearing

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
doesn't seem like I have I'm hearing

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.820 
doesn't seem like I have I'm hearing
anything<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.630> that's<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.170> that's<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.560> next

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
anything so that's the that's the next

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.670 
anything so that's the that's the next
thing<00:03:22.950> we<00:03:23.520> need<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.880> look<00:03:24.240> at<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.900> one<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
thing we need to look at is one of the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.820 
thing we need to look at is one of the
most<00:03:25.800> important<00:03:26.370> parts<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.880> understand<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.840> in

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
most important parts to understand is in

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.820 
most important parts to understand is in
your<00:03:29.280> system<00:03:29.580> here<00:03:29.850> we<00:03:30.750> are<00:03:31.020> set<00:03:31.500> up<00:03:31.650> as<00:03:31.800> a

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
your system here we are set up as a

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.699 
your system here we are set up as a
standard<00:03:32.400> channel<00:03:32.820> here<00:03:33.060> well<00:03:33.480> we<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.410> to

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
standard channel here well we have to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.880 
standard channel here well we have to
tell<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.550> channel<00:03:35.940> where<00:03:36.600> am<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.020> getting<00:03:37.350> my

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
tell the channel where am I getting my

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.190 
tell the channel where am I getting my
insert<00:03:38.370> from<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.209> certainly<00:03:39.570> isn't

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
insert from and it certainly isn't

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.220 
insert from and it certainly isn't
through<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.070> analog<00:03:41.580> channel<00:03:42.000> strip<00:03:42.239> here<00:03:42.510> so

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
through the analog channel strip here so

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.620 
through the analog channel strip here so
on<00:03:43.500> my<00:03:43.739> microphone<00:03:44.220> channel<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.940> simply<00:03:45.450> have

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
on my microphone channel I simply have

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.090 
on my microphone channel I simply have
to<00:03:45.810> tell<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:47.010> its<00:03:47.310> input<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.120> coming<00:03:48.870> from

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
to tell it that its input is coming from

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.210 
to tell it that its input is coming from
usb<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.870> if<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.989> click<00:03:52.200> over<00:03:52.350> here<00:03:52.470> you'll

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
usb and if I click over here you'll

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.190 
usb and if I click over here you'll
immediately<00:03:53.640> hear<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.870> EQ<00:03:55.550> because<00:03:56.900> it's<00:03:57.900> now

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
immediately hear the EQ because it's now

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.770 
immediately hear the EQ because it's now
returning<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.100> processed<00:03:59.760> signal<00:03:59.940> back

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
returning this processed signal back

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.930 
returning this processed signal back
through<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.170> USB<00:04:01.500> card<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.280> that's<00:04:02.489> what<00:04:02.820> I'm

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
through the USB card and that's what I'm

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.430 
through the USB card and that's what I'm
hearing<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.570> let's<00:04:03.720> go<00:04:03.780> ahead<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.080> come<00:04:04.350> over

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
hearing so let's go ahead and come over

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.070 
hearing so let's go ahead and come over
here<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.620> fix<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.100> EQ<00:04:05.750> we'll<00:04:06.750> get<00:04:06.900> rid<00:04:07.050> of

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
here and fix this EQ we'll get rid of

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.930 
here and fix this EQ we'll get rid of
this<00:04:07.200> boost<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.830> did<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.580> so<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.880> was

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
this boost I did that just so it was

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.790 
this boost I did that just so it was
obvious<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:09.989> can<00:04:10.110> clearly<00:04:10.350> see<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:10.770> that

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
obvious and you can clearly see now that

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.610 
obvious and you can clearly see now that
I've<00:04:11.010> got<00:04:11.220> bass<00:04:11.820> roll-off<00:04:12.390> all<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:13.350> way<00:04:13.470> up

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
I've got bass roll-off all the way up

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.240 
I've got bass roll-off all the way up
here<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.780> full<00:04:15.780> EQ<00:04:16.200> function<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.770> can<00:04:17.010> come<00:04:17.220> up

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
here and full EQ function I can come up

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.310 
here and full EQ function I can come up
here<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.549> do<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.640> little<00:04:17.700> boost<00:04:18.140> now<00:04:19.140> I'm<00:04:19.200> just

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
here and do a little boost now I'm just

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.050 
here and do a little boost now I'm just
going<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.530> show<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.709> an<00:04:20.010> example<00:04:20.580> on<00:04:20.790> one

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
going to show you an example on one

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.310 
going to show you an example on one
channel<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.510> course<00:04:21.810> you're<00:04:21.960> going<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.109> take

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
channel of course you're going to take

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.130 
channel of course you're going to take
that<00:04:22.530> concept<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.280> typically<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.510> do<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> one

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
that concept and typically just do a one

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.290 
that concept and typically just do a one
to<00:04:25.260> one<00:04:25.289> if<00:04:25.680> you've<00:04:25.800> got<00:04:25.979> 12<00:04:26.550> channels

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
to one if you've got 12 channels

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.050 
to one if you've got 12 channels

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
in your band and you want to have access

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.510 
in your band and you want to have access

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
to the plugins you're going to set up 12

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.180 
to the plugins you're going to set up 12
racks<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.090> you're<00:04:33.599> going<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:33.780> go<00:04:33.990> one<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.889> one

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
racks and you're going to go one in one

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.730

out<00:04:35.220> two<00:04:35.909> in<00:04:36.180> two<00:04:36.479> out<00:04:36.659> and<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.020> forth<00:04:37.319> for<00:04:37.590> all

the channels in your band and that would

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.350 
the channels in your band and that would
be<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.960> main<00:04:40.199> way<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.400> use<00:04:41.669> your<00:04:42.060> waves

multi<00:04:42.780> rack<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.650> next<00:04:43.860> one<00:04:44.009> might<00:04:44.370> be<00:04:44.400> to

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
multi rack the next one might be to

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.960 
multi rack the next one might be to
create<00:04:44.840> some<00:04:45.840> auxilary<00:04:46.710> sins<00:04:47.400> like<00:04:47.639> you<00:04:47.789> would

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
create some auxilary sins like you would

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.379 
create some auxilary sins like you would
a<00:04:48.000> reverb<00:04:48.360> or<00:04:48.479> delay<00:04:48.770> now<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.830> XR<00:04:50.580> 18<00:04:51.000> has<00:04:51.180> got

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
a reverb or delay now the XR 18 has got

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.309 
a reverb or delay now the XR 18 has got
really<00:04:51.990> great<00:04:52.169> reverbs<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.069> delays<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:55.050> in

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
really great reverbs and delays and in

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.420 
really great reverbs and delays and in
effects<00:04:55.770> it's<00:04:56.520> honestly<00:04:57.319> making<00:04:58.319> waves<00:04:58.680> multi

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
effects it's honestly making waves multi

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.059 
effects it's honestly making waves multi
rack<00:04:59.639> almost<00:05:00.150> not<00:05:00.360> necessary<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.380> if<00:05:01.830> you've

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
rack almost not necessary but if you've

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.529 
rack almost not necessary but if you've
got<00:05:02.099> some<00:05:02.580> plugins<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.150> think<00:05:03.449> are

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
got some plugins that you think are

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.779 
got some plugins that you think are
superior<00:05:04.050> or<00:05:04.289> theyíre<00:05:04.470> used<00:05:04.919> to<00:05:05.130> these<00:05:05.669> are

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
superior or theyíre used to these are

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.730 
superior or theyíre used to these are
certainly<00:05:06.060> going<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.810> want<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:06.990> use<00:05:07.229> those<00:05:07.470> so

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
certainly going to want to use those so

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.529 
certainly going to want to use those so
let's<00:05:07.919> take<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.069> look<00:05:08.250> at<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.490> so<00:05:09.240> what<00:05:09.449> I've

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
let's take a look at that so what I've

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.529 
let's take a look at that so what I've
got<00:05:09.569> here<00:05:09.750> is<00:05:10.259> a<00:05:10.289> second<00:05:10.889> rack<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.000> I've<00:05:12.270> got<00:05:12.509> a

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
got here is a second rack and I've got a

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.830 
got here is a second rack and I've got a
reverb<00:05:12.990> setup<00:05:13.380> on<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:14.130> in<00:05:15.090> this<00:05:15.270> case<00:05:15.330> I've

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
reverb setup on it and in this case I've

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.249 
reverb setup on it and in this case I've
got<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:17.630> effects<00:05:18.630> send<00:05:19.139> one<00:05:19.580> coming<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:20.909> on

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
got the effects send one coming in on

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.730 
got the effects send one coming in on
three<00:05:22.259> and<00:05:22.669> I've<00:05:23.669> got<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.180> returning<00:05:24.780> on<00:05:24.960> 17

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
three and I've got it returning on 17

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.399 
three and I've got it returning on 17
and<00:05:25.770> 18<00:05:26.280> now<00:05:27.210> we've<00:05:27.419> got<00:05:27.569> to<00:05:27.690> set<00:05:27.900> that<00:05:28.050> up<00:05:28.080> in

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
and 18 now we've got to set that up in

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.950 
and 18 now we've got to set that up in
the<00:05:28.800> XR<00:05:29.280> 18<00:05:29.699> routing<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.270> get<00:05:30.389> it<00:05:30.479> to<00:05:30.569> come<00:05:30.599> over

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
the XR 18 routing to get it to come over

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.719 
the XR 18 routing to get it to come over
here<00:05:31.139> in<00:05:31.229> return<00:05:31.639> so<00:05:32.639> let's<00:05:32.819> look<00:05:32.940> at<00:05:33.090> that<00:05:34.729> so

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
here in return so let's look at that so

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.370 
here in return so let's look at that so
the<00:05:35.849> first<00:05:36.030> thing<00:05:36.180> we<00:05:36.270> need<00:05:36.419> to<00:05:36.449> do<00:05:36.659> is<00:05:36.900> make

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
the first thing we need to do is make

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.300 
the first thing we need to do is make
sure<00:05:37.409> that<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.490> USB<00:05:39.240> output<00:05:39.719> in<00:05:39.979> our<00:05:40.979> case

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
sure that the USB output in our case

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.309 
sure that the USB output in our case
it's<00:05:41.580> number<00:05:41.940> three<00:05:42.300> it's<00:05:42.569> going<00:05:42.779> to<00:05:42.840> default

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 
it's number three it's going to default

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.070 
it's number three it's going to default
right<00:05:43.680> here<00:05:44.099> but<00:05:44.880> I've<00:05:45.000> chosen<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.479> use<00:05:45.509> number

right here but I've chosen to use number

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.339 
right here but I've chosen to use number
three<00:05:46.349> as<00:05:46.529> the<00:05:47.310> effects<00:05:47.789> one<00:05:48.210> send<00:05:48.690> and<00:05:49.110> if<00:05:49.259> you

that I decided to use returns 17 and 18
for<00:06:06.659> the<00:06:06.900> effects<00:06:07.349> 1<00:06:07.620> so<00:06:07.889> let's<00:06:08.069> just<00:06:08.250> come

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
see that effects one is getting its

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.700 
see that effects one is getting its
signal<00:06:14.940> from<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.330> USB<00:06:16.190> card<00:06:18.080> channel<00:06:19.080> 17<00:06:19.560> and

where those effects sends come from

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.950 
where those effects sends come from
that's<00:06:28.590> going<00:06:28.919> to<00:06:29.009> be<00:06:29.190> or<00:06:29.490> right<00:06:29.819> here<00:06:30.090> so<00:06:30.779> look

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
from the XR 18 reverb but that's just a

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.800 
from the XR 18 reverb but that's just a

one-to-one basis for your channels and

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.810 
one-to-one basis for your channels and
also<00:07:28.930> use<00:07:29.380> some<00:07:29.590> of<00:07:29.620> the<00:07:29.740> really<00:07:29.950> nice<00:07:30.130> routing

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820 
also use some of the really nice routing

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.540 
also use some of the really nice routing
options<00:07:31.030> that<00:07:31.330> are<00:07:31.450> built<00:07:31.690> into<00:07:31.930> the<00:07:32.080> XR<00:07:32.440> 18<00:07:32.860> to

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
options that are built into the XR 18 to

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.160 
options that are built into the XR 18 to
get<00:07:33.700> creative<00:07:33.940> and<00:07:34.240> do<00:07:34.390> more<00:07:34.600> things<00:07:34.810> now

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.170 
get creative and do more things now

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.110 
get creative and do more things now
there's<00:07:35.890> one<00:07:36.130> thing<00:07:36.310> that<00:07:36.490> is<00:07:36.610> not<00:07:36.760> programmed

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 
there's one thing that is not programmed

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.960 
there's one thing that is not programmed
in<00:07:37.660> to<00:07:37.900> the<00:07:38.080> XR<00:07:38.440> 18<00:07:38.830> yet<00:07:39.100> and<00:07:39.310> I'm<00:07:39.580> hoping<00:07:39.910> that

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:39.970 
in to the XR 18 yet and I'm hoping that

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.240 
in to the XR 18 yet and I'm hoping that
behringer<00:07:40.450> does<00:07:40.630> this<00:07:40.840> and<00:07:41.080> that<00:07:41.680> is<00:07:41.830> giving

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
behringer does this and that is giving

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.080 
behringer does this and that is giving
us<00:07:42.460> a<00:07:42.820> USB<00:07:43.600> return<00:07:43.990> function<00:07:44.320> and<00:07:44.940> that<00:07:45.940> would

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
us a USB return function and that would

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.950 
us a USB return function and that would
allow<00:07:46.180> us<00:07:46.390> to<00:07:46.810> route<00:07:47.050> out<00:07:47.290> the<00:07:48.130> left-right

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 
allow us to route out the left-right

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.250 
allow us to route out the left-right
into<00:07:49.960> waves<00:07:50.170> multi<00:07:50.650> rack<00:07:50.860> and<00:07:51.130> then<00:07:51.820> over<00:07:52.180> here

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.260 
into waves multi rack and then over here

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.240 
into waves multi rack and then over here
click<00:07:53.260> on<00:07:53.410> USB<00:07:53.890> to<00:07:54.670> return<00:07:55.630> that<00:07:55.870> insert<00:07:56.320> so

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.250 
click on USB to return that insert so
