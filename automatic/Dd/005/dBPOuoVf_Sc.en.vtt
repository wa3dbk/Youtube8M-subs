00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.840
 the golden mean is when this or that 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.839
 thing 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.050

 Korean sedan length a little 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.240
 exceeds four and a half meters 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.070
 it's not too bulky for cramped 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.070
 megalopolises and not so small 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.140
 to appear subcompact design 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
 Disputes do not cause rapid 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.030
 streamlined body styles go very and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 this car for a place in the sun 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 Elantra has to compete with 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 sedans like honda civic 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.899
 mitsubishi lancer and mazda 3 are awesome 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.489

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 two meter basketball player 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.399
 or sumo wrestler in front of the cabin 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.609
 Koreans also have reason to be proud 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 for example why not boast fresh 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.780
 sculptural design central 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.479
 ergonomic console no problem 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.299
 the driver get behind the wheel with a full 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.400
 convenience in two accounts 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.140
 don't miss the leather-trimmed steering wheel and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.299
 gear knob 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 air conditioning electrical package 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.700
 radio with steering wheel control 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.320
 confuses only the lack of soft plastics in 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.689
 finish though for this class 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.330
 cars is ok elantra 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.860
 offered with two options 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.350
 motor volume 1.65 unified force year 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.620
 say quite good power for 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.690

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.180
 Leha's car starts and always 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.550
 leaves the traffic lights among the first in 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.210
 city â€‹â€‹no problem but on high 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.390
 speeds 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.280
 elantra accelerated not so briskly to overtake 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.220
 and you need to go in speed margin 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.380
 however, our car is equipped with an automatic 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.110
 which sometimes is not too fast 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.290
 switches can not fail to transmit movement 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.510
 mark first-class noise isolation not 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.270
 engine not headwind in the cabin 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.550
 almost inaudible ride quality 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.800
 tuned for maximum comfort 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 the car is gently spreading on asphalt 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.810
 literally lulls the type with its smooth 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.850
 course however at speeds of over a hundred 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.280
 kilometers per hour on road waves 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.210

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 would the car be nice in all 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.610
 relationship the company hyundai salandra and 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.090
