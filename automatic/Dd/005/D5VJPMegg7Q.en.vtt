need to address first so first of all
we'll<00:00:36.339> look<00:00:36.399> at<00:00:36.579> field<00:00:36.909> swimming<00:00:37.089> without<00:00:37.929> any

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
aids we're just going to have a look to

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.340 
aids we're just going to have a look to
see<00:00:40.539> if<00:00:40.690> your<00:00:40.870> technique<00:00:41.260> needs<00:00:41.589> improving

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.740 

our<00:00:47.890> CEO<00:00:48.250> is<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.489> very<00:00:48.760> strong<00:00:48.970> swimmer<00:00:49.210> elite

our CEO is a very strong swimmer elite

our CEO is a very strong swimmer elite
level<00:00:49.870> swimmer<00:00:50.290> there's<00:00:50.980> not<00:00:51.160> much<00:00:51.900> that<00:00:52.900> can

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
level swimmer there's not much that can

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.450 
level swimmer there's not much that can
be<00:00:53.140> improved<00:00:53.350> but<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.770> main<00:00:53.950> things<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.280> look

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
be improved but the main things to look

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.860 
be improved but the main things to look
out<00:00:54.610> for<00:00:54.760> when<00:00:54.880> you're<00:00:55.000> swimming<00:00:55.450> air

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
out for when you're swimming air

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.530 
out for when you're swimming air
trapping<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.770> keep<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.910> regular<00:00:58.330> pattern

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
trapping is to keep a regular pattern

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.360 
trapping is to keep a regular pattern
that<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:58.900> can<00:00:59.050> sustain<00:00:59.290> throughout<00:01:00.220> the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
that you can sustain throughout the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.400 
that you can sustain throughout the
distance<00:01:00.790> you've<00:01:01.090> chosen<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.930> compete<00:01:02.079> in

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
distance you've chosen to compete in

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.040 
distance you've chosen to compete in
there's<00:01:03.070> no<00:01:03.220> point<00:01:03.489> going<00:01:03.640> all<00:01:03.879> out<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.420> doing

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
there's no point going all out and doing

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.820 
there's no point going all out and doing
a<00:01:05.229> massive<00:01:05.500> big<00:01:06.630> 1,500<00:01:07.630> meter<00:01:07.810> swim<00:01:08.080> when<00:01:08.740> you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
a massive big 1,500 meter swim when you

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
a massive big 1,500 meter swim when you
can't<00:01:09.009> maintain<00:01:09.430> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
can't maintain it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.390 
can't maintain it
sprint<00:01:10.990> would<00:01:11.380> be<00:01:11.500> recommended<00:01:12.100> for<00:01:12.280> those

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
sprint would be recommended for those

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.980 
sprint would be recommended for those
who<00:01:12.640> are<00:01:12.700> starting<00:01:12.910> out<00:01:13.180> on<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.330> track<00:01:13.630> than<00:01:13.869> a

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
who are starting out on a track than a

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.100 
who are starting out on a track than a
smaller<00:01:14.490> smaller<00:01:15.490> distance<00:01:16.060> what<00:01:16.869> we're<00:01:16.990> now

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
smaller smaller distance what we're now

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.270 
smaller smaller distance what we're now
going<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.350> look<00:01:17.470> at<00:01:17.619> though<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.770> some<00:01:18.040> training

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
going to look at though is some training

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.190 
going to look at though is some training
principles<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:19.090> can<00:01:19.210> then<00:01:19.300> be<00:01:19.360> used<00:01:19.750> to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
principles that can then be used to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.969 
principles that can then be used to
encourage<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:22.210> swim<00:01:22.479> times<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:23.410> drop<00:01:23.619> quite

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
encourage the swim times to drop quite

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.350 
encourage the swim times to drop quite
drastically<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.880> we're<00:01:24.970> gonna<00:01:25.060> first<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.300> all

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
drastically so we're gonna first of all

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.749 
drastically so we're gonna first of all
do<00:01:25.479> an<00:01:25.600> overload<00:01:26.080> exercise<00:01:26.619> on<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.550> upper

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
do an overload exercise on the upper

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.450 
do an overload exercise on the upper
body<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.470> going<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.710> basically<00:01:29.830> involve

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
body which is going to basically involve

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.880 
body which is going to basically involve
us<00:01:30.610> crossing<00:01:30.940> our<00:01:31.180> legs<00:01:31.210> together<00:01:31.630> not<00:01:32.530> using

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
us crossing our legs together not using

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.170 
us crossing our legs together not using
our<00:01:32.979> legs<00:01:33.100> imagining<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.880> legs<00:01:34.030> are

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
our legs imagining that the legs are

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.719 
our legs imagining that the legs are
tied<00:01:34.390> together<00:01:34.660> and<00:01:35.110> just<00:01:35.800> using<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.369> arms

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
tied together and just using the arms

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.080 
tied together and just using the arms
only<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.509> do<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.660> few<00:01:37.930> lengths<00:01:38.200> alright<00:01:39.100> what

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
only to do a few lengths alright what

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.910 
only to do a few lengths alright what
happen<00:01:40.479> is<00:01:40.600> these<00:01:40.750> legs<00:01:41.020> will<00:01:41.200> start<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.740> drop

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
happen is these legs will start to drop

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.300 
happen is these legs will start to drop
a<00:01:41.979> little<00:01:42.160> bit<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.670> sway<00:01:43.509> a<00:01:43.539> little<00:01:43.690> bit

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a little bit and sway a little bit

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.999 
a little bit and sway a little bit
causing<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.460> lot<00:01:45.670> more<00:01:45.940> work<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:47.560> done<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:47.920> the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
causing a lot more work be done on the

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.169 
causing a lot more work be done on the
upper<00:01:48.220> body<00:01:48.399> so<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.670> selectively<00:01:49.000> already

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
upper body so it selectively already

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.120 
upper body so it selectively already
dropped<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.750> couple<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.649> feet<00:01:50.830> below<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
dropped a couple of feet below the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.710 
dropped a couple of feet below the
surface<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.610> it's<00:01:51.820> swaying<00:01:52.090> on<00:01:52.360> everyone

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
surface and it's swaying on everyone

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.870 
surface and it's swaying on everyone
providing<00:01:53.320> more<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.619> more<00:01:53.710> drag<00:01:54.189> so<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:54.759> is

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
providing more and more drag so this is

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.039 
providing more and more drag so this is
the<00:01:54.970> opposite<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.479> what<00:01:55.540> we<00:01:55.720> want<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.960> achieve

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
the opposite of what we want to achieve

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.149 
the opposite of what we want to achieve
when<00:01:56.740> we're<00:01:56.890> competing<00:01:57.189> but<00:01:58.119> in<00:01:58.540> training

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
when we're competing but in training

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.179 
when we're competing but in training
this<00:02:00.159> can<00:02:00.400> overload<00:02:01.000> our<00:02:01.930> upper<00:02:02.229> body<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:02.710> in

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
this can overload our upper body and in

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.069 
this can overload our upper body and in
essence<00:02:03.610> give<00:02:03.820> us<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.570> good<00:02:04.780> upper<00:02:05.049> body

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
essence give us the good upper body

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.859 
essence give us the good upper body
workout<00:02:05.770> which<00:02:06.159> can<00:02:06.850> be<00:02:07.090> achieved<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.659> gym

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
workout which can be achieved in the gym

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.440 
workout which can be achieved in the gym
but<00:02:08.829> in<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.429> gym<00:02:09.640> obviously<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> lot<00:02:10.420> more

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
but in the gym obviously a lot more

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.030 
but in the gym obviously a lot more
exercise<00:02:11.019> needs<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.350> be<00:02:11.440> done<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.860> there's<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
exercise needs to be done and there's a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.490 
exercise needs to be done and there's a
much<00:02:12.280> greater<00:02:12.610> risk<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.060> injury<00:02:13.450> we're<00:02:14.380> now

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
much greater risk of injury we're now

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500 
much greater risk of injury we're now
going<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.769> do<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.400> opposite<00:02:15.850> version<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.360> that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
going to do the opposite version of that

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.289 
going to do the opposite version of that
which<00:02:17.140> equates<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.709> overload<00:02:18.280> in<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.579> legs<00:02:18.790> so

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
which equates to overload in the legs so

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.060 
which equates to overload in the legs so
now<00:02:19.450> we're<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.200> leg<00:02:20.350> version<00:02:20.739> by

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
now we're going to do the leg version by

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
now we're going to do the leg version by
holding<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.579> float<00:02:22.680> against<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.010> water<00:02:24.190> 90<00:02:24.730> 90

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
holding a float against the water 90 90

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.020 
holding a float against the water 90 90
degree<00:02:25.360> angle<00:02:25.780> against<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.230> water<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.730> just

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
degree angle against the water and just

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.640 
degree angle against the water and just
kicking<00:02:28.209> only<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.110> breathe<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
kicking only the breathe it's the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.740 
kicking only the breathe it's the
breaststroke<00:02:29.920> breath<00:02:30.280> okay<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.269> this<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.630> now

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
breaststroke breath okay so this is now

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.990 
breaststroke breath okay so this is now
providing<00:02:32.260> maximum<00:02:32.440> resistance<00:02:33.040> at<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
providing maximum resistance at the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.970 
providing maximum resistance at the
front<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.390> body<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:35.049> overloading<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
front of the body so overloading the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.980 
front of the body so overloading the
legs<00:02:36.220> on<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.820> occasion

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
legs on this occasion

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.860 
legs on this occasion
so<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:38.740> both<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.100> these<00:02:39.220> tools<00:02:39.460> we've<00:02:39.670> used

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
so on both of these tools we've used

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.860 
so on both of these tools we've used
specificity<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.670> muscle<00:02:42.940> groups<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.450> work

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
specificity on the muscle groups to work

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.910 
specificity on the muscle groups to work
them<00:02:44.020> out<00:02:44.170> individually<00:02:46.260> again<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
them out individually again this is the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.290 
them out individually again this is the
opposite<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.490> what<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.790> want<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.030> be<00:02:49.120> doing

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
opposite of what we want to be doing

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.060 
opposite of what we want to be doing
when<00:02:49.480> we're<00:02:49.630> competing<00:02:49.930> when<00:02:50.920> we're

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
when we're competing when we're

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.370 
when we're competing when we're
competing<00:02:51.310> we're<00:02:51.670> trying<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.000> minimize

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
competing we're trying to minimize

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:10.070 
competing we're trying to minimize
frontal<00:02:53.380> resistance<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.130> drag

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.530 

another<00:03:10.830> thing<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.250> be<00:03:11.370> aware<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.700> when<00:03:12.300> you're

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
another thing to be aware of when you're

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.420 
another thing to be aware of when you're
thinking<00:03:13.380> about<00:03:13.500> competing<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:14.130> entrapment

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
thinking about competing in entrapment

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.880 
thinking about competing in entrapment
is<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.000> need<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.540> different<00:03:16.350> breeds<00:03:16.770> and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
is you need to have different breeds and

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.460 
is you need to have different breeds and
patterns<00:03:17.310> throughout<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.450> race<00:03:18.660> or<00:03:18.960> at<00:03:19.290> least

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
patterns throughout the race or at least

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.140 
patterns throughout the race or at least
available<00:03:19.800> throughout<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.790> race<00:03:20.940> because

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
available throughout the race because

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.480 
available throughout the race because
you<00:03:21.480> might<00:03:21.900> swim<00:03:22.110> very<00:03:22.140> well<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.770> first<00:03:22.980> 500

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
you might swim very well the first 500

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.430 
you might swim very well the first 500
meters<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:23.970> then<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.720> last<00:03:24.900> sex<00:03:25.140> or<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.290> race

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
meters but then the last sex or the race

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.630 
meters but then the last sex or the race
is<00:03:25.710> you're<00:03:25.860> running<00:03:26.100> out<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.310> there<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.520> need

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
is you're running out of there you need

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.610 
is you're running out of there you need
to<00:03:26.700> be<00:03:26.820> as<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.210> they<00:03:27.330> have<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.570> drop<00:03:28.110> down<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
to be as if they have to drop down to a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.050 
to be as if they have to drop down to a
faster<00:03:29.100> breathing<00:03:29.400> pattern<00:03:29.760> without

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
faster breathing pattern without

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.270 
faster breathing pattern without
affecting<00:03:30.780> your<00:03:30.870> technique<00:03:31.230> too<00:03:31.380> much<00:03:31.620> so

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
affecting your technique too much so

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.340 
affecting your technique too much so
this<00:03:32.670> time<00:03:32.910> Theo<00:03:33.210> is<00:03:33.360> gonna<00:03:33.540> demonstrate<00:03:33.750> a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
this time Theo is gonna demonstrate a

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.260 
this time Theo is gonna demonstrate a
free<00:03:34.950> stroke<00:03:35.280> breathing<00:03:35.820> pattern<00:03:36.120> which<00:03:36.240> is

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
free stroke breathing pattern which is

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.370 
free stroke breathing pattern which is
useful<00:03:36.750> when<00:03:36.870> you're<00:03:36.990> doing<00:03:37.020> traveling

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
useful when you're doing traveling

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.920 
useful when you're doing traveling
because<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:38.430> regular<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.630> get<00:03:39.780> to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
because it's regular and you get to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.170 
because it's regular and you get to
breed<00:03:40.230> on<00:03:40.920> both<00:03:41.190> sides<00:03:43.280> keeping<00:03:44.280> an<00:03:44.610> eye<00:03:44.790> on

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
breed on both sides keeping an eye on

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.780 
breed on both sides keeping an eye on
what's<00:03:46.110> going<00:03:46.200> on<00:03:46.740> around<00:03:46.800> you<00:03:47.370> while<00:03:47.580> you're

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
what's going on around you while you're

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.970 
what's going on around you while you're
competing<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:48.600> we<00:03:48.720> start<00:03:48.960> off<00:03:49.050> with<00:03:49.710> four

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
competing so we start off with four

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.460 
competing so we start off with four
links<00:03:50.340> free<00:03:50.880> stroke<00:03:51.180> breathing<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:52.200> fear

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
links free stroke breathing then fear

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.530 
links free stroke breathing then fear
will<00:03:52.560> drop<00:03:52.860> down<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.100> a<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.550> two<00:03:53.970> stroke<00:03:54.300> pattern

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
will drop down to a a two stroke pattern

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.960 
will drop down to a a two stroke pattern
to<00:03:55.260> simulate<00:03:55.470> being<00:03:55.830> more<00:03:56.100> tired<00:03:56.400> towards<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
to simulate being more tired towards the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:20.710 
to simulate being more tired towards the
end<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.210> the<00:03:57.360> race

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.320 

okay<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:22.130> now<00:04:22.250> twos<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.790> now<00:04:22.880> twos

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.809 

so<00:04:28.780> now<00:04:28.960> if<00:04:29.500> he<00:04:29.650> was<00:04:29.770> more<00:04:29.919> tired<00:04:30.159> you'd<00:04:30.729> be

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
so now if he was more tired you'd be

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:36.149 
so now if he was more tired you'd be
taking<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.240> more<00:04:31.419> oxygen<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.830> fact<00:04:36.039> is

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
taking in more oxygen and the fact is

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.659 
taking in more oxygen and the fact is
the<00:04:36.280> longer<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.610> race<00:04:36.759> goes<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:39.520> more

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
the longer the race goes on the more

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.050 
the longer the race goes on the more
aerobic<00:04:40.000> capacity<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.599> required<00:04:41.610> an<00:04:42.610> aerobic

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
aerobic capacity is required an aerobic

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.420 
aerobic capacity is required an aerobic
event<00:04:43.389> so<00:04:44.139> the<00:04:44.229> breathing<00:04:44.440> has<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:45.009> be<00:04:45.099> spot-on

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
event so the breathing has to be spot-on

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.600 
event so the breathing has to be spot-on

whilst we scull now this is great for
