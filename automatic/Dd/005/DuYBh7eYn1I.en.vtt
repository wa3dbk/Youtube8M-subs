00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
we're like so you can't oil them

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.290 
we're like so you can't oil them
independently<00:00:30.339> or<00:00:30.579> you<00:00:30.820> can<00:00:30.970> do<00:00:31.060> them<00:00:31.179> both

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200

we're going to we're going to squeeze it
into<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:55.990> filter<00:00:56.200> we're<00:00:56.410> not<00:00:56.500> twisting<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:57.700> as

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
into the filter we're not twisting so as

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.170 
into the filter we're not twisting so as
to<00:00:58.560> damage<00:00:59.560> the<00:00:59.680> filter<00:01:00.010> pull<00:01:00.490> it<00:01:00.580> away<00:01:00.670> I'm

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180

to damage the filter pull it away I'm
going<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.360> pour<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.540> little<00:01:01.660> bit<00:01:01.810> inside<00:01:02.140> as

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
going to pour a little bit inside as

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.200 
going to pour a little bit inside as
well<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.619> we<00:01:05.710> run<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.130> through<00:01:06.340> out<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
well and we run it through out the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.219 
well and we run it through out the
filter<00:01:07.479> okay<00:01:07.600> that's<00:01:07.869> good

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
filter okay that's good

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.739 
filter okay that's good
so<00:01:08.829> we're<00:01:08.950> throughout<00:01:09.219> the<00:01:09.369> whole<00:01:09.520> filter<00:01:09.909> at

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
so we're throughout the whole filter at

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:13.800 
so we're throughout the whole filter at
this<00:01:10.960> point<00:01:11.200> we're<00:01:12.390> kneading<00:01:13.390> it<00:01:13.479> into<00:01:13.719> the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
this point we're kneading it into the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.789 
this point we're kneading it into the
filter<00:01:14.369> squeezing<00:01:16.109> so<00:01:17.109> that<00:01:17.259> we<00:01:17.350> get<00:01:17.469> complete

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
filter squeezing so that we get complete

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.679 
filter squeezing so that we get complete
saturation<00:01:18.069> throughout<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.030> entire<00:01:19.329> filter

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
saturation throughout the entire filter

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.130 
saturation throughout the entire filter
so<00:01:20.350> there's<00:01:20.530> no<00:01:21.240> dry<00:01:22.240> spots<00:01:22.659> throughout<00:01:22.960> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
so there's no dry spots throughout the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.209 
so there's no dry spots throughout the
filter<00:01:23.880> rubbing<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.109> oil<00:01:26.109> throughout<00:01:26.560> as<00:01:26.770> you

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
filter rubbing the oil throughout as you

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
turn it all the way around so we're

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.700

the<00:01:56.439> whole<00:01:56.709> filter<00:01:57.039> like<00:01:57.819> so<00:01:57.999> inside<00:01:58.810> okay

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
the whole filter like so inside okay

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.889 
the whole filter like so inside okay
hold<00:01:59.770> up<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.069> then<00:02:00.520> as<00:02:00.729> you've<00:02:01.270> sprayed<00:02:01.749> it

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160 
covered so now we're going to install
our<00:03:58.040> cage<00:03:58.280> which<00:03:58.430> can<00:03:58.580> be<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> little<00:03:58.790> bit

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
our cage which can be a little bit

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.310 
our cage which can be a little bit
tricky<00:04:00.170> we<00:04:00.260> slide<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.709> up<00:04:00.830> like<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:03.230> this

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
tricky we slide it up like so to this

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.250 
tricky we slide it up like so to this
point<00:04:03.440> right<00:04:03.680> here<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:05.750> there's<00:04:06.110> anything

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
point right here if there's anything

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.600 
point right here if there's anything
that<00:04:06.380> comes<00:04:06.650> out<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:06.980> back<00:04:07.130> we<00:04:07.310> want<00:04:07.459> to<00:04:07.520> make

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
that comes out the back we want to make

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.650 
that comes out the back we want to make
sure<00:04:07.640> that<00:04:07.820> that<00:04:08.000> comes<00:04:08.239> out<00:04:08.770> nice<00:04:09.770> and<00:04:10.010> evenly

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
sure that that comes out nice and evenly

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.940 
sure that that comes out nice and evenly
so<00:04:11.660> that<00:04:11.690> will<00:04:11.900> sit<00:04:12.080> like<00:04:12.200> this<00:04:12.380> this<00:04:12.620> will<00:04:12.800> sit

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
so that will sit like this this will sit

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.990 
so that will sit like this this will sit
like<00:04:12.980> this<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:15.020> at<00:04:15.110> this<00:04:15.200> point<00:04:15.380> right<00:04:15.470> here

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
like this and at this point right here

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.099 
like this and at this point right here
this<00:04:17.000> rubber<00:04:17.329> piece<00:04:17.570> right<00:04:17.690> here<00:04:17.750> can<00:04:17.989> have

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
this rubber piece right here can have

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.069 
this rubber piece right here can have
some<00:04:18.320> oil<00:04:18.530> on<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:20.570> it's<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.690> good<00:04:20.780> idea<00:04:20.840> to

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
some oil on it so it's a good idea to

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.790 
some oil on it so it's a good idea to
put<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.230> little<00:04:21.290> contact<00:04:21.859> cleaner<00:04:22.040> on<00:04:22.220> here<00:04:23.800> get

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
put a little contact cleaner on here get

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.380 
put a little contact cleaner on here get
this<00:04:24.980> cleaned<00:04:25.340> off<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.730> oil<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.180> your

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
this cleaned off of oil so that your

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.350 
this cleaned off of oil so that your
clamp<00:04:26.660> doesn't<00:04:26.990> slip<00:04:30.669> and<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:31.850> can<00:04:31.880> reinstall

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
clamp doesn't slip and you can reinstall

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.060 
clamp doesn't slip and you can reinstall
your<00:04:32.630> clamp<00:04:36.490> right<00:04:37.490> back<00:04:37.669> onto<00:04:37.940> your<00:04:38.180> filter
