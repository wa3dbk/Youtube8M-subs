shoulder<00:02:25.110> strap<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.740> got<00:02:26.610> rid<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.210> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
shoulder strap I got rid of it because I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.910 
shoulder strap I got rid of it because I
would<00:02:28.740> carry<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.070> around<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:31.470> would<00:02:31.650> flip

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
would carry it around and it would flip

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
would carry it around and it would flip
upside<00:02:32.280> down<00:02:32.310> because<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> top<00:02:33.270> was

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
upside down because all the top was

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.550 
upside down because all the top was
heavier<00:02:33.780> than<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.990> bottom<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
heavier than the bottom because the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.330 
heavier than the bottom because the
bottom<00:02:34.860> mostly<00:02:35.790> had<00:02:35.940> like<00:02:36.180> powders<00:02:37.340> and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
bottom mostly had like powders and

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.620 
bottom mostly had like powders and
they're<00:02:39.030> not<00:02:39.150> very<00:02:39.330> heavy<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:41.630> basically

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
they're not very heavy and basically

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.620 
they're not very heavy and basically
