of that which was it wasn't getting very
many<00:03:42.150> views<00:03:42.919> but<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.040> people<00:03:44.280> who<00:03:44.310> did<00:03:44.519> watch

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
many views but the people who did watch

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.940 
many views but the people who did watch
it<00:03:44.760> were<00:03:45.209> were<00:03:45.840> big<00:03:46.109> fans<00:03:46.139> they<00:03:46.590> love<00:03:46.799> this

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
it were were big fans they love this

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.039 
it were were big fans they love this
series<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:48.650> what<00:03:49.650> made<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.510> hard<00:03:51.510> for<00:03:51.630> me<00:03:51.930> to

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
series and what made it hard for me to

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.629 
series and what made it hard for me to
continue<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.650> series<00:03:52.919> is<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:53.519> I

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
continue that series is because I

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.180 
continue that series is because I
already<00:03:53.790> knew<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.090> happened<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.780> game

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
already knew what happened in the game

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.530 
already knew what happened in the game
so<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.370> was<00:03:56.489> really<00:03:56.669> hard<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.090> me<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.450> get

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
so it was really hard for me to get

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.559 
so it was really hard for me to get
excited<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.139> play<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.470> game<00:03:58.680> when<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.970> didn't

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
excited to play the game when I didn't

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.030 
excited to play the game when I didn't
feel<00:04:00.750> like<00:04:00.780> they're<00:04:01.109> what<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.470> was<00:04:01.620> worth<00:04:01.799> it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
feel like they're what it was worth it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.680 
feel like they're what it was worth it
but<00:04:02.760> I've<00:04:02.849> never<00:04:03.030> played<00:04:03.239> final<00:04:03.660> fantasy
