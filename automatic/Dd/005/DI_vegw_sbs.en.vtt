00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.110 

I<00:05:16.330> think<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:18.020> really<00:05:18.290> important<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:19.120> note

I think it's really important to note

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.630 
I think it's really important to note
that<00:05:20.290> you<00:05:21.290> don't<00:05:21.440> have<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.620> take<00:05:22.130> yourself<00:05:22.520> too

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
that you don't have to take yourself too

that you don't have to take yourself too
seriously<00:05:22.670> to<00:05:23.240> make<00:05:23.420> serious<00:05:23.870> work<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.800> I

seriously to make serious work and I

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.500 
seriously to make serious work and I
think<00:05:25.100> that<00:05:25.220> we<00:05:25.310> take<00:05:25.520> making<00:05:25.940> work<00:05:26.090> very

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
think that we take making work very

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.400 
think that we take making work very
seriously<00:05:26.720> and<00:05:27.500> we<00:05:28.190> respect<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:28.880> class

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
seriously and we respect the class

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.880 
seriously and we respect the class
tremendous<00:05:30.410> amount<00:05:32.080> we're<00:05:33.080> able<00:05:33.170> to<00:05:33.500> joke

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
tremendous amount we're able to joke

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.610 
tremendous amount we're able to joke
around<00:05:34.040> about<00:05:34.310> ourselves<00:05:34.780> because<00:05:35.780> there's

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
around about ourselves because there's

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.740 
around about ourselves because there's
just<00:05:37.000> not<00:05:38.000> enough<00:05:38.060> days<00:05:38.510> and<00:05:39.230> your<00:05:39.410> life<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:40.580> be
