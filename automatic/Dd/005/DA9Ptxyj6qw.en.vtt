00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you can deactivate the first one by just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
you can deactivate the first one by just
activating<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> second<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.729> my<00:01:08.729> older

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
activating the second one in my older

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820 
activating the second one in my older
versions<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.450> had<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> deactivate<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.560> back

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
versions I had to deactivate the back

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.450 
versions I had to deactivate the back
portal<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:11.640> update<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.180> main<00:01:13.020> portal

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
portal and then update the main portal

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.840 
portal and then update the main portal
his<00:01:14.460> system<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.030> lot<00:01:15.270> faster<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.930> easier<00:01:16.850> so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
his system is a lot faster and easier so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.200 
his system is a lot faster and easier so
big<00:01:18.390> thanks<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.670> what<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.150> is

big thanks to you what you see here is
basically<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> wiring

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
basically just a little bit of wiring

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.850 
basically just a little bit of wiring
when<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> spins<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.869> activating<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
when the spins on here activating the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
when the spins on here activating the
back<00:01:26.100> portal<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.509> activating<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
back portal one in here activating the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
back portal one in here activating the
main<00:01:28.439> portal<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.180> third<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:30.900> which

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
main portal and third one and here which

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.569 
main portal and third one and here which
gave<00:01:31.439> debates<00:01:31.740> our<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.250> portal<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> wiring

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
gave debates our back portal the wiring

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.270 
gave debates our back portal the wiring
is<00:01:35.790> easy<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.390> could<00:01:37.350> become<00:01:37.710> more<00:01:37.950> compact

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
is easy but could become more compact

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.370 
is easy but could become more compact
I'm<00:01:39.000> sure<00:01:39.270> many<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.960> already<00:01:40.020> know

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I'm sure many of you will already know

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.359 
I'm sure many of you will already know
how<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:42.170> but<00:01:43.170> first<00:01:43.470> let's<00:01:43.680> build<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
how to do it but first let's build it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.870 
how to do it but first let's build it
and<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> better<00:01:46.110> idea<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:47.220> all

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and then you get a better idea of all

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.020 
and then you get a better idea of all
those<00:01:48.210> works<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:49.250> course<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.490> first<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.880> need<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
those works of course at first we need a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.219 
those works of course at first we need a
portal<00:01:51.740> like<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.920> example<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:54.110> this<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
portal like for example this one this is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.139 
portal like for example this one this is
going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.649> our<00:01:55.799> main<00:01:56.070> portal<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.969> one

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
going to be our main portal you one

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.800 
going to be our main portal you one
which<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.570> will<00:01:57.869> enter<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.299> then<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.450> need<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
which we will enter and then we need a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.080 
which we will enter and then we need a
second<00:02:01.350> bottle<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.740> back<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.850> deactivate

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
second bottle on the back to deactivate

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.510 
second bottle on the back to deactivate
the<00:02:03.450> first<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:04.009> for<00:02:05.009> example<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:07.520> so

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the first one for example like this so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.250 
the first one for example like this so
now<00:02:08.670> let's<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.509> dispense<00:02:10.050> us

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
now let's see if you dispense us

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:23.020 
now let's see if you dispense us
we<00:02:12.260> need<00:02:12.410> one<00:02:12.860> here<00:02:16.480> one<00:02:17.480> down<00:02:17.840> here<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:22.030> one

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
we need one here one down here and one

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:32.140 
we need one here one down here and one
on<00:02:23.120> top<00:02:23.300> here<00:02:26.860> now<00:02:27.860> sticky<00:02:28.310> piston<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:31.150> let's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
on top here now sticky piston and let's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.010 
on top here now sticky piston and let's
add<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.390> bit<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.720> wiring<00:02:33.250> um<00:02:34.450> at<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.630> point<00:02:35.870> I

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
add a bit of wiring um at this point I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.800 
add a bit of wiring um at this point I
mix<00:02:36.200> assuming<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.580> take<00:02:37.820> exactly<00:02:38.390> this

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
mix assuming you take exactly this

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.670 
mix assuming you take exactly this
design<00:02:39.080> where<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.770> put<00:02:40.450> buttons<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.750> those

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
design where I put buttons and those

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:54.910 
design where I put buttons and those
post<00:02:43.130> places<00:02:43.790> those<00:02:44.720> two<00:02:53.110> okay<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.260> hard<00:02:54.770> to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
post places those two okay it's hard to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:06.360 
post places those two okay it's hard to
build<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.220> camera<00:02:55.550> still<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:04.370> yet

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
build on camera still so here yet

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.040 
build on camera still so here yet
repeater<00:03:07.370> was<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.880> take<00:03:08.090> delay<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.630> he<00:03:08.840> won

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
repeater was a to take delay and he won

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.230 
repeater was a to take delay and he won
with<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.470> one-take<00:03:10.400> delay<00:03:12.820> this<00:03:13.820> part<00:03:14.090> will

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
with a one-take delay this part will

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:23.850 
with a one-take delay this part will
make<00:03:14.450> this<00:03:14.930> piston<00:03:15.380> pulls<00:03:16.250> for<00:03:16.520> short<00:03:16.760> moment

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.810 

and<00:03:24.860> we<00:03:25.160> add<00:03:26.440> repeater<00:03:27.440> will<00:03:27.739> retake<00:03:28.459> delay<00:03:28.760> in

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
and we add repeater will retake delay in

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.640 
and we add repeater will retake delay in
here<00:03:29.860> this<00:03:30.860> will<00:03:31.040> activate<00:03:32.110> using<00:03:33.110> written

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
here this will activate using written

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.680 
here this will activate using written
update<00:03:33.950> this<00:03:34.480> depends<00:03:35.480> on<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> back<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:38.570> its

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
update this depends on the back so its

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.560 
update this depends on the back so its
power<00:03:38.870> now<00:03:39.080> every<00:03:39.709> time<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.310> button<00:03:40.670> but

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
power now every time this button but

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.509 
power now every time this button but
every<00:03:41.720> time<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.080> redstone<00:03:42.640> cable<00:03:43.640> updates

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
every time this redstone cable updates

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.979 
every time this redstone cable updates
it<00:03:46.519> will<00:03:46.670> activate<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.180> suspender<00:03:47.660> that

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
it will activate the suspender that

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.410 
it will activate the suspender that
where<00:03:48.170> we<00:03:48.320> can<00:03:51.519> spill<00:03:52.519> out<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.880> suck<00:03:53.060> in<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
where we can spill out and suck in the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.960 
where we can spill out and suck in the
lava<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.019> here<00:03:54.860> we<00:03:54.890> add<00:03:55.100> fire<00:03:55.880> charges<00:03:57.970> here

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
lava and here we add fire charges here

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.400 
lava and here we add fire charges here
true<00:03:59.150> and<00:04:00.070> that's<00:04:01.070> pretty<00:04:01.250> much<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:06.200> now

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
true and that's pretty much it so now

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.120 
true and that's pretty much it so now
let's<00:04:06.620> add<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:07.420> design

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
let's add a design

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.280 
let's add a design
I<00:04:11.800> like<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.130> way<00:04:13.340> because<00:04:14.290> the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
I like it this way because the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.090 
I like it this way because the
background<00:04:15.710> gets<00:04:16.030> small<00:04:17.030> pattern<00:04:18.100> should

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
background gets small pattern should

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.650 
background gets small pattern should
still<00:04:19.370> work<00:04:21.370> as<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.520> can<00:04:22.640> see<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:22.940> that's

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
still work as you can see and that's

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.370 
still work as you can see and that's
pretty<00:04:23.870> much<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:25.000> said<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.120> can<00:04:26.300> change<00:04:27.290> a

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
pretty much it I said you can change a

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.980 
pretty much it I said you can change a
lot<00:04:27.500> in<00:04:27.560> here<00:04:27.950> make<00:04:28.580> more<00:04:29.030> compact<00:04:29.270> wiring<00:04:29.720> I'm

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
lot in here make more compact wiring I'm

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.340 
lot in here make more compact wiring I'm
pretty<00:04:30.260> sure<00:04:30.440> you<00:04:30.590> will<00:04:30.740> able<00:04:30.890> to<00:04:31.100> do<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:32.350> yeah

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
pretty sure you will able to do it yeah

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.740 
pretty sure you will able to do it yeah
that's<00:04:34.480> this<00:04:35.480> part<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:37.060> if<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.270> like<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.630> make

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
that's this part and if you like to make

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.050 
that's this part and if you like to make
it<00:04:38.960> really<00:04:39.350> fancy<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.040> could<00:04:40.250> do<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:40.910> like

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
it really fancy you could do it like

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.870 
it really fancy you could do it like
this<00:04:41.290> let<00:04:42.290> paintings<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:42.860> front<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.610> block

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
this let paintings in front of the block

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.720 
this let paintings in front of the block
behinds<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.740> strip<00:04:46.010> wire<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.400> activate

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
behinds and you strip wire to activate

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:55.180 
behinds and you strip wire to activate
everything<00:04:51.940> works<00:04:52.940> pretty<00:04:53.120> good<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:54.260> like

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
everything works pretty good and I like

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.690 
everything works pretty good and I like
the<00:04:55.220> way<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.550> looks<00:04:57.220> that's<00:04:58.220> all<00:04:58.340> for<00:04:58.370> today

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
the way it looks that's all for today

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.120 
the way it looks that's all for today
thanks<00:04:59.570> for<00:04:59.600> watching<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.200> see<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:00.980> next
