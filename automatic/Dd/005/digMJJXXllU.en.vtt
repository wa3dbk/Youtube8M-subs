00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
ump45 ultimately comes down to play

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.080 
ump45 ultimately comes down to play
style<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.530> where<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.010> intend<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.490> use<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.730> if
