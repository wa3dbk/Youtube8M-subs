00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.770
 shearwaters gannets terns algae 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.300
 guillemots puffs all of them 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 they go through here on long trips 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 from their breeding grounds to those of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.289
 wintering but also this point counts 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.719
 with a hundred breeding pairs 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.270
 of shag and with a small 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.550
 Cinderella shearwater colony the only 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.040
 known in the Spanish Atlantic without 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.900
 count the canaries 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 sometimes they come for example from the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.550
 Malvinas Islands in Argentina birds that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 come from canada birds that come from 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.960
 siberia but very east of siberia and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.230
 birds that come from many points of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.810
 europe is the future tipped marine strain 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.270
 from candelaria ría de ortigueira stake 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.440
 of bars the northernmost point of 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.809
 the Iberian Peninsula 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.030
 we are in the cape of bars stake the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.280
 northernmost point of Spain 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.940
 very important migratory corridor maybe 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.860
 the best step of seabirds in europe 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.080
 this space is part of the list of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.119
 the 39 marine strains that the state has 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.070
 proposed to the European Commission and that 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.259
 will convert Spain into the country that 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.110
 marine surface contributes to the natural network 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.150
 2000 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.730
 will be a total of 50 thousand kilometers 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.650
 Protected squares of sea surface 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.600
 in that in the natura 2000 network 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.550
 will have greater guarantee of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.810
 good conservation is a level of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.400
 very interesting protection as of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 any strain not the fact that 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.070
 recognize the value of this broker 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.050
 migratory because it already protects 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 level , for example, to avoid the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.250
 potential placement of wind turbines 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.260
 in the sea there have been some projects of 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 sense in different points of galicia 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.910
 this is an example and it also supposes a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.440
 added value to artisanal fisheries that 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.040
 is typical here in the area and for 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.500
 brotherhood of 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.650
 from the area that has a job here 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.100
 exemplary in the sense of treatment 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.050
 sustainable use of the resources of the sea 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.580
 because as this expert explains the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.070
 people in the area are very aware 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.290
 of the passage of seabirds with those that have 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.570
 always lived and they value that their 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.310
 statement as strain will contribute to 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.740
 have a seal of quality in their 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.750
 resources an important part of the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.030
 population of Ortigueira and viveiro sus 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.630
 main localities is dedicated to the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.820
 fishing and shellfishing 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.070
 Despite the harshness of its climate this 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.080
 imminent marine strain constitutes a 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.050
 show for ornithologists and 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.970
 birding fans 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.020
 expose on the map the interest of this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.510
 zone from the point of view 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.010
 ornithological for the enjoyment of the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.530
 observation of these bird rivers because 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.570
 is more and more the amount of two 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.430
 mythologists both Spanish and the 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.140
 foreigner who come here in the autumn to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.440
 enjoy it and spend every season 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.240
 longer the protected area covers up 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.790
 13 kilometers offshore 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.680
 stands out from bars on its coastal edge it 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.900
 extends from Cape Ortegal to 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.580
 sanciprián the place where the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.720
 waters of the Atlantic and those of the sea 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.880
 Cantabrian 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.130
 for antonio sandoval author of the book 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.780
 what are the birds for the peculiarity 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.510
 of this area and its extraordinary value 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.960
 as a migratory step, it is due to its own 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.960
 profile 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.370
 and this makes this out in a 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.340
 sort of like narrowness of a clock 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.650
 sand and dozens are concentrated here 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.200
 hundreds of thousands of seabirds in 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.420
 those times sandoval recognizes the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.000
 vulnerability of an exposed space 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.860
 like all galicia to the passage of oil tankers 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.940
 here we have in all galicia in all 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.470
 the also marine strains of galicia that 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.210
 that crossroads of birds and of 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.230
 tankers and good the story that 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.530
 we have in that sense is 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.690
 unfortunately long and sad for 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.820
 that for this ornithologist that leads from 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.400
 late 90s working in the area 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.210
 its recognition as a strain is only a 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.430
 He passed 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.170
 now it is necessary to conserve it and it is up to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.210
 administrations establish the 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.670
 measures and support for the local population 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.260
 to avoid any threat and serve 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.260
 of model to the rest of Europe
