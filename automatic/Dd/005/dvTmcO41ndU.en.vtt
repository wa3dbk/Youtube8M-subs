00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:25.080

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.009
 fifty five millimeters 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.979

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:38.570

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:42.270
 pulled so here the twine as 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.070
 the film falls there and can 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.600
