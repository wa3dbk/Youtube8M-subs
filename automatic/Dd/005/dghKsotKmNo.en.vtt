reader comm for this comparison review

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.869 
reader comm for this comparison review
I've<00:00:03.570> got<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.899> Kobo<00:00:04.319> Glo<00:00:04.410> HD<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.580> Kobo

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
I've got the Kobo Glo HD and the Kobo

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.660 
I've got the Kobo Glo HD and the Kobo
aura<00:00:06.060> h2o<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.859> talk<00:00:08.069> about<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
aura h2o so I'm going to talk about the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.209 
aura h2o so I'm going to talk about the
differences<00:00:09.179> between<00:00:09.240> these<00:00:09.630> two<00:00:09.809> devices

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
differences between these two devices

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.499 
differences between these two devices
first<00:00:11.219> let's<00:00:11.490> talk<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.150> obvious

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
first let's talk about the obvious

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.669 
first let's talk about the obvious
difference<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> size<00:00:13.170> difference<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
difference the size difference the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.230 
difference the size difference the
screen<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.099> quite<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.280> bit<00:00:14.460> larger<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
screen is quite a bit larger here on the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.870 
screen is quite a bit larger here on the
aura<00:00:15.420> h2o<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.800> got<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> six<00:00:17.250> point<00:00:17.490> eight<00:00:17.670> inch

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
aura h2o it's got a six point eight inch

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.750 
aura h2o it's got a six point eight inch
inch<00:00:18.119> screen<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.650> HD<00:00:20.039> has<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> six<00:00:20.580> inch

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
inch screen and the HD has a six inch

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.099 
inch screen and the HD has a six inch
screen<00:00:21.060> which<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> lot<00:00:21.480> more<00:00:21.600> common<00:00:21.840> so

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
screen which is a lot more common so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.929 
screen which is a lot more common so
obviously<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.010> get<00:00:23.160> quite<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> few<00:00:23.699> more

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
obviously you can get quite a few more

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.750 
obviously you can get quite a few more
lines<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.750> larger<00:00:25.170> screen<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:26.460> reading

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
lines on the larger screen for reading

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.429 
lines on the larger screen for reading
so<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.420> don't<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.689> turn<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> pages<00:00:28.199> as

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
so you don't have to turn the pages as

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
so you don't have to turn the pages as
much<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.670> as<00:00:29.910> far<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> design<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
much so as far as like the design the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.280 
much so as far as like the design the
Glo<00:00:31.410> HD<00:00:31.769> or<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.309> aura<00:00:32.700> h2o<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.050> sort

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
Glo HD or the aura h2o here it has sort

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.799 
Glo HD or the aura h2o here it has sort
of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> soft<00:00:34.680> textured<00:00:35.280> rubbery<00:00:36.149> feel<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
of a soft textured rubbery feel to it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.590 
of a soft textured rubbery feel to it
and<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.230> course<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.620> waterproof<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.450> it<00:00:39.450> can

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and of course it's waterproof so it can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360 
and of course it's waterproof so it can
be<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.350> metre<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.680> water<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.219> half

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
be in up to one metre of water for half

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.360 
be in up to one metre of water for half
an<00:00:41.489> hour<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.540> also<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.170> flap<00:00:44.160> right

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
an hour it's also got this flap right

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.590 
an hour it's also got this flap right
here<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.610> opens<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.969> there's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> micro<00:00:45.390> SD

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
here that opens up there's a micro SD

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.950 
here that opens up there's a micro SD
card<00:00:45.809> under<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.670> Glo<00:00:47.850> HD<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.750> does

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
card under there and the Glo HD it does

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.410 
card under there and the Glo HD it does
not<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> micro<00:00:49.649> SD<00:00:49.860> card<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:51.090> does<00:00:51.300> not

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
not have a micro SD card so it does not

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.959 
not have a micro SD card so it does not
have<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> expansion<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.469> has<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.610> harder

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
have the expansion but has this harder

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
have the expansion but has this harder
plastic<00:00:54.449> material<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> does<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.410> show

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
plastic material here it does not show

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.340 
plastic material here it does not show
fingerprints<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> h2o<00:00:57.329> does<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.260> then

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
fingerprints like the h2o does and then

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.959 
fingerprints like the h2o does and then
on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> back<00:00:58.710> guys<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> sort<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> texture<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
on the back guys is sort of a texture to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.529 
on the back guys is sort of a texture to
it<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.270> does<00:01:00.390> show<00:01:00.870> some<00:01:01.020> marks<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it that does show some marks but the the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.340 
it that does show some marks but the the
width<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.439> device<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> about<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.309> same

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
width of these device is about the same

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.780 
width of these device is about the same
the<00:01:07.350> weight<00:01:07.619> obviously<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the weight obviously it's more with the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.490 
the weight obviously it's more with the
larger<00:01:09.060> device<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:09.630> 50<00:01:09.930> grams<00:01:10.110> more

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
larger device that's about 50 grams more

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679 
larger device that's about 50 grams more
so<00:01:11.159> though<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> 6<00:01:11.820> inch<00:01:12.000> screen<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.479> does

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
so though the 6 inch screen here does

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.719 
so though the 6 inch screen here does
have<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> slightly<00:01:13.229> higher<00:01:13.380> resolution<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
have a slightly higher resolution and I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
have a slightly higher resolution and I
did<00:01:14.909> post<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.479> 1080p<00:01:16.439> video<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> other<00:01:17.189> day<00:01:17.310> so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
did post a 1080p video the other day so

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.100 
did post a 1080p video the other day so
if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.270> devices<00:01:18.810> up

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
if you want to see these two devices up

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
if you want to see these two devices up
close<00:01:19.939> with<00:01:20.939> high<00:01:21.150> resolution<00:01:21.330> check<00:01:22.049> out

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
close with high resolution check out

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.320 
close with high resolution check out
that<00:01:22.350> video<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> most<00:01:23.549> part<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that video but for the most part the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
that video but for the most part the
screen<00:01:24.630> really<00:01:24.810> looks<00:01:25.080> basically<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.680> same

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
screen really looks basically the same

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.999 
screen really looks basically the same
to<00:01:26.130> me<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.450> 265<00:01:28.049> pixels<00:01:28.590> per<00:01:28.740> inch<00:01:28.799> on

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to me so it's got 265 pixels per inch on

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
to me so it's got 265 pixels per inch on
the<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.340> h2o<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> glow<00:01:30.900> FDS<00:01:31.259> 300<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.829> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the or h2o and the glow FDS 300 so I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.289 
the or h2o and the glow FDS 300 so I
mean<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.310> close<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.060> can't

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
mean it's so close that you really can't

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.420 
mean it's so close that you really can't
tell<00:01:33.509> much<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> difference<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
tell much of a difference at all so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
tell much of a difference at all so
we're<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> big<00:01:36.479> difference<00:01:36.900> lies<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
we're the big difference lies with the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.620 
we're the big difference lies with the
screens<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.579> these<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:38.850> guys<00:01:39.030> aside<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
screens on these two guys aside from the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
screens on these two guys aside from the
size<00:01:39.930> difference<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.350> course<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> front

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
size difference of course is the front

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.639 
size difference of course is the front
lights<00:01:41.759> okay<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.840> tone<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.259> quite<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> bit

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
lights okay so the tone is quite a bit

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.020 
lights okay so the tone is quite a bit
different<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> front<00:01:44.490> lights<00:01:44.670> between

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
different on the front lights between

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.219 
different on the front lights between
these<00:01:45.149> two<00:01:45.270> e-readers<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:45.990> how<00:01:46.079> well

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
these two e-readers don't know how well

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.270 
these two e-readers don't know how well
it's<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> show<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> camera<00:01:47.130> here

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it's going to show up on the camera here

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
it's going to show up on the camera here
but<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> aura<00:01:48.060> HT<00:01:48.479> OS<00:01:48.659> front<00:01:48.899> life<00:01:49.020> quite<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
but the aura HT OS front life quite a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.280 
but the aura HT OS front life quite a
bit<00:01:49.439> yellower<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.979> tone<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.299> HD<00:01:51.899> has<00:01:52.049> more

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
bit yellower and tone in the HD has more

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.410 
bit yellower and tone in the HD has more
of<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> whitish<00:01:52.920> sort<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.280> maybe<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.759> subtle

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of a whitish sort of maybe a subtle

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.080 
of a whitish sort of maybe a subtle
bluish<00:01:54.840> tint<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> there's<00:01:56.700> quite<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.969> bit

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
bluish tint to it so there's quite a bit

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.310 
bluish tint to it so there's quite a bit
of<00:01:57.119> difference<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.960> got<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
of difference here but you got to just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.480 
of difference here but you got to just
take<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> grain<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.040> salt<00:01:59.159> because

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
take this with a grain of salt because

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.569 
take this with a grain of salt because
these<00:02:00.360> ear<00:02:01.140> eaters<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.590> vary<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:02.100> when<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
these ear eaters they vary a lot when it

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
these ear eaters they vary a lot when it
comes<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.090> front<00:02:03.450> lights<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> can't

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
comes to front lights so you can't

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.319 
comes to front lights so you can't
really<00:02:04.380> take<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.890> being<00:02:05.130> how<00:02:05.850> every<00:02:06.180> one

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
really take this as being how every one

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270 
really take this as being how every one
of<00:02:06.360> them<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.570> gonna<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.259> far<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.500> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
of them is gonna be but as far as the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.669 
of them is gonna be but as far as the
light<00:02:08.910> settings<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.989> mean<00:02:10.170> they're<00:02:10.319> obviously

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
light settings I mean they're obviously

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.740 
light settings I mean they're obviously
offer

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
offer

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.220 
offer
same<00:02:11.930> similar<00:02:12.350> kind<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:13.870> brightness<00:02:14.870> settings

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
same similar kind of brightness settings

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.480 
same similar kind of brightness settings
throughout<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.620> whole<00:02:15.770> scale<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.280> had<00:02:16.430> him

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
throughout the whole scale so I had him

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.850 
throughout the whole scale so I had him
at<00:02:16.610> 100%<00:02:17.030> there<00:02:17.510> let's<00:02:18.170> take<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.470> down<00:02:18.620> to

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
at 100% there let's take it down to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.400 
at 100% there let's take it down to
about<00:02:18.950> 50%<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.940> both<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.300> them<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.780> camera

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
about 50% on both of them here I camera

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.900 
about 50% on both of them here I camera
adjust<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.280> kind<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.550> hard<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.850> a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
adjust so it's kind of hard to get a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.870 
adjust so it's kind of hard to get a
real<00:02:23.210> accurate<00:02:23.860> look<00:02:24.860> at<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.160> front<00:02:25.400> light<00:02:25.580> so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
real accurate look at the front light so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.150 
real accurate look at the front light so
but<00:02:26.240> I'll<00:02:27.230> give<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.650> go<00:02:27.770> ahead<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.040> keep

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
but I'll give a that go ahead and keep

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.160 
but I'll give a that go ahead and keep
adjusting<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.850> some<00:02:29.030> lower<00:02:29.630> settings<00:02:30.020> here

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
adjusting to some lower settings here

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.510 
adjusting to some lower settings here
you<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.320> kind<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.560> see<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:30.890> they<00:02:31.010> go<00:02:31.130> really

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
you can kind of see so they go really

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.250 
you can kind of see so they go really
really<00:02:31.640> dim<00:02:32.030> if<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.690> want<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.930> read<00:02:33.050> at<00:02:33.230> night

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
really dim if you want to read at night

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.380 
really dim if you want to read at night
you<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.830> get<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.100> set<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.790> low<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.240> it

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
you can get it set so low that it

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.640 
you can get it set so low that it
doesn't<00:02:35.660> bother<00:02:35.750> your<00:02:36.020> eyes<00:02:36.170> even<00:02:36.470> in

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
doesn't bother your eyes even in

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.170 
doesn't bother your eyes even in
complete<00:02:36.830> darkness<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.520> they<00:02:37.550> do<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:38.000> good

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
complete darkness so they do have a good

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.510 
complete darkness so they do have a good
really<00:02:39.020> nice<00:02:39.170> full<00:02:39.650> range<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:40.190> brightness

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
really nice full range of brightness

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.070 
really nice full range of brightness
settings<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:41.390> lights<00:02:41.600> can<00:02:41.780> be<00:02:41.810> turned

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
settings and that lights can be turned

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.260 
settings and that lights can be turned
completely<00:02:42.590> off<00:02:42.740> as<00:02:43.010> well<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.790> both<00:02:43.970> of<00:02:44.000> these

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
completely off as well and both of these

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.780 
completely off as well and both of these
devices<00:02:44.630> have<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.020> quick<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.590> little<00:02:46.040> thing

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
devices have a quick a little thing

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.100 
devices have a quick a little thing
where<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.030> can<00:02:47.180> just<00:02:47.209> swipe<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.020> down

where you can just swipe up and down

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.750 
where you can just swipe up and down
screen<00:02:48.560> right<00:02:48.739> here<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.010> adjust<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.550> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
screen right here to adjust the the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.600 
screen right here to adjust the the
front<00:02:50.330> light<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> fly's<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.320> help<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:52.489> it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
front light on the fly's to help get it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.310 
front light on the fly's to help get it
without<00:02:53.090> having<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.510> go<00:02:53.570> into<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:53.750> menu<00:02:53.900> and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
without having to go into that menu and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.570 
without having to go into that menu and
it's<00:02:54.530> really<00:02:54.709> nice<00:02:54.860> because<00:02:55.010> into<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.459> way

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
it's really nice because into that way

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.010 
it's really nice because into that way
you<00:02:55.640> can<00:02:55.820> really<00:02:55.940> fine-tune<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.780> get<00:02:56.900> the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
you can really fine-tune it to get the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.740 
you can really fine-tune it to get the
exact<00:02:57.350> brightness<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.070> want<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:02.060> both

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
exact brightness that you want so both

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.949 
exact brightness that you want so both
front<00:03:03.080> lights<00:03:03.260> are<00:03:03.470> really<00:03:03.800> quite<00:03:04.130> evenly

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
front lights are really quite evenly

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.120 
front lights are really quite evenly
distributed<00:03:05.959> there's<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.709> little<00:03:06.950> bit<00:03:07.040> of

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
distributed there's just a little bit of

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.490 
distributed there's just a little bit of
subtle<00:03:07.400> shadow<00:03:07.700> ease<00:03:07.910> areas<00:03:08.840> down<00:03:09.110> here<00:03:09.140> I

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
subtle shadow ease areas down here I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.420 
subtle shadow ease areas down here I
don't<00:03:09.590> know<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:09.890> it's<00:03:09.980> gonna<00:03:10.130> show<00:03:10.280> up<00:03:10.340> on

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
don't know that it's gonna show up on

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.850 
don't know that it's gonna show up on
camera<00:03:10.760> on<00:03:11.120> both<00:03:11.540> devices<00:03:11.720> but<00:03:12.350> I'd<00:03:12.560> say<00:03:12.830> I

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
camera on both devices but I'd say I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.140 
camera on both devices but I'd say I
mean<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.130> front<00:03:13.370> lights<00:03:13.610> it's<00:03:13.820> pretty<00:03:14.030> much

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
mean the front lights it's pretty much

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.310 
mean the front lights it's pretty much
exactly<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.600> same<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.870> all<00:03:14.959> these<00:03:15.080> devices

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
exactly the same of all these devices

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.620 
exactly the same of all these devices
it's<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:16.010> slightly<00:03:16.610> different<00:03:16.760> tone<00:03:17.269> on

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
it's just a slightly different tone on

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.720 
it's just a slightly different tone on
the<00:03:17.840> or<00:03:18.019> h2o<00:03:18.560> there<00:03:18.950> with<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.310> slightly

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
the or h2o there with the slightly

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.640 
the or h2o there with the slightly
o-o-or<00:03:20.209> feel<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.110> figured<00:03:21.440> some

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
o-o-or feel to it so I figured some

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.140 
o-o-or feel to it so I figured some
people<00:03:21.920> probably<00:03:22.130> want<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.489> know<00:03:22.580> about<00:03:22.700> PDFs

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
people probably want to know about PDFs

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.140 
people probably want to know about PDFs
and<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.630> thing<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:24.019> 0.8<00:03:24.709> MNH<00:03:25.310> isn't<00:03:25.790> enough<00:03:26.000> to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
and the thing is 0.8 MNH isn't enough to

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.580 
and the thing is 0.8 MNH isn't enough to
really<00:03:26.299> make<00:03:26.390> any<00:03:26.690> significant<00:03:27.290> difference

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
really make any significant difference

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.800 
really make any significant difference
whatsoever<00:03:27.830> so<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.220> mean<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.910> glow<00:03:29.150> or<00:03:29.690> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
whatsoever so I mean the glow or the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.110 
whatsoever so I mean the glow or the
aura<00:03:30.110> show<00:03:30.500> isn't<00:03:30.709> gonna<00:03:30.890> be<00:03:31.040> any<00:03:31.190> better<00:03:31.310> for

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
aura show isn't gonna be any better for

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.870 
aura show isn't gonna be any better for
PDFs<00:03:32.540> then<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.560> glow<00:03:33.769> HD<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.549> mean<00:03:34.700> you're

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
PDFs then the glow HD is I mean you're

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.150 
PDFs then the glow HD is I mean you're
only<00:03:35.000> talking<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.750> fraction<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.860> an<00:03:36.950> inch

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
only talking about a fraction of an inch

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.100 
only talking about a fraction of an inch
here<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.640> it's<00:03:37.910> not<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:38.480> really<00:03:38.690> making

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
here so it's not like it's really making

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.860 
here so it's not like it's really making
much<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.470> difference<00:03:39.769> as<00:03:39.890> far<00:03:40.100> as<00:03:40.190> making

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
much of a difference as far as making

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.180 
much of a difference as far as making
readability<00:03:41.870> any<00:03:42.170> better<00:03:42.410> it's<00:03:42.620> just<00:03:42.829> very

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
readability any better it's just very

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.600 
readability any better it's just very
ever<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:43.910> slightly<00:03:44.920> larger<00:03:45.920> than<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.370> on

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
ever so slightly larger than it is on

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.140 
ever so slightly larger than it is on
the<00:03:46.850> Glo<00:03:47.030> HD<00:03:47.450> but<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.959> mean<00:03:48.110> both<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.290> them<00:03:48.620> are

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
the Glo HD but I mean both of them are

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.729 
the Glo HD but I mean both of them are
just<00:03:50.150> as<00:03:50.329> clear<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.690> read<00:03:51.049> as<00:03:51.320> far<00:03:51.530> as<00:03:51.620> that

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
just as clear to read as far as that

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:52.990 
just as clear to read as far as that
goes<00:03:51.799> so<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.220> mean<00:03:52.459> you're<00:03:52.579> really<00:03:52.730> not<00:03:52.850> getting

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
goes so I mean you're really not getting

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.490 
goes so I mean you're really not getting
any<00:03:53.239> advantage<00:03:53.630> with<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.930> slightly<00:03:54.290> larger

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
any advantage with the slightly larger

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.900 
any advantage with the slightly larger
screen<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.070> when<00:03:55.190> it<00:03:55.280> comes<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.579> software

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
screen so when it comes to software

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.550 
screen so when it comes to software
features<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.600> mean<00:03:56.780> these<00:03:56.900> guys<00:03:57.079> they<00:03:57.320> have<00:03:57.440> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
features I mean these guys they have the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.110 
features I mean these guys they have the
exact<00:03:57.920> same<00:03:58.100> software<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.760> I'm<00:03:58.850> not<00:03:58.970> gonna

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
exact same software so I'm not gonna

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.699 
exact same software so I'm not gonna
really<00:03:59.269> go<00:03:59.480> into<00:03:59.720> any<00:03:59.900> details<00:04:00.290> here<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.590> can

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
really go into any details here you can

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.259 
really go into any details here you can
check<00:04:00.890> out<00:04:01.040> their<00:04:01.160> individual<00:04:01.610> reviews<00:04:02.000> for<00:04:02.239> a

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
check out their individual reviews for a

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.210 
check out their individual reviews for a
rundown<00:04:02.480> on<00:04:02.810> all<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.410> features<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.920> basic

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
rundown on all the features the basic

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.650 
rundown on all the features the basic
thing<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.730> mean<00:04:05.150> they<00:04:05.239> run<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> same

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
thing is I mean they run the same

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.240 
thing is I mean they run the same
software<00:04:06.049> they<00:04:06.290> run<00:04:06.440> meant<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.709> operate<00:04:07.100> at

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
software they run meant to operate at

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.380 
software they run meant to operate at
the<00:04:07.340> same<00:04:07.549> speed<00:04:07.940> they're<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.239> same

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
the same speed they're the same

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.569 
the same speed they're the same
processor<00:04:09.110> so<00:04:09.680> all<00:04:09.860> this<00:04:10.040> stuff<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.370> basically

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
processor so all this stuff is basically

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.069 
processor so all this stuff is basically
the<00:04:10.850> same<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.269> just<00:04:11.299> like<00:04:11.630> these<00:04:11.780> subtle

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
the same it's just like these subtle

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.840 
the same it's just like these subtle
Hardware<00:04:12.320> differences<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.950> larger<00:04:13.250> screen<00:04:13.640> I

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
Hardware differences the larger screen I

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.479 
Hardware differences the larger screen I
mean<00:04:14.660> mostly<00:04:14.930> all<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.500> software's<00:04:15.950> exactly

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
mean mostly all the software's exactly

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.800 
mean mostly all the software's exactly
the<00:04:16.609> same<00:04:16.820> text<00:04:17.150> frames<00:04:17.359> are<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:17.510> same

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
the same text frames are the same

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.509 
the same text frames are the same
there's<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.739> couple<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.160> subtle

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
there's just a couple of subtle

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.039 
there's just a couple of subtle
differences<00:04:19.729> with<00:04:20.330> this<00:04:20.539> particular

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
differences with this particular

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.260 
differences with this particular
firmware<00:04:21.530> version<00:04:22.010> these<00:04:22.490> devices<00:04:23.000> are<00:04:23.120> both

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
firmware version these devices are both

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.780 
firmware version these devices are both
running<00:04:23.690> three<00:04:23.960> point

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
running three point

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.330 
running three point
fifteen<00:04:25.140> or<00:04:26.140> just<00:04:26.470> like<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.680> couple<00:04:27.100> of<00:04:27.160> weird

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
fifteen or just like a couple of weird

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.730 
fifteen or just like a couple of weird
things<00:04:27.580> like<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.540> beta<00:04:28.750> in<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.260> beta<00:04:29.440> list

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
things like in the beta in the beta list

only has the web browser whereas the or
HD<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:36.010> all<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.370> older<00:04:36.580> stuff<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:36.970> used<00:04:37.090> to

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
HD is all the older stuff that used to

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.600 
HD is all the older stuff that used to
have<00:04:37.530> except<00:04:38.530> for<00:04:38.800> they<00:04:39.070> got<00:04:39.190> rid<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.340> chest

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
have except for they got rid of chest

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.740 
have except for they got rid of chest
for<00:04:39.790> some<00:04:39.940> reason<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.480> still<00:04:40.630> has<00:04:40.720> a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
for some reason but this still has a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.690 
for some reason but this still has a
sketchpad<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.440> has<00:04:41.770> a<00:04:41.800> couple<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.160> games<00:04:42.460> on

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
sketchpad and has a couple of games on

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.490 
sketchpad and has a couple of games on
here<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.630> is<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:43.960> like<00:04:44.110> one<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.350> the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
here so that is just like one of the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.460 
here so that is just like one of the
subtle<00:04:44.860> differences<00:04:45.660> with<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.810> software<00:04:47.200> but

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
subtle differences with the software but

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.840 
subtle differences with the software but
I<00:04:47.500> wouldn't<00:04:47.800> count<00:04:47.980> on<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.190> staying<00:04:48.640> that

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
I wouldn't count on that staying that

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.370 
I wouldn't count on that staying that
way<00:04:48.910> code<00:04:49.570> was<00:04:49.690> always<00:04:49.930> updating<00:04:50.290> their

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
way code was always updating their

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.190 
way code was always updating their
software<00:04:50.710> one<00:04:51.550> other<00:04:51.730> minor<00:04:52.420> difference<00:04:53.020> in

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
software one other minor difference in

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.880 
software one other minor difference in
the<00:04:53.260> reading<00:04:53.530> settings<00:04:53.950> menu<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:56.140> glow<00:04:56.380> HD

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
the reading settings menu the glow HD

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.080 
the reading settings menu the glow HD
has<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.510> option<00:04:58.510> for<00:04:58.810> doing<00:04:59.550> pinch<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.790> adjust

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
has a option for doing pinch to adjust

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.000 
has a option for doing pinch to adjust
font<00:05:01.240> size<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.140> have<00:05:02.290> it<00:05:02.380> enabled<00:05:02.770> but<00:05:02.920> it

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
font size and I have it enabled but it

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.230 
font size and I have it enabled but it
doesn't<00:05:03.220> work<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.610> guess<00:05:03.820> it's<00:05:04.000> just<00:05:04.030> like<00:05:04.150> a

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
doesn't work so I guess it's just like a

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.340 
doesn't work so I guess it's just like a
new<00:05:04.420> feature<00:05:04.600> they're<00:05:04.810> working<00:05:05.020> on<00:05:05.110> that

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
new feature they're working on that

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.800 
new feature they're working on that
features<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.400> even<00:05:06.580> over<00:05:06.790> here<00:05:06.970> but<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.570> has

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
features and even over here but it has

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.230 
features and even over here but it has
the<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.680> water<00:05:09.040> detection<00:05:09.490> droplet<00:05:09.850> because

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
the the water detection droplet because

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.690 
the the water detection droplet because
of<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:11.040> waterproof<00:05:12.040> feats<00:05:12.280> are<00:05:12.400> here<00:05:12.520> so

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
of the waterproof feats are here so

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.860 
of the waterproof feats are here so
they're<00:05:12.820> just<00:05:12.970> like<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> couple<00:05:13.240> subtle

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
they're just like a couple subtle

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.150 
they're just like a couple subtle
different<00:05:14.200> things<00:05:14.350> they're<00:05:14.530> in<00:05:14.650> settings<00:05:14.980> but

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
different things they're in settings but

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.860 
different things they're in settings but
I<00:05:15.190> mean<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.460> got<00:05:15.610> all<00:05:15.760> the<00:05:15.850> same<00:05:16.060> exact

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
I mean you got all the same exact

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.210 
I mean you got all the same exact
reading<00:05:17.230> features<00:05:17.440> between<00:05:17.980> these<00:05:18.100> two

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
reading features between these two

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.530 
reading features between these two
devices<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:18.790> I'm<00:05:18.880> not<00:05:19.000> going<00:05:19.180> to<00:05:19.240> go<00:05:19.330> into
