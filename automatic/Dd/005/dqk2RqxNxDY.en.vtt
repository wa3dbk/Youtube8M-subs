00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that I hit right there right there

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560

bounced<00:01:28.590> off<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> floor<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.390> picked<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> up

busted often was ready to go so I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.580

I'm making comments on was the enclosure

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.020 
I'm making comments on was the enclosure
on<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> back<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.810> now<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:52.170> reviewed<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
on the back here now I reviewed the the

on the back here now I reviewed the the
IV<00:01:54.329> scans<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.960> love<00:01:55.140> t2<00:01:55.439> which<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.610> point<00:01:56.909> in

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
IV scans I love t2 which at one point in

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
IV scans I love t2 which at one point in
time<00:01:57.180> was<00:01:57.540> exactly<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> same<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.740> cases

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
time was exactly the same as that cases

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.490 
time was exactly the same as that cases
this<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.939> from<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.110> understand

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this one I think from what I understand

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.929 
this one I think from what I understand
i<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> manufacturer<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.610> would

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
i think the manufacturer that would

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
i think the manufacturer that would
create<00:02:03.240> building<00:02:03.750> putting<00:02:04.110> together<00:02:04.229> these

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
create building putting together these

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.810 
create building putting together these
cases<00:02:04.829> was<00:02:04.979> also<00:02:05.250> doing<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> same<00:02:05.640> thing

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
cases was also doing the same thing

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
cases was also doing the same thing
friday<00:02:06.030> skin<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.079> basically<00:02:07.350> had

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
friday skin so they basically had

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.029 
friday skin so they basically had
identical<00:02:08.520> cases<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:10.349> big<00:02:10.530> issue<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> had

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
identical cases and the big issue I had

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.650 
identical cases and the big issue I had
with<00:02:11.069> ideas

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
with ideas

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.180 
with ideas
case<00:02:11.780> was<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.620> push<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> little<00:02:13.010> bit

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
case was that you just push a little bit

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.680 
case was that you just push a little bit
of<00:02:13.280> pressure<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.820> back<00:02:14.000> slit<00:02:14.300> right<00:02:14.480> off

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
of pressure and the back slit right off

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.260 
of pressure and the back slit right off
so<00:02:15.530> with<00:02:15.830> made<00:02:16.070> me<00:02:16.160> kinda<00:02:16.370> nervous<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:17.030> just

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
so with made me kinda nervous but I just

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.270 
so with made me kinda nervous but I just
possibly<00:02:17.690> drop<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.140> if<00:02:18.470> you're<00:02:18.710> talking<00:02:19.040> on

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
possibly drop it if you're talking on

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.040 
possibly drop it if you're talking on
the<00:02:19.370> phone<00:02:19.550> or<00:02:19.730> nose<00:02:20.270> in<00:02:20.390> your<00:02:20.420> pocket<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
the phone or nose in your pocket it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.810 
the phone or nose in your pocket it
easily<00:02:21.560> slipped<00:02:21.800> out<00:02:21.950> whenever<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.430> want<00:02:22.760> to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
easily slipped out whenever you want to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.220 
easily slipped out whenever you want to
be<00:02:22.880> tired<00:02:23.090> together<00:02:23.420> pocket<00:02:23.810> which<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:23.930> kind

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
be tired together pocket which is kind

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.170 
be tired together pocket which is kind
of<00:02:24.260> annoying<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:25.040> case<00:02:25.250> made<00:02:25.580> an<00:02:25.880> adjustment

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
of annoying so case made an adjustment

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.120 
of annoying so case made an adjustment
here<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:26.840> changed<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.380> snap<00:02:27.770> right<00:02:27.950> here

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
here and it changed the snap right here

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.000 
here and it changed the snap right here
and<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.610> really<00:02:29.090> really<00:02:29.360> good<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.800> way<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and is really really good the way the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.710 
and is really really good the way the
designer<00:02:31.310> actually<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.880> pretty<00:02:31.910> difficult<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
designer actually is pretty difficult to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.390 
designer actually is pretty difficult to
open<00:02:32.900> up<00:02:33.140> once<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.440> close<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:33.860> I'm<00:02:34.040> lying<00:02:34.310> or

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
open up once you close this I'm lying or

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.850 
open up once you close this I'm lying or
try<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.610> attempt<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:35.780> um<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.410> if<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.590> type

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
try to attempt it but um so if you type

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.800 
try to attempt it but um so if you type
of<00:02:36.980> person<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.310> switches<00:02:37.700> out<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.970> cases<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> lot

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
of person I switches out the cases a lot

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.750 
of person I switches out the cases a lot
you<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.380> might<00:02:39.590> get<00:02:39.950> annoyed<00:02:40.220> by<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.700> I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
you you might get annoyed by this and I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.280 
you you might get annoyed by this and I
will<00:02:40.820> imagine<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:41.240> will<00:02:41.390> probably<00:02:41.540> probably

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
will imagine this will probably probably

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.350 
will imagine this will probably probably
get<00:02:42.470> loose<00:02:42.650> after<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.010> while<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.280> opening<00:02:44.210> and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
get loose after a while of opening and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.570 
get loose after a while of opening and
closing<00:02:44.510> up<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.930> closing<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:45.380> if<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.430> like

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
closing up and closing but if you like

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.130 
closing up and closing but if you like
to<00:02:46.730> keep<00:02:46.880> your<00:02:47.030> cases<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.570> used<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.020> put

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
to keep your cases and you used to put

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.540 
to keep your cases and you used to put
the<00:02:48.260> same<00:02:48.410> tape<00:02:48.590> case<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.190> months<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.490> end

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
the same tape case for months on end

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.000 
the same tape case for months on end
probably<00:02:50.270> having<00:02:50.630> issues<00:02:50.870> with<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.020> but<00:02:51.980> a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
probably having issues with that but a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.920 
probably having issues with that but a
definitely<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.940> good<00:02:53.180> design<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.660> they<00:02:53.780> have

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
definitely a good design that they have

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.660 
definitely a good design that they have
here<00:02:54.080> for<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> sniper<00:02:54.620> closure<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.370> does<00:02:55.550> not

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
here for a sniper closure it does not

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.490 
here for a sniper closure it does not
come<00:02:55.820> loose<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.540> case<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.780> really<00:02:57.140> snug

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
come loose and the case is really snug

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.800 
come loose and the case is really snug
much<00:02:57.770> snug<00:02:58.070> much<00:02:58.550> more<00:02:58.760> snug<00:02:59.000> than<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.450> IV

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
much snug much more snug than the IV

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.770 
much snug much more snug than the IV
skins<00:03:00.080> iot<00:03:00.560> too<00:03:00.740> so<00:03:01.550> that's<00:03:01.850> enough<00:03:02.030> about<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
skins iot too so that's enough about the

Xylo IV skins I'll I'm like I talk about

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.610

provides<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.920> iphone<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.340> know<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.700> still

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
provides the iphone you know it's still

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.030 
provides the iphone you know it's still
pretty<00:03:17.180> as<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.110> plastic<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.590> still<00:03:18.650> pretty

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
pretty as the plastic is still pretty

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.370 
pretty as the plastic is still pretty
thick<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.520> I<00:03:19.580> don't<00:03:19.730> think<00:03:19.880> even<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.959> depth<00:03:21.200> I

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
thick and I don't think even you depth I

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.600 
thick and I don't think even you depth I
don't<00:03:21.530> know<00:03:21.680> how<00:03:21.800> you<00:03:21.830> would<00:03:22.040> drop<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.490> even

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
don't know how you would drop it to even

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.220 
don't know how you would drop it to even
scratch<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.120> because<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.930> edges<00:03:24.200> are

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
scratch that because the edges are

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.290 
scratch that because the edges are
pretty<00:03:24.500> raised<00:03:24.709> pretty<00:03:24.950> well<00:03:25.100> so<00:03:25.820> everything

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
pretty raised pretty well so everything

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.940 
pretty raised pretty well so everything
is<00:03:26.420> obviously<00:03:26.750> really<00:03:26.959> accessible<00:03:27.530> easy<00:03:27.770> to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
is obviously really accessible easy to

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.030 
is obviously really accessible easy to
get<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.340> switches<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.150> plugs<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
get to the switches that the plugs the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.980 
get to the switches that the plugs the
opening<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.820> bottom<00:03:32.150> i<00:03:32.209> found<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.660> logo<00:03:32.870> in

opening the bottom i found the logo in

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.449 
opening the bottom i found the logo in
the<00:03:33.080> bottom<00:03:33.110> fits<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.620> lot<00:03:33.740> of<00:03:33.860> my<00:03:33.950> accessories

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
the bottom fits a lot of my accessories

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.620 
the bottom fits a lot of my accessories
that<00:03:34.640> plug<00:03:34.940> into<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.150> bottom<00:03:35.390> attempt

transmitters my i am my charger here all
those<00:03:40.280> things<00:03:40.520> fit<00:03:40.730> really<00:03:40.850> well<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.180> that

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
those things fit really well in that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.750 
those things fit really well in that
slot<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.410> has<00:03:42.530> been<00:03:42.709> an<00:03:42.800> issue<00:03:42.920> yet<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.610> i

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
slot and it has been an issue yet so i

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.310 
slot and it has been an issue yet so i
like<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.180> like<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.360> i'm<00:03:44.720> not<00:03:44.840> sure<00:03:45.080> they<00:03:45.200> made

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
like it like that i'm not sure they made

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.140 
like it like that i'm not sure they made
this<00:03:45.440> water<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.860> what<00:03:46.220> but<00:03:46.400> about<00:03:47.060> my

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
this water and what but about my

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.940 
this water and what but about my
accessories<00:03:47.600> have<00:03:47.720> been<00:03:47.840> probably<00:03:48.470> all<00:03:48.709> fit

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
accessories have been probably all fit

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.910 
accessories have been probably all fit
into<00:03:49.100> their<00:03:49.360> camera<00:03:50.360> lines<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.690> perfectly<00:03:51.170> so

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
into their camera lines up perfectly so

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.590 
into their camera lines up perfectly so
overall<00:03:52.220> I'm<00:03:52.459> going<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.640> rate<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:52.850> case<00:03:53.120> very

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
overall I'm going to rate this case very

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.870 
overall I'm going to rate this case very
highly<00:03:54.050> this<00:03:54.860> is<00:03:54.980> probably<00:03:55.160> one<00:03:55.459> of<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.670> few

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
highly this is probably one of the few

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.580 
highly this is probably one of the few
cases<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.420> were<00:03:56.570> actually<00:03:56.900> considered<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.440> use

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
cases I were actually considered to use

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.080 
cases I were actually considered to use
on<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.770> regular<00:03:57.830> basis<00:03:58.370> that's<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.580> plastic<00:03:58.970> case

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
on a regular basis that's a plastic case

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.820 
on a regular basis that's a plastic case
I'm<00:03:59.360> not<00:03:59.510> really<00:03:59.660> big<00:03:59.780> on<00:03:59.989> plastic<00:04:00.410> cases<00:04:00.709> of

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
I'm not really big on plastic cases of

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.180 
I'm not really big on plastic cases of
all<00:04:00.980> but<00:04:01.760> but<00:04:02.270> by<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.870> fact<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.860> screen

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
all but but by the fact that the screen

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.790 
all but but by the fact that the screen
is<00:04:04.250> being<00:04:04.550> protected<00:04:04.700> with<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.270> case<00:04:05.450> and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
is being protected with this case and

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.500 
is being protected with this case and
its<00:04:06.800> really<00:04:06.980> snug<00:04:07.459> it's<00:04:07.730> not<00:04:07.910> loose<00:04:08.150> doesn't

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
its really snug it's not loose doesn't

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.960 
its really snug it's not loose doesn't
feel<00:04:08.630> cheap<00:04:08.800> I<00:04:09.800> really<00:04:10.430> like<00:04:10.550> this<00:04:10.640> case<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.880> lot

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
feel cheap I really like this case a lot

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.550 
feel cheap I really like this case a lot
i've<00:04:11.180> been<00:04:11.300> testing<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.750> off<00:04:11.870> about<00:04:12.110> maybe<00:04:12.500> a

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
i've been testing it off about maybe a

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.100 
i've been testing it off about maybe a
week<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:12.860> a<00:04:12.920> half<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.959> haven't<00:04:14.959> really

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
week and a half and I haven't really

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.260 
week and a half and I haven't really
missed<00:04:15.410> my<00:04:15.650> leather<00:04:16.190> bahah<00:04:16.640> case<00:04:16.669> at<00:04:17.150> all<00:04:17.209> i

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
missed my leather bahah case at all i

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.330 
missed my leather bahah case at all i
really<00:04:17.600> like<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.200> only<00:04:18.650> wished<00:04:18.919> ahead<00:04:19.220> of

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
really like it I only wished ahead of

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.800 
really like it I only wished ahead of
some<00:04:19.489> type<00:04:19.640> of<00:04:19.669> holster<00:04:20.210> that<00:04:20.239> could<00:04:20.570> put

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
some type of holster that could put

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.300 
some type of holster that could put
my<00:04:20.959> hip<00:04:21.139> because<00:04:21.290> I'm<00:04:21.440> not<00:04:21.620> really<00:04:21.799> big<00:04:21.919> on

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
my hip because I'm not really big on

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.600 
my hip because I'm not really big on
keeping<00:04:22.790> my<00:04:22.820> eyes<00:04:23.000> on<00:04:23.030> my<00:04:23.360> pocket<00:04:23.800> but<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:25.190> think

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
keeping my eyes on my pocket but I think

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.700 
keeping my eyes on my pocket but I think
from<00:04:25.850> what<00:04:25.970> I<00:04:26.260> believe<00:04:27.260> that<00:04:27.290> they<00:04:27.680> are

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
from what I believe that they are

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.409 
from what I believe that they are
working<00:04:28.040> on<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> holster<00:04:28.730> for<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:28.940> case<00:04:29.210> so

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
working on a holster for this case so

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.460 
working on a holster for this case so
hopefully<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.810> can<00:04:29.900> see<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.080> in<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.350> future

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
hopefully you can see that in the future

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.379 
hopefully you can see that in the future
from<00:04:30.740> case-mate<00:04:31.160> but<00:04:31.970> that's<00:04:32.090> probably<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
from case-mate but that's probably the

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.460 
from case-mate but that's probably the
only<00:04:32.419> recommendation<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:33.050> paper<00:04:33.320> this<00:04:33.410> just
