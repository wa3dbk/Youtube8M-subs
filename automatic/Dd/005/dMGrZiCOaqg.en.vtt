00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.529 
brilliant is brilliant I've had so much
fun<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> customization<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.420> know

it's<00:00:54.719> pretty<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.079> depth<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> multiplayer

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
it's pretty in depth for a multiplayer

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.729 
it's pretty in depth for a multiplayer
game<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:57.149> create<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.510> own<00:00:57.660> avatar<00:00:57.899> may

game you can create your own avatar may

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.369 
game you can create your own avatar may
the<00:00:58.980> male<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.760> female<00:01:00.210> which<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.510> great

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the male or female which is great

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
the male or female which is great
because<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.949> opens<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.399> more

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
because that opens a little more

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.460 
because that opens a little more
audience<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.390> more<00:01:03.899> shooters<00:01:04.290> should

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
audience I think more shooters should

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649 
audience I think more shooters should
take<00:01:04.650> notice<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.180> you'd<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.330> sure<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.570> had

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
take notice and you'd be sure they had

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.910 
take notice and you'd be sure they had
to<00:01:06.750> choose<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.110> gender<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> play

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to choose your gender they want to play

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
to choose your gender they want to play
I<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I think a lot of you know it's not a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.179 
I think a lot of you know it's not a
let's<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> lot<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> games<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.530> seem<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
let's see a lot of games that seem to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.000 
let's see a lot of games that seem to
neglect<00:01:11.430> female<00:01:12.299> avatars<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
neglect female avatars because it's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.999 
neglect female avatars because it's
maddening<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.820> war<00:01:15.060> oh<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.799> think

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
maddening it's war oh and I just think

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
maddening it's war oh and I just think
it's<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.310> bit<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.820> silly<00:01:18.090> excuse<00:01:18.450> it's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
it's a bit that's just silly excuse it's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
it's a bit that's just silly excuse it's
a<00:01:18.659> video<00:01:18.780> game<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.259> God's<00:01:19.409> sake<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.009> think

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
a video game for God's sake and I think

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.460 
a video game for God's sake and I think
it<00:01:20.280> should<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.430> open<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.210> everybody<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it should be open to it for everybody to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.820 
it should be open to it for everybody to
play<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.030> Max<00:01:24.030> Payne<00:01:24.210> has<00:01:24.990> open<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.560> well<00:01:25.710> as
