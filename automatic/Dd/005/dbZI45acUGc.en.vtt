cuz<00:02:34.959> uh<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:37.080> why<00:02:38.080> would<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.380> boost<00:02:38.680> a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
cuz uh I know it's why would you boost a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.240 
cuz uh I know it's why would you boost a
foreign<00:02:39.820> emblem<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:41.290> should<00:02:41.500> be<00:02:41.680> earlier

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
foreign emblem that should be earlier

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.600 
foreign emblem that should be earlier
this<00:02:42.790> maybe<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.510> looks<00:02:43.660> cool<00:02:43.990> I<00:02:44.380> don't<00:02:44.860> know<00:02:44.950> or

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
this maybe it looks cool I don't know or

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.330 
this maybe it looks cool I don't know or
maybe<00:02:46.170> people<00:02:47.170> want

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
maybe people want

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.690 
maybe people want
bulk<00:02:49.000> ammo<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.599> don't<00:02:50.440> know<00:02:50.500> no<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.190> guess<00:02:51.519> I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
bulk ammo I don't know no I guess I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.570 
bulk ammo I don't know no I guess I
guess<00:02:51.849> that<00:02:52.319> makes<00:02:53.319> him<00:02:53.440> feel<00:02:53.920> better<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:54.550> uh

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
guess that makes him feel better but uh

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.960 
guess that makes him feel better but uh
I<00:02:55.030> saw<00:02:55.690> him<00:02:55.900> right<00:02:56.290> there<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:57.099> am<00:02:57.370> shot<00:02:57.849> him

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
quick because I wasn't really expecting

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.600 
quick because I wasn't really expecting
to<00:03:03.310> get<00:03:03.459> five<00:03:04.420> killstreak<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.410> from<00:03:06.129> from
