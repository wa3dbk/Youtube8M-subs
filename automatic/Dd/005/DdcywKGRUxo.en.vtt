00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:20.320
 hi friends today here in france saturday and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.590
 very good circuit from the beginning 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.810
 I liked it a lot and in the time 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.660
 had a good problems with the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.609
 brake I made the 17 but the sleeve 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.949
 qualifying I had a good 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.350
 departure and I'm very happy to have 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.450
 been rolling 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.460
 among the top ten then I think that 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.180
 I put on 11 and it's finally over 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.489
 the 10 so very well very happy and 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.760
 tomorrow so try to do it the same or 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.920
 better to try to finish the sleeves of nothing 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 the greeting and tomorrow I tell you 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.140
 hello friends of mx1 board we are here in 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.210
 France and good the circuit is very 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.140
 nice already in the first trainings 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.330
 I was very good at the circuit 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.619
 it's a bit muddy but then 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.090
 for the chronos it was leaving a 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.600
 a little bit better 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.810
 I really felt very good myself and the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.759
 motivates very well and good can do very 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.799
 good return I went first this last one 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.289
 back until my teammate 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.329
 and that nats that happened to me then I did 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.819
 a second place in the first sleeve 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.819
 Well, I made a very good exit 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.340
 I tried to throw as much as possible going 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.070
 first but good the circuit was me 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.670
 choked a bit and in the end I 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.310
 passed the 22 pilots either in 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.500
 acquire in or re is not the one that goes second 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.229
 in the championship and good the annoyance 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.540
 enough because now I only have three 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.010
 points but good looking already for tomorrow 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.110
 today the piloting was not 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.590
 as expected but good I made a third 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.790
 put and we're always there then 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.550
 looking already for tomorrow and good 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.070
 hello hello friends of mx1 board 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.960
 we are in france in my third race 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.320
 of the european championship 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.620
 I have not been doing as well as I expected 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.080
 in fact I could not classify myself in 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.300
 the timed trainings and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.280
 I was also a little annoyed because I 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.880
 touch with another pilot in the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 trainings I did a lot of damage in the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.120
 foot 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.050
 The things that happen 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.819
 and get to qualify at the end in the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.599
 repesca 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.749
 nothing then in the first sleeve that was 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.749
 today Saturday I did not go very well as always 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:55.030
 and finally I got to the seventeenth 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:58.300
 and tenth the 17 sorry and good to see if 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.090
 tomorrow goes better because today the circuit 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.480
 we were choked enough to see to see 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.480
 What's up
