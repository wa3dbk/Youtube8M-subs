00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.390
 just double the whole but has one 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.790
 very specific reason and indeed come 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 with her in the video again so completely 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.030
 Discreetly speaking about these sectors 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.970
 the one of the strategic right there 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.250
 This overview card looks and indeed 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.329
 I'm here in a video what 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.970
 noticed I know if there ever 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.230
 somehow you paid attention to me 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.210
 it was definitely noticed again 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 or is always on it and that is yes 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.130
 this is the strategic one right now 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.370
 here we do this we can see this 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.519
 Sectors Moon Earth Good 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.869
 usually more to see though 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.850
 for the moment we are supposed to wait 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.319
 do not care because it is only possible 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.899
 and solely to this sector because I 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.850
 marked red because that's why 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.990
 these two pictures take that 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.079
 is the whole reason for that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.530
 Now look at this particle there 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.700
 so these are those that tile 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.829
 what it looks like and that looks here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.729
 Over on the minimap you overlook that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.619
 is almost the same thing one to one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.229
 So that's what I mean in good German 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.709
 here look on the sector or 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.929
 strategic map 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:43.259
 the map that I see there so here 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.149
 this tile and that card as well as these 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.789
 internet is pictured so will the or 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.560
 ingame look that may already be 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.060
 somebody has paid attention to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.799
 every case that is the case at the moment 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.959
 So that's the island to see again 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.240
 get 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:02.189
 but that does not help matters 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.439
 also because this internet is not 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.810
 more automatically generated so 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.340
 This one sees you fall away so these are 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.810
 all handmade islands you 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.130
 looks may have the advantage 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.200
 that, of course, later that 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.319
 possibility exists by dlc small 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.239
 ingame will be new because of course 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.620
 Adding a few sectors to the world one 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.319
 has actually taken place looks 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.440
 yes, everywhere in the end, even if he is good 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.510
 is the question of performance 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 history but that has me out 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.620
 the volleyball women in any case 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.940
 if you continue now we 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.940
 look at this sector again 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.349
 go because it gets bigger when you go 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.569
 This video where I get this out now 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.360
 I kept looking at it then 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.220
 I saw that person exactly 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.680
 actually built only one sector 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.880
 and the one down here plus a polit 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.630
 I think on the moon settlement to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.100
 5000 inhabitants and the rest 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.340
 Roughly 650,000 times they are up 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.049
 this sector data on it if we now 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.220
 further thought over where do I have this video 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.260
 even further on, it looks like one 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.430
 Construction of space savings still had 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.410
 nothing is heard that means the thing 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.880
 Want to be optimized now is the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.470
 ask to what extent has the great houses 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.730
 built with more inhabitants like it 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.440
 He does not look like the crowd 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.239
 built by 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.570
 So if I'm the whole converter now 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.970
 hochrechne and back and forth there I could 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.920
 let's say big pro on such a sector we 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.650
 down here I loose a war 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.049
 Month after that, if I do not quite do that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.670
 continue to calculate 812 sectors but on 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.230
 the earth is coming or in total it is coming 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.660
 I'll tell it to myself 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.069
 eight sectors or let's say ten 2 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.450
 moon 8 on the earth 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.430
 then there are ever in these 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.630
 Sectors provided I am all 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.940
 reasonably or hopefully the same 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.299
 great because we were there already about at 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.100
 eight million inhabitants 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.609
 provided of course you build optimally 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.120
 everything close and so on but that only 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.769
 by the way 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.389
 there are so much of it is now about 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.540
 this sector definitely what you want 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.639
 Here on the map looks like this cable is 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.470
 just the same map then in game that 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:09.680
 you could look that is this video 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:11.269
 thereof yes bla bla bla bla bla you see 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.450
 Now that's just about to happen 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.450
 purely 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.730
 that's almost this landscape in now 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.920
 and you see , that's really it 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:33.030
 ample building land what you have to 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:35.540
 disposal has a deep so that's that 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.680
 what he said five times the size of the year 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.210
 2070 I can imagine that 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.480
 that he gets there you can see this 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.390
 whole square hall on the coasts 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:49.860
 I would really say that was true 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.690
 Bauplatz up to crime again 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.470
 start once is enough to look once 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.480
 Send as it was that is mine 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.280
 look for the sectors what 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.380
 you see there in the strategic map 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.970
 is after that money in so you can 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.040
 to guess approximately like this 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.670
 island world looks like or in 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.350
 this sector looks and that is that 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.240
 Whole mystery does what in this 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.000
 sector is that's all it 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.470
 I always really have videos yet 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.840
 and look again 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.360
 in the end , so to speak 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.100
 example in a user noticed at 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.590
 In this module system, the module 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.960
 system was explained 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.660
 this one of these mines factory or 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.210
 less peitings accustomed or the modules 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.620
 meanwhile drives a very short passage 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.870
 Must really be single picture divorce 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.420
 make you see the thing for a moment 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.830
 aufpoppen what is needed and there 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.470
 then you just read that yours 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.930
 credits iridium and count as 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.820
 Construction material is needed 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.830
 and so you always come so gradually 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.930
 always to other things and 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.360
 but in the end it still experiences here and 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.030
 because something more than what they are in the 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.760
 but wanted to betray end effect yes 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.710
 only knows everything on the edge 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.810
 Definitely so for the sector 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.240
 In my opinion, that's what you see 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.980
 on the strategic map is seen 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.740
 after that the world of the island as in game 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.960
 So you can then get a picture 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.630
 them what was in there one expected because he 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.190
 the team as no more scrolling on 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.280
 edge of this mini map gives that is 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.860
 definitely then the finished island world yes 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.780
 Now you can wonder if 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.340
 I own the building land to my 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.800
 look for yes because if not more 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.350
 you can just watch the picture of the look 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.599
 make times greater told more times 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:37.470
 make it smaller 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:39.990
 you can see then you look back 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.750
 So that's a rich one 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.310
 Building land what is on it and you had 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.360
 the island behind the others 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.800
 Corner you can see here 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.680
 You only see this excerpt here 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.750
 the front is somehow a third of 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.250
 the island in front, though roughly, is one 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.479
 a little more than a third that we 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.039
 in our dreams that the island is still 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.069
 and has this part still there so goes 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.150
 really something on it 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:04.020
 Do you wonder if I'm like that 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:06.270
 I really like it 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.949
 someday you have to believe me 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.259
 bring fresh wind into alu and me 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.509
 believe that what we have so far 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.289
 clearly you have to see the implementation 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:16.050
 wait 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:17.940
 no subject is therefore to reserve but 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.860
 I think that's what they may be 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.849
 thought that you have 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.849
 thoughts that I have made
