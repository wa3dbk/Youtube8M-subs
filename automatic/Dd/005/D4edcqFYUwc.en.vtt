 glitter out here and what do you need 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.149
 for this look 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.969
 you need a good car from the 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.010
 street and you have it fully back on 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.750
 tune what works like the last 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.629
 German, too, but this is slippery 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.989
 as easy and as I said for all 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.609
 Consoles for back and for next gen and 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.390
 You are not allowed to use this car 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:57.879
 assures her people need to spawn your 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.190
 set point to last place it is 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.989
 Also important and get to her 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.350
 your garage it does not matter 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.580
 which garage it is really perfect 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:13.000
 no matter which garage is so and now 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.390
 your start menu look at online jobs 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.799
 then also from ochs represents and then 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.049
 also missions 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.689
 it does not really matter which mission 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.570
 you only need a mission where he is on 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.460
 same place from where he is right now 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.610
 start now the mission was fast 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.649
 then the whole could see mine 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.619
 buddy is still sitting in the car 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.750
 Yes, yes, and I am in the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.049
 mission alone i drive my car 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.630
 easy in the garage rhine quite simply 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.310
 my garage is full but yours 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.000
 does not have to be full it is perfect 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.890
 no matter 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.810
 so now I just replace 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.630
 car or if you have room you can 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.520
 driving it in normally so people now 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.740
 replaces the car is good in the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.360
 garage now I go out again and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.320
 my buddy is suffering now 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.049
 again 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.079
 then I go at its meeting in and 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.060
 then he is still in the car and in there 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.010
 You can take it car and the glitch 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.060
 as I do here do it again 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.790
 or go straight to the garage 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.920
 So I later did that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.840
 the whole garage was full 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.640
 and then I have the bypass switch 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.700
 made the bottom you will you in the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.380
 video description also link 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.959
 at the bypass switch and then I have 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.680
 all cars sold one after the other and 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.680
 who can count 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.810
 150000 I think I got close 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.930
 or 100 9000 in any case of the x 10 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.819
 really cool so now I'm climbing again 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.239
 on driver position 1 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.160
 My buddy gets back in the car 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.360
 and I start the mission again 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.310
 rockford roll 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.470
 but as said the mission is 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.080
 really could not care less what a 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.510
 mission here because it just has to 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.870
 be a mission where he will go 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.940
 same place as that of so it is 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.280
 really no matter what mission you then 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.660
 just so now shares, so to speak 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.450
 our lobby again 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.959
 I am in the mission and he is sitting 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.549
 Still in the car and I was seeing now 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.260
 I am alone in the mission 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.390
 I was the car back in the garage 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.549
 in and then you can also see that 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.070
 you already have two times you have right 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.720
 is still the car from just now and 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.200
 That's why I'm counting on that again 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.170
 you see 2 now we were the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.680
 All invite me back to the lobby 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.930
 a guy and then the glitch rocks 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.780
 simply without end and that is so mega 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.549
 just what do you say to people like that 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.609
 Do you like this look down below 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.350

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.260

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.500

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.069
 leave mission it does not matter 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.310
 and then you have the car twice or 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.299
 three or ten times people of these clips 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.549
 just hammer and I tarry with 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.229

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.120

 just a hammer greasy and if you the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.970
