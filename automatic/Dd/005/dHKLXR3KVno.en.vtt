okay I'm going to show how this new
squeegee<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.209> works

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
squeegee is works

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.800 
squeegee is works
first<00:00:18.050> off<00:00:18.849> we<00:00:19.849> want<00:00:20.029> something<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.570> same

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
first off we want something the same

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.710 
first off we want something the same
thickness<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.849> white<00:00:22.849> enough<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:23.419> this

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
little tit on it then we can take our

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.590 
little tit on it then we can take our
piece<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.359> get<00:00:30.140> right<00:00:30.289> up<00:00:30.470> against<00:00:30.949> there<00:00:34.600> put

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
piece and get right up against there put

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.810 
piece and get right up against there put
the<00:00:35.720> squeegee<00:00:36.019> on<00:00:36.260> there<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.739> help<00:00:36.890> hold<00:00:37.400> it<00:00:37.640> in

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
the squeegee on there to help hold it in

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.640 
the squeegee on there to help hold it in
place<00:00:37.970> and<00:00:38.980> help<00:00:39.980> us<00:00:40.159> align<00:00:41.379> and<00:00:42.379> then<00:00:44.620> tape<00:00:45.620> it

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
place and help us align and then tape it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:54.910 
place and help us align and then tape it
down

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.170 

then<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.219> dip<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:58.430> can<00:00:59.430> roll<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.000> in

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
then we just dip your can roll it up in

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.229 
then we just dip your can roll it up in
here<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:01.129> somebody<00:01:02.129> says<00:01:02.610> shorter

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:54.840 

you

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.610 

this<00:01:55.850> tool<00:01:56.090> also<00:01:56.120> do<00:01:56.690> masking<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.320> want<00:01:57.530> to

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
this tool also do masking you want to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.210 
this tool also do masking you want to
peel<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:58.190> back<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.550> little<00:01:58.909> bit<00:02:00.610> on<00:02:01.610> here<00:02:01.880> to

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
expose the sticky side torch so you can

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.630 
expose the sticky side torch so you can
run<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.259> roll<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:09.560> back<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.039> table<00:02:10.399> it's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
run you roll it back on the table it's

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.990 
run you roll it back on the table it's
stick<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.930> go<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.740> way

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
one thing about nice about this new

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.310 
one thing about nice about this new
squeegee<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.630> can<00:02:17.810> bring<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.170> right

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
squeegee is that you can bring it right

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.020 
squeegee is that you can bring it right
up<00:02:18.530> against<00:02:19.450> there<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.480> square<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.380> up<00:02:22.030> so

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
up against there and square it up so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.500 
up against there and square it up so
it's<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.640> they<00:02:25.640> roll<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:25.970> back<00:02:26.180> with<00:02:26.480> a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
it's so that they roll it back with a

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.449 
it's so that they roll it back with a
squeegee<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:28.900> that's<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.350> smooths<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.310> out

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
squeegee and that's that smooths it out

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.790 
squeegee and that's that smooths it out
now<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.019> choice<00:02:33.380> here<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:36.140> start

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
banner I have peeled back a little ways

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.700 
banner I have peeled back a little ways
here<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.910> I've<00:04:03.270> got<00:04:03.300> some<00:04:03.810> tape<00:04:04.140> exposed

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
here so that I've got some tape exposed

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.820 
here so that I've got some tape exposed
so<00:04:05.490> I<00:04:05.610> can<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:05.940> use<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.690> not<00:04:07.380> only<00:04:07.530> tape

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
so I can just use that to not only tape

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.920 
so I can just use that to not only tape
my<00:04:08.040> banner<00:04:08.310> down<00:04:08.640> but<00:04:09.000> tape<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.420> graphics

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
my banner down but tape the graphics

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.080 
my banner down but tape the graphics
down<00:04:11.540> it's<00:04:12.540> always<00:04:12.840> best<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.970> let<00:04:14.970> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
down it's always best to let the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.170 
down it's always best to let the
squeegee<00:04:15.540> on<00:04:15.660> there<00:04:16.190> let<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.220> do<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.640> all<00:04:17.820> flat

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
squeegee on there let it do it all flat

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.120 
squeegee on there let it do it all flat
so<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:18.870> nice<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:20.120> nice<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.360> flat<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.630> there
