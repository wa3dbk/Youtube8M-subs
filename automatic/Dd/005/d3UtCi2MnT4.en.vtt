00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.410
 know the most important thing when my profession 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.300
 work is doing something she wore 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.160
 turbo income well and to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.740
 it was your need that it is it 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 this is cool this is nice you will like it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.809
 it 's some kind of creativity you can 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.809
 use yourself in many ways and you can 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.520
 develop 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.520
 road bikes 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.170
 I think the most important party itself 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.640
 the first big party was life 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 ballet giselle 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.910
 then I was only really 17 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340
 years and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.489
 and 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.850
 Even the season is completely the first not 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.979
 worked in the mariinsky theater it was 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.790
 of course a great challenge for me 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.790
 but 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.280
 what is probably childish naivety and 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.510
 the desire to prove that I can very 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.330
 moved and 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.340
 it turned out so good for 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.770
 me this is a great happiness to speak 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.070
 big theater i love this theater 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.840
 I really love this scene one of the most 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.510
 challenging one of the hardest scenes 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.210
 probably the world is much easier to dance 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.680
 other theaters after when you 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.680
 perform on stage big 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.450
 already bought 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.590
 I am not a superstitious person because I 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:03.030
 a believer for me is 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.810
 not even the ritual as needs i will dawn on 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.599
 godfather know and 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.530
 I read a prayer of course when I dance 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.959
 the premiere is much more exciting and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.310
 a comparison with if I dance many times 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:22.170
 one performance or another 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.780
 the role is much easier to understand how to 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.310
 behave yourself on the stage where you can 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.099
 rest where you need the opposite 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.170
 gather all your strength when you dance 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.090
 the premiere is extra excitement 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.099
 which I don't like, she doesn't need such 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.530
 the excitement that you never know what 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.349
 wait like when you get tired when i'm already 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.200
 your hand cannot rise but therefore 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.239
 Of course I worry, I always before going out 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.030
 to the scene first of all the day I really 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.150
 it is important this development to develop to find 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.110
 new choreographer new partners new 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.569
 performances 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.769
 that is probably my life is peace when 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.560
 they don't need this very carefully 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:08.519
 listen to your teachers who 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.260
 sure to give a good foundation and schools 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.819
 it is generally a base base that you 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.120
 then you use all your creative 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.569
 life and 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.879
 all you can get from school from your 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.799
 teachers need to absorb everything 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.069
 soak up because then time is running out 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.890
 that's what you didn't learn at school you 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.379
 later it is difficult to catch it today 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.610
 I think a lot about some new ones 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.599
 performances aha new roles and new 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.520
 productions a lot of work on 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.569
 modern choreography therefore 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.620
 this is for the profession 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.840
 as for just living of course 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.830
 I really want the family to be always 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.220
 next to me to 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.060
 and my daughter was growing up happy 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:02.370
 my loved ones were also happy and 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.270
 I do everything for this general dreams 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.270
 to persuade
