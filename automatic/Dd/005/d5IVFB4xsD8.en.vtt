 that the merchant bug makes us more ballast 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.250
 early 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:57.290
 I gaff korea fact is that 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:59.000
 alger than wait until I lose it is 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.189
 preferable ointment if your vehicle

 it's kind of you can not 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.159
 to go because your past half 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.540
 improve done x is returned six times 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.489
 short and it will work 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.039
 when you see I lost it 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.090
 perfect that's what I wanted 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:27.889
 see it three races and 8 harper I 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.650

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.370
 that I just had that come 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.960
 to buy only eight pairs instead 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:02.449
 1000 is still a good little 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:06.860
 profit it's short I wanted and 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:10.880
