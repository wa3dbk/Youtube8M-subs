00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello family talk about 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.750
 say motor pump 307 eats and manufacturer 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.570
 Japan Subaru 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.980
 This is how the box looks like. 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.980
 what is included 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:26.840
 kit includes a connection kit for 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.840
 hose filter on the suction pipe 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.279
 keys for servicing a motor pump and 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.379
 user manual 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:51.180
 note what is in Russian 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:53.100
 correctly set out the instruction like this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.270
 Dastan's motor pump looks out of the box 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.500
 Now carefully and and see 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.559
 motor pump characteristics 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.239
 The principle of operation is the same as that of 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.430
 normal pump surface height 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.430
 suction up to 8 meters 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.890
 head 23 meters performance 1000 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.510
 liters per minute 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:28.110
 pump part here is a hole for 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.110
 suction rod here for pressurized 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.619
 for pouring water when you first start 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:44.410
 key for service, that is, if 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.869
 you never know something pumping 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.869
 part can unscrew the nuts 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:58.420
 remove the warranty is not 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:02.590
 distributed over the kit in 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 Included are the usual clips I don't 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.710
 began to get the hose connection 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.270
 further screw connections on my 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.640
 they are not very comfortable because 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.820
 constantly 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.900
 if you wind the thread grind down 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.820
 as an option you can also use 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:29.940
 conventional sleeve nuts that is us 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:34.810
 I clocked the cooling can also be 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.300
 to mount and on the natural response 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.410
 where it will be possible to tie later 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:47.530
 like that fire hose like that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.740
 there is a special suction hose 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.870
 reinforced clamps 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:03:00.970
 which can be a filter and a hose 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:04.000
 secure in this mod on the pump volume 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.580
 tank about 4 liters of it is enough 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.150
 two hours if you use it almost 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.870
 at maximum speed 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.320
 here oil is poured at the first in 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.820
 bay 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.090
 6 100 grams it changes after 20 hours 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.190
 afterwards she at the first 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.170
 subsequent launch is added 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:32.530
 looks level and after 50 hours and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.959
 can also be changed to motor pump 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.959
 regular 95 petrol was working properly 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:47.049
 start handle 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.219
 that is, you can safely turn on the power 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.840
 on the back side 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:57.430
 open the fuel feeder if it is 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.150
 cold open the valve put on 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.909
 one-third two-thirds turnovers and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.469
 run 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.849
 stop immediately if it is not 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:10.090
 running at maximum speed 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.980
 you can lower the handle to the far left 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.760
 position 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.859
 worked for 2 minutes, it can be disabled 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.280
 also with convenience even though it is equipped 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.720
 check valve 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.289
 it is possible to install a check valve 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.509
 finally suction hoses in order 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:38.320
 so that if water remains low so she 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:40.750
 not sucked the air motor pump worth its 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.590
 what kind of money you can 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.590
