00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.720 
GPS doesn't work well in my work I'm not
sure<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.480> can't<00:02:52.690> really<00:02:52.870> test<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.380> good

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
sure I can't really test it that good

Wi-Fi errors if you try to start it by
again<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.010> think<00:02:57.190> that's<00:02:57.490> just<00:02:57.520> because<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.970> the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
again I think that's just because of the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.190 
again I think that's just because of the
colonel<00:02:58.990> shabby<00:02:59.860> should<00:03:00.130> have<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.400> fixed

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
colonel shabby should have that fixed

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
positive the volume works and you can

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.740 
positive the volume works and you can
hear<00:03:16.690> stuff<00:03:18.060> multi-touch<00:03:19.060> I'll<00:03:19.390> show<00:03:19.690> you

actually see in the background hold it
see<00:03:47.860> we<00:03:47.980> have<00:03:48.010> one<00:03:48.250> finger<00:03:48.700> two<00:03:49.090> fingers

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
see we have one finger two fingers

see we have one finger two fingers
crossed<00:03:50.110> my<00:03:50.380> own<00:03:50.530> do<00:03:50.890> whatever<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:52.120> works

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
crossed my own do whatever it works

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.220 
crossed my own do whatever it works
which<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:53.890> awesome<00:03:54.720> there<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:55.840> actually<00:03:56.170> a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
which is awesome there is actually a

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.080 
which is awesome there is actually a
hack<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.500> we<00:03:56.830> can<00:03:57.070> do<00:03:57.190> almost<00:03:57.370> positive<00:03:57.760> that

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
hack that we can do almost positive that

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.650 
hack that we can do almost positive that
can<00:03:58.330> give<00:03:58.450> us<00:03:58.510> five<00:03:59.140> fingers<00:04:00.300> inside<00:04:01.300> just<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
can give us five fingers inside just to

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.440 
can give us five fingers inside just to
which<00:04:02.080> is<00:04:02.230> awesome<00:04:02.670> one<00:04:03.670> thing<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:03.880> note<00:04:04.180> i'm

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
which is awesome one thing to note i'm

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
which is awesome one thing to note i'm
not<00:04:04.900> sure<00:04:05.080> if<00:04:05.200> this<00:04:05.380> is<00:04:05.440> just<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:06.040> due<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.760> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
not sure if this is just the due to the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.170 
not sure if this is just the due to the
screen<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.650> photon<00:04:09.130> or<00:04:09.160> what<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:09.730> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
screen of the photon or what but the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.449 
screen of the photon or what but the
color<00:04:10.540> green<00:04:10.989> looks<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.560> little<00:04:11.770> bit<00:04:11.950> off<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
color green looks a little bit off I

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.090 
color green looks a little bit off I
mean<00:04:13.300> it's<00:04:13.450> not<00:04:13.600> too<00:04:13.930> bad<00:04:14.170> but<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:14.860> kind<00:04:15.040> of

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100
