00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.250
 good guys as far as the part that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.400
 also where he puts a name of black 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.380
 ops 3 if you are not wrong that is a 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.890
 departure in both 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.500
 normal illa d 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.000
 hot spot I found it out of interest 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.480
 realistic and the first games do not 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.560
 he 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.440
 I'm looking for it and I think in the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.800
 first game of 23 that has been uploaded to 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.840
 youtube I do not know but really that the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.370
 crust and it seems different to all 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.320
 other cases in terms of mobility 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.780
 graphically as to many 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.460
 things when they showed the trailer the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.170
 multiplayer yesterday I thought it looks like 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.269
 very much to you that is as far as 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.269
 graphics that is not exactly 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.230
 different from all things 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.330
 but if one saw it like that but it is something 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.910
 different obviously it's nothing we see that 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.170
 is saying that it is something very very 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.080
 different 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.729
 but if you have a co-creation and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.970
 variety in terms of mobility and everything 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.970
 that 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.790
 weapons was avenged for this from the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.290
 roles and abilities that each 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.970
 person if it seems very good 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.480
 here we can see how they make lavalle 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.480
 state 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.990
 is with the bird and is really exploited 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.990
 4 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.480
 I do not know I have many uses good though 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.040
 I feel that in this black water is when 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.050
 is in the multiplayer to see me 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.390
 normally just normally 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.230
 lately and tears normally 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.660
 when I 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.450
 advanced warfare what is my goal my 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.340
 objective 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:06.149
 adn when there were many gusts 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:06.149
 I always say that if not seriously playing 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.190
 the gusts have not killed so much the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.910
 better way though that is however the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.610
 objective according to the developers 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.500
 the maps that the gusts are those that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.530
 more we have here 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.420
 simple special bomb or repression like 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.670
 brothers clear or sharply 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.730
 but in the end being the goal for that 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.240
 I tell you, it's going to be another 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.610
 the most hardcore streak I do I do not know 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.270
 is very good only showed multiple 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.270
 bells 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.370
 however I feel I could give a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.370
 little bit 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.060
 but the story I think he called me a 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:03:02.930
 little attention 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:05.700
 and I think that's why it's because 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.140
 viable but what do you mean I do not know 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.370
 until the moment of the rosary 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.640
 obviously but when it comes out 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.640
 5 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.400
 in the sense of good motivator and such and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.050
 after several variations many things 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.930
 of for example that are said 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.829
 it could be a very very good 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.829
 same 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.569
 very much 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.540
 and you atmosphere of comfort is better 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.829
 A) Yes 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.829
 and a lot of innovation 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.680
 in innovation but what he wants 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.790
 to say is that only multiplayer will 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.380
 is saying that it is only the part 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.060
 multiplayer already has me as a 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.370
 let me know, imagine when you come to assume 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.790
 what really I like my channel 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.790
 he is dedicated 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.650
 imagine how zombie leaves so many maps 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.800
 supposedly basal many maps do not 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.800
 he 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.930
 tomorrow if you give this video tomorrow 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.599
 I promise to bring you more multiplayer one 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.319
 two three and more analyzed very much 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.319
 Much more 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.650
 and how 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.389
 goodbye
