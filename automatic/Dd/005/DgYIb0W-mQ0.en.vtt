00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 bio people what exactly my name is you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.690
 double cd and i was with the the today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 buy a longboard together 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.929
 who would have thought that since I was otherwise 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.759
 by the way, I always use it now 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.870
 here again my mobile just as sound like that 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.750
 I'm easy on the fast 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.740
 take a video and use the aston 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.500
 I buy martin longboard otherwise 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 always with the others together with the others 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 us sport drove and thus simons the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.930
 have even had two or simon 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 I even believe three or so and now 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 In fact, you finally have my own 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.779
 bought yes what I set so myself 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.210
 can on my weight and so and so on 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.950
 I would like that to be so 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.850
 It has become so here I can do you 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.350
 times show no idea then 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 probably not so hot either 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.710
 looks so far from the classroom 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.660
 from below and so from above exactly us 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.960
 want these concrete workshops or 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.460
 that's exactly what the concrete wave shop is called 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.660
 where the others are always experienced 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.699
 that was really cool 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.859
 it's really cool, but there it was 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.339
 really so mega crass many people so the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.280
 and I was about twenty at the time 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.040
 Three I believe so and he does at 16 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.450
 So, actually, when we get there 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 16 clock actually closed and the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 hell go so people can stand 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.659
 kind of loading up to the back 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.860
 through and we have a loose over one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.000
 half an hour queued in any case 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.170
 until we finally got it 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.340
 or until it was my turn 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 he had to wait for me and the armada 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.560
 in it also in rising mega many of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.939
 somehow the dena always has it 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.930
 on instagram is posted on everyone 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.979
 case is this shop i believe 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.009
 kind of a little bit with you 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.820
 arrived and above all people the dna 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.049
 who recognized and was like that and then 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.189
 me somehow and then I have me 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.009
 brought the board what is it called 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.570
 from frankfurt germany yes at least there 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.930
 Design has just been written 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.430
 Unfortunately, the shop did not have it 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.020
 not so much anymore 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.280
 all axes there and me so many 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.270
 mature I can do it right 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.380
 but I also understand online 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.600
 Looked or everywhere is everything 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.580
 sold out longboard is just right 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.599
 gross hype somehow and that's why 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.979
 I had is a relatively limited 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.390
 choice for you but pretty good because 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.190
 I can never decide anyway 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.080
 that does not matter 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.370
 a lot of choice that's just building me 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.040
 I believe only two or three 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.300
 drove three little and I wanted 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.550
 actually something in shape 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.810
 other longboard actually have 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.820
 a bit like that from actually 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.620
 do not know but that means above 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.840
 on the surface is that he is also in need 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.140
 that now also bamboo that exists in 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.160
 two different degrees of hardness if one 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.440
 so this is how it is here now 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.420
 relatively hard that was synonymous flex 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.390
 1 and flex two flex 1 was I think 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.100
 that something softer flex hiflex 2 is 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.340
 now that each means something harder that is 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.100
 the word itself does not change that way 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.360
 If you think about it now 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.950
 has nothing to do with the steering now 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.560
 that it then hangs with the axles 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.060
 and so more together 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.060
 and yes, no idea who the roles are 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.920
 now a bit wider and therefore 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.390
 more for the city so now is not 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.250
 such a highspeed board around any 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.020
 his crew goes down mountains with his crew 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.480
 setting for the city where you can cool from a 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.800
 after b comes as fast as I think 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.090
 really good, I 'm like 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.320
 Otherwise, who else said that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.090
 which one also really liked 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.100
 only has that growing ultra-gross 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.270
 has set soft that if you 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.680
 at some point down the mountain 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.640
 I'm not even in control at all 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.730
 At least not maybe I am yes 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.440
 not practiced enough enough not enough 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.590
 idea 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.300
 yes that was longboard achso has cost 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.390
 I can just say that now 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.980
 has now cost 250 euros I know 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.420
 honestly not so so it up 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.850
 any case not me upper class now 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.530
 believe that is a very solid good 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.060
 beginner farmers I know that I like 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.400
 much you have to spend so but I have 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.290
 already belongs to 200 250 euro for one 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.220
 So you have to agree something good word 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.170
 not some kind of scrap now 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.989
 or no idea was told me 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.519
 I know because not so good and 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.690
 you wanted to have quite good because 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.430
 I'm with the other drivers together 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.650
 always and how will this flare off mega 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.390
 if I had built what is right 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.970
 bad rolls or or no idea 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.320
 what is there for problems so I ask 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.110
 I always get off really fast when I am 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.280
 because somehow can not keep up 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.560
 that's why it's not the most expensive but 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.750
 that have been going on so many times and that 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.070
 always been hampered if I none 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.300
 has and why it has bought once 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.560
 but I think actually very nice of 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.850
 because I'm a bit crazy 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.780
 other as I said it should be above 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.639
 actually be bright 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.380
 but there was not that much now 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.880
 selection of this price range and was there 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.440
 me that quasi put to heart because 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.070
 it's so cool in terms of price 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.360
 should be 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.790
 I'm very, very much 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.080
 Satisfied though I am not so 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.880
 choice had with dex or so i thought 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.290
 I imagine so cool deck looking here 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.030
 I'm out of me that actually me 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.560
 Really like it when he's such a friend 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.720
 something so simple so either must 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.440
 completely ill from the colors and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.910
 shape 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.780
 or just really bad and I finds 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.770
 then at the beginning actually already 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.190
 really bad that actually completely 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.990
 cool 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.419
 So it has a little accent here 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.919
 call these integrate with these 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.140
 Can you see that I do not know 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.130
 this one does not know how to call it that 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.230
 again I do not know me that way 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.240
 that's just when it's up here 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.550
 Axis through brad, so to speak , that comes through 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.900
 is now relative, I still remember 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.210
 not even what you call it but it is 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.250
 keep relatively flat that is it now so 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.690
 for those profi people now too 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.250
 someday want to borrow with sauce or 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.500
 so maybe not for it now 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.430
 necessarily the best board's just me 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.290
 sin city cruiser thing 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.120
 I am very very very much in any case 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.320
 happy with me with adi and soon had 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.970
 already driven through the area and 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.400
 It was really really fun 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.510
 that was a little longboard video, yes 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.070
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.870
 we'll definitely go over it again 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.910
 longboards remmel 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.870
 that 's because rumble in those together 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.040
 maybe make or even on the 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.540
 board if we can 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.100
 sometime karama cameraman will find the 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.360
 maybe then on logport can drive 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.530
 must she have us then maybe film 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.760
 if we do not know that one 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.840
 Let's see if you see that well 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.590
 write in any case in the 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.300
 Comments 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.770
 Gives the thumb up when you the whole 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.330
 like and write her the comments 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.440
 what she thinks about longboards and 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.880
 maybe soon a longboard too 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.890
 want to buy or if he wants this whole 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.020
 hype almost ridiculous finds that 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.070
 Just times I almost feel like it 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.270
 everyone a longboard like that and it does though 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.680
 also just a lot of fun 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.970
 just write your opinion in the 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.650
 comments that was a very short video 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.650
 I have since fallen and
