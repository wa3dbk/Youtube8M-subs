 print the necklace template that 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.730
 you will find in the link that I attached in

 fold the piece of cloth in half I 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.060
 I have used broken white leatherette but 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.460
 you can use felt too 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.410
 place the template on the fabric 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.130
 bent 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.890
 [Music] 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.950
 it is important that one side of the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.310
 template perfectly matches the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.770
 fold the fabric 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.770
 Place pins to hold the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.140
 template to the fabric with a marker or 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 With Tailor's Soap, go over all the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 outline of the template 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.409
 cut all the contour where we have 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 marked

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.420
 after this process the neck should remain 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.960
 well on the one hand open and for the rest 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.120
 closed now try taylor to see if 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.700
 it fits you well if you do not have to do 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.670
 small modifications open the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.550
 central opening or make another pattern a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.620
 slightly larger 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.660
 we begin to place the tacks 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.370
 first the smallest ones and we're going 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.370
 guiding the central circle 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.820
 first we put the tack and then 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.510
 with the pliers we close it by the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.330
 back side 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.480
 we do this until we complete a first

 good chao 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.740
 how that 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.290
 once the first circle of 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.750
 tacks let's start with the second 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.569
 we are guided by the first we have done 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.040
 to go placing the tacks pointed 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.250
 and in order

 [Music] 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.510
 we perform the same procedure 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.640
 first we nail the tack and then the 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.000
 We closed the back with the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.910
 pliers 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.490
 we already have the second circle 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.010
 and with the same procedure we are going to 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.450
 make as many circles as you want 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.450

 glue some loops on the ends of the
