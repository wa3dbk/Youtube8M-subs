00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Marca Toons Summer Video Series ... 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 From the previous sections ... 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.450
 Part 8: Not my city ... 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.000
 Mister, we have a problem ... 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 No, there is no debate, you have competed enough, everyone is equal now! 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.000
 Is everyone equal? Like in communism. 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 What are you talking about? No one competes, so everything is much worse. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Here is my week !!! 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 We learn from the story, because with the fuentealbilla this was done by the long closure ... 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 It is our sole responsibility to help him in some way. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
 You know, this is impossible. 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.650
 Why? We could tell him he's the fuentealbill. And we are - your family. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 What? Or Ramos is always just screaming, right? 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500
 No, in fact, this is a great idea, we'll be doing it right away. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Of course, of course, you can say anything, Ramos does everything ... What ??? 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.500
 Repeat the plan. Andres meets his father. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.200
 I'm here. 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.000
 And with her mother. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.000
 At your service. 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.000
 Then comes your grandfather ... 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.000
 If necessary... 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.800
 And with your grandmother. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 Iniesta Grandma! 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.600
 Any questions? 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.000
 Yes. You all gone crazy ?! 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 Listen and listen ... 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.900
 We arrived, now you can open your eyes and see your surprise! 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 Oóóó, Fuentealbilla, this is Fuentealbilla! 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.000
 Good afternoon, Andrés! 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.000
 Dad, are you talking about Catalan? 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.000
 No, but just like you, fenealealbill! 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.400
 Fuentealbillaiul? 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.000
 Your memory is not very good, we have our own special language. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 (((Speaks English))) 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.000
 I told your father to call Mom and Dad here. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800
 What kind of waka-waka? Are you crazy? Grandfather and grandmother! 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.500
 I hope we get a lot of this ... 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Welcome to Fuentealbill !!! 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.300
 I really don't have a good memory, I remembered them differently. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.200
 Sometimes the memory excels as judges do with Barça. 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 What??? 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.000
 This is fuentealbillai, no matter what it means! 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.500
 Papa, the wig ... 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 I wouldn't be so beautiful with that. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 Is there a problem with the hair? 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.000
 Valdés? 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.000
 No, he is not Valdés, he is our best friend. 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.400
 Ahaaa ... 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.500
 We always say how similar it is to Barça's goalkeeper. 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.900
 Really, how are you, granny? 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Iniesta Grandma !!! 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.500
 It's terrible! We would all do better ... 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.000
 Okay, it's not real, it's just a play. 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.000
 What are you talking about, Mom? That's Fuentealbilla. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.800
 This is Fuentealbilla and ready !!! Head to party! 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.500
 This is Fuentealbilla !!! Where everything is surrounded by great happiness. 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.700
 Fuentealbilla !!! Happiness... 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.300
