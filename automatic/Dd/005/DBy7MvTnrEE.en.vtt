about cobia fishing we going fishing no
matter<00:04:33.300> what<00:04:33.569> the<00:04:33.719> tide<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.409> but<00:04:34.949> but<00:04:35.580> there

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
matter what the tide is but but there

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.850 
matter what the tide is but but there
are<00:04:35.879> some<00:04:36.270> places<00:04:36.539> that<00:04:36.780> different<00:04:37.289> tides<00:04:37.500> may

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
are some places that different tides may

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.619 
are some places that different tides may
be<00:04:37.919> better<00:04:38.250> right<00:04:38.580> now<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:38.879> think<00:04:39.300> around<00:04:39.509> the

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
be better right now I think around the

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.330 
be better right now I think around the
inlets<00:04:40.020> on<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.259> outside<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.830> inlets<00:04:41.129> with

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
this warm water coming out there's going

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.899 
this warm water coming out there's going
to<00:04:43.319> be<00:04:43.379> some<00:04:43.560> real<00:04:43.770> good<00:04:43.919> tide<00:04:44.189> lines<00:04:44.520> where

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
to be some real good tide lines where

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.850 
to be some real good tide lines where
the<00:04:45.030> waters<00:04:45.389> actually<00:04:45.629> almost<00:04:46.020> 70<00:04:46.530> degrees

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
the waters actually almost 70 degrees

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.050 
the waters actually almost 70 degrees
inside<00:04:47.400> them

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
inside them

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.779 
inside them
typically<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.050> like<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.620> like<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.129> water<00:04:50.310> moving

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
typically I like I like the water moving

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.990 
typically I like I like the water moving
a<00:04:50.849> little<00:04:51.030> bit<00:04:51.300> within<00:04:52.139> a<00:04:52.379> couple<00:04:52.590> hours<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:53.370> of

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
just strongest not to make a double line

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.610

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.540 
double line to a piece of crank one
leader<00:06:40.720> and<00:06:41.590> what<00:06:41.710> we<00:06:41.800> do<00:06:41.920> we<00:06:42.070> got<00:06:42.220> the<00:06:42.370> loop

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
leader and what we do we got the loop

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.170 
leader and what we do we got the loop
here<00:06:42.850> we<00:06:43.600> go<00:06:43.750> up<00:06:44.020> with<00:06:44.230> de<00:06:44.380> mono<00:06:44.590> and<00:06:45.030> wrap<00:06:46.030> it

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
here we go up with de mono and wrap it

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.430 
here we go up with de mono and wrap it
around<00:06:46.270> just<00:06:46.540> like<00:06:46.810> you're<00:06:46.990> going<00:06:47.170> around<00:06:47.350> a

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
barber pole three four times and then

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.980 
barber pole three four times and then
fold<00:06:51.160> it<00:06:51.340> back<00:06:51.550> still<00:06:52.210> wrapping<00:06:52.660> the<00:06:52.750> same

fold it back still wrapping the same

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.410 
fold it back still wrapping the same
direction<00:06:53.350> just<00:06:54.280> wrap<00:06:54.490> back<00:06:54.730> down<00:06:55.000> to<00:06:55.270> the

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
direction just wrap back down to the

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.720 
direction just wrap back down to the
loop<00:06:55.600> three<00:06:55.930> or<00:06:56.020> four<00:06:56.170> times<00:06:56.380> and<00:06:56.860> then<00:06:57.550> you

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
loop three or four times and then you

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.880 
loop three or four times and then you
take<00:06:57.910> the<00:06:58.030> tag<00:06:58.270> in<00:06:58.600> you<00:06:59.350> just<00:06:59.410> take<00:06:59.620> it<00:06:59.740> back

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
take the tag in you just take it back

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.000 
take the tag in you just take it back
through<00:07:00.190> the<00:07:00.250> loop<00:07:00.420> okay<00:07:01.420> so<00:07:02.110> all<00:07:02.320> we<00:07:02.350> did<00:07:02.680> is

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
through the loop okay so all we did is

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.280 
through the loop okay so all we did is
we<00:07:03.190> went<00:07:03.340> up<00:07:03.550> wrapped<00:07:04.120> it<00:07:04.270> around<00:07:04.360> folded<00:07:05.170> it

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
we went up wrapped it around folded it

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.170 
we went up wrapped it around folded it
back<00:07:05.500> and<00:07:06.040> went<00:07:06.190> back<00:07:06.370> through<00:07:06.640> the<00:07:06.730> loop<00:07:06.910> to

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
back and went back through the loop to

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.990 
back and went back through the loop to
tighten<00:07:07.840> it<00:07:07.960> up<00:07:08.080> the<00:07:08.710> only<00:07:09.010> thing<00:07:09.220> you<00:07:09.340> pull<00:07:09.610> is

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
tighten it up the only thing you pull is

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.960 
tighten it up the only thing you pull is
the<00:07:10.810> standing<00:07:11.350> line<00:07:11.530> you<00:07:11.860> don't<00:07:12.130> pull<00:07:12.460> the<00:07:12.730> tag

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
the standing line you don't pull the tag

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.960 
the standing line you don't pull the tag
in<00:07:13.330> and<00:07:13.660> put<00:07:14.500> in<00:07:14.740> and<00:07:15.010> the<00:07:15.160> key<00:07:15.400> to<00:07:15.640> it<00:07:15.670> is<00:07:15.910> you

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:15.970 
in and put in and the key to it is you

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.720 
in and put in and the key to it is you
got<00:07:16.210> to<00:07:16.300> get<00:07:16.390> it<00:07:16.510> really<00:07:16.960> really<00:07:17.200> tight<00:07:17.730> you

got to get it really really tight you

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.450 
got to get it really really tight you
can<00:07:18.910> snip<00:07:19.240> the<00:07:19.390> tag<00:07:19.660> really<00:07:20.200> flush<00:07:20.500> and<00:07:20.830> it's<00:07:21.370> a
