00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.220
 hello everyone is written when we 

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.890
 ends up with a new tutorial that 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.570
 is to make the licorice wave the 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.220
 rings licorice earrings 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.360
 So I had moderate so smart 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.030
 if they are small enough 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.430
 it's normal then to start the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.670
 material we are going to need an object 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.630
 cutting edge of a painting stand 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:36.110
 black number nine exclusions accompanied 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:38.270
 this is new to see 6 1 9 2 x n a 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.880
 not done and so when I 'm going to say the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.570
 black building then to start 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.520
 mark the paw well and in no way make a 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.120
 round 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.980
 so we global is losing the ball on 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.980
 just make a pretty regular sausage 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.370
 finally little auriel I will repeat and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:05.569
 many times regular you 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:08.749
 do not worry I do not use the 

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:11.600
 firstly only non schengen then 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:13.399
 as I want to do this is quite thick 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 not for me it's for my mom so 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.590
 like alan budd is pretty thick I 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.810
 do I have I passed you a number 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.209
 that's it gives me social so I 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.279
 take my sharp object and I come 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.279
 cut roughly 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:43.539
 go 6 cm we will say good after of course 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:46.079
 you do not have to measure the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:57.630
 strokes came over six skits 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:57.630
 so here I am cutting 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.120
 and tomorrow I take my midem boss 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.070
 will serve for the second I put it of 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.490
 side 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.660
 I take my boyfriend and I take them 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.930
 have put it next like this 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 and so as I put them aside 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.230
 it will give me the idea of licorice 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.440
 so as you know the licorice one 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.930
 trick in the middle so that's a pretty 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.640
 beautiful effect is after I guarantee you 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.760
 no more no creator haribo in 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.300
 account at my game why are you presenting 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.760
 so things are so normally 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.459
 you come to make a s like that s 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.050
 but me as my mother angst of enough 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.680
 big and I did not take enough low I 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.610
 I will not make the buzz 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.790
 I 'm just rolled up 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.790
 my paw 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:08.690
 so here we call well a liquorice 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:14.840
 that's actually in fimo so we have the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.730
 hollow and we left the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.620
 stops simply slip then 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.360
 flatten and not the edges need 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.930
 to leave right as an i of 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.970
 licorice 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.620
 normal so they can very well 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.510

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.400
