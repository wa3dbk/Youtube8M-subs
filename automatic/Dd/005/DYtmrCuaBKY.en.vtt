00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:06.609
 hello aw is de we have today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.320
 alleged iphone 6 there for me 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.700
 we got that leaked out 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.559
 and sonja always up to now always 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.630
 reliable Chinese sources and 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.940
 yes he should be so 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.430
 the dummy of iphone 6 where we all 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.030
 wait and you see a lot 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.160
 done 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.880
 the buttons are no longer round like when 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.350
 iphone 5 5 it's oblong and on 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.400
 and the power button is now on too 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.070
 the side slipped 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.800
 Of course, the whole thing weighs dummy 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.560
 so much flatter elegant has so 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.180
 a bit of an ipod touch feeling 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.290
 is very good in my industry because 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.900
 I have very big hands that is for 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.180
 me actually perfect and you see the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.710
 Camera is still on the back 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.990
 place where she was before the lightning is 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.760
 again , just such a one 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.650
 no longer flash this elongated 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.579
 double lightning does like the iphone 5 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.670
 So something was done 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.700
 and yes, here you see the comparison 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 iphone 5 it is supposed to be iphone 6 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.320
 so much bigger 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.399
 bigger and, as I said, even shallower now 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.159
 a short comparison is one 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.060
 samsung galaxy s 5 is almost as big as 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.370
 five is a little bit bigger 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.340
 that's just six companies left 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.820
 HTC makes the latest generation 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.350
 currently bigger 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.610
 So far, I think has apple 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 actually found quite good middle way 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.260
 this is not the biggest smartphone and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.540
 however, significantly larger than the iphone 5 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.750
 I think it's great for me personally 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.400
 so now in the comparison of the thick 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.159
 could again look 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.960
 the iphone 6 is so much thinner 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.150
 as the iphone 5s and i think so too 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.780
 Whole pieces thinner than the Samsung 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.140
 galaxy s 5 and the htc evo 8 so 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.400
 more clearly distinguished the iphone 6 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.939
 actually makes a very good 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.460
 figure 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.280
 and I think the iPhone 5 sees it 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.619
 it's almost the agony anyway 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.080
 except there so somehow in direct 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.820
 i have to say i have the iphone 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.200
 6 in any case what and will 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.130
 I certainly have his call 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.020
 I'm looking forward to it anyway 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.540
 with high pressure on it where I now this 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.340
 Keep it in your hands and you 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.700
 you see again once from 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.379
 its the iphone 6 as said above 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.090
 weird lines because I still believe that 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.319
 so design history is different afterwards 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.940
 so it will be, I think 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.620
 not looking like that would surprise me 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.870
 if apple translates this design so 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.090
 the actual notches still or 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.110
 We'll see what happens eventually 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.120
 Of course the screen is too 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.120
 significantly larger 4.7 inches 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 do you expect that with the touch hd sensor 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.030
 will of course be the iphone 6 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.099
 be present and it is excellent 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.769
 in my hand at least so for small 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.620
 certainly not hands and you see 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.970
 Now again, of course, yes of course 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.130
 we also have matching height of course 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.630
 for matching cases that is synonymous 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.370
 funny we compare a dummy with 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.560
 alleged heights, of course, is natural 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.910
 everything a bit a bit like this 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.530
 shot the wind but yes well 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.970
 at least in the caves we have 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.560
 fits our gut outstanding the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.819
 insofar as the probability is 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.920
 that's exactly how it's going to get, and me 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.910
 Hope you had the first impression of 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.799
 iphone 6 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.799
 nice that you were here to see you soon ciao
