the lower and this is up
that's<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:53.750> so<00:04:54.770> it's<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.830> quick<00:04:56.009> video<00:04:56.370> on<00:04:56.699> how

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
that's it so it's a quick video on how

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.909 
that's it so it's a quick video on how
to<00:04:57.660> do<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.050> it's<00:04:58.229> real<00:04:58.440> simple<00:04:59.389> matter<00:05:00.389> of<00:05:00.509> fact

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
to do it it's real simple matter of fact

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.710 
to do it it's real simple matter of fact
just<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.310> we're<00:05:02.460> doing<00:05:02.580> this<00:05:02.789> real<00:05:03.060> time

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.960 

we<00:05:06.720> try<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.020> do<00:05:07.229> things<00:05:07.470> real-time<00:05:08.190> because<00:05:08.789> we

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
we try to do things real-time because we

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.920 
we try to do things real-time because we
want<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.680> we<00:05:10.680> want<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.979> show<00:05:11.630> what's<00:05:12.630> really
