00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:17.090
we've tested the new colorado in just
about every conceivable way but now we

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:26.780
get a 2015 v6 four-by-four Z71 and we
get to take it off-road all total this

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.580
truck right here just under 38 thousand
dollars so that's not cheap by any

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.449
stretch but you get a lot for that so
let's take a look get a unique

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.170
blacked-out grille you get to massive
tow hooks off the front z71 suspension

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.690
is unique so you get unique springs and
unique shocks and you get bigger wheels

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.389
and tires and a more aggressive tread on
the tires themselves underneath extra

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:58.010
skidplate eating in the rear you get the
extra stickers that identified as the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.430
z71 off-road package and standard is a
rear locking differential the g18 which

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.020
is kind of a mix between a limited-slip
differential and an automatic locking

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.159
differential but none of this means
anything if it doesn't perform well

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.350
off-road let's see how it does 71
off-road package has always been a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.700
favorite of ours but on that on the
chevy colorado it's just a trim package

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.320
so you can get it in two-wheel drive or
four-wheel drive and it's supposed to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.399
appeal to those people who want to be a
little more adventurous take their truck

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.340
off road and you can certainly have fun
with the we're having a lot of fun with

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.340
right now getting a little bit of hair
here and there but this the most

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.990
aggressive off-road package out there is
still the exact same transfer case 272

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.609
one low range

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.459
tires are about the same size as they
are on the other suspension packages so

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.420
there's nothing really unique about the
suspension other than the shocks and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.179
springs are tuned a little bit
differently so is there room to improve

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.380
absolutely is this package fun also

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.780
absolutely we hope we in fact we just
heard about the trail boss package

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.250
that's coming out we hope maybe that
becomes a little more aggressive and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.360
maybe even a zr2 who knows maybe that
will come out a little bit later as well

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.400
and provide a much more aggressive maybe
a lifted bigger wheels and tires and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.950
we'll have to see

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.610
so there you have it chevy colorado z71
off-road package a very fun truck to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.670
drive but still has some room for
improvement

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.269
