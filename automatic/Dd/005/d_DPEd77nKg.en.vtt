00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:03.740
 thanks color apc 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 the newspaper the decree 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.009
 6 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.900
 go to see if the rural 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.079
 Melon production 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.499
 it is a reality that in Paraguay 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.230
 we have several times very good 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 such is it that there is poetry is to export to germany 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.699
 and the melon holds the freight 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.699
 but we have to learn to produce high quality varieties with techniques 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.699
 how he teaches us the parakeets 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.810
 when making the opinion that 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.630
 begin to develop the secondary frames today the tightness 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.160
 when you are developing 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.210
 the four lateral or secondary branches are selected maybe someone 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.410
 between the second and that this world success 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.720
 which 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.620
 since then they are as 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 uniforms and litigated roses 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.710
 each of the lateral or secondary branches 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.600
 they will go vÃ­ctor opted until the knot number 9 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.630
 two 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.900
 yes 6 7 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.000
 l 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200
 10 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.270
 from minute number 10 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.470
 tertiary buds are left where the fruits will be located 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.320
 for each tertiary branch 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.620
 approximately 2 to three products will be developed 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.770
 of which we must leave the best of them 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.340
 eliminating the others 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.730
 Once the fruit of this branch has been selected, it is cut off in the same 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.379
 let's buy here 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:18.099
 of the work done will not be two fruits for each secondary branch 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.389
 if possible in interspersed cars 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.409
 for example 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.629
 without us 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.399
 a product in knot number 10 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:34.239
 the following dictate it in the world number 12 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.549
 the definitive breakdown of the secondary branch takes place in the world 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.549
 number 25 approximately 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.909
 If the plant is healthy and vigorous 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.219
 you can leave a product and knots number 17 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.279
 18 and with 19 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.279
 those that would be fruits pretends to be a star 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:19.019
 the ces 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.839
 c 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.839
 18 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.499
 It's important to remember 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.109
 that we must make frequent monitoring of the crop 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.419
 before doing any grocery store session 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.589
 either 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.219
 for diseases 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.229
 review 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:50.209
 some of the plates that are frequently found are the leaf uruca 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.679
 that especially attacks the protests and in severe cases the fruit 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:57.649
 and the girl 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:02.119
 that feeds on the leaves by scraping the tissues and the pistil of the city 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.759
 in case of need to spray with insecticides 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.639
 it is advisable to do it in the afternoon 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.370
 to avoid damage to bees 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.289
 those that play an important role 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.469
 in pollination 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:30.469
 of this item 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.129
 it is important to remember here for each plant four branches will be dedicated 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.529
 lateral or secondary 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.529
 Each one explains the products 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.610
 says so 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.069
 that you have eight fruits for each plant 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.610
 three were of very good production both in size and quality 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.759
 it should be noted 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.159
 specific cultural care is required 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.509
 as they are 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.279
 I found 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.460
 I put it 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.460
 and the driving 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.990
 the melon 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.630
 It is one of the most appreciated fruits by consumers of all levels of 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.729
 our population 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:17.930
 so it counts 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.439
 with a secure market at the national level 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.439
 and even international 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.949
 percent 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.169
 flat phelps 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.139
