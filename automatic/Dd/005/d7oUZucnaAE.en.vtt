 the framework of this agreement we have 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 privileged the training component because 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.949
 our wish is to allow this 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.390
 that our agents can now 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.880
 have a fairly adequate training 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.939
 since we are talking about science in

 speaking of evolution in the field of 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.830
 sea ​​fishing is therefore the objective of 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.740
 this ecology is to prevail 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.890

 under and we think it's so 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.000
 concerted that we can fight 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 this fishing there because we did 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.590
 the finding that pirate ships without 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.170
 means of having fishing licenses 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.659
 come fishing in the waters and with 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
 this agreement we go into force and to whom 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.520

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.560
 fifth freedom so that together we 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.410

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.650
