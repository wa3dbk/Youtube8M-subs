00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510
 gas 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.420
 how many times do we hear from the 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.099
 damage of salt, the most common is that 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.289
 doctors suggest reducing the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.509
 consumption of it because its intake 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.059
 excessive can cause hypertension 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.550
 an important risk factor for 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.290
 heart disease more rarely 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.110
 we hear about the fact that the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.660
 consumption of sugar can be even more 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.030
 harmful to our body with 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.400
 16 calories per teaspoon that bad 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.280
 can sugar make us sugar is 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.830
 an extremely addictive substance both 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.690
 like drugs and actually provokes 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.420
 havoc in the body 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.239
 in fact the refined white sugar that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.850
 the most we eat every day is 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.939
 artificially synthesized sucrose 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.920
 that does not contain vitamins or 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.950
 minerals that your body needs to 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 process it in addition in its process 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.990
 refined and bleached acid is used 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.360
 sulfuric so the sugar can 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.850
 contain sulfur residues ovi 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.650
 sulfites an analysis of two studies 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.140
 on the subject made at the institute 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.290
 of Health of Kansas in the USA 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.370
 found that consuming 74 grams or its 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.900
 equivalent 14 teaspoons a day 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.880
 considerably increases the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.000
 possibility of suffering blood pressure 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.160
 high if we consume sugar our 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.740
 immune system weakens during 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.960
 6 hours time in which we are 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.470
 extremely vulnerable to germs 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.020
 harmful viruses and bacteria besides you 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.640
 I have news sugar consumption makes 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.070
 reduce the desire to eat 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.560
 nutritious foods like vegetables 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.020
 which does not result in an important 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.149
 nutritional deficiency according to the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.340
 report people whose diet has the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.890
 minus 25 percent of calories 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.410
 coming from sugar have almost the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.810
 triple the risk of dying from an event 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.820
 cardiovascular than those people who 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.830
 have a diet with less than 10 per 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.200
 percent of calories from the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.239
 sugar too much sugar in a diet 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.030
 can also contribute to training 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.920
 from caries to obesity as well as 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.019
 difficulty controlling diabetes 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.940
 type 2 higher levels of

 triglycerides cancer candidiasis eczema 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.530
 premenstrual the serious problem is that the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.050
 sugar intake is not limited to the one that 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.569
 is added when cooking on the table but 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.390
 there are many different foods that 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.180
 the so disguised by containing 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.690
 example the 600 milliliter soda 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.780
 contains 65 grams of sugar that is 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.720
 about 12 tablespoons of sugar a bar 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.540
 of granola contains 23 grams a bar 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.890
 of cinnamon reaches up to 55 grams of 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.470
 sugar and a cup of cereal 25 grams the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.500
 solution is not to replace the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.690
 sugar for artificial sweeteners the 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.209
 Sweetener called sucralose is sugar 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.180
 chlorinated and therefore presents many of 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.120
 the risks of chlorine so dioxins 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.549
 are a byproduct of this processing that 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.510
 it is no more than a carcinogen a 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:33.230
 super powerful more than the DDT you sweeten 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.510
 and his coffee with DDT saccharin also 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.690
 is a carcinogen that was banned ago 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.190
 years in many countries aspartame is 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.180
 in light refreshments 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.890
 It is a successful toxin and a neurotoxic 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.410
 whose harmful effects are the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.420
 Parkinson's and Alzheimer 's development 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.690
 tumors in the brain of epilepsy 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.270
 diabetes fibromyalgia and also migraines 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.700
 and leukemia if you can not live flat 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.220
 no sweet taste seeks other sweeteners 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.070
 like honey but also treats 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.900
 to regulate your consumption remember that everything 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.300
 Too much can be harmful 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.330
 for your body and that regulate 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.900
 amounts will always be another way of
