00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello your seedlings welcome 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.680
 to a new race track we stand 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.510
 again at the golf course steel and this time 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.089
 Let's look at the gold competition path 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.440
 look the other way and you can 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.720
 namely riding the other way explained 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.080
 we just eva and then we start 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.359
 that me the stall and let's go there 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 in the back we go directly to more us 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 but can not go through here 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 Attention we have to ride out 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.390
 Otherwise we get the flag here 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.610
 not with and here not here 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 Let's not jump over it belgian 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.180
 again as close as possible and then 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 right here here too 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 you can hang around here relatively close 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.030
 turn left a bit 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.469
 you look that easy now 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.210
 something bad here by the bush 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 through then we can abbreviate here and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.620
 Here we can also by caution 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.260
 because there is the fence on the jump 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.640
 we have to go out the other side here 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.570
 you can jump around to the outside 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.950
 it all costs too much time here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.270
 everything is a bit biased 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.920
 so that you are already in the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.439
 right direction for the more 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.210
 that's what saves you everything 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.210
 Tiny little bit of time 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.340
 Green hunt r is doing really well 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.340
 just 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.110
 yes we jump again we have it 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.490
 Already almost done 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.290
 we do not miss much now 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.930
 here only the passage the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.040
 final passage here over the fences resp 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.040
 between the witnesses through so and yet 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.610
 Over the wall very well and that was it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.560
 already 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.170
 So I can 4 here with you 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.120
 do not show very much 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.010
 It does not give any abbreviations 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.780
 I hope I could still do so 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.230
 help a bit with the leadership 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.300
 and next time next Friday 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.770
 let's see with the pony track 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.140
 wait at least from her statinen times 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.690
 pony track with the track back there 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.220
 on the paddock again and that is 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.200
 exciting because that is because 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.610
 Do not look what we're doing there 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.540
 so you get to love 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.540
 next race track
