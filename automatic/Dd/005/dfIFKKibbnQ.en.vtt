class<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.980> use<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.400> class<00:00:17.699> even<00:00:17.970> though<00:00:18.090> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
class I use this class even though I

class I use this class even though I
have<00:00:18.330> other<00:00:18.510> stuff<00:00:18.810> unlocked<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.529> still

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830

a great overall SMG it's pretty good at

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
a great overall SMG it's pretty good at
range<00:00:54.629> has<00:00:54.960> minimal<00:00:55.469> recoil<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.520> it's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
range has minimal recoil you know it's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.240 
range has minimal recoil you know it's
not<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.480> doesn't<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.930> zero<00:00:58.230> recoil<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:59.039> it's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
not it doesn't have zero recoil but it's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
not it doesn't have zero recoil but it's
it<00:00:59.489> doesn't<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.539> recoil<00:01:00.840> at

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it doesn't really have much recoil at

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.290 
it doesn't really have much recoil at
all<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.460> enjoy<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.910> gun<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> has

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
all so I really do enjoy this gun it has

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
all so I really do enjoy this gun it has
a<00:01:03.449> huge<00:01:03.840> clip<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.350> pretty<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.739> its<00:01:04.979> main

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
a huge clip that's pretty much its main

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
a huge clip that's pretty much its main
asset<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.720> really<00:01:06.840> need

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
asset and you don't really need

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
asset and you don't really need
scavenger<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.740> anything<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.369> because

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
scavenger or anything like that because

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
scavenger or anything like that because
it<00:01:09.030> already<00:01:09.150> has<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> lot<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> ammo<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.170> has<00:01:10.260> 50

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it already has a lot of ammo it has 50

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.310 
it already has a lot of ammo it has 50
bullets<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:12.210> clip<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
bullets in one clip so I think it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.780 
bullets in one clip so I think it's
really<00:01:13.650> great<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.280> overall<00:01:14.580> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
really great and it's overall really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.370 
really great and it's overall really
good<00:01:14.880> starting<00:01:15.330> weapon<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.780> attachments

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

killing power even at a medium range so

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000 
killing power even at a medium range so
you<00:02:48.569> know<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:48.989> pretty<00:02:49.110> versatile<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.769> would

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.350 
say for an SMG now the score streets is
something<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.440> very<00:02:52.580> very<00:02:53.580> important

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
something that is very very important

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.759

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
understand the hotspots and etc and you

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.949 
understand the hotspots and etc and you
wave<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.060> will<00:03:33.180> kind<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.450> help<00:03:33.540> with<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
wave you will kind of help with that the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.490 
wave you will kind of help with that the
hunter<00:03:34.530> killer<00:03:34.739> drone<00:03:34.829> is<00:03:35.160> really<00:03:35.670> really<00:03:35.850> low

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
hunter killer drone is really really low

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.560 
hunter killer drone is really really low
really<00:03:37.500> Lopes<00:03:37.739> gore<00:03:38.340> shriek<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.940> lock<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
really Lopes gore shriek to a lock so it

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.940 
really Lopes gore shriek to a lock so it
doesn't<00:03:39.810> take<00:03:39.930> many<00:03:40.049> points<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.769> is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
doesn't take many points but it is

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.400 
doesn't take many points but it is
pretty<00:03:41.609> effective<00:03:41.730> it's<00:03:42.329> not<00:03:42.570> it's<00:03:43.079> not<00:03:43.230> going

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
pretty effective it's not it's not going

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.229 
pretty effective it's not it's not going
to<00:03:43.470> get<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.739> whole<00:03:43.980> bunch<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.310> kills<00:03:44.549> but

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
to get you a whole bunch of kills but

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.330 
to get you a whole bunch of kills but
the<00:03:45.269> reason<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:46.650> lower<00:03:46.890> level

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
the reason I like it for lower level

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.699 
the reason I like it for lower level
people<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.910> because<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.049> use<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.500> get

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
people is because you can use it to get

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.110 
people is because you can use it to get
to<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.190> lightning<00:03:50.609> strike<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.060> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
to the lightning strike and the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.400 
to the lightning strike and the
lightning<00:03:51.450> strike<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.780> going<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.049> be<00:03:52.140> pretty

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
lightning strike is going to be pretty

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.560 
lightning strike is going to be pretty
much<00:03:52.470> your<00:03:53.100> main<00:03:53.340> source<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.820> kills<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.420> this

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
much your main source of kills in this

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.400 
much your main source of kills in this
class<00:03:54.870> aside<00:03:55.260> from<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.590> gun<00:03:55.769> obviously<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
class aside from your gun obviously and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.170 
class aside from your gun obviously and
yeah<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:58.650> it's<00:03:58.799> they<00:03:59.370> pretty<00:03:59.609> much<00:03:59.790> stack

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
yeah so it's they pretty much stack

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.849 
yeah so it's they pretty much stack
pretty<00:04:00.780> well<00:04:01.019> together<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.680> definitely

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
pretty well together and I definitely

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.319 
pretty well together and I definitely
recommend<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.549> low<00:04:02.700> kill<00:04:02.910> shrieks<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.269> know

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
recommend the low kill shrieks I know

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.410 
recommend the low kill shrieks I know
some<00:04:04.140> people<00:04:04.410> tend<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.769> think<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.090> even<00:04:06.090> as<00:04:06.390> a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
some people tend to think that even as a

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.270 
some people tend to think that even as a
noob<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.900> want<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.380> run<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.739> higher<00:04:07.950> kill

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
noob you want to run the higher kill

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.319 
noob you want to run the higher kill
streaks<00:04:08.519> but<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.700> disagree<00:04:09.060> with<00:04:09.209> that

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
streaks but I disagree with that

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.170 
streaks but I disagree with that
mentality<00:04:10.049> because<00:04:10.200> if<00:04:10.560> you're<00:04:11.040> not<00:04:11.400> getting

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
mentality because if you're not getting

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.120 
mentality because if you're not getting
the<00:04:12.510> kill<00:04:13.019> streets<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.440> higher<00:04:13.620> kill<00:04:13.920> streaks

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
the kill streets the higher kill streaks

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.550 
the kill streets the higher kill streaks
consistently<00:04:14.819> you'd<00:04:15.750> probably<00:04:15.989> be<00:04:16.260> doing

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
consistently you'd probably be doing

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.500 
consistently you'd probably be doing
better<00:04:16.680> with<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.430> lower<00:04:17.760> kill<00:04:18.030> streaks<00:04:18.299> and

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
better with the lower kill streaks and

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.849 
better with the lower kill streaks and
you<00:04:18.570> can<00:04:18.690> stack<00:04:18.900> them<00:04:19.079> over<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.560> over<00:04:19.739> again

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
you can stack them over and over again

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.279 
you can stack them over and over again
if<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.280> do<00:04:20.760> get<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> higher<00:04:21.690> kill<00:04:22.019> streak

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
if you do get on a higher kill streak

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.810 
if you do get on a higher kill streak
and<00:04:22.560> it'll<00:04:22.740> probably<00:04:22.890> net<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.340> more<00:04:23.550> kills

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
and it'll probably net you more kills

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.460 
and it'll probably net you more kills
overall<00:04:24.419> unless<00:04:24.690> you're<00:04:24.870> really<00:04:25.050> really<00:04:25.200> good

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
overall unless you're really really good

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.110 
overall unless you're really really good
at<00:04:25.620> getting<00:04:25.710> those<00:04:25.979> hired<00:04:26.220> kill<00:04:26.460> streaks<00:04:26.729> so<00:04:26.940> I

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
at getting those hired kill streaks so I

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.620 
at getting those hired kill streaks so I
definitely

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
definitely

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.120 
definitely
recommend<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.350> it's<00:04:28.440> not<00:04:28.590> bad<00:04:28.890> by<00:04:29.100> any

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
recommend this and it's not bad by any

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.340 
recommend this and it's not bad by any
means<00:04:29.610> once<00:04:29.910> again<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.140> called

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
means once again I know this is called

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.320 
means once again I know this is called
the<00:04:31.500> best<00:04:31.680> noob<00:04:32.100> class<00:04:32.490> set<00:04:32.760> up<00:04:32.880> but<00:04:33.090> just

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
the best noob class set up but just

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.910 
the best noob class set up but just
because<00:04:33.450> you're<00:04:34.170> not<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.440> noob

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
because you're not a noob

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.590 
because you're not a noob
maybe<00:04:35.100> you're<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:35.670> know<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:36.000> pretty<00:04:36.360> good

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
maybe you're you know a pretty good

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.450 
maybe you're you know a pretty good
player<00:04:36.870> but<00:04:37.170> you<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:37.830> haven't<00:04:38.070> figured<00:04:38.250> out

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
player but you just haven't figured out

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.040 
player but you just haven't figured out
that<00:04:38.700> class<00:04:38.970> setup<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.420> you<00:04:39.480> really<00:04:39.840> enjoy

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
that class setup that you really enjoy

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.360 
that class setup that you really enjoy
you<00:04:40.110> could<00:04:40.380> use<00:04:40.500> this<00:04:40.650> too<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:40.980> it<00:04:41.070> will<00:04:41.190> work

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
you could use this too and it will work

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.400 
you could use this too and it will work
just<00:04:41.430> as<00:04:41.760> well<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.240> yeah<00:04:42.450> as<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:43.290> was<00:04:43.320> saying

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
just as well and yeah as I was saying

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.710 
just as well and yeah as I was saying
once<00:04:44.250> again<00:04:44.520> about<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.880> scorestreaks<00:04:45.390> that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
once again about the scorestreaks that

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.180 
once again about the scorestreaks that
the<00:04:46.140> good<00:04:46.380> thing<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.770> they<00:04:47.160> really

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
the good thing is that they really

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.460 
the good thing is that they really
really<00:04:47.580> lead<00:04:48.090> up<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.270> each<00:04:48.510> other<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.110> UAV

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
really lead up to each other so the UAV

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.660 
really lead up to each other so the UAV
you<00:04:49.650> know<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.800> get<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.100> really<00:04:50.430> really<00:04:50.640> early

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
you know you get it really really early

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.030 
you know you get it really really early
and<00:04:51.120> pretty<00:04:51.840> much<00:04:52.020> when<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.320> call<00:04:52.500> in<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.680> UAV

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
and pretty much when you call in the UAV

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.830 
and pretty much when you call in the UAV
I'm<00:04:53.250> not<00:04:53.400> gonna<00:04:53.490> say<00:04:53.730> it's<00:04:53.910> guaranteed<00:04:54.300> but

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
I'm not gonna say it's guaranteed but

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.050 
I'm not gonna say it's guaranteed but
it's<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:55.860> pretty<00:04:56.160> good<00:04:56.370> chance<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:56.850> once

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
it's it is a pretty good chance so once

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.550 
it's it is a pretty good chance so once
you<00:04:57.150> get<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.450> UAV<00:04:57.840> you'll<00:04:57.990> be<00:04:58.140> able<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.380> pick

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
you get the UAV you'll be able to pick

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.560 
you get the UAV you'll be able to pick
off<00:04:58.770> enough<00:04:59.070> enemies<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.700> be<00:04:59.730> able<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.240> get<00:05:00.390> the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
off enough enemies to be able to get the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.390 
off enough enemies to be able to get the
hunter<00:05:00.840> killer<00:05:01.050> drone<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:02.100> hunter

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
hunter killer drone and the hunter

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.130 
hunter killer drone and the hunter
killer<00:05:02.580> drone<00:05:02.670> is<00:05:02.940> great<00:05:03.210> for<00:05:03.390> objective<00:05:03.870> play

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
killer drone is great for objective play

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.780 
killer drone is great for objective play
and<00:05:04.440> same<00:05:04.710> thing<00:05:04.740> with<00:05:04.890> a<00:05:05.010> lightning<00:05:05.400> strike

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
and same thing with a lightning strike

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.640 
and same thing with a lightning strike
you<00:05:06.060> can<00:05:06.210> pretty<00:05:06.360> much<00:05:06.450> us<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:07.170> know<00:05:07.260> throw

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
you can pretty much us you know throw

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.850 
you can pretty much us you know throw
them<00:05:07.940> towards<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.090> objective<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:09.870> usually

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
them towards the objective and usually

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.470 
them towards the objective and usually
it<00:05:10.950> does<00:05:11.100> pretty<00:05:11.340> well<00:05:11.430> at<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:12.240> point

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
it does pretty well at that point

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.480 
it does pretty well at that point
obviously<00:05:12.930> unless<00:05:13.770> if<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.130> enemies<00:05:14.460> are

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
obviously unless if the enemies are

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.980 
obviously unless if the enemies are
inside<00:05:15.000> or<00:05:15.180> whatever<00:05:15.330> but<00:05:15.600> even<00:05:15.840> then

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
inside or whatever but even then

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.690 
inside or whatever but even then
sometimes<00:05:16.290> a<00:05:16.530> hundred<00:05:16.650> drunky<00:05:17.160> kind<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.430> sneak

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
sometimes a hundred drunky kind of sneak

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.040 
sometimes a hundred drunky kind of sneak
in<00:05:17.880> there<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.300> they're<00:05:18.600> both<00:05:18.780> pretty

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
in there but they're both pretty

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.200 
in there but they're both pretty
versatile<00:05:19.650> scorestreaks<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.880> whole

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
versatile scorestreaks and this whole

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.030 
versatile scorestreaks and this whole
class<00:05:21.480> setup<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:21.960> pretty<00:05:22.110> versatile<00:05:22.650> which<00:05:22.920> is

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
class setup is pretty versatile which is

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.580 
class setup is pretty versatile which is
why<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.220> like<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:23.520> for<00:05:24.270> not<00:05:24.480> only<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.900> newer<00:05:25.110> new

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
why I like it for not only the newer new

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.530 
why I like it for not only the newer new
players<00:05:26.010> you<00:05:26.520> know<00:05:26.640> the<00:05:26.850> less<00:05:27.180> skilled

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
players you know the less skilled

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.630 
players you know the less skilled
