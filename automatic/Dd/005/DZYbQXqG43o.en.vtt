00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.950
 language about make up what we have that is 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.049
 when we will program our 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.840
 character 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.879
 when he speaks the language 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:07.140
 if we were to continue with us 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:13.569

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.910
 I think the character here is the most 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.979
 bones well this is for advanced 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.120
 more creators if you can call it that 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.080
