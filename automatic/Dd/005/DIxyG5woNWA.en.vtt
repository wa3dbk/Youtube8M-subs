00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.210
 hi my dear subscribers and viewers 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.980
 my channel actually we 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.199
 Today we will do to today 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.150
 pass and his strength will play with you 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.089
 and pass in the stone simulator 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.789
 Can you imagine no stone simulator helped 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.369
 something like that in English read 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.680
 actually listen to the general game 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.649
 just super 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 they say that such a very cheap game 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 you know especially if you play on when 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.660
 so to speak on hardcore here damn so 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.879
 Hard to go through and control here is 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.250
 well it is unrealistically difficult to do the same 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.829
 I'm trying to play somehow, but you see 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.230
 just flogged and 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.320
 percent of the game was okay at least 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.350
 somehow poke fun at the game or something 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.870
 so much so that it is necessary to tell that he wanted a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.840
 For the game in general, then the game is called 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.230
 stone simulator in the forest so you donâ€™t need 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.220
 do but just don't know sit down somehow 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:24.360
 in Turkish or something else 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 meditate to the sounds of nature under such 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.150
 such a little green grass which even 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.760
 through the texture of the stone texture passes 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.630
 even so actually the game 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.910
 done 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.180
 but honestly according to the schedule done 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.430
 not bad that's what about exactly 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.630
 physics in this game but as you can see 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.200
 completely absent 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.480
 and even a piece of stone hangs dumbly in the air 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.910
 in fact, as it is possible here 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.910
 make a first person view 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.720
 I do not know how can but on the right 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.020
 click we can look precisely from 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.540
 from the stone again clicking on the button 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.039
 we can see ourselves from the third 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.780
 face exactly our main character in this game 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.260
 he is very big such a mission 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.330
 he has to run here for ages 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.210
 before 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.900
 Well, actually, what else is a game 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:24.470
 made on the unity3d engine 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.710
 principle classic such an engine for 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.780
 here is such a game well, what else can 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.950
 to say a cloud in my opinion is not at all 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.460
 moving the sun too nothing 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.650
 moves but I want to say that yes the graphics 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.410
 not bad i have one i have 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.220
 the graphics attracted would be the point in this 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.110
 the game would be generally super in principle 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.840
 just done so I understood for a joke 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.209
 in general there is some say so versions 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.370
 this game that is there is not clear when 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.600
 main developer because not even 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.980
 let's say well such tags there even 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:08.420
 starting up companies there or just a nickname 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.770
 let's say the developers are not there just we 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.070
 click on the icon and she about packs here 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.500
 our game on this I think it will be possible and 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.360
 finish because well what else is there 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.870
 you can say just be a stone 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.190
 sit still where do not look where I am 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.910
 I think in principle it will not be so 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.900
 interesting 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.280
 actually this was all with you 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.440
