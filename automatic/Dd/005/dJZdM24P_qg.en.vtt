 Bremthal did not see this, I do not consider the board the operation 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.400
 So here we are doing the hidden Krista 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:14.949

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.070
 OK Klopp you wake up these two blocks is behind the track and really 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.400
 only with the diamonds 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.699
 then push through here 2 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.289
 Deller HG 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.289
 and set as these are the Christians 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.439
 visit 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.750
 what should come now hoping there 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 to the monument 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.910
 then next Switzerland percent there is a Top 5 and Eifert Heermann 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.320
 then via we have to stay outside but are allowed to be really happy 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.440
 by 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 the forward- meets percent 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.410
 free Streller abstentions again 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.650
 there we are already for the tenth time that is it will want to hear more often 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.890
 have a little time for the second button becomes bridges 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.890
 So that would be pretty quick then 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.610
 around 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
 thus delays defusing so for the substitution in my time he has 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 now here on the body of Thomas Leitert 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440
 Anka places were deeper 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 here a blocker continues so that the meeting is clarified 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.240
 so hard 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 BofA and body 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.940
 so can 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 KÃ¼lsheim 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.670
 so they can nominate in July 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.110
 Daria two pieces each team Chur 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.510
 once prevent so much suffering 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.380
 connect 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 whether my day 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.200
 the Christmas quite avoid here 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740
 we did not fit so to speak 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.799
 because he is the benches the little box you can sit two buttons 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.079
 a burglar will not put off 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.429
 what should I do with these 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.649
 should press no idea quickly 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.939
 So he should definitely take a long time to find out how it works 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.209
 going 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.209
 but we know that districts will compete this Sunday 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.989
 then quickly the box 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.079
 click on it 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.369
 because we only have a short time 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:33.459
 then we can access it among our stuff rusting so Henkel 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.599
 and now from Mediums for the Ammann 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.789
