00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.490
 hi yes laura sanchez and in this video 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.709
 I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 makeup is a super strong look very 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.810
 advisable mind for the night as 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.689
 to leave are fuchsia lips and eyes 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.230
 Super super dark as a trend I put 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.700
 rock 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.160
 so if you want to learn how to do this 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.869
 logically this video we will start 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 with something very basic that is the cream 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 moisturizer that we should always use 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.930
 always always me right now I'm 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.269
 using at 15 one of my creams 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 favorites now for the eyes we're going to 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.989
 do a concealer that is also going to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 serve as the basis for the shadows and for 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.400
 one everything we are going to put in the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.839
 eyes and we blur it with your finger now 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.479
 to catch this tone here that is from the 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.299
 big palette and I'll put it in everything 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.739
 the mobile eyelid and below the eyebrow 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.619
 now when using this on the blog track 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.809
 that super creamy also very good and what 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.309
 I'm going to put on the whole eyelid very green 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.860
 where is what is super traumatic and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.600
 it has to look very very black then 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.479
 if you do not like how this kind of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 Make then invites in this video 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.619
 let's put it also day in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 eyelashes on the bottom and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.340
 let's blur the edges milestones a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.120
 little bit in this part of waters today they use 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.760
 a washcloth 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.600
 wet to clean and perfect as 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.600
 the bottom part 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.540
 now let's use black shadow I'm 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 using blackout that is the same 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.000
 urban palette that is called here 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.580
 smart and we will be able to give 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.220
 little touches on the pencil we are 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.200
 we use as a base and we will blur the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 milestones to make it look like smoked 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400
 in the water part we are also going to 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.990
 put it and let's clean the shadow that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.830
 since on the cheekbones also with a 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.830
 damp cloth 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.689
 now let's do the eyebrows we're going to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.760
 comb them with a little brush and 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.650
 fill them with a pencil and brown shadow 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.270
 now let's put the sheet on the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.300
 correct to what they want to use if they use 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.680
 this sephora base in the most 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.110
 I clarify what I know I am using in 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.080
 this moment and I'm going to start blurring 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.520
 with my flat brush that is the one that most 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.520
 like to blur the base 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.140
 and that's how the makeup looks 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.000
 let's say ass on lips new looks 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.310
 super nice if they wanted to leave it until 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.020
 there but as I tell you I want what 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 more dramatic then good I go so 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.940
 first the water was used with powders 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.650
 loose the loose powder simply 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.590
 they will take away the shine and make us 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.780
 the base the base lasts much longer 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.100
 I'm using the secret by team now 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.900
 that I leave the link can not 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.420
 get and the lips I'm just going to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.970
 use a pencil student juan in guayas in 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.410
 Fuchsia and I'm going to fill in or I'm not going 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.530
 put my shine or anything because I want 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.320
 that matt effect that remains now let's 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.330
 use a newt exterior bronze and I'm going to 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.520
 put under the cheekbones to mark 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.890
 Faces of the face I will not use 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.630
 blush or anything because I do not want to give 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.130
 as more colors than there are already because it is 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.510
 enough with my eyes hair 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.880
 super black and fuchsia lips 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.250
 so I'm just going to mark the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.530
 Cheeks the bronzer is put under 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.980
 the cheekbones to be marked and 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.050
 this would be in finished makeup now 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.940

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.640

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.860
 to close the park does not bust 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.300
 being pointed upwards very 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.020
