00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello youtube friends here I have the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 xperia cited and with the new 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.990
 Android 5.1.1 update that finishes 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.609
 to leave on these dates and good the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.970
 compilation number is 23.4 point a 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:25.890
 point zero 546 and good the improvements that 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.819
 of the updates that he announced 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.460
 on the official page is improvements in what 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.320
 which is the volume and previously in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.989
 android version of lollipop is 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.539
 criticized the volume a lot because in 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.879
 question of music and videos the 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:45.109
 true that the volume was lousy it was very 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.910
 low and good many of the users 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.249
 They began asking good to them 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.409
 raise the volume for music or for 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:54.030
 the videos and in this update the 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.699
 truth is that it has been improved in question 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.949
 of the volume another of the things that are and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.109
 announces on the official page of the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.089
 improvements is in a matter of contacts 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.480
 the truth is that the application the 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.280
 there will be 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.550
 a tad faster than in the version 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 previous the truth that is not much the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.490
 difference but good this is what 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.190
 comes on the sony mobile page other 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.520
 of things is in the improvement of the approach 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.759
 automatic and in question the camera 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.220
 they are and announces that in the mode 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.330
 automatic to the photos focus more 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.420
 fast and with better quality and good other 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.660
 of the things that good are distinguished to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.210
 simple view and that question in what is 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:44.009
 the notification bar that has 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 improved in the aesthetic aspect in 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.680
 question of wifi in question 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 bluetooth and good as we can see here 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.530
 in what is in the brightness it changes in what 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.289
 what is the interface this did not do what 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.289
 that was the previous version of lollipop 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.250
 and one of the changes it has in 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.470
 question of what the menu is only 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.350
 it is in the change of the icons since the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.440
 submenus are still the same there's no 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.170
 no extra change 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.620
 and well this is what is android 5.1.1 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.030
 it does not have big changes in the submenus 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.120
 only some changes in what is 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.950
 in question of aesthetics and good something 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.770
 that I have noticed in terms of the use of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.950
 the camera and that is when you use it 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.550
 and you start to take many pictures suffers 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.550
 a lac 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.460
 it is true that the approach has improved and 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.820
 it is true that also the photographs 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.650
 they come out more clearly but I've noticed 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.470
 that we are taking many pictures 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.410
 consecutively suffers a lag that the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.500
 really good that deteriorates what what 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.540
 It would be the speed of taking a picture 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.440
 another detail that has this new 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.350
 Android 5.1.1 update and that 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.690
 I also had version 5.0 that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.070
 issue of notifications to me 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.110
 opinion the truth is that it has not 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.180
 liked since if you are seeing 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.550
 a youtube video a video of your 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.830
 gallery and you get a notification of 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.870
 facebook or whatsapp is downloaded on 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.920
 volume of what is the audio of the video 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.980
 and the sound of the notification is 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.300
 listen very hard and the truth that you 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.610
 distracts apart from which it is mounted and in the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.330
 screen what is the notification in the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.850
 Android version 4.4 kitkat the truth 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.250
 that when you had a video you were 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.530
 watching a youtube video a video of 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.989
 your gallery comes a notification and 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.220
 only the phone vibrated but not 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.300
 it made the volume of the video 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.690
 decrease and the volume of the 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.120
 notification will be heard very loudly the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.430
 true that in this aspect has not 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.410
 much liked maybe many will say 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.200
 well the truth is that it is 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.150
 Android update are your improvements 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.850
 but to my point of view if you are 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.740
 watching a video or a movie and you 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.840
 several notifications of whatsapp arrive 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.570
 the truth is that it's annoying I'm going to 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.670
 leave a video below and you get 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.670
 a notification what is happening 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.610
 it's annoying to be seeing a person 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.880
 video and you get the 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.460
 notifications and that are displayed in the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.310
 main screen and that the audio of the 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.280
 video is decreased by returning to 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.060
 section of the camera are using 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.230
 the 4 cam video function I've been 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.060
 using and recording approximately 34 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.790
 minutes and the truth is that it warms 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.670
 Too much the phone is a detail that 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.160
 are and must improve another of the things 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.980
 is in question the rotation of the 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.690
 screen I noticed the truth is that it is 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.690
 faster than the previous version 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.210
 and well, this question of the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.980
 quickly and good friends this would be all 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.810
 in a matter of what I have noticed the 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.850
 question of this update and good 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.600
 leave your comment if you have also 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.940
 some problem some detail and good 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.310
 so that more people are informed 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.440
 thanks for watching the video and if it has 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.470
 served and you liked to give it a like
