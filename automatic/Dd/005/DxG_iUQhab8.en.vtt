00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
some that they were a bit a little bit

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.279 
some that they were a bit a little bit
more<00:00:17.039> useful<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.910> game<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.840> back<00:00:18.869> to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
more useful in game so we go back to
