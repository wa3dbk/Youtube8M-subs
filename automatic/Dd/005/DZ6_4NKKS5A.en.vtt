on<00:00:56.010> swim<00:00:56.219> baits<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.090> few<00:00:57.539> years<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.410> we

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
on swim baits for a few years now so we

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.650 
on swim baits for a few years now so we
decided<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> boot<00:00:59.820> tail<00:01:00.030> version<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
decided to make a boot tail version and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.020 
decided to make a boot tail version and
it's<00:01:01.079> awesome<00:01:01.670> probably<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> best<00:01:02.879> thing

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
it's awesome probably the best thing

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.250 
it's awesome probably the best thing
about<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.660> swim<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.049> really

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
about it is you can swim it at really

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560 
about it is you can swim it at really
low<00:01:04.500> speeds<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> that's<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> things

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
low speeds and that's one of the things

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.840 
low speeds and that's one of the things
that<00:01:06.780> triggered<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> put<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.850> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that triggered me to put it on that that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.030 
that triggered me to put it on that that
umbrella<00:01:09.240> rig<00:01:09.540> was<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.470> could<00:01:10.650> swim<00:01:10.830> really

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
umbrella rig was you could swim really

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640 
umbrella rig was you could swim really
slow<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.420> noticed<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.049> actually

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
slow and I noticed that it actually

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.920 
slow and I noticed that it actually
would<00:01:14.010> keep<00:01:14.189> swimming<00:01:14.520> even<00:01:15.509> when<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
would keep swimming even when the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
would keep swimming even when the
original<00:01:16.350> live<00:01:16.710> magic<00:01:17.100> shad<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:17.549> stop

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
original live magic shad would stop

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
original live magic shad would stop
swimming<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.450> low<00:01:18.630> speeds<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
swimming at really low speeds so if you

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.649 
swimming at really low speeds so if you
put<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> jig<00:01:21.030> head<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.630> a
