00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.560

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.730
 question that sent by mail jose 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.980

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.960
 infinitely thanks for everything 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.960
 that you share thanks to you too 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 and my question is in relation to 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:42.790
 relationships how can I get along with 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.790
 someone that I do not like how he treats me 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.630
 thanks for your answer is antonio 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 dear jose antonio is something that everyone 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.770
 it happens to us that I am alone that all in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.650
 the community we benefit because of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 soon we have or rather we have 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.360
 We believe that we have to live with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 certain questions that many times with 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.450
 certain people but that many times 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.270
 they challenge us to bring out the worst in us or not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.400
 no is not father in the relationship on 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.400
 everything if you're talking here about being 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 doing a mistreatment of that person 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.100
 and what I want to share is that all 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.170
 we all like it more than all those who 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.260
 with whom we relate are mirrors 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.990
 of ourselves is the person is 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.570
 there to show you something of you 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.060
 and maybe he's going to teach you things that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.909
 you already like jordan things that you do not 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.040
 they like but everything has to do with you 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.320
 then we tend to give them the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.920
 responsibility to the other and that is what made me 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.259
 he told me I do not know what it is and it's the other 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.840
 the one responsible is the other who did it 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.189
 the one who said it and really despite 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.480
 it has been and that is the other 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.660
 what did he say 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.850
 It's not new, it's no coincidence that there 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.400
 said to you you have a role one 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.940
 responsibility in that and in addition 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.280
 at the time of incarnating we plan how 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.020
 the whole set of our movie and all 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.210
 the characters 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.850
 and each one is taking the necessary role 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.280
 so that you also see things and learn 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:26.350
 and transcend certain teachings that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.350
 then what I can share is 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.240
 first and dans ask the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.490
 divinity with whom you connect to 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.870
 universe to nature to god like you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.670
 you call him to help you help you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.770
 have a better relationship 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.290
 promobys to this relationship you can ask 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.459
 to the archangel 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.459
 will assist you in 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:58.340
 just in harmonizing and in carrying out 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:58.340
 that equity in the relationship 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.440
 I got in touch with you and with what 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.750
 moves you what happens in you what buttons 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.590
 squeeze that teaches you about that relationship 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.170
 you can enter the meditation process 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.480
 and prayer processes something that to me 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.980
 works a lot is to send love to the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.189
 person who is challenging me 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.950
 you are doing but I bless you the libero 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.069
 with something 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.490
 and I send you love and I visualize myself 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.690
 wrapping the other person 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.690
 heart shaped 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.340
 be fine because the light is in it the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.459
 love alive through 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.860
 and obviously through me but when 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.680
 you start sending love to the other 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.660
 person or another person receives them and there 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.590
 very important changes and super 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.940
 tangible because they are no longer 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.290
 wrong and there is no longer that resistance 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.469
 the relationship 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.030
 then I can share and I hope that 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:10.349
 It has a lot of light and it would make a lot of light 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.349
