that<00:00:31.380> came<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.369> bit<00:00:32.550> faster

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that came with it so it's a bit faster

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
that came with it so it's a bit faster
than<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.450> otherwise<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.739> Asus

bookmarks sorry so let's go to engadget

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.780 
bookmarks sorry so let's go to engadget
and<00:01:09.380> both<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> load<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and both of these are going to load the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.980 
and both of these are going to load the
mobile<00:01:12.240> version<00:01:12.270> i<00:01:12.990> believe<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.509> two

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
mobile version i believe so one two

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.210 
mobile version i believe so one two
three<00:01:18.380> yes<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.640> pretty<00:01:20.880> close<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:23.130> be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
three yes so that was pretty close to be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
three yes so that was pretty close to be
honest<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.610> didn't<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:23.850> see<00:01:24.090> which<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.689> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
honest I didn't really see which one was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
honest I didn't really see which one was
fastest<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> was<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> other

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
fastest but if it was one or the other

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.660 
fastest but if it was one or the other
would<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.390> been<00:01:27.509> less<00:01:27.689> than<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.960> second<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.670> big

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
would have been less than a second a big

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:41.110 
would have been less than a second a big
deal<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.509> let's<00:01:30.720> go<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:32.270> desktop<00:01:34.310> site<00:01:35.310> so

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:52.399 

one<00:01:41.870> two<00:01:42.770> three

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.639 

hmm<00:01:53.420> don't<00:01:54.420> know<00:01:54.569> what<00:01:54.749> happened<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> prime

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
hmm don't know what happened the prime

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.760 
hmm don't know what happened the prime
there<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.539> put<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.439> was

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
there and I put on it so that was

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.980 
there and I put on it so that was
strange<00:02:00.079> all<00:02:01.079> right<00:02:01.289> well<00:02:01.649> that

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.729 

that<00:02:08.590> was<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.800> bit<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.310> fail<00:02:09.640> but<00:02:09.940> that's<00:02:10.390> okay

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that was a bit of a fail but that's okay

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.690 
that was a bit of a fail but that's okay
we'll<00:02:11.739> click<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.819> one<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.030> these<00:02:13.180> links<00:02:13.270> here

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
we'll click on one of these links here

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.010 
we'll click on one of these links here
so<00:02:15.700> we're<00:02:15.940> alive<00:02:16.180> from<00:02:16.560> CES<00:02:17.560> 2012<00:02:18.630> one<00:02:19.630> two

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
so we're alive from CES 2012 one two

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.309 
so we're alive from CES 2012 one two
three<00:02:23.010> which<00:02:24.010> one's<00:02:24.250> going<00:02:24.550> fastest<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:26.110> it

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
three which one's going fastest and it

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.280 
three which one's going fastest and it
looks<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.920> s2<00:02:27.599> it's<00:02:28.599> almost<00:02:28.810> done<00:02:29.140> it's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
looks like the s2 it's almost done it's

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.910 
looks like the s2 it's almost done it's
winning<00:02:29.590> oh<00:02:30.150> but<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.330> asus<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.019> catching<00:02:32.769> up

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
winning oh but the asus is catching up

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.360 
winning oh but the asus is catching up
hope<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.910> sto<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.330> done<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.650> transformer

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
hope the sto is done and the transformer

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.710 
hope the sto is done and the transformer
prime<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:37.060> few<00:02:37.870> seconds<00:02:38.410> behind<00:02:39.720> surprising

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
prime a few seconds behind surprising

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.309 
prime a few seconds behind surprising
considering<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.069> has<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> quad-core

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
considering that it has a quad-core

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.820 
considering that it has a quad-core
processor<00:02:44.319> versus<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.569> st's<00:02:46.569> dual<00:02:47.140> core<00:02:47.530> and

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
processor versus the st's dual core and

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.820 
processor versus the st's dual core and
it's<00:02:48.760> still<00:02:48.940> going<00:02:49.209> actually<00:02:50.220> let's<00:02:51.220> see<00:02:51.489> I

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
it's still going actually let's see I

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.370 
it's still going actually let's see I
have<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.040> say<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.549> s2<00:02:54.970> feels<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.660> bit<00:02:55.870> smoother

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
have to say the s2 feels a bit smoother

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.910 
have to say the s2 feels a bit smoother
but<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.280> mean<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:58.360> does<00:02:58.930> feel<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.170> bit<00:02:59.260> more<00:02:59.560> fluid

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
but I mean it does feel a bit more fluid

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.660 
but I mean it does feel a bit more fluid
but<00:03:00.069> as<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.489> see<00:03:00.760> there's<00:03:01.049> slight<00:03:02.049> delay

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
but as you can see there's slight delay

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.759 
but as you can see there's slight delay
or<00:03:03.670> pinch<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.239> zoom<00:03:04.440> ace<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.500> prime<00:03:07.380> less<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
or pinch to zoom ace is prime less of a

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.220 
or pinch to zoom ace is prime less of a
delay<00:03:09.069> but<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.730> feels<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.180> bit<00:03:10.480> more<00:03:10.780> choppy

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
delay but this feels a bit more choppy

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.509 
delay but this feels a bit more choppy
and<00:03:11.670> look<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:12.820> still<00:03:13.060> loading<00:03:13.299> ok<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.890> let's

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
and look it's still loading ok so let's

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.110 
and look it's still loading ok so let's
try<00:03:15.850> let's<00:03:16.120> try<00:03:17.079> another<00:03:17.350> website<00:03:17.739> now<00:03:18.160> how

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
try let's try another website now how

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:31.759 
try let's try another website now how
about<00:03:21.000> gsmarena<00:03:23.790> ok<00:03:27.060> ok<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:29.620> two<00:03:30.040> three

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
about gsmarena ok ok so one two three

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.620 
about gsmarena ok ok so one two three
and<00:03:32.769> we're<00:03:32.950> off

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.920 

so<00:03:38.200> which<00:03:38.470> one's<00:03:38.710> going<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.010> take<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.930> looks

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
so which one's going to take it looks

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.440 
so which one's going to take it looks
like<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.410> s2<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.160> winning<00:03:44.070> with<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.550> Oh<00:03:45.790> nope

like the s2 is winning with the Oh nope
CSIS<00:03:47.320> prime<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:48.130> takes<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.550> the<00:03:48.880> s2<00:03:49.240> still

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
CSIS prime it takes it the s2 still

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.920 
CSIS prime it takes it the s2 still

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.270 
loading still working at it you can't
really<00:03:53.110> tell<00:03:53.440> but<00:03:54.570> see<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.690> screen<00:03:55.990> bot<00:03:56.280> just

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
it hope this time it was the s2 by a

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.510 
it hope this time it was the s2 by a
margin<00:04:18.430> less<00:04:19.060> than<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.330> second<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:19.780> think<00:04:20.520> let's

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
margin less than a second I think let's

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.870 
margin less than a second I think let's

eight<00:04:29.010> one<00:04:30.010> two<00:04:30.250> three<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:33.100> we're<00:04:33.310> off

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.370 

this<00:04:39.700> time<00:04:39.970> it's<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.270> esta<00:04:40.660> tu<00:04:40.780> de<00:04:40.930> takes<00:04:41.170> it

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
this time it's the esta tu de takes it

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.850 
this time it's the esta tu de takes it
so<00:04:41.770> not<00:04:42.700> very<00:04:43.000> consistent<00:04:43.590> both<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.770> them

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
so not very consistent both of them

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.880 
so not very consistent both of them
pretty<00:04:45.220> fast<00:04:45.640> though<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:47.050> let's<00:04:47.080> go<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.500> our

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
pretty fast though so let's go to our

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.980 
pretty fast though so let's go to our

it doesn't quite show all the nikon
camera<00:05:19.180> whereas<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.350> transformer<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.730> see<00:05:21.970> a

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
camera whereas the transformer you see a

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.690 
camera whereas the transformer you see a

you<00:07:04.480> take<00:07:04.720> your<00:07:04.990> pick<00:07:05.260> I<00:07:05.730> think<00:07:06.730> the<00:07:07.330> samsung

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
you take your pick I think the samsung

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
so you have to take that for what it's

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.900

worth<00:07:13.780> and<00:07:14.260> here's<00:07:15.130> the<00:07:15.400> pinch<00:07:15.940> to<00:07:16.150> zoom<00:07:16.180> again
