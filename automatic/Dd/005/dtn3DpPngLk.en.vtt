00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.080
 good hello how about roommates 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.880
 Aug 15 10 and I would like to give 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.910
 know a method to have a better 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.450
 sound in the on playstation3 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.630
 carles with this cable that comes to us 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.630
 default 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.920
 and so 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.240
 we will also be a sound team 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.060
 and well what we must do first is 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.220
 make our playstation3 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:43.370
 go to the part where it says adjustments and 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.370
 go down to where it says sound setting 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.510
 here what we are going to do is press 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.050
 where it says we go down it says multi exit 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 of audio and we sink ourselves into this 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.120
 case and you like 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.229
 Once I have done good 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.229
 we connect our cable 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.680
 in this cable 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.700
 and we go to the back of 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.460
 sound equipment here at least you can 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.880
 visualize we connect the red banana 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 in the port the color of the banana and the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.330
 white 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.670
 and later 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.200
 we connect this in the back 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.200
 of playstation 3 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.320
 once this is done we turn on our 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.320
 team 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.260
 and we can visualize what 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 in playstation 3 is also sending 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.009
 sound to the sound equipment is worth this is 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.129
 a method that allows 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.989
 allows us to have a good sound without 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.750
 needs many things simply 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.840
 having a sound that 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.450
 defect many the good ones this was 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.450
 all for today mates greetings
