00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.950
 He was a typical boy who ran behind 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.810
 all the bugs that moved and that I 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.810
 all animals attracted attention 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.090
 I specialized in exotic animals 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.830
 first because I also like them a lot 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 animals in nature 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
 wild animals and this specialty 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 during the race they were animals 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.470
 exotic in general and I started to work 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.400
 Well, with all kinds of animals 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:43.110
 specializing in those that were not 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:46.410
 dogs and cats in the rest surgery 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.960
 part of one of my specialties 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 most important in particular the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.730
 Traumatology I really like animals 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.100
 small in exotic animals but good 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 I just do a lot of surgeries 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.720
 soft tissues in all types of animals 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.150
 it looks pretty good right we have 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.650
 to put this piece here and this piece 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.770
 here we have 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.970
 and place it to your site to operate 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.250
 animals so small, not only 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.900
 we have to work hard and that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 make them material that we build 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.950
 ourselves this is concretely a 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.530
 external fixator we will insert the leg by 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.990
 in here to get it aligned and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 we will cross it with some gold needles 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.580
 simple working with animals 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.140
 exotic is a challenge because all the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.210
 days we find different things 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.670
 we have to innovate and for dogs and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 cats is all studied and we have 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.440
 all possible means but for 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 exotic animals we have to look for 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.729
 the resources then it's all day 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.010
 innovating and all day studying and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.070
 all day long looking for new things and 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.080
 adapting medicine and surgery 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.760
 with these guides what we are doing 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.670
 it is already to pass the forces of the bone to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.740
 external plastic is like a plaster if 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.540
 it really is similar to the effect it makes 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.700
 a plaster 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.620
 perfectly aligned I love the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.840
 animal fauna in africa 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.270
 worked there in South Africa 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.100
 concretely and good there then 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.920
 imagine then from rhinos lions 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.380
 of giraffes all kinds of animals 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.840
 could deal with all kinds of animals 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.450
 I work both in Spain and outside do 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.700
 an important teaching task 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.760
 because we give talks in the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.620
 universities of spain and with kun and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.900
 pique we also impart enough 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.360
 chats off so much for vets 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.670
 as for other professionals in the sector 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.580
 good pets one of the most challenges 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.490
 difficult was doing the ultrasound of a 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.700
 jaguar we could not anesthetize 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.130
 too much because this animal had 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.110
 I was pregnant had puppies inside 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.190
 and then you can not use much 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.050
 anesthesia and I was a little reluctant to that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.209
 we did the ultrasound 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.610
 it cost us a lot and working with animals 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.460
 big not with big wild animals 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.530
 animals that can really hurt you 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.410
 and that they could kill you talking in two 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.420
 words is a challenge because of 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.760
 somehow then you put your 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.430
 clear physical integrity the animals are 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.000
 much of my life I really live with 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.990
 animals I wake up with animals and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.600
 since I get up until I 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.000
 I lie that is my world revolves around 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.000
 the animals what I like the most about me 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.360
 work is the contact with all kinds of 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.510
 animals also with people knowing 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.660
 people from other parts of the world me 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.680
 allows to travel and well my work is a 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.680
 wonder I can not say anything else
