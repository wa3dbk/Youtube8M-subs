00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460 

I<00:00:04.130> think<00:00:05.130> there's<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.790> sort<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.470> conflicting

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
I think there's this sort of conflicting

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.720 
I think there's this sort of conflicting
obsessions<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:10.260> ones<00:00:10.500> kind<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.980> twinship<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
obsessions the ones kind of twinship and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.749 
obsessions the ones kind of twinship and
the<00:00:11.790> other<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.120> opposition<00:00:13.400> it's<00:00:14.400> about

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the other is opposition it's about

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.420 
the other is opposition it's about
people<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.299> look<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.630> same<00:00:16.010> but<00:00:17.010> aren't<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
people that look the same but aren't the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.390 
people that look the same but aren't the
same<00:00:18.350> it's<00:00:19.350> about<00:00:19.560> boys<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.859> look<00:00:20.220> like

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
same it's about boys that look like

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.769 
same it's about boys that look like
girls<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.820> girls<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.150> look<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.420> boys<00:00:21.689> or

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
girls or girls that look like boys or

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.269 
girls or girls that look like boys or
boys<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.140> look<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.949> soldiers<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.400> Oren's

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
boys that look like soldiers and Oren's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.979 
boys that look like soldiers and Oren's
I'm<00:00:29.279> trying<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> create<00:00:30.420> tribes<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.790> people

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
I'm trying to create tribes of people

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
I'm trying to create tribes of people
and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.350> that's<00:00:34.680> why<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.860> was<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.280> drawn<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and I think that's why I was so drawn to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.670 
and I think that's why I was so drawn to
the<00:00:35.850> wrestling<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.200> there<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.500> there's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the wrestling you get there and there's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
the wrestling you get there and there's
this<00:00:37.800> tribe<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.460> sort<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.910> look<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this tribe and they do sort of look a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.770 
this tribe and they do sort of look a
bit<00:00:39.899> similar<00:00:40.760> they<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> same<00:00:42.540> kind

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
bit similar they all have the same kind

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.740 
bit similar they all have the same kind
of<00:00:42.840> body<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.640> their<00:00:44.640> ears<00:00:44.879> turn<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> same<00:00:45.629> way

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
of body is their ears turn the same way

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020 
of body is their ears turn the same way
if<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:45.989> wrestle<00:00:46.320> too<00:00:46.469> long<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.820> when<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
if they wrestle too long and when you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
if they wrestle too long and when you
have<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.329> kind<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.629> twinship<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
have this kind of twinship and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
have this kind of twinship and
opposition<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:51.239> becomes<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.899> mean<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> kind

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
opposition it becomes I mean it's a kind

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.799 
opposition it becomes I mean it's a kind
of<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> metaphor<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
of a metaphor for this you know for the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.220 
of a metaphor for this you know for the
Jew<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> German<00:00:56.390> German<00:00:57.390> Jews<00:00:57.629> thinking

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
Jew and the German German Jews thinking

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.630 
Jew and the German German Jews thinking
that<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:58.440> were<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> same<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.980> Germans<00:00:59.399> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that they were the same as Germans and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:11.899 
that they were the same as Germans and
being<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.840> different

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.980 

I<00:01:16.609> decided<00:01:17.609> to<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.090> back<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.359> high<00:01:18.450> school<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
I decided to go back to high school and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.069 
I decided to go back to high school and

because no one ever had interest in
wrestling<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:31.079> taken<00:01:31.590> by

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
love that they were doing something that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.609 
love that they were doing something that
in<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.149> made<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.659> small<00:01:43.259> outcasts<00:01:45.619> they

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
in a way made them small outcasts they

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.520 
in a way made them small outcasts they
were<00:01:46.739> doing<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.610> popular<00:01:48.119> sport<00:01:48.500> not<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
were doing not a popular sport not a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
were doing not a popular sport not a
sport<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.860> people<00:01:50.039> watched<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.909> sport<00:01:51.179> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
sport that people watched the sport that

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.850 
sport that people watched the sport that
that<00:01:52.379> was<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.770> difficult

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.200 

particularly<00:01:56.860> in<00:01:57.070> practice<00:01:57.550> it's<00:01:57.880> about

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
particularly in practice it's about

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.770 
particularly in practice it's about
partnerships<00:01:59.080> and<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:01.210> just<00:02:01.390> thought<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.630> was<00:02:01.720> a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
partnerships and I just thought it was a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.320 
partnerships and I just thought it was a
really<00:02:02.140> beautiful<00:02:03.010> relationship<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.150> I<00:02:04.210> had

really beautiful relationship that I had

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.090 
really beautiful relationship that I had
never<00:02:04.450> seen<00:02:04.600> before
