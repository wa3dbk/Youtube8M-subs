00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.639
 Now we're going to discuss an appeal. 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.599
 very interesting inside javaserver 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.530
 faces that made you reflect template 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.049
 basically with these resources we 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 we were able to create professional layouts 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.670
 to our site 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.640
 theoretically without much effort 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.510
 that way I'm going to create the new project 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.720
 the web to discuss this issue of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.829
 template I'll name this project 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.829
 for example made the theme 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.190
 let me search the same folder as we 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.190
 we are working 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.850
 I believe it's that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.750
 exactly then just playing the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.810
 designing where it will be 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.990
 stored in a web project with 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.530
 normal glassfish 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.439
 let's put javaserver faces is 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.890
 being created in the project for people and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.920
 within this new project as the sun 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 we know if we run the project one 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.950
 kind of reload the mpe already shown for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.330
 people like you can see everything 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.179
 working 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.470
 let's create a template for our 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.020
 site 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.619
 so I'll create here in 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.700
 javaserver faces made template is a 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.909
 faces model how was the translation 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.259
 I'll give the name, for example, of template and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.179
 I notice that here I can choose 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.520
 any template I want through the site 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.100
 net has already have 80 predefined beds 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.539
 including choosing I want to do the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.850
 layout of their companies in the form of 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.350
 tables in the form of access 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.789
 we know that currently we do not 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.110
 we recommend more use of tables with 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.349
 site layout 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.720
 so we'll keep css and for example 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:13.560
 chosen here where I have there one 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.150
 header same the same perhaps left 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.959
 in a central region 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.550
 I like it a lot here, it caused me to click on 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.560
 to complete with a series of codes were 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.120
 generated in the series generated code for us 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.950
 will discuss with you in a little while 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.920
 but first and foremost let's try 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.230
 directly access time and how the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.860
 our focus in SÃ£o Paulo is the index all 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.360
 We've created a stainless steel link here the knots 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.700
 we run right clicked to execute 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.700
 directly from here 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.220
 as you can see it has already been generated 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.230
 for me a template the layout for my 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.420
 page 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.659
 What I can do now is try 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 show you how this layout 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.959
 was generated 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.090
 we will then analyze the generated project 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.799
 on here 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.050
 As you can see, I'm going 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.560
 maximize for you but first I will 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.840
 show here 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.080
 of face we already gained two files and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.120
 css access if you want jarrett 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.700
 enjoy and use some styles 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.580
 ready here I voted styles for example 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.120
 referring to the upper part of my 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.690
 layout that part I voted styles for 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.269
 example referring to the footer of my layout 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.980
 that this part that is not here in the 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.920
 True, I will not need to use that 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.450
 case but did not win but for example has 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.030
 has a ready style it just leaves 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.500
 left of my site and so on 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.700
 successively must have one to 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.760
 content also tried to check the 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.129
 various centralized content content 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.540
 things like this you can then 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.310
 check that when week is the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.819
 facebook template automatically you 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.680
 already has some styles 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.349
 you can use 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.250
 within your pages 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.540
 at 3:00 p.m., giving a check in the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.540
 chile html that was generated 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.730
 automatically we can observe that 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.519
 the specific namespace for facebook 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.440
 templates was called wii is this 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.870
 address here for done before 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.960
 so we need to declare this 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.900
 namespace so we can use the tags 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.310
 prescribed within them namespaces 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.810
 within the header of my page that 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.190
 note that we made a little shape 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.320
 different from this 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.240
 that way the netbeans euro was not with 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.039
 other advertising chips 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.590
 basically it has gone the way 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.539
 traditionally, we associate our 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.000
 pages with files is 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.590
 basically the link to the directory 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.599
 where it is stored in our files 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:52.610
 and continuous text-base access and CSS and 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.220
 as you can see it was generated 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.280
 basically inside my body of mine. 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.060
 javaserver faces basically 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.120
 some divisions one of these divisions that 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.060
 are sub areas will think yes in my 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.800
 page was called the top that is 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.690
 precisely this top here is a 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.219
 another subdivision was called the 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:22.289
 tram that this part here and another 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:24.479
 on the visual called the content 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.520
 click here note that none of these 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.529
 here with information about color 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.629
 about spacing between these divisions 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.449
 not because all of this has been defined 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.939
 out of mine will already be done through 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.379
 specifically with the rules 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:40.819
 defined as I just showed 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.819
 for you guys
