well and I know that he likes to take
his<00:01:40.070> raise<00:01:40.369> spots<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.240> whatnot<00:01:41.740> it's<00:01:42.740> a

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
his raise spots and and whatnot it's a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.649 
his raise spots and and whatnot it's a
little<00:01:43.100> scary<00:01:43.340> because<00:01:43.549> he<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:43.909> under<00:01:44.119> 20<00:01:44.479> big

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
little scary because he is under 20 big

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.590 
little scary because he is under 20 big
blinds<00:01:44.869> but<00:01:45.229> I'm<00:01:45.830> pretty<00:01:46.520> confident<00:01:47.479> that

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
blinds but I'm pretty confident that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.230 
blinds but I'm pretty confident that
he's<00:01:47.900> an<00:01:47.990> opening<00:01:48.409> light<00:01:48.619> on<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.979> button<00:01:49.280> just

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
he's an opening light on the button just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.410 
he's an opening light on the button just
because<00:01:50.600> that's<00:01:51.460> he<00:01:52.460> it's<00:01:52.820> really<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.299> his

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
because that's he it's really in his

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.020 
because that's he it's really in his
game<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:53.990> before<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.100> hand<00:01:55.280> was<00:01:55.490> even<00:01:55.820> dealt

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
game and before the hand was even dealt

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.940 
game and before the hand was even dealt
it<00:01:56.299> didn't<00:01:56.659> matter<00:01:56.810> what<00:01:57.080> my<00:01:57.229> cards<00:01:57.590> were<00:01:57.680> here

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
it didn't matter what my cards were here

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.270 
it didn't matter what my cards were here
to<00:01:58.310> seven<00:01:58.640> offsuit<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.590> guess<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> only<00:02:00.890> hands

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
to seven offsuit I guess the only hands

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.350 
to seven offsuit I guess the only hands
I<00:02:01.400> wouldn't<00:02:01.759> have<00:02:01.850> been<00:02:01.939> three<00:02:02.210> about

something or something like aces or

my best to get all this chips in the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.060 
my best to get all this chips in the

middle instead of trying to push him off
his<00:02:10.280> hand<00:02:10.630> but<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.380> six<00:02:12.620> seven<00:02:12.890> does<00:02:13.040> flop

his hand but the six seven does flop

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.210 
his hand but the six seven does flop
somewhat<00:02:14.600> decently<00:02:15.079> but<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.890> wouldn't<00:02:16.130> have

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
somewhat decently but it wouldn't have

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.830 
somewhat decently but it wouldn't have
mattered<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:17.510> two<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.810> clubs

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
mattered this this was the two of clubs

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.560 
mattered this this was the two of clubs
and<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> seven<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.890> Hearts<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.340> had<00:02:20.209> decided

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
and the seven of Hearts I had decided

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.870 
and the seven of Hearts I had decided
before<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> cards<00:02:21.829> were<00:02:21.950> even<00:02:22.190> dealt<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.640> if

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
before the cards were even dealt that if

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.030 
before the cards were even dealt that if
he<00:02:23.360> went<00:02:23.540> mini<00:02:23.930> raises<00:02:24.320> button<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:24.769> it<00:02:24.889> was

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
he went mini raises button if it was

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.069 
he went mini raises button if it was
unopened<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.579> him<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.820> was<00:02:25.940> going<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.209> shove<00:02:26.389> and

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
unopened to him I was going to shove and

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.050 
unopened to him I was going to shove and
he<00:02:27.260> does<00:02:27.440> many<00:02:27.680> raises<00:02:28.100> button

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
he does many raises button

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.059 
he does many raises button
and<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.300> put<00:02:29.480> my<00:02:29.599> chips<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.290> he<00:02:30.770> snapped

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
and I put my chips in and he snapped

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.160 
and I put my chips in and he snapped
folder<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.450> was<00:02:32.720> pretty<00:02:32.930> much<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
folder so that was pretty much the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.660 
folder so that was pretty much the
dynamics<00:02:33.860> behind<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.400> hand<00:02:36.099> like<00:02:37.099> I<00:02:37.220> said<00:02:37.459> if

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
dynamics behind that hand like I said if

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.370 
dynamics behind that hand like I said if
you<00:02:37.970> know<00:02:38.180> somebody's<00:02:38.599> gonna<00:02:38.780> do<00:02:38.989> something

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
you know somebody's gonna do something

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.530 
you know somebody's gonna do something
before<00:02:39.560> they<00:02:39.860> even<00:02:40.010> do<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:41.360> could

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
before they even do it you could

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.089 
before they even do it you could
probably<00:02:41.690> pretty<00:02:42.110> much<00:02:42.200> go<00:02:42.530> with<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.830> read

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
probably pretty much go with that read

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.660 
probably pretty much go with that read
because<00:02:43.459> you're<00:02:43.640> probably<00:02:43.970> bang<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:45.670> you

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
because you're probably bang on you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.280 
because you're probably bang on you
probably<00:02:47.620> not<00:02:48.640> wrong<00:02:49.640> very<00:02:49.970> often<00:02:50.360> there<00:02:50.540> so

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
probably not wrong very often there so

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.680 
probably not wrong very often there so
that's<00:02:51.769> why<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:51.950> go<00:02:52.160> ahead<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.430> do<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.880> little

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
that's why I go ahead and do it a little

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.809 
that's why I go ahead and do it a little
different<00:02:54.019> situation<00:02:54.200> here<00:02:54.620> all<00:02:55.430> my<00:02:55.580> hands

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
different situation here all my hands

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.790 
different situation here all my hands
have<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.330> little<00:02:56.569> bit<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:56.930> different<00:02:57.290> dynamic

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
have a little bit of a different dynamic

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.229 
have a little bit of a different dynamic
to<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.310> because<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.730> would<00:02:58.849> didn't<00:02:59.030> want<00:02:59.180> to

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
to it because I would didn't want to

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.020 
to it because I would didn't want to
make<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.870> video<00:03:00.140> stale<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:01.489> one<00:03:01.640> has<00:03:01.819> no

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
he's really aggressive so he is the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.789 
he's really aggressive so he is the
razor<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:08.329> just<00:04:08.750> figured<00:04:09.019> he's<00:04:09.260> opening

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
razor and I just figured he's opening

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.229 
razor and I just figured he's opening
pretty<00:04:10.040> light<00:04:10.250> because<00:04:10.579> of<00:04:10.760> his<00:04:10.910> aggression

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
pretty light because of his aggression

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.050 
pretty light because of his aggression
level<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.590> go<00:04:12.980> ahead<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.340> shove<00:04:13.549> my<00:04:13.730> twenty

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
level and I go ahead and shove my twenty

level and I go ahead and shove my twenty
Binks<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:15.070> I'll<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:16.250> let<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.579> play<00:04:16.820> out

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
Binks and I'll just let that play out

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.250 
Binks and I'll just let that play out
for<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:18.160> he<00:04:19.160> makes<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.579> standard<00:04:20.359> 3x<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.109> I

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
for you he makes it standard 3x and I

you gotta remember like it's it's
important<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.870> remember<00:04:30.160> when<00:04:31.160> you're

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
important to remember when you're

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.529 
important to remember when you're
shoving<00:04:32.020> with<00:04:33.020> no<00:04:33.260> antes<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:34.639> can't<00:04:35.300> stress

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
shoving with no antes I can't stress

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.440 
shoving with no antes I can't stress
this<00:04:35.690> enough<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.669> really<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:37.970> really<00:04:38.000> have

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
this enough you really you really have

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.210 
this enough you really you really have
to<00:04:38.570> have<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.720> hand<00:04:38.990> with<00:04:39.140> showdown<00:04:39.530> or<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.979> have

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
to have a hand with showdown or you have

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.860 
to have a hand with showdown or you have
to<00:04:40.370> really<00:04:40.640> know<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:41.150> he's<00:04:41.330> opening

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
to really know that he's opening

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.320 
to really know that he's opening
and<00:04:42.169> I<00:04:42.740> suspected<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:43.400> there<00:04:43.880> was<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.030> pretty

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
and I suspected that there was a pretty

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.840 
and I suspected that there was a pretty
light<00:04:44.570> open<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:45.080> wouldn't<00:04:45.980> have<00:04:46.070> shoved<00:04:46.310> anyone

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
light open I wouldn't have shoved anyone

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.200 
light open I wouldn't have shoved anyone
else<00:04:47.380> more<00:04:48.380> than<00:04:48.440> likely<00:04:48.800> if<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.730> pot<00:04:49.940> comes

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
else more than likely if the pot comes

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.060 
else more than likely if the pot comes
to<00:04:50.360> me<00:04:50.479> unopened<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.290> have<00:04:51.440> 20<00:04:51.740> bags<00:04:51.889> I'm

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
to me unopened and I have 20 bags I'm

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
to me unopened and I have 20 bags I'm
just<00:04:52.340> gonna<00:04:52.460> fold<00:04:52.820> as<00:04:53.780> niddy<00:04:54.110> as<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.440> seems

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
just gonna fold as niddy as that seems

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.120 
just gonna fold as niddy as that seems
there's<00:04:56.090> not<00:04:56.300> really<00:04:56.590> I'm<00:04:57.590> not<00:04:57.650> sure<00:04:57.979> it's

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
there's not really I'm not sure it's

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.879 
there's not really I'm not sure it's
super<00:04:58.340> profitable<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.180> be<00:04:59.660> shoving<00:05:00.020> 20<00:05:00.710> bags

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
super profitable to be shoving 20 bags

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.350 
super profitable to be shoving 20 bags
when<00:05:01.160> there's<00:05:01.310> only<00:05:01.400> 300<00:05:01.940> chips<00:05:02.150> in<00:05:02.270> the

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
when there's only 300 chips in the

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.629 
when there's only 300 chips in the
middle<00:05:02.600> and<00:05:02.780> they<00:05:03.500> there's<00:05:04.130> nothing<00:05:04.490> really

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
middle and they there's nothing really

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.120 
middle and they there's nothing really
to<00:05:04.790> be<00:05:05.000> gained<00:05:05.240> so<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:06.229> probably<00:05:06.590> just<00:05:06.949> would

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
to be gained so I probably just would

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.409 
to be gained so I probably just would
have<00:05:07.220> folded<00:05:07.639> because<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.090> wouldn't<00:05:08.360> have

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
have folded because I wouldn't have

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.930 
have folded because I wouldn't have
wanted<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.870> raise<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.800> plop<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.850> then

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
wanted to raise the the plop and then

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.040 
wanted to raise the the plop and then
fold<00:05:11.540> or<00:05:12.229> have<00:05:12.470> to<00:05:12.650> see<00:05:12.889> bet<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.460> fold<00:05:14.330> or

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
fold or have to see bet and fold or

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.480 
fold or have to see bet and fold or
anything<00:05:15.260> like<00:05:15.590> that<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.070> would<00:05:16.250> have

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
anything like that so I would have

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.870 
anything like that so I would have
probably<00:05:17.120> just<00:05:17.419> folded<00:05:18.280> but<00:05:19.280> with<00:05:19.490> his<00:05:19.669> open

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
probably just folded but with his open

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.760 
probably just folded but with his open
it<00:05:20.240> looked<00:05:20.570> like<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.750> pretty<00:05:20.990> good<00:05:21.139> spot<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.650> me

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
it looked like a pretty good spot to me

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.390 
it looked like a pretty good spot to me
so<00:05:22.040> I<00:05:22.280> went<00:05:22.850> took<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.330> worked<00:05:24.160> one<00:05:25.160> thing<00:05:25.310> I

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
so I went took it it worked one thing I

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.510 
so I went took it it worked one thing I
will<00:05:25.580> mention<00:05:25.760> here<00:05:26.240> on<00:05:26.419> this<00:05:26.720> vid<00:05:27.020> is<00:05:27.229> all<00:05:28.040> the

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
will mention here on this vid is all the

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.070 
will mention here on this vid is all the
three<00:05:28.729> bad<00:05:28.910> shelves<00:05:29.210> that<00:05:29.330> you're<00:05:29.570> gonna<00:05:29.780> see

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
three bad shelves that you're gonna see

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.900 
three bad shelves that you're gonna see
they<00:05:30.950> all<00:05:31.100> work<00:05:32.260> obviously<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:34.070> isn't<00:05:34.639> that

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
they all work obviously it isn't that

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.480 
they all work obviously it isn't that
simple<00:05:35.300> they're<00:05:36.260> not<00:05:36.410> always<00:05:36.740> gonna<00:05:37.250> lurk

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
simple they're not always gonna lurk

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.790 
simple they're not always gonna lurk
work<00:05:38.169> but<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:39.200> wanted<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.620> show<00:05:39.889> you<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:40.100> vid<00:05:40.490> with

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
work but I wanted to show you a vid with

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.110 
work but I wanted to show you a vid with
different<00:05:42.800> dynamics<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.520> reasons<00:05:43.880> I<00:05:44.060> do

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
different dynamics and the reasons I do

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.850 
different dynamics and the reasons I do
it<00:05:44.270> but<00:05:44.960> keep<00:05:45.110> in<00:05:45.260> mind<00:05:45.289> that<00:05:45.650> they're

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
it but keep in mind that they're

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.279 
it but keep in mind that they're
obviously<00:05:46.460> I<00:05:46.789> mean<00:05:47.479> I'm<00:05:47.690> sure<00:05:47.720> you<00:05:47.960> can<00:05:48.110> figure

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
obviously I mean I'm sure you can figure

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.840 
obviously I mean I'm sure you can figure
that<00:05:48.440> out<00:05:48.500> they're<00:05:48.830> not<00:05:48.860> always<00:05:49.310> gonna<00:05:49.550> work

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
that out they're not always gonna work

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.779 
that out they're not always gonna work
but<00:05:50.660> there<00:05:51.620> are<00:05:51.650> some<00:05:52.039> good<00:05:52.190> spots<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.610> be<00:05:52.700> had

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
but there are some good spots to be had

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.060 
but there are some good spots to be had
if<00:05:53.120> you<00:05:53.150> can<00:05:53.450> if<00:05:53.840> you<00:05:54.020> can't<00:05:54.169> if<00:05:54.650> you<00:05:54.680> can<00:05:54.919> pick

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
if you can if you can't if you can pick

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:03.320 
if you can if you can't if you can pick
them<00:05:55.220> up

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.389
