00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.400 
don't have a easel at home I would go
for<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:30.609> French<00:00:30.880> easel<00:00:31.359> because<00:00:32.259> they'll

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
for the the French easel because they'll

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.850 
for the the French easel because they'll
work<00:00:32.590> as<00:00:32.770> both<00:00:33.690> well<00:00:34.690> if<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.080> want<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.380> you<00:00:35.710> can

paint<00:00:36.070> something<00:00:36.310> as<00:00:36.820> big<00:00:37.120> as<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.360> 80<00:00:38.350> by<00:00:38.590> 80

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
paint something as big as a 80 by 80

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.460 
paint something as big as a 80 by 80
centimeters<00:00:39.490> on<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.640> on<00:00:40.240> a<00:00:40.420> French<00:00:40.750> easel<00:00:41.200> while

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
centimeters on a on a French easel while

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.170 
centimeters on a on a French easel while
in<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.740> four<00:00:42.070> shot<00:00:42.280> box<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.860> really<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:45.430> mean<00:00:46.060> I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
in a four shot box not really I mean I

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.640 
in a four shot box not really I mean I
think<00:00:46.240> the<00:00:46.480> biggest<00:00:46.690> I<00:00:46.870> can<00:00:47.020> paint<00:00:47.230> on<00:00:47.320> this<00:00:47.470> is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
think the biggest I can paint on this is

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.350 
think the biggest I can paint on this is
40<00:00:47.980> by<00:00:48.100> 40<00:00:48.160> which<00:00:48.700> is<00:00:48.850> half<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.300> size<00:00:49.830> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
40 by 40 which is half the size so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.910 
40 by 40 which is half the size so
that's<00:00:52.360> one<00:00:52.540> thing<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.780> consider<00:00:53.080> between

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
that's one thing to consider between

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.970 
that's one thing to consider between
these<00:00:54.070> two<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:58.300> outside<00:00:58.930> for<00:00:59.320> outdoors

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
these two for outside for outdoors

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.020 
these two for outside for outdoors
I<00:01:00.190> kind<00:01:00.790> of<00:01:00.880> prefer<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:02.010> Ishod<00:01:03.010> box<00:01:03.370> not<00:01:03.820> only

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
I kind of prefer the Ishod box not only

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.330 
I kind of prefer the Ishod box not only
because<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.600> weights<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:05.170> quarter<00:01:05.799> of<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
because it weights a quarter of the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.669 
because it weights a quarter of the
weight<00:01:06.580> that<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:07.090> French<00:01:08.049> is<00:01:08.229> looking<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.590> have

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
weight that a French is looking to have

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:12.660 
weight that a French is looking to have
up<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.009> like<00:01:09.250> 10<00:01:09.789> kilos<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.740> weight<00:01:12.369> when

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
up to like 10 kilos in in weight when

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.539 
up to like 10 kilos in in weight when
it's<00:01:12.820> fully<00:01:13.060> loaded<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.979> one<00:01:15.250> again

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
it's fully loaded and this one again

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's fully loaded and this one again
it's<00:01:15.729> half<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:17.170> five<00:01:17.530> kilos<00:01:17.950> or<00:01:18.159> four<00:01:18.490> kilos

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
it's half it's five kilos or four kilos

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.770 
it's half it's five kilos or four kilos
it<00:01:18.999> if<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.450> take<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.810> shelves<00:01:20.170> off<00:01:20.320> even<00:01:20.619> less

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it if you take the shelves off even less

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.569 
it if you take the shelves off even less
so<00:01:22.780> this<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.499> my<00:01:23.649> go-to<00:01:23.890> when<00:01:24.189> I<00:01:24.219> go<00:01:24.429> outside

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
so this is my go-to when I go outside

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.080 
so this is my go-to when I go outside
mainly<00:01:25.530> unless<00:01:26.530> I<00:01:26.740> want<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:26.979> make<00:01:27.100> a<00:01:27.130> larger

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
mainly unless I want to make a larger

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.440 
mainly unless I want to make a larger
piece<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.020> then<00:01:29.109> I<00:01:29.259> have<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.710> take<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:30.070> one

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
piece and then I have to take this one

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.059 
piece and then I have to take this one
but<00:01:31.450> another<00:01:31.929> reason<00:01:32.170> why<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.409> like<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.829> the

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
but another reason why I like the the

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.359 
but another reason why I like the the
Prashad<00:01:33.460> better<00:01:33.759> for<00:01:34.090> outdoor<00:01:34.420> painting<00:01:34.749> is

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
Prashad better for outdoor painting is

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.550 
Prashad better for outdoor painting is
at<00:01:36.369> least<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.819> this<00:01:36.969> system<00:01:37.479> as<00:01:37.719> you<00:01:38.200> can<00:01:38.350> see

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
at least of this system as you can see

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.980
