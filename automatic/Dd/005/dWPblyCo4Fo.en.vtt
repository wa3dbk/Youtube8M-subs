I've<00:00:04.799> been<00:00:04.980> doing<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.250> for<00:00:05.430> 15<00:00:05.910> years<00:00:07.309> and

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
I've been doing this for 15 years and

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.600 
I've been doing this for 15 years and
when<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.580> dedicate<00:00:08.790> your<00:00:09.179> life<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> something

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
when you dedicate your life to something

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:25.920 
when you dedicate your life to something
you<00:00:11.610> expect<00:00:12.059> something<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.570> return

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:53.750 

I<00:00:26.020> guess<00:00:26.710> you<00:00:26.830> could<00:00:26.980> say<00:00:27.190> this<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.670> return

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.689

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and that is a little bit of probably one

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.130 
and that is a little bit of probably one
of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> gnarliest<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.539> most<00:00:57.690> decadent

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.430 
bit about the art of flight well you
know<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.880> art<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> flight<00:01:30.300> we'd<00:01:31.080> spent<00:01:31.319> two

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
know the art of flight we'd spent two

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.870 
know the art of flight we'd spent two
years<00:01:31.470> making<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.100> movie<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.520> more<00:01:32.759> than

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
years making this movie but more than

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
years making this movie but more than
that<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:33.119> think<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.080> kind<00:01:34.289> of<00:01:34.319> almost<00:01:34.500> like

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that I think it was kind of almost like

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
that I think it was kind of almost like
a<00:01:34.770> four<00:01:35.429> or<00:01:35.460> five<00:01:35.670> year<00:01:35.850> lead-up<00:01:36.240> working

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
a four or five year lead-up working

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
a four or five year lead-up working
towards<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> doing<00:01:37.409> projects<00:01:37.860> trying<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.970> get

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
towards it doing projects trying to get

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
towards it doing projects trying to get
the<00:01:39.209> production<00:01:39.360> value<00:01:39.899> anything<00:01:40.530> tighter<00:01:40.950> if

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the production value anything tighter if

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.680 
the production value anything tighter if
people<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.759> seen<00:01:41.940> that's<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.330> that's<00:01:42.450> all

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690

into<00:04:37.830> just<00:04:38.070> trying<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> get<00:04:38.430> one<00:04:38.610> shot<00:04:38.880> but<00:04:39.270> at

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
into just trying to get one shot but at

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.110 
into just trying to get one shot but at
the<00:04:39.990> same<00:04:40.140> time<00:04:40.350> too<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.590> mean<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.010> kind<00:04:41.760> of<00:04:41.910> I

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
the big thing with this film is that we

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.560 
the big thing with this film is that we
