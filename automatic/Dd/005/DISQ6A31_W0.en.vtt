another weather card that comes up or
storm<00:05:03.020> car<00:05:03.290> licensing<00:05:11.590> is<00:05:12.590> there<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:15.560> moves<00:05:15.770> up

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
storm car licensing is there it moves up

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.570 
storm car licensing is there it moves up
a<00:05:16.100> notch

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
a notch

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.530 
a notch
that<00:05:17.120> means<00:05:17.450> we're<00:05:18.230> gonna<00:05:18.380> draw<00:05:18.680> three<00:05:19.010> cards

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
that means we're gonna draw three cards

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.870 
that means we're gonna draw three cards
every<00:05:20.620> time<00:05:21.620> so<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.310> gets<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.580> little<00:05:22.700> more
