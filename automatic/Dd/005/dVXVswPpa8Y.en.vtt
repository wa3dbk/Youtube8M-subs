00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.180 
and put that a bottle layer of that
place<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.490> it'll<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.850> nice<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.360> absorb<00:02:26.050> right

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.400 

now<00:02:30.190> what<00:02:30.370> we<00:02:30.550> did<00:02:30.760> now<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.330> we'll<00:02:32.050> have<00:02:32.080> to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
now what we did now is we'll have to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.940 
now what we did now is we'll have to
spoon<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:33.370> mixture<00:02:33.910> into<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.330> piping<00:02:34.570> bag<00:02:34.950> so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
spoon this mixture into a piping bag so

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.280 
spoon this mixture into a piping bag so
just<00:02:35.980> put<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.460> into<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.880> piping<00:02:37.180> bag<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.630> fill<00:02:38.140> up

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
just put it into a piping bag to fill up

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.110 
just put it into a piping bag to fill up
it<00:02:38.500> was<00:02:38.590> much<00:02:38.770> easier<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.820> way<00:02:40.060> to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
it was much easier to do it this way to

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.370 
it was much easier to do it this way to
fill<00:02:40.510> up<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:40.840> come<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.140> Lonnie's<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:44.050> put<00:02:44.260> it

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
fill up we come to Lonnie's just put it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:53.580 
fill up we come to Lonnie's just put it
in<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.560> bit<00:02:44.710> at<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.950> time<00:02:44.980> if<00:02:45.430> you<00:02:45.460> want<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.290> all

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
pipe it through very easy to pipe it

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:11.450 
pipe it through very easy to pipe it
through<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:01.300> just<00:03:02.580> lay<00:03:03.580> them<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.240> dish

give it the generous fill them up really
I'm<00:03:15.190> going<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.730> put<00:03:15.910> them<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.180> way<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.780> can

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
I'm going to put them this way so I can

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.470 
I'm going to put them this way so I can
put<00:03:17.350> six<00:03:18.040> across<00:03:18.430> there<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.760> six<00:03:19.180> across

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
put six across there and six across

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.900 
put six across there and six across
there<00:03:19.840> there's<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.170> dozen<00:03:20.410> here<00:03:20.770> which<00:03:21.610> this

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
there there's a dozen here which this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.930 
there there's a dozen here which this
will<00:03:22.120> be<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.739> sufficient<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:24.130> filled<00:03:24.370> twelve<00:03:24.760> of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
will be a sufficient to filled twelve of

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.410 
will be a sufficient to filled twelve of
them<00:03:25.060> up<00:03:28.320> go<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:30.280> doesn't<00:03:30.640> take<00:03:30.820> long<00:03:30.850> at<00:03:31.270> all

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
going to put some of this down here fill

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.180 
going to put some of this down here fill
up<00:03:52.720> another<00:03:53.050> one<00:03:53.320> then<00:03:53.620> I'll<00:03:53.770> fill<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.100> up

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
up another one then I'll fill it up

yeah I have filled up the whole 12 of

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.110 
yeah I have filled up the whole 12 of
them<00:04:04.620> there<00:04:05.620> is<00:04:05.830> sufficient<00:04:06.069> there<00:04:06.700> there's

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
them there is sufficient there there's

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.260 
them there is sufficient there there's
plenty<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.569> ricotta<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.860> spinach<00:04:09.130> left<00:04:09.880> over

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
plenty of ricotta and spinach left over

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.180 
plenty of ricotta and spinach left over
you<00:04:10.300> can<00:04:10.390> use<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.870> core<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.740> make<00:04:11.770> something

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
you can use the core to make something

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.820 
you can use the core to make something
some<00:04:12.490> more<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.090> now<00:04:13.840> we<00:04:13.900> put<00:04:14.290> another<00:04:14.530> layer

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
some more and now we put another layer

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.190 
some more and now we put another layer
you<00:04:15.280> have<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.670> have<00:04:15.850> this<00:04:16.030> sufficient<00:04:16.870> because

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
you have to have this sufficient because

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.710 
you have to have this sufficient because
they've<00:04:17.500> got<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.829> cook<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.430> sauce<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.239> we

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
they've got to cook in this sauce so we

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.290 
they've got to cook in this sauce so we
put<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.959> nice<00:04:20.260> generous<00:04:20.970> layer<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.300> tomato<00:04:23.169> of

put a nice generous layer of tomato of

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.190 
put a nice generous layer of tomato of
the<00:04:25.300> sauce<00:04:25.570> on<00:04:25.870> top<00:04:27.419> because<00:04:28.419> they<00:04:28.810> will<00:04:29.020> have

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
the sauce on top because they will have

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.800 
the sauce on top because they will have
to<00:04:29.260> cook<00:04:29.680> now<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.669> will<00:04:30.850> have<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.150> go<00:04:31.300> into<00:04:31.690> an

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
to cook now this will have to go into an

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.470 
to cook now this will have to go into an
oven<00:04:31.960> about<00:04:32.940> 200<00:04:33.940> degrees<00:04:34.140> 180<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.620> 200<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.640> at

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
oven about 200 degrees 180 to 200 and at

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.530 
oven about 200 degrees 180 to 200 and at
least<00:04:37.750> for<00:04:38.169> at<00:04:38.440> least<00:04:38.740> for<00:04:39.130> about<00:04:39.400> 45<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.360> 50

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.740 
least for at least for about 45 to 50
minutes<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.520> they<00:04:42.520> have<00:04:42.790> to<00:04:42.910> cook<00:04:43.120> into<00:04:43.600> the

minutes so they have to cook into the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.070 
minutes so they have to cook into the
into<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.200> sauce<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.850> sufficient<00:04:46.600> there<00:04:46.810> it

into this sauce the sufficient there it

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.020 
into this sauce the sufficient there it
has<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.500> have<00:04:47.710> enough<00:04:47.740> because<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.700> has<00:04:48.880> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
has to have enough because it has to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.960 
has to have enough because it has to
absorb<00:04:49.510> it<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:49.780> will<00:04:50.020> absorb<00:04:50.169> all<00:04:50.970> that

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
absorb it it will absorb all that

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.310 
absorb it it will absorb all that
