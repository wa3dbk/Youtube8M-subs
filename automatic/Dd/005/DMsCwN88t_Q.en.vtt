rocks pot firearms and whatnot pillars
so<00:01:00.840> let's<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.410> first<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.060> is

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so let's see first what we want to do is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.850 
so let's see first what we want to do is
look<00:01:03.540> at<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> bottom<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.940> shape<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.860> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
look at the bottom the shape here this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.270 
look at the bottom the shape here this
is<00:01:08.040> its<00:01:08.220> reproductive<00:01:08.729> organs<00:01:09.649> it<00:01:10.649> opens<00:01:11.070> up

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is its reproductive organs it opens up

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.050 
is its reproductive organs it opens up
and<00:01:12.740> basically<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.160> female<00:01:14.399> anything

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and basically this is a female anything

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.820 
and basically this is a female anything
that's<00:01:15.270> round<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.899> this<00:01:16.110> nice<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> round

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that's round like this nice and round

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820 
that's round like this nice and round
it's<00:01:17.190> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> female<00:01:17.729> crab<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.830> when

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
it's going to be a female crab and when

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.850 
it's going to be a female crab and when
she<00:01:20.220> does<00:01:20.550> have<00:01:20.790> eggs<00:01:21.259> it'll<00:01:22.259> move<00:01:22.410> from<00:01:22.680> her

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
she does have eggs it'll move from her

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.820 
she does have eggs it'll move from her
body<00:01:23.100> into<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.270> area<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.960> she'll

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
body into this little area and she'll

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590 
body into this little area and she'll
move<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.190> like<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:27.030> filter<00:01:27.420> water

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
move it like this to filter water

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.969 
move it like this to filter water
through<00:01:27.960> them<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> make<00:01:28.440> sure<00:01:28.560> they're<00:01:28.770> clean

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
through them to make sure they're clean

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
through them to make sure they're clean
at<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:29.910> times<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:31.229> male<00:01:31.880> would<00:01:32.880> simply<00:01:33.539> look

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
at all times a male would simply look

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
at all times a male would simply look
probably<00:01:34.289> like<00:01:34.679> this<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.130> would<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.399> long

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
probably like this it would have a long

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.930 
probably like this it would have a long
stem<00:01:36.240> coming<00:01:36.810> down<00:01:36.959> and<00:01:37.319> a<00:01:37.740> small<00:01:38.250> oval<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
stem coming down and a small oval at the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.630 
stem coming down and a small oval at the
bottom<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> first<00:01:40.920> thing<00:01:41.069> we<00:01:41.190> want<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.459> do

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
bottom so the first thing we want to do

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.350 
bottom so the first thing we want to do
is<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.690> want<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.929> tear<00:01:43.050> this<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.270> then

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
here this little hole is where the inks

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.790 
here this little hole is where the inks
come<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.800> when<00:01:53.720> they're<00:01:54.720> fertilized<00:01:55.410> they'll

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
come out when they're fertilized they'll

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.430 
come out when they're fertilized they'll
come<00:01:56.009> into<00:01:56.160> this<00:01:56.369> little<00:01:56.670> area<00:01:56.819> and<00:01:57.440> she'll

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
come into this little area and she'll

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.020 
come into this little area and she'll
filter<00:01:58.830> them<00:01:59.009> out<00:01:59.160> until<00:01:59.640> they're<00:01:59.789> ready<00:01:59.880> to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
filter them out until they're ready to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.440 
filter them out until they're ready to
go

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
go

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.840 
go

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and you're going to high that part up

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.780 
and you're going to high that part up

this and you'll have to scrape this out
and<00:02:20.480> they'll<00:02:20.990> still<00:02:21.320> be<00:02:21.350> guts<00:02:21.680> inside<00:02:22.330> and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
and they'll still be guts inside and

you<00:02:28.760> how<00:02:29.420> clean<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:29.959> get<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.410> sure

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
you how clean you can get it and sure

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.400 
you how clean you can get it and sure
that<00:02:31.340> they'll<00:02:31.760> be<00:02:31.790> no<00:02:32.000> guts<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.959> basically<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
that they'll be no guts so basically the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.040 
that they'll be no guts so basically the
shell<00:02:33.590> you're<00:02:33.950> gonna<00:02:34.040> throw<00:02:34.280> away<00:02:34.930> now<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
shell you're gonna throw away now the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.699 
shell you're gonna throw away now the
inside<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> crab<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.160> know<00:02:38.030> have<00:02:38.239> a

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
inside of the crab you know have a

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.580 
inside of the crab you know have a
dark-colored<00:02:39.709> area<00:02:40.250> which<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:41.440> kind<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> like

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
dark-colored area which is kind of like

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.740 
dark-colored area which is kind of like
a<00:02:42.620> tendon<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.730> keeps<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.209> shell<00:02:44.540> that's

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
a tendon and it keeps the shell that's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.490 
a tendon and it keeps the shell that's
on<00:02:44.930> top<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.709> its<00:02:45.890> body<00:02:46.810> we're<00:02:47.810> gonna<00:02:47.900> scrape

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
on top to its body we're gonna scrape

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.199 
on top to its body we're gonna scrape
all<00:02:48.739> this<00:02:48.920> out<00:02:50.830> now<00:02:51.830> on<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.070> inside<00:02:52.489> you're

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
all this out now on the inside you're

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.930 
all this out now on the inside you're
going<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.390> see<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.530> guts<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:55.820> you're

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
going to see the guts and then you're

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.699 
going to see the guts and then you're
going<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> see<00:02:56.239> these<00:02:56.360> orange<00:02:57.020> things<00:02:57.080> if<00:02:57.560> it's

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
going to see these orange things if it's

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.460 
going to see these orange things if it's
a<00:02:57.800> female<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.910> what<00:02:59.840> these<00:02:59.989> orange<00:03:00.410> things

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
a female in it what these orange things

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.340 
a female in it what these orange things
are<00:03:00.950> are<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.520> eggs<00:03:01.870> now<00:03:02.870> once<00:03:03.110> they<00:03:03.230> get

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
are are the eggs now once they get

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.020 
are are the eggs now once they get
fertilized<00:03:03.890> they<00:03:04.160> move<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.610> back<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
fertilized they move to the back and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.490 
fertilized they move to the back and
they<00:03:05.090> come<00:03:05.300> back<00:03:05.480> out<00:03:05.690> like<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.110> explained

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
they come back out like I explained

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.340 
they come back out like I explained
earlier<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> side<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.060> your<00:03:08.360> crab<00:03:08.570> you're

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
earlier on the side of your crab you're

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.680 
earlier on the side of your crab you're
going<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> have<00:03:09.709> these<00:03:09.920> little<00:03:10.000> white<00:03:11.000> pieces

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
going to have these little white pieces

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.600 
going to have these little white pieces
they<00:03:12.230> look<00:03:12.410> like<00:03:12.590> me<00:03:12.830> but<00:03:13.250> they're<00:03:13.430> not

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
they look like me but they're not

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.880 
they look like me but they're not
they're<00:03:14.510> actually<00:03:14.840> lungs<00:03:15.140> or<00:03:15.380> gills<00:03:15.410> or

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
they're actually lungs or gills or

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.560 
they're actually lungs or gills or
whatever<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.280> want<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.519> call<00:03:16.700> them<00:03:16.790> okay<00:03:17.540> so

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
whatever you want to call them okay so

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.910 
whatever you want to call them okay so
you<00:03:17.780> just<00:03:17.840> want<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.110> go<00:03:18.230> ahead<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.590> rip<00:03:18.739> these

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
you just want to go ahead and rip these

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.430 
you just want to go ahead and rip these
off<00:03:21.549> right<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:23.570> then<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.870> have<00:03:24.049> these<00:03:24.170> side

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
off right and then you have these side

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.750 
off right and then you have these side
pieces<00:03:24.650> here<00:03:25.070> you're<00:03:25.190> going<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.340> break<00:03:25.580> these

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
pieces here you're going to break these

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.720 
pieces here you're going to break these
off<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.239> well

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.729 

all<00:03:30.239> right<00:03:30.450> now<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.810> get<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.140> inside<00:03:31.500> so

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
all right now you get the inside so

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.790 
all right now you get the inside so
we're<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.040> turn<00:03:32.129> our<00:03:32.190> water<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:33.800> and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
we're going to turn our water on and

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.770 
we're going to turn our water on and
this<00:03:34.950> way<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.459> make<00:03:35.700> sure<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.209> water<00:03:36.450> stream

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
this way just make sure the water stream

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.170 
this way just make sure the water stream
is<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.410> middle<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.830> crab

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.330 

you<00:03:42.510> probably<00:03:43.349> clean<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.830> any<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.129> these

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
you probably clean up any of these

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.759 
you probably clean up any of these
excesses<00:03:45.319> pieces<00:03:46.319> Michelle<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:48.379> many<00:03:49.379> cuts

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
excesses pieces Michelle and many cuts

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.789 
excesses pieces Michelle and many cuts
that<00:03:50.099> might<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.519> hanging<00:03:50.940> around<00:03:51.799> basically

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
that might be hanging around basically

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.990 
that might be hanging around basically
rub<00:03:53.069> them<00:03:53.220> off<00:03:54.860> take<00:03:55.860> off<00:03:56.010> any<00:03:56.250> excess<00:03:56.700> long

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
rub them off take off any excess long

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.770 
rub them off take off any excess long
enough

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.540 

rats

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.030 

basically<00:04:08.550> now<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.090> have<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.810> crab<00:04:10.170> it's

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
basically now you have a crab it's

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.580 
basically now you have a crab it's
completely<00:04:11.550> clean<00:04:12.060> on<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.390> inside<00:04:12.750> there's

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
completely clean on the inside there's

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.240 
completely clean on the inside there's
no<00:04:13.800> guts

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
no guts

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.220 
no guts
there's<00:04:14.850> no<00:04:15.060> lungs<00:04:15.830> but<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:17.160> problem<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:18.230> when

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
there's no lungs but the problem is when

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.039 
there's no lungs but the problem is when
you<00:04:19.380> boil<00:04:19.799> crabs<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.580> you're<00:04:20.700> using<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.180> crab

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
you boil crabs and you're using a crab

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.640 
you boil crabs and you're using a crab
boil<00:04:22.350> splicing<00:04:23.250> mix<00:04:23.820> by<00:04:24.810> washing<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.470> like

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
boil splicing mix by washing it like

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.430 
boil splicing mix by washing it like
this<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:26.220> wash<00:04:26.430> off<00:04:26.760> all<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.240> mix<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.780> now

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
this you wash off all the mix and now

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.580 
this you wash off all the mix and now
your<00:04:28.710> crab<00:04:28.950> basically<00:04:29.550> has<00:04:29.700> no<00:04:29.940> flavors<00:04:30.590> what

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
your crab basically has no flavors what

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.580 
your crab basically has no flavors what
you<00:04:31.740> could<00:04:31.920> do<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:33.270> could<00:04:33.600> clean<00:04:34.470> your

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
you could do is you could clean your

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.550 
you could do is you could clean your
crabs<00:04:34.830> out<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.370> then<00:04:36.090> use<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> boiling<00:04:37.380> mixture

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
crabs out and then use a boiling mixture

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.860 
crabs out and then use a boiling mixture
that's<00:04:38.010> probably<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> quarter<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.570> what<00:04:39.750> you

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
that's probably a quarter of what you

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.740 
that's probably a quarter of what you
would<00:04:40.020> use<00:04:40.170> normally<00:04:40.790> in<00:04:41.790> some<00:04:42.060> water<00:04:42.330> and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
would use normally in some water and

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.470 
would use normally in some water and
then<00:04:42.930> put<00:04:43.620> these<00:04:43.830> pieces<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.400> crab<00:04:44.640> back<00:04:45.060> into

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
then put these pieces of crab back into

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.260 
then put these pieces of crab back into
your<00:04:45.570> boil<00:04:45.870> for<00:04:46.410> probably<00:04:46.970> eight<00:04:47.970> three

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
your boil for probably eight three
