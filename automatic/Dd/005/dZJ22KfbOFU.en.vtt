00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.299
 Perhaps you saw our vidyashku pro 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.670
 cosmo strategy about those who made cosmo 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.130
 humble 2 strategy but no space under 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.990
 name hardwar chef breakers if not 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.880
 now and now without having one you can 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.100
 live dying out of nowhere 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.840
 hidden in the endless darkness of the mysterious 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.029
 on kickstarter began collecting 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.949
 abundant amount of money that need piles 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.090
 smart guys to create novus 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 aeterna.ru 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 and a m m arts it looks nice 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.619
 they promise something sweet too 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.270
 About the appearance of probably 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 actually our future empire 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.620
 which can belong to one of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 five times available in the game we appear 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.920
 will be in some solar system from there 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 we will begin to scatter their 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.829
 tentacles further into uncharted expanses 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.230
 space 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.149
 search for any and you can find different 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.460
 starting from the new planets from which you can 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.710
 suck out healthy juices and ending 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.989
 other big and terrible empires and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.329
 here as a planet means you can build up 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 true land battles and empires 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.289
 strangers not only to fight but also 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.879
 make friends and trade if build 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.519
 first on the planets of the mine and then 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.000
 factories then warehouses and then the market 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.520
 shipyards 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.140
 cosmo and docks is that there are now at 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.150
 It seems that the planets are limited 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 supply of minerals and also 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.909
 some different resources like so what 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.220
 Well, if there are different resources, then there will be 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.630
 wars for the rich like balls otherwise 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.330
 just do not understand why else to fight 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.430
 except how simple because of random rage 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.259
 top still screwed diplomacy which 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.570
 In general, it is directly related to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.049
 trade and the ability to unite in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.060
 alliance 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.740
 it is obviously not just mean 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.180
 initial binding to a specific 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.829
 home planet of the solar system 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.750
 despite the promised vastness 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.439
 the universe will probably live like in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.450
 communal 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.430
 so that we certainly would not be lonely in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.590
 including including it seems after 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.180
 view trailer in which the player 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.850
 fought very close to his relatives 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.579
 lands for some planet X glory to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.710
 planets under the control of the player will be many 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.990
 but guarding them all will be difficult because 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.549
 in my opinion stupid fleet restrictions 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.380
 each player will be strictly 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.850
 limited amount commander 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 Points to be absorbed 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.810
 ships when they do not remain it and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.819
 there will be a maximum fleet limit and the very 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.989
 a different ship and eat different things 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.940
 number of CP 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.140
 I think it would be better to border it 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.670
 economic power 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.530
 empire that is if you have money on 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.870
 content enough and wonderful build 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.200
 even if not then stay here in some 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.940
 frames 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.340
 besides logic, it would also give 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.630
 own and increased mass for 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.400
 there would be more interest 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.200
 nicer to fight their one huge 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.720
 empire let's say against some 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.910
 coalition just nice when through your 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.200
 gently stroking well and the ships themselves after 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.570
 how we study different technologies 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.340
 it will be possible to create discounts for oldfags 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.470
 that is, to create ships for us personally 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.940
 necessary configuration for a variety of 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.130
 goals and this is the idea of ​​developers 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.200
 should add vrt depth 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.600
 and on top of this you will need to feed and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.910
 cherishes our population to multiply it 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.030
 evict grab new planets like 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.160
 here everything is fine yes but space 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.019
 such a healthy disk space such 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.200
 healthy endless thing when it comes to 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.600
 comes about mrt especially sandbox and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.489
 all this in space is better in my opinion 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.060
 do not limit player to random one 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.530
 the planet 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.510
 where he will actually start his way 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.850
 give him the usual colonization spikes 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.739
 small code all now t1 in the middle 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.690
 fly strange wherever you want and here 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.180
 then the game would have started to appear their 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.640
 the tyranids that would fly hell knows 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.769
 where and then disappeared without a trace and its 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 type of intergalactic eldorado where 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.459
 hundreds of empires would strive because 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.660
 someone somewhere said there just 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.880
 solid deposits 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.040
 different materials about the collision between 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.170
 empires their alliances often could 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.850
 sound like enmity between really 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.250
 unique communities that 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.140
 evolved quite differently in that 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.910
 number and because let's say went there by 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.130
 another way of development and because 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.200
 let's say you had access to other minerals 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.850
 with different properties ie sandbox 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.340
 would really then be like 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.970
 sandbox but here apparently will be wrong 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.340
 moreover 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.049
 despite the fact that we are in space he 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.760
 flat until you could see one 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.860
 a ship that would not go down 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.140
 rose above the ecliptic plane like 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.640
 let's say it was in to turnover it is not 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.350
 let's say about a surprise attack 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.180
 enemy fleets 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.610
 not from the enemy base but 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.590
 sudden appearances under our base or 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.170
 over our seemingly small change but 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.650
 in fact, it is very important in pro games 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.019
 space 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.090
 0 case so far alpha so maybe 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.979
 only maybe a lot more will change and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.870
 Finally, by the interestingness of the game, you can 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.760
 will draw conclusions only when 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.430
 There will be more info about pva and 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.050
 pvp similar content will also be if 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.240
 staples and understandable this struggle with different 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.280
 other top empires will be 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.170
 represented by some cosmic and 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.180
 screws in which we can participate 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.250
 then when we want the blues and the whole thing 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.340
 well, that is, our actions will somehow 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.720
 change a certain history of the world as not yet in 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.610
 Anyway, the most important thing is to 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.770
 developers are not limited to something in 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.750
 style build a hundred ships alliance whether 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.310
 there to mine 500 tons of hell ore with 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.810
 some kind of planet like this it will be 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.610
 faintly change the galaxy 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.800
 although if then the ore will be part 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.720
 migration bomb or fleet task 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.180
 will be knocking out some other empire 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.340
 beyond its territory there would be 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.290
 nice but better see the idea of ​​old 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.900
 singles where there was something in the style of tasks for 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.940
 whole alliances starting from there protecting 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.280
 our stars from a certain infernal zirka 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.780
 similar threats and ending with how scientific 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.120
 research for which it was necessary 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.280
 find some artifacts that are hidden on 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.020
 distant planet under a layer of ice due to 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.020
 which you first need to transform 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.970
 thats like it sure was two you already 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.740
 now you can bring if interested 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.420
 money for getting into alpha 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.630
 either wait while about what is there 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.320
 we will tell and only then decide to bring 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.320
 or not
