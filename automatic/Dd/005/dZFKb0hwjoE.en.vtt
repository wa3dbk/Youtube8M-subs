guns<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.270> been<00:01:18.299> around<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.950> hundreds<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
guns have been around for hundreds of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.450 
guns have been around for hundreds of
years<00:01:20.100> 1500s<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.390> 1400s<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.229> used<00:01:22.460> guns

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
years 1500s or so 1400s they used guns

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.890 
years 1500s or so 1400s they used guns
khalaqa<00:01:23.850> buses<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.270> were<00:01:24.420> absolutely

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
khalaqa buses which were absolutely

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.429 
khalaqa buses which were absolutely
massive<00:01:25.229> Wade<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.520> 1,500<00:01:26.850> pounds<00:01:27.439> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
massive Wade you know 1,500 pounds and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.899 
massive Wade you know 1,500 pounds and
they've<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.920> through<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.750> lot<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> changes

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
they've come through a lot of changes

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.249 
they've come through a lot of changes
over<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.939> centuries<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.630> mainly<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
over the centuries and mainly at this

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.460 
over the centuries and mainly at this
point<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.670> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> gotten<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> where

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
point they have kind of gotten to where

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
point they have kind of gotten to where
there<00:01:37.470> aren't<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> many<00:01:37.829> changes<00:01:38.400> anymore

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
there aren't that many changes anymore

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.510 
there aren't that many changes anymore
the<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.840> greatest<00:01:40.409> changes<00:01:40.860> ended<00:01:41.189> probably

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the the greatest changes ended probably

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.870 
the the greatest changes ended probably
in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> early<00:01:41.729> 1900s<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.649> these<00:01:43.950> rifles<00:01:44.399> have

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
in the early 1900s so these rifles have

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.420 
in the early 1900s so these rifles have
remained<00:01:45.479> essentially<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> same<00:01:46.310> since<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
remained essentially the same since the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.539 
remained essentially the same since the
1900s<00:01:47.930> even<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.070> so-called<00:01:50.070> modern

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
1900s even this so-called modern
