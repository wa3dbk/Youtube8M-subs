00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
I'm going to show you how to read the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.830 
I'm going to show you how to read the
time<00:00:53.390> it's<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:54.719> very<00:00:54.960> simple

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
time it's really very simple

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.619 
time it's really very simple
the<00:00:57.840> inner<00:00:58.289> ring<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.710> blocks<00:00:59.149> shows<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.449> hour

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the inner ring of blocks shows the hour

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.609 
the inner ring of blocks shows the hour
and<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> gap<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.870> ring<00:01:04.140> shows<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and the gap in this ring shows the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.620 
and the gap in this ring shows the
current<00:01:04.949> hour<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.000> at<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> moment<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> can

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
current hour so at the moment you can

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.940 
current hour so at the moment you can
see<00:01:06.840> there's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> gap<00:01:07.260> at<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.530> six<00:01:07.830> o'clock

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
see there's a gap at the six o'clock

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.330 
see there's a gap at the six o'clock
position<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.439> current<00:01:10.740> hour<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.100> 6

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
position so the current hour is 6

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.980 
position so the current hour is 6
o'clock<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> large<00:01:14.909> ring<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> blocks<00:01:15.600> on

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
o'clock and the large ring of blocks on

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.520 
o'clock and the large ring of blocks on
the<00:01:16.710> outside<00:01:17.479> shows<00:01:18.479> approximate<00:01:19.229> minutes

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the outside shows approximate minutes

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.780 
the outside shows approximate minutes
and<00:01:20.090> again<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> gap<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.900> ring<00:01:22.549> shows<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and again the gap in this ring shows the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
and again the gap in this ring shows the
current<00:01:24.150> approximate<00:01:25.080> minutes<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> can

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
current approximate minutes so you can

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.670 
current approximate minutes so you can
see<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> moment<00:01:27.960> it's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
see that at the moment it's

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.850 
see that at the moment it's
approximately<00:01:29.310> 25<00:01:29.939> minutes<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
approximately 25 minutes so the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
approximately 25 minutes so the
approximate<00:01:32.340> time<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.700> 625<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> very

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
approximate time is 625 and the very

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.270 
approximate time is 625 and the very
outside<00:01:37.380> ring<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> small<00:01:38.189> dots<00:01:39.680> shows<00:01:40.680> exact

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
outside ring of small dots shows exact

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.139 
outside ring of small dots shows exact
minutes<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
minutes and you can see that at the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.920 
minutes and you can see that at the
moment<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:48.140> 23<00:01:49.140> minutes<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.659> current

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
moment it is 23 minutes so the current

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.770 
moment it is 23 minutes so the current
time<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> 623

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.500
