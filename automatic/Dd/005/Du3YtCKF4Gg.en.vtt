00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.360 
blow-dryer over top and bring it that
way<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:19.120> will<00:02:19.360> also<00:02:19.780> put<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
way and I will also put it like this and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.850 
way and I will also put it like this and
put<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.330> blow-dryer<00:02:22.660> over<00:02:22.900> top<00:02:23.140> because<00:02:23.620> that

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
put the blow-dryer over top because that

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.730 
put the blow-dryer over top because that
way<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.970> will<00:02:25.060> get<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.300> lot<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.690> body<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.560> by

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
way it will get a lot of body just by

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.490 
way it will get a lot of body just by
making<00:02:27.300> or<00:02:28.300> kind<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:28.630> forcing<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> hair

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
making or kind of like forcing the hair

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:52.400 
making or kind of like forcing the hair
in<00:02:29.620> different<00:02:29.890> directions<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:52.120> to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
in different directions I like to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.600 
in different directions I like to
straighten<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:53.590> part<00:02:53.920> as<00:02:54.010> well<00:02:54.160> because<00:02:54.430> it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
straighten this part as well because it

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.830 
straighten this part as well because it
starts<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.060> get<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> little<00:02:55.300> bit<00:02:55.600> frizzy

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.260 

okay<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:01.770> once<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.280> done<00:03:02.670> I'm<00:03:02.910> going<00:03:03.180> to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
okay so once that is done I'm going to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.000 
okay so once that is done I'm going to
section<00:03:03.690> off<00:03:03.930> my<00:03:03.989> hair<00:03:04.140> work<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.709> bottom

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
section off my hair work on the bottom

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
section off my hair work on the bottom
layer<00:03:05.160> first<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.450> first<00:03:06.599> thing<00:03:06.810> I'm

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
layer first and the first thing I'm

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.330 
layer first and the first thing I'm
going<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.650> make<00:03:07.860> sure<00:03:08.010> my<00:03:08.130> hair<00:03:08.310> is

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
going to do is make sure my hair is

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520 
going to do is make sure my hair is
almost<00:03:08.849> dry<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.750> reason<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.140> do<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.349> is

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
almost dry the reason I do that is

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.100 
almost dry the reason I do that is
because<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.069> will<00:03:11.160> take<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> lot<00:03:11.730> longer<00:03:12.110> using

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
because it will take a lot longer using

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.510 
because it will take a lot longer using
the<00:03:13.200> round<00:03:13.380> brush<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.800> make<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:13.950> dry<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
the round brush to make it dry and

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.150 
the round brush to make it dry and
rather<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:15.150> almost<00:03:15.510> dry<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.080> just<00:03:16.830> using<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
rather just almost dry it just using the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.040 
rather just almost dry it just using the
blow-dryer<00:03:17.580> then<00:03:18.269> going<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.870> round

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
blow-dryer then going with the round

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.479 
blow-dryer then going with the round
brush<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.410> blow-dryer<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.220> go<00:03:20.370> in

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
brush in the blow-dryer and then go in

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:43.640 
brush in the blow-dryer and then go in
with<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.640> straightener<00:03:42.019> okay<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.080> once<00:03:43.410> I'm

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
with the straightener okay so once I'm

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.820 
with the straightener okay so once I'm
completely<00:03:44.160> done<00:03:44.610> with<00:03:44.670> both<00:03:45.420> sides<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.620> next

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
completely done with both sides the next

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.259 
completely done with both sides the next
thing<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.040> do<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.400> take<00:03:47.580> my<00:03:47.640> straightener

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
thing I do is I take my straightener

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.710 
thing I do is I take my straightener
and<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.830> start<00:03:50.220> quickly<00:03:50.940> running<00:03:51.180> through

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
and I just start quickly running through

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.110 
and I just start quickly running through
the<00:03:51.989> strands<00:03:52.849> not<00:03:53.849> too<00:03:54.030> fast<00:03:54.330> but<00:03:56.120> you

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
the strands not too fast but you

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.910 
the strands not too fast but you
basically<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:57.599> want<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:58.080> get<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.380> hair<00:03:58.590> hot

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
basically just want to get the hair hot

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.259 
basically just want to get the hair hot
so<00:04:01.920> then<00:04:02.099> it<00:04:02.190> looks<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.549> this<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.209> not

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
so then it looks like this and it's not

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.000 
so then it looks like this and it's not
completely<00:04:03.900> straightened<00:04:04.319> I<00:04:04.560> mean<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:04.859> guys

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
completely straightened I mean you guys

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.890 
completely straightened I mean you guys
might<00:04:05.250> think<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.670> but<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.120> me<00:04:06.269> it's<00:04:06.810> not

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
might think it is but for me it's not

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.410 
might think it is but for me it's not
straight<00:04:07.320> enough<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.799> ends<00:04:08.100> are<00:04:08.250> still<00:04:09.239> a

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
straight enough the ends are still a

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.830 
straight enough the ends are still a
little<00:04:09.750> bit<00:04:09.900> curling<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.329> to<00:04:12.359> take<00:04:12.630> a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
little bit curling so I like to take a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.270 
little bit curling so I like to take a
comb<00:04:13.709> like<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:15.350> run<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.500> through<00:04:16.829> my

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
comb like this and run it through my

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.940 
comb like this and run it through my
hair<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.000> then<00:04:18.359> put<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.630> straightener<00:04:19.289> after

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
hair and then put the straightener after

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.480 
hair and then put the straightener after
it<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.880> do<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.180> really<00:04:22.109> slowly<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.919> it

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
it and I do it really slowly and it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.580 
it and I do it really slowly and it
really<00:04:23.700> helps<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.180> get<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.539> smoothness<00:04:25.380> of

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
really helps to get the smoothness of

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.620 
really helps to get the smoothness of
the<00:04:25.740> hair<00:04:27.410> makes<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.560> shinier<00:04:29.160> but<00:04:30.090> also<00:04:30.240> makes

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
the hair makes it shinier but also makes

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.400 
the hair makes it shinier but also makes
it<00:04:30.840> as<00:04:31.110> straight<00:04:31.500> as<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.770> can<00:04:31.889> possibly<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:33.410> I'm

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
it as straight as it can possibly be I'm

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.930 
it as straight as it can possibly be I'm
gonna<00:04:34.560> do<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.860> exact<00:04:35.220> same<00:04:35.250> thing<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.820> the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.700 
gonna do the exact same thing to the
middle<00:04:36.180> ear<00:04:36.330> but<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.080> top<00:04:37.260> layer<00:04:37.500> is<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.620> little

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
middle ear but the top layer is a little

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.110 
middle ear but the top layer is a little
bit<00:04:37.950> different<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.400> I'll<00:04:38.520> be<00:04:38.610> back<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.910> show

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
top layer is going to be a little bit

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.900
