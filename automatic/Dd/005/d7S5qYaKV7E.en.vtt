00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
that happened yeah okay what happened I

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.600 
that happened yeah okay what happened I
think<00:02:43.290> there's<00:02:43.440> actually<00:02:43.560> maybe<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.370> maybe

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
think there's actually maybe you maybe

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.770 
think there's actually maybe you maybe
what<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.510> thinking<00:02:45.840> cuz<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.349> game<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.709> cool

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.640 

1<00:02:51.780> &amp;<00:02:52.079> 2<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.470> one<00:02:52.739> game<00:02:53.630> yeah<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:55.470> would

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
1 &amp; 2 in one game yeah that would

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.530 
1 &amp; 2 in one game yeah that would
actually<00:02:55.920> make<00:02:56.069> sense<00:02:56.280> because<00:02:56.489> this<00:02:57.390> was

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
actually make sense because this was

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.240 
actually make sense because this was
made<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.720> 2000<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> second<00:02:58.980> movie<00:02:59.160> was

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
made in 2000 and the second movie was

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.400 
made in 2000 and the second movie was
released<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.120> something<00:03:00.360> like<00:03:00.480> 99<00:03:01.260> or

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
released in something like 99 or

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.470 
released in something like 99 or
something<00:03:01.650> or<00:03:01.769> 97<00:03:02.549> something<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> couple<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
something or 97 something a couple a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.789 
something or 97 something a couple a
couple<00:03:03.510> years<00:03:03.900> after<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.260> first<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.680> that

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
couple years after the first one so that

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.140 
couple years after the first one so that
would<00:03:04.859> make<00:03:05.010> complete<00:03:05.160> sense<00:03:05.400> actually<00:03:06.000> if

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
would make complete sense actually if

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.330 
would make complete sense actually if
they<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.900> yeah<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.709> only<00:03:07.980> halfway<00:03:08.220> through

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
they and yeah it is only halfway through

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.879 
they and yeah it is only halfway through
looks<00:03:09.000> like<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> topic<00:03:09.480> for<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.290> beating<00:03:10.590> scar

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
looks like a topic for the beating scar

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.349 
looks like a topic for the beating scar
that's<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.459> last<00:03:11.639> thing<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:11.910> they<00:03:12.090> did

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
that's like the last thing that they did

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.020 
that's like the last thing that they did
in<00:03:12.480> Lion<00:03:12.989> King<00:03:13.170> one<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.680> that's<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.639> good<00:03:14.670> that's

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
in Lion King one so that's a good that's

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.490 
in Lion King one so that's a good that's
a<00:03:16.010> perfectly<00:03:17.010> valid<00:03:17.100> point<00:03:17.609> valid<00:03:18.239> idea<00:03:19.049> if

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
a perfectly valid point valid idea if

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.410 
a perfectly valid point valid idea if
they<00:03:19.709> if<00:03:19.920> this<00:03:20.430> game<00:03:20.609> was<00:03:20.639> actually<00:03:20.940> emerged

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
they if this game was actually emerged

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.509 
they if this game was actually emerged
between<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.769> would<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.220> kind<00:03:23.370> of

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
between and that would be kind of

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.449 
between and that would be kind of
creative<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.150> mean<00:03:25.069> yeah<00:03:26.069> that's<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.280> good<00:03:26.370> idea

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
creative I mean yeah that's a good idea

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.610 
creative I mean yeah that's a good idea
actually<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.389> I<00:03:27.630> liked<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.079> I<00:03:28.290> liked<00:03:28.500> it

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
actually like and I liked it I liked it

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.930 
actually like and I liked it I liked it
I<00:03:28.680> actually<00:03:28.799> really<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.519> this<00:03:29.670> game<00:03:29.910> because

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
I actually really like this game because

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.449 
I actually really like this game because
of<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.359> fact<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.690> um<00:03:31.049> most<00:03:31.859> moody<00:03:32.220> themes

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
of the fact that um most moody themes

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.190 
of the fact that um most moody themes
they<00:03:32.790> don't<00:03:32.970> follow<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.420> movies<00:03:33.780> at<00:03:33.900> all<00:03:34.019> they

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
they don't follow the movies at all they

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
they don't follow the movies at all they
basically<00:03:34.920> they<00:03:35.220> make<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> really<00:03:36.859> topic<00:03:37.859> game

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
basically they make a really topic game

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.879 
basically they make a really topic game
of<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.880> movies<00:03:39.239> but<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.170> game<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.530> made

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
of the movies but this this game is made

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.500 
of the movies but this this game is made
around<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.370> scenes<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.880> movie<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.389> it

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
around the scenes of the movie like it

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.699 
around the scenes of the movie like it
should<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:42.870> doing<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.290> it's<00:03:43.380> you're<00:03:43.470> actually

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
should be doing and it's you're actually

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.430 
should be doing and it's you're actually
using<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.099> cutscenes<00:03:45.139> effectively<00:03:46.139> as<00:03:46.290> in

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
using the cutscenes effectively as in

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.720 
using the cutscenes effectively as in
like<00:03:46.819> showing<00:03:47.819> between<00:03:48.410> levels<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:50.069> for

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
like showing between levels but for

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.670 
like showing between levels but for
example<00:03:50.790> monsters<00:03:51.359> think<00:03:51.690> for<00:03:51.870> example<00:03:51.959> like

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
example monsters think for example like

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.620 
example monsters think for example like
those<00:03:52.919> levels<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.790> most<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.359> them<00:03:54.480> they

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
those levels that you most of them they

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.699 
those levels that you most of them they
have<00:03:54.810> absolutely<00:03:55.380> no<00:03:57.560> similarity<00:03:58.560> to

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
have absolutely no similarity to

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.150 
have absolutely no similarity to
anything<00:03:59.069> anything<00:03:59.669> in<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.819> movies

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
any other plant all the way and get back

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.990 
any other plant all the way and get back
up<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.380> here<00:04:36.860> yeah<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:37.980> basically<00:04:38.340> what<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.880> was

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
up to here yeah so basically what I was

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.670 
up to here yeah so basically what I was
just<00:04:39.060> saying<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:40.050> game<00:04:40.260> follows
