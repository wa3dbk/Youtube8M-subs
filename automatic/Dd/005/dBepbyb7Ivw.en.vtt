sense trying to shoot at the upper

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.020 
sense trying to shoot at the upper
thoracic<00:01:05.930> could<00:01:06.320> cause<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:07.010> stutter<00:01:07.490> if

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
thoracic could cause you to stutter if

thoracic could cause you to stutter if

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
the defensive situation that you need to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.780 
the defensive situation that you need to
fight<00:01:11.390> for<00:01:11.420> your<00:01:11.600> life<00:01:11.750> for<00:01:12.460> now<00:01:13.460> I'm<00:01:13.579> sure

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
fight for your life for now I'm sure

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.580 
fight for your life for now I'm sure
some<00:01:14.060> people<00:01:14.090> will<00:01:14.479> counter<00:01:14.780> that<00:01:15.259> that

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
some people will counter that that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.080 
some people will counter that that
that's<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.890> fine<00:01:16.130> theory<00:01:16.579> but<00:01:16.729> if<00:01:16.909> your

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
that's a fine theory but if your

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.700 
that's a fine theory but if your
assailant<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.570> actually<00:01:17.810> facing<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.229> head-on

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
assailant is actually facing you head-on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.760 
assailant is actually facing you head-on
then<00:01:19.490> by<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:19.909> means<00:01:20.060> shots<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.590> upper

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
then by all means shots in the upper

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.899 
then by all means shots in the upper
thoracic<00:01:21.890> area<00:01:22.399> are<00:01:22.460> going<00:01:22.579> to<00:01:22.640> be<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.790> most

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
thoracic area are going to be the most

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.399 
thoracic area are going to be the most
effective<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.509> that's<00:01:23.930> what<00:01:24.079> you<00:01:24.140> should<00:01:24.290> aim

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
effective and that's what you should aim

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.830 
effective and that's what you should aim
if<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.549> option<00:01:26.000> available<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.600> you

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
if you have that option available to you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.710 
if you have that option available to you
well<00:01:27.829> yes<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.520> no<00:01:28.700> under<00:01:29.030> those

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
well yes and no under those

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.539 
well yes and no under those
circumstances<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.649> know<00:01:30.829> a<00:01:31.009> full<00:01:31.250> frontal

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
circumstances you know a full frontal

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.530 
circumstances you know a full frontal
shot<00:01:31.610> as<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.030> were

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
shot as it were

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.420 
shot as it were
we<00:01:32.869> still<00:01:33.140> prefer<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.740> center<00:01:34.130> of<00:01:34.220> mass

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
we still prefer the center of mass

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.179 
we still prefer the center of mass
center<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.820> available<00:01:35.240> mass<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:36.680> main<00:01:36.860> reason

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
center of available mass the main reason

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.940 
center of available mass the main reason
being<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.549> no<00:01:37.909> one<00:01:38.090> stands<00:01:38.570> still<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.229> let

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
being that no one stands still and let

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.980 
being that no one stands still and let
themselves<00:01:40.100> be<00:01:40.340> shot<00:01:40.640> people<00:01:41.360> tend<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.810> be<00:01:41.960> in

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
themselves be shot people tend to be in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.260 
themselves be shot people tend to be in
motion<00:01:42.439> when<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.829> have<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.100> shoot<00:01:43.310> them<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.610> if

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
motion when we have to shoot them and if

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.510 
motion when we have to shoot them and if
you're<00:01:44.390> aiming<00:01:44.810> here<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.469> this<00:01:46.130> guy<00:01:46.310> moves

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
you're aiming here and this guy moves

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.190 
you're aiming here and this guy moves
it's<00:01:49.520> easier<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.119> miss<00:01:50.329> then<00:01:50.810> if<00:01:51.049> you're

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
it's easier to miss then if you're

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.100 
it's easier to miss then if you're
aiming<00:01:51.500> here<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.460> he's<00:01:52.670> moving<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.899> just

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
aiming here and he's moving you just
