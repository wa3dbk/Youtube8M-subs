actually form an X and that gives you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.230 
actually form an X and that gives you
your<00:01:36.420> structural<00:01:37.380> rigidity<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.670> integrity

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
your structural rigidity and integrity

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.120 
your structural rigidity and integrity
they<00:01:40.110> insert<00:01:40.500> into<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.890> little<00:01:41.280> gusset<00:01:42.210> pocket

okay that's in there go to the second
one<00:01:57.830> right<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.130> okay<00:01:59.550> that<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.880> easy<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.420> have

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
one right and okay that was easy we have

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.980 
one right and okay that was easy we have
the<00:02:00.690> second<00:02:01.200> wall<00:02:01.319> we're<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.679> do<00:02:01.860> just

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990

a<00:04:27.420> B<00:04:27.840> or<00:04:27.960> C<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:28.920> match<00:04:29.400> 8a<00:04:29.790> b<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.450> b<00:04:30.570> c

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
a B or C so you just match 8a b to b c

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:40.880 
a B or C so you just match 8a b to b c
to<00:04:31.050> c

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.670
