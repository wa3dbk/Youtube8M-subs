material for a high-carbon steel blade
the<00:00:53.610> leather<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.030> absorb<00:00:54.329> moisture<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the leather will absorb moisture and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
the leather will absorb moisture and
that<00:00:55.800> moisture<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.370> eventually<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.850> make

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that moisture is eventually gonna make

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.090 
that moisture is eventually gonna make
it<00:00:57.239> onto<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> blade<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.140> it's<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
it onto the blade and it's going to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
it onto the blade and it's going to
corrode<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.300> number<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> fact

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
corrode it so that's number one the fact

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.209 
corrode it so that's number one the fact
that<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.350> made<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.680> sheet<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> leather

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
for two reasons number one when I attach

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.470 
for two reasons number one when I attach
this<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.980> my<00:03:33.069> belt

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
and then number two is this is

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.960 
and then number two is this is
quick-release<00:03:50.590> now<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.190> won't<00:03:51.370> take<00:03:51.549> it<00:03:51.730> apart

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
quick-release now I won't take it apart

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.610 
quick-release now I won't take it apart
because<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.299> actually<00:03:52.660> comes<00:03:52.870> apart<00:03:53.230> in<00:03:53.470> two

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
because it actually comes apart in two

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.659 
because it actually comes apart in two
pieces<00:03:53.859> and<00:03:54.690> can<00:03:55.690> be<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.780> pain<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.109> put<00:03:56.260> back<00:03:56.410> in

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
pieces and can be a pain to put back in

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.270 
pieces and can be a pain to put back in
but<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.049> quick-release<00:03:59.380> also<00:04:00.040> so<00:04:00.250> I

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
but this is a quick-release also so I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.520

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
so much friction this just does not move

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
actually have to use quite a bit of

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.100 
actually have to use quite a bit of
pressure<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.950> force<00:04:38.760> it<00:04:38.940> into<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.270> sheet<00:04:39.480> but
