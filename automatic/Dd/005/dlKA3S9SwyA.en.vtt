00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
okay so this will be my review on the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.770 
okay so this will be my review on the
not<00:00:09.330> huge<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.849> master<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.240> more<00:00:12.509> things<00:00:12.780> now

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
not huge a master here more things now

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.510 
not huge a master here more things now
what<00:00:15.780> does<00:00:15.960> what<00:00:17.480> difference<00:00:18.480> from<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.520> then

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
what does what difference from this then

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:31.429 
what does what difference from this then
a<00:00:23.600> pyraminx<00:00:25.490> is<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:29.480> impairments<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
a pyraminx is that a impairments you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.540 
a pyraminx is that a impairments you
could<00:00:31.590> turn<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:32.099> tips<00:00:32.610> right<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:37.550> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
could turn these tips right here and you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
could turn these tips right here and you
would<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:41.360> but<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:44.480> regular<00:00:45.480> care<00:00:46.350> more

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
would do this but on a regular care more

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.010 
would do this but on a regular care more
things<00:00:46.860> or<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.910> maximal<00:00:48.480> thing<00:00:48.690> that's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
things or the maximal thing that's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.130 
things or the maximal thing that's
called<00:00:49.379> he's<00:00:50.280> only<00:00:52.789> turn<00:00:53.789> around<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.809> edge

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
called he's only turn around this edge

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.490 
called he's only turn around this edge
piece<00:00:57.170> like<00:00:58.170> that

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:11.510 

sorry<00:01:04.100> no<00:01:05.720> these<00:01:08.210> these<00:01:09.210> stickers<00:01:10.520> feel

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
sorry no these these stickers feel

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.920 
sorry no these these stickers feel
pretty<00:01:12.119> smooth<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.970> think<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.720> be

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
pretty smooth so I think I will be

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.640 
pretty smooth so I think I will be
placed<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.619> placing<00:01:20.070> tiles<00:01:20.540> except<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.900> little

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
placed in placing tiles except a little

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.740 
placed in placing tiles except a little
stickers<00:01:23.990> unless<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.680> baby<00:01:26.640> somehow<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> peel

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
stickers unless a baby somehow the peel

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.890 
stickers unless a baby somehow the peel
off<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:29.930> hey<00:01:31.159> yeah<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.610> can't<00:01:32.880> turn<00:01:33.720> this

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
off and hey yeah you can't turn this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.580 
off and hey yeah you can't turn this
edge<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:35.630> or<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.799> only<00:01:38.009> too<00:01:38.310> much

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
edge here or this think only too much

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.870 
edge here or this think only too much
now<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> pillow<00:01:42.899> shape

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
now as you can see this the pillow shape

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.289 
now as you can see this the pillow shape
so<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> other<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.610> messed<00:01:51.060> up

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so I think the other the other messed up

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.289 
so I think the other the other messed up
here<00:01:51.509> more<00:01:51.750> things<00:01:52.020> might<00:01:53.360> have<00:01:54.360> some<00:01:56.299> things

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
here more things might have some things

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.450 
here more things might have some things
that<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.810> wanted<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> deal<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.159> this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that we wanted to deal with and this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.499 
that we wanted to deal with and this
pyramid<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.799> turning<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.610> pretty

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
pyramid thing so the turning is pretty

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
pyramid thing so the turning is pretty
smoke<00:02:04.850> after<00:02:06.020> opening<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.489> so

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
smoke after opening it so

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:20.399 
smoke after opening it so
because<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.340> box<00:02:13.769> said<00:02:16.349> she<00:02:18.329> king<00:02:19.329> yeah

website cuz I got it from he came in the
normal<00:02:32.530> QJ<00:02:32.980> box<00:02:33.359> but<00:02:34.359> then<00:02:34.599> when<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:34.989> open<00:02:35.620> it

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
normal QJ box but then when I open it

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.300 
normal QJ box but then when I open it
from<00:02:35.889> the<00:02:36.010> box<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.810> came<00:02:38.079> in<00:02:38.139> this<00:02:38.439> box<00:02:38.769> which

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
from the box it came in this box which

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.259 
from the box it came in this box which
is<00:02:39.689> better<00:02:40.689> because<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:42.280> nice<00:02:42.669> quality

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
is better because it's nice quality

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.149 
is better because it's nice quality
doesn't<00:02:43.780> really<00:02:44.049> break<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:46.500> as<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.769> may<00:02:47.950> know

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
doesn't really break so as you may know

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.080 
doesn't really break so as you may know
this<00:02:48.959> pyramid<00:02:49.959> things<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:51.340> change<00:02:51.669> shape

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
this pyramid things can change shape

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.390 
this pyramid things can change shape
actually<00:02:52.469> so<00:02:54.090> let<00:02:55.090> me<00:02:55.209> give<00:02:55.389> me<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.569> sec<00:02:56.400> with

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
actually so let me give me a sec with

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.500 
actually so let me give me a sec with
the<00:02:57.489> cable<00:02:57.909> back<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.120> little<00:02:58.389> and<00:02:59.159> this<00:03:00.510> so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the cable back a little and this so

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.440 
the cable back a little and this so
watch<00:03:02.319> if<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.430> move<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.650> 45<00:03:05.650> degrees<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.459> mean

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
watch if I move this 45 degrees I mean

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.069 
watch if I move this 45 degrees I mean
90<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.169> can<00:03:09.040> actually<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.590> look<00:03:12.599> like<00:03:13.599> that<00:03:13.840> I

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
90 I can actually so look like that I

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.180 
90 I can actually so look like that I
can<00:03:14.290> actually<00:03:14.829> move<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.729> right<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:18.010> that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
can actually move it right here so that

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.659 
can actually move it right here so that
it<00:03:18.400> changes<00:03:18.430> shape<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:22.470> whites<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.010> adds

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
it changes shape so that whites and adds

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.729 
it changes shape so that whites and adds
quite<00:03:25.659> a<00:03:25.780> challenge<00:03:26.409> to<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:28.229> as<00:03:29.229> you<00:03:29.349> can<00:03:29.500> see

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
quite a challenge to this as you can see

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.909 
quite a challenge to this as you can see
these<00:03:30.359> all<00:03:31.359> right<00:03:31.750> here<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.169> could<00:03:32.470> see<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:32.769> they

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
these all right here I could see if they

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.949 
these all right here I could see if they
will<00:03:32.979> change<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.819> shape<00:03:33.849> even<00:03:34.299> more<00:03:36.959> like

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
will change the shape even more like

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.319 
will change the shape even more like
that<00:03:41.009> let<00:03:42.009> me<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.400> put<00:03:42.759> this<00:03:42.879> back<00:03:43.090> in<00:03:43.239> the

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
that let me just put this back in the

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.319 
that let me just put this back in the
original<00:03:43.479> position<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:45.030> don't<00:03:46.030> start

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
original position so I don't start

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.429 
original position so I don't start
trying<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:49.209> plan<00:03:49.629> to<00:03:49.659> figure<00:03:50.109> this<00:03:50.259> out

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
trying it so I plan to figure this out

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
trying it so I plan to figure this out
by<00:03:50.680> myself<00:03:50.889> I<00:03:51.870> don't<00:03:52.870> plan<00:03:53.139> on<00:03:53.199> looking<00:03:54.159> up

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
by myself I don't plan on looking up

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.289 
by myself I don't plan on looking up
YouTube<00:03:55.299> for<00:03:56.639> instructions<00:03:57.639> on<00:03:57.790> how<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.060> solve

this<00:03:58.479> because<00:03:58.659> I<00:03:58.870> want<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.139> try<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.729> figure

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:00.729 
this because I want to try and figure

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.860 
this because I want to try and figure
out<00:04:00.849> a<00:04:00.939> puzzle<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.509> my<00:04:01.689> own<00:04:02.579> so<00:04:03.579> that's<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
out a puzzle of my own so that's the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.920 
out a puzzle of my own so that's the
clear<00:04:05.109> more<00:04:05.319> things<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.479> there<00:04:07.720> anything

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
clear more things so is there anything

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.429 
clear more things so is there anything
else<00:04:08.739> will<00:04:09.489> be<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:09.819> say<00:04:10.030> oh<00:04:10.299> yeah<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.079> size

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
else will be to say oh yeah the size

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.279 
else will be to say oh yeah the size
it's<00:04:11.739> pretty<00:04:12.129> small<00:04:12.900> if<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.049> compare<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.799> a

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
it's pretty small if you compare it to a

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.729 
it's pretty small if you compare it to a
3x3<00:04:18.479> it's<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.539> little<00:04:19.840> taller<00:04:20.049> because<00:04:20.409> of<00:04:20.650> the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
3x3 it's a little taller because of the

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.590 
3x3 it's a little taller because of the
pillow<00:04:20.979> shape<00:04:21.370> let's<00:04:21.849> crack

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
pillow shape let's crack

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.150 
pillow shape let's crack
we<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.710> same<00:04:24.100> size<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:27.300> compare<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.450> to<00:04:28.720> money

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
we the same size and compare it to money

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.040 
we the same size and compare it to money
you<00:04:30.160> seen<00:04:30.460> from<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.910> store<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.720> little

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
you seen from the store just a little

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.030 
you seen from the store just a little
bigger<00:04:35.230> because<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.860> shape<00:04:36.160> but<00:04:36.630> yeah<00:04:38.040> the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
bigger because of the shape but yeah the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:49.740 
bigger because of the shape but yeah the
same<00:04:39.310> thing<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:46.380> my<00:04:47.380> megaminx<00:04:48.480> yeah<00:04:49.480> the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
same thing and my megaminx yeah the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.600 
same thing and my megaminx yeah the
stickers<00:04:50.260> are<00:04:50.560> starting<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.070> fade<00:04:51.250> away<00:04:51.490> on

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
stickers are starting to fade away on

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.700 
stickers are starting to fade away on
this<00:04:51.790> thing

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
this thing

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.640 
this thing
yeah<00:04:53.710> they're<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.130> same<00:04:54.310> price<00:04:54.670> and<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
yeah they're the same price and the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.670 
yeah they're the same price and the
pyraminx<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.760> definitely<00:04:58.300> bigger<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.610> you

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
pyraminx is definitely bigger so you

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.080 
pyraminx is definitely bigger so you
might<00:05:02.680> be<00:05:02.710> think<00:05:03.130> in<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.520> beginning<00:05:03.970> you

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
might be think in the beginning you

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.420 
might be think in the beginning you
might<00:05:04.270> be<00:05:04.420> thinking<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.770> pyramid<00:05:06.190> things

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
might be thinking of the pyramid things

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.610 
might be thinking of the pyramid things
well<00:05:06.640> big<00:05:06.850> deal<00:05:06.880> this<00:05:07.660> centerpiece<00:05:08.140> in<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
well big deal this centerpiece in the

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.080 
well big deal this centerpiece in the
middle<00:05:08.920> it<00:05:09.730> just<00:05:10.540> makes<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.560> easier<00:05:11.950> so<00:05:12.820> that's

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
middle it just makes it easier so that's

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.640 
middle it just makes it easier so that's
not<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.420> case<00:05:13.570> anymore<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:14.140> can<00:05:14.290> move<00:05:14.530> around

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
not the case anymore you can move around

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.590 
not the case anymore you can move around
the<00:05:14.830> center's<00:05:15.340> oh<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:16.000> one<00:05:16.150> more<00:05:16.180> thing<00:05:16.480> I

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
the center's oh and one more thing I

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.320 
the center's oh and one more thing I
should<00:05:16.660> mention<00:05:17.640> where<00:05:18.640> to<00:05:18.760> go<00:05:18.970> well<00:05:19.900> here<00:05:21.330> not

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
should mention where to go well here not

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:31.200 
should mention where to go well here not
wait<00:05:22.510> for<00:05:22.810> an<00:05:22.870> example<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:25.890> can<00:05:26.890> see<00:05:28.560> see<00:05:30.210> some

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
wait for an example you can see see some

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:39.770 
wait for an example you can see see some
kind<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.720> center<00:05:32.230> cap<00:05:32.500> let<00:05:32.950> me<00:05:33.070> just<00:05:33.400> oh<00:05:37.890> sorry

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
kind of center cap let me just oh sorry

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.590 
kind of center cap let me just oh sorry
my<00:05:40.780> webcam<00:05:41.560> is<00:05:42.660> bouncing<00:05:43.660> on<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:43.870> 5x5<00:05:45.600> which

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
my webcam is bouncing on the 5x5 which

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.710 
my webcam is bouncing on the 5x5 which
she'll<00:05:47.110> probably<00:05:47.590> show<00:05:47.770> me<00:05:48.010> later<00:05:48.250> so<00:05:48.720> there's

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
she'll probably show me later so there's

00:05:49.720 --> 00:06:00.870 
she'll probably show me later so there's
a<00:05:49.810> center<00:05:50.470> cap<00:05:54.870> there<00:05:58.020> see<00:05:59.020> there's<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.880> center

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
a center cap there see there's a center

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.210 
a center cap there see there's a center
cap<00:06:01.090> with<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.840> screw<00:06:02.320> in<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.590> middle<00:06:03.060> so<00:06:05.220> I'm

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
cap with the screw in the middle so I'm

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.820 
cap with the screw in the middle so I'm
assuming<00:06:06.640> that<00:06:07.470> all<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.860> these<00:06:09.750> pieces

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
assuming that all of these pieces

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.930 
assuming that all of these pieces
revolve<00:06:11.830> around<00:06:12.280> this<00:06:14.100> so<00:06:15.100> that<00:06:15.460> means<00:06:15.730> I

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
revolve around this so that means I

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.490 
revolve around this so that means I
think<00:06:15.970> that<00:06:16.870> we<00:06:17.740> can<00:06:17.890> assume<00:06:18.010> that<00:06:18.220> this<00:06:19.500> is

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
think that we can assume that this is

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.990 
think that we can assume that this is
like<00:06:20.860> this<00:06:21.520> piece<00:06:21.790> is<00:06:22.800> like<00:06:23.800> a<00:06:24.010> wedge<00:06:24.460> piece<00:06:24.820> on

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
like this piece is like a wedge piece on

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.810 
like this piece is like a wedge piece on
the<00:06:25.060> 3x3<00:06:25.860> this<00:06:26.860> -<00:06:27.190> this<00:06:27.370> -<00:06:27.430> on<00:06:27.940> this<00:06:28.150> -<00:06:29.160> yeah<00:06:30.160> and

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
the 3x3 this - this - on this - yeah and

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.470 
the 3x3 this - this - on this - yeah and
this<00:06:31.240> would<00:06:31.900> be<00:06:32.110> a<00:06:32.730> corner<00:06:33.730> this

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
this would be a corner this

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.070 
this would be a corner this
hold<00:06:36.290> on<00:06:36.470> called<00:06:36.680> centerpiece<00:06:37.430> would<00:06:37.880> be<00:06:38.090> not

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
hold on called centerpiece would be not

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.540 
hold on called centerpiece would be not
a<00:06:39.110> corner<00:06:39.500> like<00:06:40.220> one<00:06:40.490> third<00:06:40.700> of<00:06:40.880> it<00:06:41.030> also<00:06:41.720> this

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
a corner like one third of it also this

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:50.160 
a corner like one third of it also this
tip<00:06:43.550> over<00:06:43.940> here<00:06:44.270> and<00:06:45.520> this<00:06:46.520> centerpiece<00:06:47.980> so

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
tip over here and this centerpiece so

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.560 
tip over here and this centerpiece so
yeah<00:06:51.170> maybe<00:06:51.920> I<00:06:52.100> can<00:06:52.520> adjust<00:06:52.880> attention<00:06:53.420> on

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
yeah maybe I can adjust attention on

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.430 
yeah maybe I can adjust attention on
here<00:06:53.870> but<00:06:54.200> it's<00:06:55.130> a<00:06:55.310> QJ<00:06:55.640> I<00:06:56.030> tried<00:06:56.390> doing<00:06:56.810> down<00:06:57.140> my

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
here but it's a QJ I tried doing down my

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.340 
here but it's a QJ I tried doing down my
megaminx<00:06:58.120> which<00:06:59.120> is<00:06:59.330> in<00:06:59.540> also<00:06:59.990> in<00:07:00.110> bad<00:07:00.320> shape

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
megaminx which is in also in bad shape

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.410 
megaminx which is in also in bad shape
but<00:07:02.170> yeah<00:07:03.170> it<00:07:03.500> won't<00:07:03.680> really<00:07:04.310> adjust<00:07:05.300> the

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.420 
but yeah it won't really adjust the

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.570 
but yeah it won't really adjust the
tensions<00:07:05.900> a<00:07:06.020> lot<00:07:07.510> so<00:07:08.830> guess<00:07:09.830> that's<00:07:10.310> all<00:07:10.550> I

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
tensions a lot so guess that's all I

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.120 
tensions a lot so guess that's all I
want<00:07:10.700> to<00:07:10.850> say<00:07:11.090> for<00:07:11.390> at<00:07:11.450> all<00:07:11.650> for<00:07:12.650> more<00:07:12.860> things

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
want to say for at all for more things

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.930 
want to say for at all for more things
so<00:07:13.930> bye
