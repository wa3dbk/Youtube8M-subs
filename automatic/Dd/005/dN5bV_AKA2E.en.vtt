00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello guys here we are in the company of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.320
 an ipad 3 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:17.470
 and of the aluminum keyboard since it is 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.020
 a question that often recurs we go to 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.890
 see how to associate away 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.829
 bluetooth 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.960
 the iPad 3 with this one with this keyboard 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:30.009
 in general they are inscriptions that are valid 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.929
 also for keyboards the like for example 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.129
 those integrated into this skin team 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:41.040
 then the first thing to do 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:44.019
 naturally go into ipad and generals 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.409
 bluetooth make sure that nasty and 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.019
 be active as in this case this 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.830
 point the second thing to do is 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:56.489
 make sure the keyboard is in 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.489
 position on 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:07.180
 as can be seen, the peering led blinks 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 mating in case you don't 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.020
 flashes if it would automatically be 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.550
 just press the connect button 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.890
 here to the side 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.140
 in our case it is already flashing then not 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.020
 no need to go to press 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.450
 italy and in the meantime the ipad 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.830
 which was the search for devices 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.720
 produced to connect to already found 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.810
 has already found ours 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.009
 our external device for 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.409
 associate we stop here and the iPad there 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.350
 says to insert a pin in this 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.080
 camping of 4 numerical digits 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.720
 generally in this case 92 92 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.229
 then we go to the keyboard 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:00.259
 type 92 92 which we give hayter which 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.930
 practically the connection is made 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.920
 completely configured to be able to 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:11.959
 begin between quote fact 6a prof 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.700
 note how come the associated keyboard that 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.700
 I can start writing 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.790
 now let's see some settings 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.150
 recommended with the use of this 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.989
 keyboard that we repeat a keyboard 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.030
 international going to write yes 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.109
 see that if we leave the setting 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.150
 ipad base there is external keyboard 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:40.700
 Italian some symbols not 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.489
 will coincide if in fact or I go to 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.090
 press to the people to exit it 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.430
 stressed the point is correct though if 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.170
 I want to ask the question mark out 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.880
 a different lighthouse character then that 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.709
 what needs to be done let's go into the 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:04.609
 general keyboard keypad settings 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.959
 International 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.870
 let's add the new keyboard 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.030
 in fact it is installed for the moment only 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.370
 from the row in Italian 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.079
 let's add the keyboard in language 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:22.450
 English so we can at this point 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.450
 return to our blog 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.590
 the iPad has now installed 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.870
 two Italian and English keyboards for 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.090
 move from one to the other 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.370
 you have to press this button here the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.930
 button in the world 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.060
 and in fact that shows us that in this 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.510
 moment in the seed will be the Italian from 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.959
 now instead we use the coding for i 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.330
 character in English indeed as yes 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.930
 see now there is perfect correspondence 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:57.450
 among the symbols on the buttons on the keys 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.450
 those that are reproduced on 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.459
 display 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.440
 but let's be careful what you do 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.190
 see here we have disabled 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.989
 self-correction because by setting one 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.959
 english keyboard and holding 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.600
 active self-correction 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.229
 of course if we write in Italian 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.549
 the ipad will correct 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.070
 in short, it went to highlight all the 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.680
 Italian words that we write another 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.160
 which often comes from who is and how it is 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.900
 does how do you produce a character 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.300
 accented with a keyboard 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.020
 international that has no letters 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.110
 accented and is very simple it is 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.620
 sufficient before beating a character 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.039
 special a special apex and then the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:51.520
 letter that you want to go to ascertain 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.380
 for example if I want to do never accepted 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.710
 I insert this character as a child 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.210
 special that a superscript and then the letter is 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.350
 to insert the special character 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:06.580
 just press simultaneously 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.880
 high option and the letter and I go precisely 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.530
 to insert this this apex here 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.460
 special so I want to produce no 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:24.710
 centered care here is therefore high 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:28.180
 I produce accented work and so on 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.180
 and very simple
