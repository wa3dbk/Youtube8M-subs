00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
going to be a very difficult game

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:04.450 
going to be a very difficult game
because<00:07:03.410> as<00:07:03.530> you<00:07:03.650> can<00:07:03.710> see<00:07:03.800> by<00:07:04.069> their<00:07:04.220> squad

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
because as you can see by their squad

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.980 
because as you can see by their squad
they<00:07:04.550> do<00:07:04.639> have<00:07:04.759> a<00:07:04.789> very<00:07:05.240> very<00:07:05.419> strong<00:07:05.599> squad

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
they do have a very very strong squad

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.749 
they do have a very very strong squad
that<00:07:06.410> you<00:07:06.590> have<00:07:06.710> Dwight<00:07:06.979> Gayle<00:07:07.280> as<00:07:07.490> well<00:07:07.639> so

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 
that you have Dwight Gayle as well so

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.670 
that you have Dwight Gayle as well so
that<00:07:07.880> actually<00:07:07.940> brought<00:07:08.330> him<00:07:08.479> in<00:07:08.630> as<00:07:08.780> I<00:07:08.840> was

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
that actually brought him in as I was

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.839 
that actually brought him in as I was
actually<00:07:09.800> looking<00:07:09.979> to<00:07:10.190> buy<00:07:10.430> him<00:07:10.580> but

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849 
actually looking to buy him but

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:12.700 
actually looking to buy him but
obviously<00:07:11.300> if<00:07:11.479> Southampton<00:07:12.319> just<00:07:12.530> brought

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
obviously if Southampton just brought

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.960 
obviously if Southampton just brought
him<00:07:12.800> we're<00:07:13.310> not<00:07:13.430> going<00:07:13.550> to<00:07:13.610> be<00:07:13.669> able<00:07:13.699> to<00:07:13.880> do

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970 
him we're not going to be able to do

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.310 
him we're not going to be able to do
that<00:07:14.120> but<00:07:14.330> we<00:07:14.389> actually<00:07:14.449> played<00:07:14.810> a<00:07:14.840> weakened

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320 
that but we actually played a weakened

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.529 
that but we actually played a weakened
squad<00:07:15.590> in<00:07:15.770> this<00:07:15.889> one<00:07:16.099> during<00:07:16.490> due<00:07:17.210> to<00:07:17.330> the<00:07:17.389> fact

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.130 
that we had our strongest squad out up

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.010 
that we had our strongest squad out up
against<00:07:19.580> West<00:07:19.910> Ham<00:07:20.000> but<00:07:20.539> we<00:07:20.630> do<00:07:20.720> get<00:07:20.840> good
