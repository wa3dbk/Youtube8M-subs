00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
is the flip side HD is actually now

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.559 
is the flip side HD is actually now

it's finally available for 279 dollars
now<00:03:36.329> basically<00:03:36.569> this<00:03:37.019> looks<00:03:37.349> exactly<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
now basically this looks exactly the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.009 
now basically this looks exactly the
same<00:03:37.920> from<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.430> outside<00:03:38.849> except<00:03:39.389> when<00:03:39.840> you're

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
same from the outside except when you're

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.690 
same from the outside except when you're
actually<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.650> recording<00:03:41.069> mode<00:03:41.280> there's<00:03:41.609> a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
actually in the recording mode there's a

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.520 
actually in the recording mode there's a
touch<00:03:42.150> screen<00:03:42.329> now<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.870> reason<00:03:43.169> this<00:03:43.470> is

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
touch screen now the reason this is

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.069 
touch screen now the reason this is
actually<00:03:43.950> called<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.190> flip<00:03:44.519> slide<00:03:45.090> HD<00:03:45.900> is

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
actually called the flip slide HD is

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.199 
actually called the flip slide HD is
because<00:03:46.530> there's<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.859> slide-out<00:03:47.400> screen<00:03:47.970> it's

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
because there's a slide-out screen it's

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.240 
because there's a slide-out screen it's
a<00:03:48.599> 3-inch<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.440> slide-out<00:03:49.709> screen<00:03:50.099> is

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
a 3-inch the slide-out screen is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.830 
a 3-inch the slide-out screen is
actually<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.730> used<00:03:50.940> for<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.180> playback<00:03:51.599> and

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
actually just used for the playback and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.270 
actually just used for the playback and
there's<00:03:52.019> actually<00:03:52.349> another<00:03:52.590> screen<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
there's actually another screen on the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.039 
there's actually another screen on the
outside<00:03:53.609> it's<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.060> resistive<00:03:54.540> touchscreen

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
outside it's a resistive touchscreen

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.539 
outside it's a resistive touchscreen
that<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.349> can<00:03:55.500> use<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.799> record<00:03:55.950> your<00:03:56.430> video

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
that you can use to record your video

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.789 
that you can use to record your video
and<00:03:56.760> all<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.569> just<00:03:58.049> like<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.530> older

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
and all of that just like on the older

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.379 
and all of that just like on the older
flip<00:03:59.010> models<00:03:59.340> there<00:03:59.579> was<00:03:59.609> physical<00:03:59.910> buttons

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
flip models there was physical buttons

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.370 
flip models there was physical buttons
there<00:04:00.569> but<00:04:00.750> now<00:04:00.840> there's<00:04:01.079> actually<00:04:01.349> a

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
there but now there's actually a

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.259 
there but now there's actually a
resistive<00:04:01.829> touchscreen<00:04:02.280> now<00:04:02.609> for<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.880> actual

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
resistive touchscreen now for the actual

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.729 
resistive touchscreen now for the actual
hardware<00:04:03.660> on<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.900> device<00:04:04.139> there<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.709> a

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
hardware on this device there is a

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.220 
hardware on this device there is a
headphone<00:04:05.430> jack<00:04:05.760> stereo<00:04:06.269> speakers<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.079> an

everything<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.810> exactly<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.380> same<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
everything is exactly the same just the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.949 
everything is exactly the same just the
hardware<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.669> new<00:04:21.030> camera<00:04:21.419> is<00:04:21.510> completely

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
hardware on the new camera is completely

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.480 
hardware on the new camera is completely
different<00:04:22.320> now<00:04:22.530> there's<00:04:22.770> actually<00:04:23.070> 16

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
different now there's actually 16

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.310 
different now there's actually 16

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
gigabytes of storage as well and that's

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.629 
gigabytes of storage as well and that's
capable<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.830> recording<00:04:26.130> for

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
capable of recording for

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.920 
capable of recording for
or<00:04:26.699> ours<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.270> anyways<00:04:27.659> guys<00:04:27.870> that's

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
or ours but anyways guys that's

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.689 
or ours but anyways guys that's
