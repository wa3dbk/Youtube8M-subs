00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.600
 yet besides, I refused to go to court 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 turned 18 years old in a big city 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.259
 they told him his words 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.099
 high 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.339
 chicago marathon country 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.339
 went well 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.989
 as far as is known is very complicated 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.030
 45 days 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.140
 how many days 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.010
 just for investors 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.000
 authorities 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.250
 but the fact that in fact people live like here I think 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.210
 swaying reveals stage 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.720
 Well, no, we have here and together 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.120
 other people 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 to other people 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.720
 in the garden partnership 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.880
 court 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.880
 many people 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160
 that is, in the year something that is hardly anymore 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.840
 only what is it of course is it in the past 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.540
 what they say we will take more 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.020
 most 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.390
 such comrades that Medvedev has 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.960
 so how else 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.090
 you hardly believe it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.020
 if this were not 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.830
 on the export of private capital 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.130
 it is seen 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.140
 for this, nothing would seem to be for everything 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.590
 I did not see the service time 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.840
 happened if something was done wrong 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.900
 only concerned 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.810
 unknown yet say 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.130
 flour 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 and the one that good luck to help your car 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.720
 other media 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.280
 share occupy production in 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.390
 far abroad 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 and so simple 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.369
 so far the beginning of the year they will act 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.020
 no one there is no such 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.800
 never seen that 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.440
