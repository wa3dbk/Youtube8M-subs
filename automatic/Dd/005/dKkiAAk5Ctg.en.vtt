00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.039
 staff today then we will study 

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:08.010
 leg muscles 

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:10.320
 it divides the leg into anterior portions 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.120
 lateral and posterior 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.670
 Let's start the muscles of the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 anterolateral region of the first stone 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.140
 previous after christmas 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.140
 come on then note that the following 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 look at this muscle that originated there in the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 one side of the tibia 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.070
 on the tibia to insert there in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 uniform medial there in the region of tatuapÃ© 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.950
 then this muscle here we will 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.050
 call the anterior tibial and arrived 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.329
 passing the forceps is a tibial muscle 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.920
 that you can see all over the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.989
 extension 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.780
 Good , I'll turn the piece right here on my 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.219
 direction 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.950
 laterally with origin also in the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 material set of the lateral tibia 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.300
 anterior tibial 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.110
 this muscle here is the path of it goes 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.379
 if it opens in tendons of the four fingers 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.989
 sides 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.970
 then this is the long extensor of the fingers 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.799
 I'm going to put a pin here on TB. 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.060
 and I will put a pin on the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:23.100
 extended along the fingers to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:26.909
 to differentiate well before and now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.369
 yellowing long extensor days 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.780
 boot from the origin and it is clear to 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.930
 difference between the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.299
 lateral extensor of the fingers 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 I open between the two boys look here 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.700
 I open between the two and see yourself a musician. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.670
 deep and threw itself along the hallux 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.670
 long extensor album got him the front 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.780
 to put it on this beginning, I'm going 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:01.829
 change the color to be clear then these 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.180
 three monsters who are talking to the 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.249
 anterior has thrown shoulders since yellow 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.849
 this is so long of the hallux with pin 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.849
 dark 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:20.320
 I am one of the fingers the effect very well I go 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.450
 take the pins right we can 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.120
 see now lateral side of the leg 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.860
 look at the origin of the fibula head 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.770
 this musician that his path and the fibula 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.730
 long and deep to him 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.630
 or the short fibular in all its extension 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.880
 look what a good part these people jump long 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.790
 and short fibular both are and reversers 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.040
 of the foot making the inversion of the pt stated 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.400
 where to close this piece at the request of 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.720
 bial makes our reflection and 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:07.710
 inversion ankle extension over the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:11.140
 fingers and three vans or long hallux 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.940
 the part turned laterally origin in 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.340
 Head affego fibula honor reverser 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.490
 deep he simulated short too 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.490
 ederson there closed that part
