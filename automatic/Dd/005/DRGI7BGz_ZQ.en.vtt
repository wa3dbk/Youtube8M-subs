00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
guess and normally we have something

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.439 
guess and normally we have something
formerly<00:00:53.320> like<00:00:54.309> Rick<00:00:54.580> planned<00:00:54.940> or<00:00:55.239> whatever

formerly like Rick planned or whatever

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.880 
formerly like Rick planned or whatever
but<00:00:55.660> we<00:00:55.780> thought<00:00:55.930> we<00:00:56.050> just<00:00:56.260> record<00:00:56.620> this<00:00:56.650> one

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
but we thought we just record this one

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.990 
but we thought we just record this one
in<00:00:56.980> fans<00:00:57.720> super<00:00:58.720> fancy<00:00:59.710> but<00:01:00.579> we<00:01:00.670> just<00:01:00.850> thought

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
in fans super fancy but we just thought

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.970 
in fans super fancy but we just thought
we'd<00:01:01.150> do<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> quick<00:01:01.839> little<00:01:02.079> video<00:01:02.290> here<00:01:02.470> and

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
we'd do a quick little video here and

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.710 
we'd do a quick little video here and
