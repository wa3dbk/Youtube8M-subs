00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello army bowler 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:25.160
 everyone knows what it is 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.039
 there can be no doubt got yourself 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.239
 a bowler I had exactly the same 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.840
 got to somewhere 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.510
 an old one has come to purchase this 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.430
 good 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:47.180
 worth a penny in our lives but we 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:50.860
 thing very well, as the need of the need to 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.009
 she does not need at all as for me so 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.229
 the need is very i think is useful 

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.600
 me in my forays into the forest for 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:03.860
 cooking something warmed up 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.479
 cook i think i will have and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.670
 any other mowers 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.909
 but as I am now that it is more 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.210
 tight became engaged so I decided 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.670
 start with that 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.970
 army pot in a few words about 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.160
 pot 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.160
 such a pot was put into service 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.620
 food service soviet 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:38.060
 Union after the Great Patriotic War 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:43.070
 and has similarity with German 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.070
 representative of this model 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:53.310
 is a just such a capacity with 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:59.119
 one side top lid which 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.130
 use as a griddle and pen clamp 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.130
 here here there is such here 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.509
 here's a slot in the metal bow so 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.640
 let's say yes the spoon is inserted 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.600
 the volume of the top cover is somewhere 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.400
 half a liter in it is convenient what to do 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.010
 heat food or fry something 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.480
 The second part is the basic fact itself 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.050
 as a pot the volume here is 1 and 3 liters 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.050
 about 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.780
 the pot is made of food grade aluminum 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:44.310
 and painted here in such a protective 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:48.550
 the color is on top of wire 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.880
 Well, I must pay tribute to this package 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.600
 stand to ferment 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.860
 food service of our army already 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.860
 several decades 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.379
 long term 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:13.159
 and this model is very successful used 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.319
 not only military and tourists 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.610
 hunters 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.040
 Of course there are many options that 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.280
 now there are foreign 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:29.590
 lighter options more practical with 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:34.760
 flash drives but i think that this model 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:39.019
 deserves special attention at least 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:44.410
 even because the price is here we just 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.410
 funny and compared with other counterparts 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.440
 I enjoyed so well that I am a bowler 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.459
 I can say 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.489
 normal snare on the fire there as well 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.950
 any any dishes for smoked 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.459
 over time, I think it's okay 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.640
 so here is such a thing 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.650
 near future near future 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.280
 will test the full shall weld soup yet 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.549
 anything comes he can see without 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.990
 glitters in grease everything is as it should be 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.550
 that something like this 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:34.410
 on it I say goodbye to you and for all that 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:37.560
 said about him on this i say goodbye to you 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.560
