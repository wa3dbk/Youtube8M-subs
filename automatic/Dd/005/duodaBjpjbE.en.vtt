00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.190 
know if I'm exactly the person to be
speaking<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.100> but<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.780> feel<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.049> have

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
speaking on this but I feel like I have

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
speaking on this but I feel like I have
enough<00:01:10.439> insight<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.460> I've

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
enough insight because you know I've

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370 
enough insight because you know I've
been<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:11.939> long<00:01:12.360> enough<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.170> speak

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
been here long enough to I kind of speak

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.320 
been here long enough to I kind of speak
on<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.650> matter<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.430> feel<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.090> Boop

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
on this matter but I feel like Boop

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.460 
on this matter but I feel like Boop
could<00:01:15.600> answer<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.380> better

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
could answer this a little bit better

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.810 
could answer this a little bit better
and<00:01:16.740> maybe<00:01:16.890> he'll<00:01:17.100> make<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> video<00:01:17.490> explaining

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and maybe he'll make a video explaining

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
and maybe he'll make a video explaining
it<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.409> needs<00:01:19.770> all

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it but I don't think it really needs all

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.200 
it but I don't think it really needs all
that<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.189> explaining<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.970> pretty

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
that much explaining because it's pretty

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
that much explaining because it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> most<00:01:22.740> part<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
straightforward for the most part I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.620 
straightforward for the most part I
think<00:01:23.939> saying<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.020> were<00:01:25.049> promises<00:01:25.740> is

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
think saying that they were promises is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.410 
think saying that they were promises is
is<00:01:27.630> saying<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.229> much<00:01:28.470> because<00:01:28.710> F<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.670> play

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is saying a bit much because F I play

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
is saying a bit much because F I play
the<00:01:30.540> game<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.350> love<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.920> we're

being able to do it we're just not gonna

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.420 
being able to do it we're just not gonna
do<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.409> we've<00:01:37.710> never<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.189> think<00:01:38.340> we've

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
do it we've never I don't think we've

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
that important on the back burner

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.680 
that important on the back burner
because<00:03:16.460> you<00:03:16.760> don't<00:03:16.970> want<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.270> half-ass

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
because you don't want a half-ass

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.790 
because you don't want a half-ass
something<00:03:18.080> like<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.440> don't<00:03:18.590> want<00:03:18.740> to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
something like that you don't want to

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.690 
something like that you don't want to
take<00:03:18.980> home<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.430> say<00:03:19.610> um<00:03:20.740> okay<00:03:21.740> Boop<00:03:21.950> do<00:03:22.490> home

take home and say um okay Boop do home

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.460 
take home and say um okay Boop do home
it's<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.270> now<00:03:23.390> it's<00:03:23.540> all<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.020> up<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.350> you

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
it's you now it's all just you up to you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.160 
it's you now it's all just you up to you
you<00:03:24.890> can't<00:03:25.100> do<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.400> because<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:26.240> there's<00:03:27.080> a

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
you can't do that because it's there's a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.430 
you can't do that because it's there's a
structure<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.650> home<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.790> needs<00:03:29.440> at

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
structure to home and it needs at

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.830 
structure to home and it needs at
minimal<00:03:31.430> three<00:03:31.790> people<00:03:32.090> working<00:03:32.270> on<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.690> at

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
minimal three people working on it at

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.300 
minimal three people working on it at
all<00:03:32.900> times<00:03:33.260> because<00:03:33.530> if<00:03:33.740> you<00:03:33.830> take<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:34.070> one

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
all times because if you take just one

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.520 
all times because if you take just one
person<00:03:34.880> do<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:35.300> thing<00:03:35.330> it's<00:03:36.110> going<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.350> have

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
person do one thing it's going to have

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.800 
person do one thing it's going to have
that<00:03:37.430> straight<00:03:37.880> linear<00:03:38.150> path<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.720> you're

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
that straight linear path and you're

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.060 
that straight linear path and you're
going<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:38.990> expect<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.410> every<00:03:39.620> time<00:03:39.770> if<00:03:39.980> you

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
going to expect it every time if you

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.320 
going to expect it every time if you
look<00:03:40.250> at<00:03:40.370> home<00:03:40.520> videos<00:03:40.850> you'll<00:03:41.000> see<00:03:41.209> that

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
look at home videos you'll see that

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.640 
look at home videos you'll see that
there<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.630> structure<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.410> but<00:03:42.560> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
there is a structure to it but the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.000 
there is a structure to it but the
structure<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.130> like<00:03:44.620> something<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.800> you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
structure is like something that you

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.800 
structure is like something that you
can't<00:03:46.250> really<00:03:46.459> control<00:03:46.850> if<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.420> makes<00:03:47.630> sense

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
can't really control if that makes sense

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.470 
can't really control if that makes sense
it's<00:03:48.080> a<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:49.489> could<00:03:49.640> tell<00:03:49.820> multiple<00:03:50.270> people

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
it's a you could tell multiple people

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.840 
it's a you could tell multiple people
work<00:03:50.600> on<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:50.930> can<00:03:51.050> tell<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.739> lot<00:03:52.730> of

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
work on it you can tell that a lot of

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.280 
work on it you can tell that a lot of
heart<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.209> soul<00:03:53.450> went<00:03:53.660> into<00:03:53.810> those<00:03:53.959> videos

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
heart and soul went into those videos

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.410 
heart and soul went into those videos
and<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.980> don't<00:03:55.160> want<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.520> half-ass<00:03:55.940> heart<00:03:56.300> and

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
and you don't want a half-ass heart and

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.449 
and you don't want a half-ass heart and
soul<00:03:56.570> videos<00:03:56.900> because<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.560> end<00:03:57.590> it'll

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
soul videos because in the end it'll

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.890 
soul videos because in the end it'll
just<00:03:58.760> end<00:03:58.910> up<00:03:59.090> shit<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.570> then<00:03:59.660> people<00:03:59.780> like

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
just end up shit and then people like

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.470 
just end up shit and then people like
what<00:04:00.350> happened<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:00.920> it's<00:04:01.880> better<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.330> have

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
what happened and it's better to have

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.680 
what happened and it's better to have
the<00:04:02.750> old<00:04:02.930> stuff<00:04:03.580> there<00:04:04.580> and<00:04:04.940> be<00:04:05.480> beautiful

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
the old stuff there and be beautiful

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.250 
the old stuff there and be beautiful
rather<00:04:06.380> than<00:04:06.620> cloud<00:04:07.550> it<00:04:07.760> with<00:04:07.940> new<00:04:08.750> stuff

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
rather than cloud it with new stuff

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.590 
rather than cloud it with new stuff
that's<00:04:09.320> not<00:04:09.620> as<00:04:09.950> good<00:04:10.190> it's<00:04:10.940> kind<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.270> like<00:04:11.330> if

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
that's not as good it's kind of like if

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.960 
that's not as good it's kind of like if
a<00:04:11.750> really<00:04:12.170> good<00:04:12.320> band<00:04:12.530> makes<00:04:13.130> a<00:04:13.250> shit<00:04:13.459> album<00:04:13.790> it

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
a really good band makes a shit album it

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.190 
a really good band makes a shit album it
makes<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.270> hate<00:04:14.390> that<00:04:14.630> band<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:14.989> you<00:04:15.050> don't

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
makes you hate that band and you don't

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.180 
makes you hate that band and you don't
even<00:04:15.290> want<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.530> listen<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.770> the<00:04:15.860> old<00:04:15.980> stuff

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
even want to listen to the old stuff

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.620 
even want to listen to the old stuff
because<00:04:16.400> you've<00:04:16.520> lost<00:04:16.700> respect<00:04:17.000> for<00:04:17.239> them<00:04:17.480> in

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.840 
because you've lost respect for them in
that<00:04:18.230> sense<00:04:18.560> that's<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.250> think<00:04:19.580> that's<00:04:19.730> the
