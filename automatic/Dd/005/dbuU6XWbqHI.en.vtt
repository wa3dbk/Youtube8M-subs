this is the best way I guarantee it so
this<00:00:14.219> method<00:00:14.429> worked<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> complete<00:00:15.599> group

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
this method worked with a complete group

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.140 
this method worked with a complete group
of<00:00:16.170> randoms<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.039> never<00:00:17.279> really<00:00:17.609> play<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
of randoms I never really play with a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.170 
of randoms I never really play with a
core<00:00:18.480> group<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.960> usually<00:00:19.439> go<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.619> lfg<00:00:20.279> pick<00:00:21.029> up

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
core group I usually go on lfg pick up

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910 
core group I usually go on lfg pick up
some<00:00:21.359> random<00:00:21.660> people<00:00:22.020> teach<00:00:22.260> them<00:00:22.500> what<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> do

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
the sword and getting him down the only

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.960 
the sword and getting him down the only
difference<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.739> need<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.400> watch<00:03:25.670> his

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
difference is you need to watch his

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.319 
difference is you need to watch his
health<00:03:26.239> at<00:03:26.540> about<00:03:27.109> ten<00:03:27.859> to<00:03:28.220> fifteen<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.970> twenty
