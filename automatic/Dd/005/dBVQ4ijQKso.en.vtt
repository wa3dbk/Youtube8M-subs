00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the reason why I'm doing that is because

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
the reason why I'm doing that is because
this<00:01:56.520> particular<00:01:56.729> mike<00:01:57.119> has<00:01:57.360> output<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:57.990> well

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this particular mike has output as well

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
this particular mike has output as well
and<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.860> didn't<00:01:59.040> want<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> attach<00:01:59.520> an<00:01:59.700> external

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and I didn't want to attach an external

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.249 
and I didn't want to attach an external
speaker<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> microphone<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.049> order<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
speaker to the microphone in order to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.560 
speaker to the microphone in order to
play<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> back<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.920> easier<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> use<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
play it back it's just easier to use the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
play it back it's just easier to use the
iPad<00:02:03.570> speaker<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.409> play<00:02:04.560> things<00:02:04.740> back<00:02:04.979> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
iPad speaker to play things back and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190 
iPad speaker to play things back and
hopefully<00:02:05.820> we'll<00:02:06.329> hear<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> difference<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
hopefully we'll hear the difference it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.889 
hopefully we'll hear the difference it
should<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.710> only<00:02:07.860> recorded<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.390> Yeti<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
should have only recorded on the Yeti so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.869 
should have only recorded on the Yeti so
if<00:02:10.289> anything<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> beginning<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.790> this

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
if anything at the beginning of this

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.240 
if anything at the beginning of this
particular<00:02:12.360> recording<00:02:12.959> will

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
particular recording will

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.040 
particular recording will
softer<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:14.420> go<00:02:14.540> let's<00:02:14.660> turn<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.990> all

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
softer so here we go let's turn it all

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:24.010 
softer so here we go let's turn it all
the<00:02:15.110> way<00:02:15.200> up<00:02:19.210> pretty<00:02:20.210> soft<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> Yeti

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
the way up pretty soft this is the Yeti

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.400 
the way up pretty soft this is the Yeti
I'm<00:02:24.290> talking<00:02:24.890> directly<00:02:25.280> into<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.580> mic<00:02:25.760> and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
I'm talking directly into the mic and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.100

go

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
go

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.710
