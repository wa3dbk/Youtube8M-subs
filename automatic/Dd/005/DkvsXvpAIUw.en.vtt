at<00:01:35.909> all<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.740> 250<00:01:41.369> dollars<00:01:41.610> cheaper

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
at all and it was 250 dollars cheaper

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.160 
at all and it was 250 dollars cheaper
than<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.150> metal<00:01:42.450> version<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.040> I'm<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
than a metal version so I'm all for that

than a metal version so I'm all for that
now<00:01:46.170> here's<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> reason<00:01:46.619> why<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.189> got<00:01:47.460> this

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
now here's the reason why I got this

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.889 
now here's the reason why I got this
belt<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.420> because<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.960> has<00:01:49.170> screws<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.649> nuts

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
belt it's because it has screws and nuts

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.980 
belt it's because it has screws and nuts
so<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.939> read<00:01:54.390> either<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.780> one
