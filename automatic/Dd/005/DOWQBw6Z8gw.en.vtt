 jean-luc at the site 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.179
 the players in the list of the new realists a start of dr dr 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.449
 efficient pressing good circulation of the balloon 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.119
 the beauvaisiens creates opportunities but it's false 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.470
 more logical that opens us the mark in the 16th minute 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.300
 on a city corner 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.400
 well placed in the surface thanks the balloon confused 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.100
 the perimeter 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.760
 the ideals on the spot of the vultures is able to keep the ball 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.310
 twenty minutes later a brotonne hand deflects a free kick so if 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.400
 the referee whistles penalty q canalÃ¨s is in charge of transforming 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.270
 the city of Lausanne on its lawn 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.020
 aware of the current situation 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.800
 very good first half 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.860
 as said m 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.990
 here is a fall at the beginning of the second half was apprehended 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.510
 civil 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.630
 it's really a shame because 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 perfect attendance and studies 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 transformative trust of rank in sufficiency 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.170
 thus revealing the delay of counter-performances is found in the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.990
 evenings in the last moments 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.270
 that's the frontier the defenders of German TV rights 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.090
 he returns to his home on the proportions 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.250
 his pleasure and the deadlines are good to take 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.540
 because the last twenty minutes of the match are significantly lower 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 difficult to govern but that provides much too yes plabennec on

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.829
 he pushes in the last minutes to snatch the draw 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.010
 the players have 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.300
 we ask them 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300

 this site of the health center 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.500
