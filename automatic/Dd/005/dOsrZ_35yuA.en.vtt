magnesium<00:00:02.830> deficiency<00:00:03.550> can<00:00:03.850> be<00:00:03.909> caused

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.390 
magnesium deficiency can be caused

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.990 
magnesium deficiency can be caused
simply<00:00:05.260> because<00:00:05.680> you're<00:00:05.860> not<00:00:06.069> eating<00:00:06.490> enough

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
simply because you're not eating enough

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.769 
low in magnesium one of the problems
with<00:00:17.890> trying<00:00:18.189> to<00:00:18.310> diagnose<00:00:18.970> a<00:00:19.000> magnesium

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
with trying to diagnose a magnesium

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.220 
with trying to diagnose a magnesium
deficiency<00:00:20.410> is<00:00:20.589> only<00:00:21.220> 1%<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:22.539> the<00:00:22.660> total

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230

magnesium in the bodies found in the

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.239 
magnesium in the bodies found in the
bloodstream<00:00:25.539> and<00:00:26.230> that<00:00:27.039> amount<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:27.910> is

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
bloodstream and that amount is is

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.880 
bloodstream and that amount is is
guarded<00:00:30.249> as<00:00:30.519> I<00:00:30.730> say<00:00:30.939> jealously<00:00:31.839> by<00:00:32.829> the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
guarded as I say jealously by the

guarded as I say jealously by the
feedback<00:00:33.730> mechanisms<00:00:34.510> in<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.809> body<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.620> it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
feedback mechanisms in the body so it

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.950 
feedback mechanisms in the body so it
always<00:00:36.010> looks<00:00:36.190> normal<00:00:36.879> so<00:00:37.090> when<00:00:37.719> you<00:00:37.809> do<00:00:37.930> a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
always looks normal so when you do a

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.319 
always looks normal so when you do a
blood<00:00:38.260> test<00:00:38.289> it<00:00:38.649> looks<00:00:38.800> normal<00:00:39.250> dr.<00:00:39.699> sale<00:00:39.969> well
