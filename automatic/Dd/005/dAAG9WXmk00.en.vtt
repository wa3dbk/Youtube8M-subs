00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
so now take the ruler and this stop will

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.940 
so now take the ruler and this stop will
and<00:01:31.760> start<00:01:32.030> cutting<00:01:32.720> on<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.320> line<00:01:33.530> just

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
and start cutting on the line just

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.580 
and start cutting on the line just
slightly<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.850> little<00:01:35.030> bit<00:01:35.480> that<00:01:35.780> way<00:01:36.050> we<00:01:36.320> can

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
slightly a little bit that way we can

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
that way you are going to make a little

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.289 
that way you are going to make a little
hole<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.260> middle<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.710> bamboo

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.700 

and<00:02:02.829> then<00:02:03.829> take<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.789> wire<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.570> start<00:02:06.049> bending

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
and then take the wire and start bending

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.820 
and then take the wire and start bending
it<00:02:07.159> make<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.030> little<00:02:08.420> twist<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.080> then<00:02:09.410> put<00:02:09.709> it

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
it make a little twist and then put it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.759 
it make a little twist and then put it
inside<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.269> one<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.930> already<00:02:12.319> closed

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.890 

now<00:02:16.769> take<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.220> other<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.700> close<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.569> -

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
now take the other one and close it -

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.550 
now take the other one and close it -
and<00:02:19.170> also<00:02:19.769> take<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.489> wire<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.120> measure<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.079> so

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
and also take the wire and measure it so

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.979 
and also take the wire and measure it so
you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.579> know<00:02:23.730> how<00:02:23.760> much<00:02:24.120> you're<00:02:24.599> going<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
wear if you're going to use it directly

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.259 
wear if you're going to use it directly
on<00:02:28.049> your<00:02:28.409> head<00:02:28.739> or<00:02:29.040> you're<00:02:29.579> going<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.060> use<00:02:30.239> a

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
on your head or you're going to use a

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.640 
on your head or you're going to use a
crown<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:32.909> cut<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.690> wire<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.319> put

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
crown just like so cut the wire and put

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:45.540 
crown just like so cut the wire and put
it<00:02:34.769> inside<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.250> other<00:02:36.140> triangle

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.680 

and<00:02:46.550> then<00:02:47.390> pays<00:02:47.810> them<00:02:48.110> together

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.500 

now<00:02:53.690> take<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.470> wood<00:02:55.010> stick<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.370> put<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.090> through

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
now take a wood stick and put it through

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.680 
now take a wood stick and put it through
the<00:02:56.870> middle<00:02:57.050> of<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.860> diamond<00:02:58.250> tube<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:59.480> to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
the middle of the diamond tube just to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.260 
the middle of the diamond tube just to
make<00:02:59.930> it<00:02:59.960> stronger<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.550> where<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.910> want<00:03:02.150> to
