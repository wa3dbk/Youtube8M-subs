00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
oil I'm going to be using this as a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.209 
oil I'm going to be using this as a
detangler<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.770> using<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
detangler and I really like using this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.540 
detangler and I really like using this
as<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.270> detangler<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:59.190> hair<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
as a as a detangler because my hair is

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.630 
as a as a detangler because my hair is
very<00:00:59.579> thin<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.570> very<00:01:00.600> fragile<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
very thin and very fragile so this

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.299 
very thin and very fragile so this
really<00:01:03.030> helps<00:01:03.480> prevent<00:01:03.930> breakage<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
really helps prevent breakage and I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
really helps prevent breakage and I
really<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.900> opposed<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
really like this as opposed to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.609 
really like this as opposed to
detangling<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> shower<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.619> find

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
detangling in the shower because I find

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:36.010 
detangling in the shower because I find
that<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.979> causes<00:01:11.549> less<00:01:12.150> breakage

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.620 

and<00:01:36.380> I'll<00:01:36.710> reginae<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:43.310> now<00:01:43.729> I'm<00:01:43.939> going<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.360> be

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
little pieces because I find that that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.350 
little pieces because I find that that
works<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.320> lot<00:01:57.470> better<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.460> prevents

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
works a lot better and it prevents

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.639 
works a lot better and it prevents
breakage<00:01:59.720> once<00:01:59.990> again

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649
