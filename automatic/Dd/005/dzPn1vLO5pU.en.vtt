 avenger pike 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.050

 for the pig baby shit 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.160
 I thought that hiding inside the ass of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.280
 a cow was the best hiding place 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.140
 I hate these fucking games to me 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.210
 I like it when I always win and the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.550
 others lose so I can fuck all 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.950

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.230

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.119
 I found he told me the hiding places of all 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.270
 that is to be a pro x of that is to be a 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.280
 wolf not that is to be pro no but no but 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.619

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.429
 we think of some game 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.429

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.330

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.470

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.890
 hear, wait , an idea has occurred to me 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.130
 to create the gta 5 web 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.140
 do not wait it's cool, hahahahaha all 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.030

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.030
 for the future ruler of minecraft 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.030
 let's see this goes here and this here the shit 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.280
 but what the fuck was that I think 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.280
 I would have to go investigate 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.850
 now 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.120
 I think gta 5 has a gameplay 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.360
 explosive xd and now the question of the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.170
 video what is your favorite gta for me is 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.170
