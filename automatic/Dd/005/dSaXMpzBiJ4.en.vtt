these<00:01:17.740> dark<00:01:18.010> squares<00:01:18.370> a<00:01:18.490> bit<00:01:19.710> um<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:20.770> think

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
these dark squares a bit um I think

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.850

playing<00:01:21.820> f4<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.390> bit<00:01:22.570> dangerous<00:01:22.960> because<00:01:23.350> it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
playing f4 is a bit dangerous because it

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.280 
playing f4 is a bit dangerous because it
does<00:01:24.040> week<00:01:24.250> and<00:01:24.460> whites<00:01:24.610> position<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.120> it<00:01:25.290> so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
does week and whites position of it so

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.110 
does week and whites position of it so
