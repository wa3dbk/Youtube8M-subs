00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.480 
team is quite good we've been channeling
so<00:06:26.180> far<00:06:26.449> in<00:06:26.569> the<00:06:26.659> first<00:06:26.900> game<00:06:27.289> so<00:06:27.319> I<00:06:27.800> think<00:06:28.159> we

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
so far in the first game so I think we

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.520 
so far in the first game so I think we
could<00:06:28.669> give<00:06:28.849> them<00:06:28.969> around<00:06:29.240> whatever<00:06:29.900> the

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
could give them around whatever the

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.140 
could give them around whatever the
results<00:06:31.069> I<00:06:31.330> remain<00:06:32.330> incredibly<00:06:33.020> proud<00:06:33.620> of<00:06:34.430> our

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
results I remain incredibly proud of our

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.119 
results I remain incredibly proud of our
young<00:06:35.419> men<00:06:35.659> they<00:06:35.870> put<00:06:36.080> their<00:06:36.259> bodies<00:06:36.650> on<00:06:36.860> the

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
young men they put their bodies on the

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.149 
young men they put their bodies on the
line<00:06:37.389> they<00:06:38.389> give<00:06:38.659> it<00:06:38.810> their<00:06:39.169> all<00:06:39.229> they<00:06:39.860> give<00:06:40.039> it

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
line they give it their all they give it

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.629 
line they give it their all they give it
their<00:06:40.340> all<00:06:40.550> for<00:06:41.449> each<00:06:41.569> other<00:06:42.159> for<00:06:43.159> their<00:06:43.340> coach

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
their all for each other for their coach

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.730 
their all for each other for their coach
and<00:06:44.289> for<00:06:45.289> their<00:06:46.150> beloved<00:06:47.150> school

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.800 
and for their beloved school
and<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:49.800> think<00:06:50.070> that's<00:06:50.250> what<00:06:50.460> it's<00:06:50.630> it's<00:06:51.630> all

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
and I think that's what it's it's all

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.080 
and I think that's what it's it's all
about
