00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.670
 the canon is 18 to 135 ps stm objective 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.859
 it's just an extended one 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.230
 standard lens no that's not it 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.180
 how to get the high quality plastic and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.310
 can recognize rubber but that is synonymous 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.130
 it makes it difficult to have three switches 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.080
 for focus stabilization and zoom lock 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.340
 the switches are well made and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.199
 does not break that easily 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.899
 Unfortunately, the popular distance is changing 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.489
 if you change the focal length of the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.890
 sharp ring goes very supple but 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.780
 The focus away is very long 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 this is useful for marco photography 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.770
 when it comes on every millimeter of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.610
 but especially when filming that can be very 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.920
 to be annoying 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 since it is almost impossible great focus 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.520
 jumps in one turn of the ring towards 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.649
 do 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.960
 stm is called step motor and is a new one 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.090
 focusing technology specifically for 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.829
 autofocus when filming was developed 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.020
 However, this only works with 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.030
 a small 650 de or newer 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.640
 But synonymous with older cameras you have 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.229
 with advantages that focus extremely 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 fast and absolutely quiet 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.520
 You can not hear it a bit more esther 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.330
 autofocus does not interfere with the focus ring 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.400
 connected 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.740
 therefore, it is manual override 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.369
 autofocus possible at any time and the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.689
 focus st does not move automatically 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.820
 the focus speed and 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.700
 Accuracy is definitely as good as 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.070
 at the objective the white of the shows 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.880
 this lens only works with aps 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.439
 c cameras 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.170
 I have five pictures without 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.880
 Bildstabilisator and five participated in the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.750
 Closing time was always one fifth 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.460
 one second 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.439
 how do you see the pictures? 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 image stabilizer sharper than the without 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.850
 I also have a video with and one 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.960
 without image stabilizer made around the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 to show difference 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.930
 The image stabilizer is also extreme 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.729
 Quiet , but there are also some disadvantages 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.560
 One is the barrel-shaped directory 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.689
 the at wide angle 18 millimeters 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.950
 You can see that I am watching 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.630
 But 28mm is what it's all about 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.820
 for me, the biggest disadvantage is that it 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.610
 objectively has no continuous aperture 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.700
 that means that the aperture of 35 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.830
 increased to 56 when you zoom in that's one 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.260
 big problem if your video at 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 zoom the photos become darker 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.860
 make weak lighting conditions 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.540
 or you want a very small one 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.519
 want to tell 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.220
 Apart from that, the picture quality 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.780
 very well, personally, I use that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.989
 objectively not much but 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.030
 prefer the sigma 17 to 50 f 2.8 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.950
 usually I do not need also to 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.780
 curves zoom factor because I have many movies 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.190
 if I do not go through the 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.140
 Aperture does not bother it is objective 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 definitely a good progress from 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.319
 standard objective 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.739
 otherwise I recommend a look 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.629
 to throw Egypt up to 40 f 2,8 the one 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.099
 similar award has look at you like 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.730
 otherwise on a canal and 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.530
