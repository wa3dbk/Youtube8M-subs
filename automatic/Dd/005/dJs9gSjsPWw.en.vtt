really<00:00:32.189> fun<00:00:32.219> flashy<00:00:32.910> piece<00:00:34.219> for<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.489> ring

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
really fun flashy piece for this ring

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
really fun flashy piece for this ring
we're<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> attach<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> jump<00:00:37.320> rings

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
we're going to attach the jump rings

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.389 
we're going to attach the jump rings
with<00:00:37.950> gem<00:00:38.250> drops<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> gem<00:00:39.270> drop<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:40.399> drilled

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
with gem drops now a gem drop is drilled

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.420 
with gem drops now a gem drop is drilled
so<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> very<00:00:42.239> tiny<00:00:42.570> hole<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:44.160> use<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so it has a very tiny hole and you use a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.260 
so it has a very tiny hole and you use a
lightweight<00:00:45.000> jump<00:00:45.390> ring<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> gem<00:00:46.890> drop

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
lightweight jump ring with the gem drop

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.080 
lightweight jump ring with the gem drop
so<00:00:48.270> you're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:49.039> attach<00:00:50.039> gem<00:00:50.460> drop<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
so you're going to attach gem drop to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
so you're going to attach gem drop to
the<00:00:51.270> jump<00:00:51.539> ring<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.649> holding<00:00:52.800> that

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the jump ring and I'm just holding that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.619 
the jump ring and I'm just holding that
with<00:00:53.219> pliers<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.640> make<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.420> bit

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
with pliers to make that a little bit

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.380 
with pliers to make that a little bit
easier<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.410> slide<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.340> tiny<00:00:56.820> hole<00:00:57.090> on

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
easier and just slide that tiny hole on

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.319 
easier and just slide that tiny hole on
to<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> jump<00:00:58.500> ring<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.800> i'm<00:00:59.399> also<00:00:59.609> using<00:00:59.760> some

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
to the jump ring and i'm also using some

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.650 
to the jump ring and i'm also using some
small<00:01:00.660> round<00:01:00.960> tags<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.699> gives<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
small round tags and that just gives the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.450 
small round tags and that just gives the
ring<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> metallic<00:01:04.530> look<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
ring more of a metallic look when it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.750 
ring more of a metallic look when it's
finished<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.270> some<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.600> nice<00:01:06.810> shine

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
finished you get some really nice shine

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
finished you get some really nice shine
so<00:01:08.760> once<00:01:09.090> I've<00:01:09.270> got<00:01:09.479> all<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:09.900> drops

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so once I've got all of my drops

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.250 
so once I've got all of my drops
threaded<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.390> then<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> attach<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
threaded on then I'm going to attach the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.109 
threaded on then I'm going to attach the
Rings<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.140> loops<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.439> ring<00:01:16.850> I'll<00:01:17.850> just

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
Rings to the loops on the ring I'll just

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
Rings to the loops on the ring I'll just
start<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.830> jump<00:01:19.830> ring<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.220> open

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
start with this one jump ring and open

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600 
start with this one jump ring and open
it<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.780> put<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.860> onto<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.400> ring

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it and then put it right onto the ring

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
it and then put it right onto the ring
and<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.409> add<00:01:25.590> more<00:01:26.009> loops<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and you will just add more loops to the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.100 
and you will just add more loops to the
ring<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:29.189> give<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.700> full<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.329> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
ring to give it a really full look so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.990 
ring to give it a really full look so
there's<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:31.890> fastened<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.850> would

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
there's one that's fastened and I would

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.240 
there's one that's fastened and I would
just<00:01:33.119> keep<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:34.049> until<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:35.009> full

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
just keep going until it's really full

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210 
just keep going until it's really full
and<00:01:35.310> blingy<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.259> ring<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.799> just

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and blingy now with this ring it just

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
and blingy now with this ring it just
has<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> single<00:01:38.880> loop<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> middle<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
has a single loop in the middle and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.359 
has a single loop in the middle and
that's<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.860> attach<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that's where I'm going to attach the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.240 
that's where I'm going to attach the
head<00:01:41.549> pins<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> ball<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> star

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
head pins and this is a ball and star

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
head pins and this is a ball and star
head<00:01:44.490> pin<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.939> would<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> few<00:01:45.810> crystals

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
head pin I would just put a few crystals

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.380 
head pin I would just put a few crystals
on<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:49.520> then<00:01:50.520> we'll<00:01:50.700> make<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> wrapped<00:01:51.240> loop

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
on and then we'll make a wrapped loop

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870 
on and then we'll make a wrapped loop
and<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.530> wrapped<00:01:52.740> loop<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.369> little<00:01:53.640> bit

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and the wrapped loop can be a little bit

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.580 
and the wrapped loop can be a little bit
tricky<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:54.899> you're<00:01:55.020> working<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
tricky when you're working with the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
tricky when you're working with the
bling<00:01:55.829> ring<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.700> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.090> sure<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> use

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
bling ring so you want to be sure to use

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
bling ring so you want to be sure to use
pliers<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> really<00:01:59.460> small<00:01:59.790> tip<00:02:00.560> so

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
pliers that have a really small tip so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
pliers that have a really small tip so
that<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.979> get<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.369> there<00:02:02.719> when<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.810> gets

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that you can get in there when it gets

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420 
that you can get in there when it gets
even<00:02:04.170> fuller<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> little

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
even fuller it's going to be a little

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.999 
even fuller it's going to be a little
more<00:02:05.579> complicated

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
more complicated

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.710 
more complicated
so<00:02:08.009> you'll<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.429> add<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> loop<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
so you'll just add it to the loop on the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.590 
so you'll just add it to the loop on the
ring<00:02:10.310> then<00:02:11.310> use<00:02:11.550> your<00:02:11.700> pliers<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.150> hold<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
ring then use your pliers to hold the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.380 
ring then use your pliers to hold the
loop<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:15.000> wrap<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.560> base<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.070> loop

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
loop and then wrap the base of the loop

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.850 
loop and then wrap the base of the loop
to<00:02:18.390> attach<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.170> ring<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
to attach it to the ring so you get a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.500 
to attach it to the ring so you get a
nice<00:02:23.130> wrap<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.940> would<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.240> trim

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
nice wrap and then I would just trim

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.790 
nice wrap and then I would just trim
this<00:02:24.690> extra<00:02:25.200> off<00:02:29.360> then<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:31.050> use<00:02:31.260> jump

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
this extra off then you can use jump

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.230 
this extra off then you can use jump
rings<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.910> attach<00:02:33.240> these<00:02:33.959> briolette<00:02:34.920> shape

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
rings to attach these briolette shape

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.810 
rings to attach these briolette shape
crystals<00:02:36.240> on<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.140> ring<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.560> again<00:02:38.520> just

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
crystals on to the ring and again just

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.970 
crystals on to the ring and again just
filling<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:42.470> attaching<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
filling this in and attaching that to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.180 
filling this in and attaching that to
the<00:02:44.070> loop<00:02:44.640> as<00:02:44.850> well<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:46.500> see<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.950> is

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
the loop as well so you can see this is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.479 
the loop as well so you can see this is
the<00:02:47.250> beginning<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:49.470> finished<00:02:49.980> ring<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
the beginning of this finished ring and

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.780 
the beginning of this finished ring and
this<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:51.750> really<00:02:52.500> super<00:02:53.100> fun<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.340> flashy

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
this is just really super fun and flashy

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.729 
this is just really super fun and flashy
and<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.780> how<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.020> make<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> bead<00:02:55.560> ring

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and that's how you make a bead ring

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.390 
and that's how you make a bead ring
that's<00:02:56.280> today's<00:02:56.640> beating<00:02:57.030> lesson
