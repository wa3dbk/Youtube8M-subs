 hopefully I have always collaborated for a long time I repeat with help in 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.420
 action and we think it is a task have com ar last year as well 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.300

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.900
 from here also thank all the people and encourage 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.910

 from that country 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:11.150
 and I see more inclination than to go on the run because a little bit with the slogan of 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.090
 range and go forth may mean running 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.159
 without drugs it is possible not when I believe that it is a

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.509
 also a reason for them to 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.609
 to take a 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.859
 a single other effort more to be able to read that hard cover that is the 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.239
 I think foreign release is TZDs we show it very nice that 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.619
 all finish well and that all this obviously serves this group well 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:37.739
 for 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.029
 to move forward and not take advantage 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.509
 Then another opportunity to live in more than dignified conditions
