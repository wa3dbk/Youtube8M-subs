something that uh this is a day that I
stopped<00:00:06.330> drinking<00:00:06.509> soda<00:00:07.429> when<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.490> was<00:00:08.610> in

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
stopped drinking soda when I was in

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.730 
stopped drinking soda when I was in
college<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.300> would<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.750> had<00:00:09.960> my<00:00:10.080> biology<00:00:10.260> class

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
college I would I had my biology class

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.950 
college I would I had my biology class
and<00:00:11.099> basically<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.700> had<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> little<00:00:12.420> experiment

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and basically we had a little experiment

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.259 
and basically we had a little experiment
we<00:00:13.049> measure<00:00:13.290> how<00:00:13.530> much<00:00:13.759> sugars<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:14.940> coca-cola

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
we measure how much sugars in coca-cola

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
we measure how much sugars in coca-cola
so<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> got<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:18.109> this<00:00:19.109> is

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so what I got right here is this is

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.099 
so what I got right here is this is
actually<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:20.000> organic<00:00:21.000> pure<00:00:21.270> cane<00:00:21.480> sugar<00:00:21.510> but

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
actually a organic pure cane sugar but

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.900 
actually a organic pure cane sugar but
that's<00:00:22.859> not<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> point<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.760> show

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030 
grams of sugar so on what is say for
example<00:00:29.789> coke<00:00:30.269> coke<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.230> star<00:00:31.439> nine<00:00:31.650> grams<00:00:31.859> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
example coke coke a star nine grams of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.510 
example coke coke a star nine grams of
sugar

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
sugar

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.139 
sugar
the<00:00:33.239> average<00:00:33.630> soda<00:00:34.140> has<00:00:34.440> anywhere<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:35.120> 32<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the average soda has anywhere from 32 to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.020 
the average soda has anywhere from 32 to
as<00:00:36.750> 45<00:00:37.469> any<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.100> drink<00:00:38.309> those<00:00:38.460> Mexican

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
as 45 any of you drink those Mexican

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.869 
as 45 any of you drink those Mexican
soda<00:00:39.270> ones<00:00:39.540> oh<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:40.410> god<00:00:40.590> they're<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.879> fifty

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
soda ones oh my god they're like fifty

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569 
soda ones oh my god they're like fifty
or<00:00:42.090> six<00:00:42.480> years<00:00:42.719> outrageous<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.800> think<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> know

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
or six years outrageous I think you know

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.310 
or six years outrageous I think you know
which<00:00:44.700> ones<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:44.940> talking<00:00:45.270> about<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:46.170> ones

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
which ones I'm talking about the ones

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.510 
which ones I'm talking about the ones
that<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.620> taste<00:00:46.770> nothing<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.160> sugar

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
that just taste nothing but sugar

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.189 
that just taste nothing but sugar
so<00:00:48.170> basically<00:00:49.170> four<00:00:49.440> grams<00:00:49.739> will<00:00:50.160> put<00:00:50.370> 10

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
so basically four grams will put 10

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.240 
so basically four grams will put 10
teaspoons<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.620> container<00:00:53.010> right<00:00:53.190> here

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
teaspoons into this container right here

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.729 
teaspoons into this container right here
that<00:00:53.520> way<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.670> guys<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.120> how<00:00:54.239> much

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
that way you guys can see how much

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.189 
that way you guys can see how much
approximately<00:00:55.739> how<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:57.920> one<00:00:58.920> coke<00:00:59.670> is

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
approximately how much one one coke is

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.549 
approximately how much one one coke is
and<00:01:01.199> by<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.039> uh<00:01:02.660> based<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> research

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and by the way uh based on the research

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
and by the way uh based on the research
I've<00:01:04.769> done<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.460> your<00:01:05.729> what<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.780> about

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
I've done I think your what is it about

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
I've done I think your what is it about
nine<00:01:07.200> teaspoons<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:08.070> day<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.460> human<00:01:09.210> adult<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
nine teaspoons a day a human adult a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
nine teaspoons a day a human adult a
male<00:01:11.390> am<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> supposed<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> day<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> if
