the looper you got 48 second 38 seconds
of<00:00:53.699> looping<00:00:54.030> time<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:56.059> still<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.210> loop

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
of looping time so still a little loop

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:11.280 
of looping time so still a little loop
here

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.679

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
you can do infinite overdubs another

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.719 
you can do infinite overdubs another
thing<00:01:14.869> I<00:01:14.930> want<00:01:15.079> to<00:01:15.140> show<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.350> is<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.070> GT<00:01:16.369> 10<00:01:16.579> it

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
chains per patch so for example in this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.590 
chains per patch so for example in this
patch<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.540> have<00:01:23.689> a<00:01:23.720> harmonizer<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.130> we<00:01:25.220> have

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
patch I have a harmonizer and we have

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.700 
patch I have a harmonizer and we have
undeath<00:01:26.600> this<00:01:26.840> side<00:01:27.049> you're<00:01:27.289> gonna<00:01:27.380> hear<00:01:27.590> what

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
undeath this side you're gonna hear what

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.810 
undeath this side you're gonna hear what
I<00:01:27.740> plan<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:28.220> side<00:01:28.399> it's<00:01:28.549> only<00:01:28.670> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
I plan that side it's only the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.109 
I plan that side it's only the
harmonized<00:01:29.210> signal<00:01:33.759> you<00:01:34.759> can<00:01:34.909> really

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
harmonized signal you can really

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.609 
harmonized signal you can really
simulate<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.630> son<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.960> -<00:01:36.110> guitar<00:01:36.439> play<00:01:36.590> a

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
simulate the son of a - guitar play a

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:37.929 
simulate the son of a - guitar play a
band<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.009> know<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:37.250> different<00:01:37.490> effects<00:01:37.759> per

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
band you know with different effects per

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.910 
band you know with different effects per
side<00:01:38.179> and<00:01:38.330> different<00:01:38.570> have<00:01:38.689> models<00:01:39.110> which<00:01:39.830> i

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
side and different have models which i

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.700 
side and different have models which i
think<00:01:40.039> is<00:01:40.189> super<00:01:40.490> super<00:01:40.640> cool<00:01:41.409> another<00:01:42.409> thing

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710
