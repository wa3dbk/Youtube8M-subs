00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.960 
when do we expose them to certain
content<00:02:26.860> how<00:02:27.099> does<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.340> feel<00:02:27.489> really<00:02:27.760> cool

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
content how does that feel really cool

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.010 
content how does that feel really cool
like<00:02:28.180> obviously<00:02:28.480> there's<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.690> new<00:02:28.840> user

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
like obviously there's a new user

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.449 
like obviously there's a new user
experience<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.860> don't<00:02:29.980> want<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> slam

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459

somebody<00:02:30.700> into<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> raid<00:02:31.330> straight<00:02:31.750> away

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
somebody into a raid straight away

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:32.850 
somebody into a raid straight away
because<00:02:32.110> that's<00:02:32.319> supposed<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> be<00:02:32.709> really

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
because that's supposed to be really

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.890 
because that's supposed to be really
challenging<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.150> way<00:02:34.270> things<00:02:34.330> roll<00:02:34.720> out

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
challenging so the way things roll out

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.390 
challenging so the way things roll out
the<00:02:35.140> way<00:02:35.230> people<00:02:35.350> get<00:02:35.530> exposed<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.980> things<00:02:36.130> how
