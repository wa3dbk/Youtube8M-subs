00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.960
 swallows and here we are with the one who goes 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.780
 to be the fifth episode of advice 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.429
 guys first of all the truth that you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.249
 touch you say I have to tell a 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.130
 good news and is that if I already have the 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.650
 cat catcher so what more 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.050
 sure in the next video maybe 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.779
 within two already have the first 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.240
 the first gameplays on my channel the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.740
 It was trying to make it a new 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.480
 series that I have thought of since 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.270
 rather than as I said in 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.710
 previous videos I could not do it for 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.690
 for not having capturing and the truth that 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.340
 how good are we going to see how the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.010
 series I have high hopes in it 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.590
 and I think you're going to like it a lot 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.420
 second place as I always say before 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.750
 start with the council thank you 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.809
 because we are going to be imminent 20 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.820
 100 subscribers in a very short time 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.079
 guys the truth that I'm very very 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.110
 grateful and good I wanted to tell you that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.030
 possibly make a small screw in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.040
 special to 100 subscribers with a 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.990
 award as is normal as you all know 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.509
 I have not decided yet, I have not decided 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.399
 many than what the price will be or is 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.490
 with forgiveness what the prize will be if it will be 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.720
 currency if it is a specific player 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 but the safest thing is that we make a 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.960
 screw 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.570
 so good after all this the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.320
 today's advice on the video of a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.229
 tips episode 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.900
 I put in the comments that if I was not 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.320
 aware of the personal modifier in 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.070
 the fifa twin booty 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.560
 and the truth that there was there was you 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.550
 enough subscribers that you were not 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.310
 very high very aware of him 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.190
 but the matter so well I decided 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.980
 make a new episode of tips for 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.550
 explain how it goes how the thing goes 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.760
 so good guys as you know there are 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.680
 trainers 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.220
 that goes up in contracts and talks 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.330
 team here you have the bright 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.580
 usually only on contracts 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.580
 as you see here allegri three of contract 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.870
 ferguson three contract mancini and three 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.790
 of good contract because the most of this 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.150
 percent that you see here is 50 per 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.580
 cent and how you get it then you 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.260
 get adding up the number of 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.160
 coaches who have adding up for 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.170
 example 3 369 12 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.890
 well up to 50 we have to have up to 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.720
 50 as you see here it does not reach me but I have 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.210
 Most are d 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.120
 bronze you see here in the contract of 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.360
 contract and good that's what you 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.730
 will provide the rise of a bit by 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.160
 hundred of contracts like the pri hats 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.880
 that in the previous video there is also 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.560
 coaches who up the talk of the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.540
 team talks the team talk is 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.460
 what I told you in previous tips 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.000
 of 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.890
 of the moral talk the moral 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.320
 here they are what is normally 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.660
 are the ones that are not bright this is not 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.360
 brilliant and talk about team plus three and 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.850
 that's how the mechanism is the same guys the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.820
 maximum is 50% and that would be the sum of 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.560
 all these would add all these and 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.890
 have to get to 50 do not buy 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.230
 guys do not buy more than 50 when you see 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.870
 the modifier and not less than 50% 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.930
 You buy some more because there 's not going to raise it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.760
 maximum is 50% as I said and good in 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.590
 around you know how to look for the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.660
 trainers at auctions 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.780
 in coaches and good here or you 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.569
 select a for because it really does not 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.090
 I did not want to put many and good so that 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.879
 see that environment in this east estorde 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.730
 in what prices are they that are 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.709
 these two 350 to 300 but because 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.220
 honestly these are not very 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.230
 known 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.390
 then coaches like me here loft 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.849
 as efficient the forest the truth that 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.950
 they tend to come out more expensive but it does not 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.560
 lack you do not have to have those and 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.299
 you can perfectly buy these 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.670
 is going to leave more 3 equally so 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.579
 that is already a matter of your tastes and 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.979
 of the money that of the money that you want 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.610
 that you want to spend as you see in my 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.229
 club I have I have enough 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.680
 I have enough already I have them of the two 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.600
 50% modifiers 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.310
 and good how are we going to do the last 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.919
 so you can see the last check 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.530
 but good that already devils in the other day 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.900
 how good are we going to catch this player see 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.290
 as well 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.290
 and as you see here the time we're going to see 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.070
 where we go in contracts you see we have 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.860
 Here 50% as I said that 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.800
 we have all and that's what makes you 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.330
 they add up to half of 13 and good is what 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.850
 what I said in another league we're going 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.940
 I just wanted to clarify it so you know 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.210
 all and it's already cleared so I hope 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.100
 to have helped them as I always say 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.389

 improve your experience in ultimate 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.009
