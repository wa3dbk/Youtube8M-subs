00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
had on mission Manchester which I think

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
had on mission Manchester which I think
was<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.300> four<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.570> five<00:00:45.690> seasons<00:00:46.410> running

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
was about four or five seasons running

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.840 
was about four or five seasons running
that<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:47.129> managed<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> win<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> so

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that we actually managed to win it so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.610 
that we actually managed to win it so
let's<00:00:48.420> hope<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.899> continue<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.500> on

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
let's hope that we can continue that on

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.110 
let's hope that we can continue that on

running out but it turned out to be to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.450 
running out but it turned out to be to
bring<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.159> got<00:01:47.430> a

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
maybe we should have tried to get those

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.539 
maybe we should have tried to get those
full<00:02:51.080> three<00:02:51.380> points<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:51.830> taking<00:02:52.130> one<00:02:52.280> point

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
full three points but taking one point

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.340 
full three points but taking one point
away<00:02:52.670> isn't<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.239> end<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.540> world<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.019> it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
away isn't the end of the world and it

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.440 
away isn't the end of the world and it
does<00:02:54.500> mean<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.799> we<00:02:55.310> are<00:02:55.489> still<00:02:56.030> within<00:02:56.239> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
does mean that we are still within a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.390 
does mean that we are still within a
chance<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.989> winning<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.470> division<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.860> mean<00:02:58.010> we

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
chance of winning the division I mean we

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.920 
chance of winning the division I mean we
got<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.700> chance<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.120> we've<00:02:59.390> released<00:02:59.660> three

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
got the chance of we've released three

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.690 
got the chance of we've released three
games<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.470> see<00:03:00.650> our<00:03:00.799> chances<00:03:01.220> over<00:03:01.340> but<00:03:01.610> we

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
games that see our chances over but we

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.309 
games that see our chances over but we
need<00:03:01.849> to<00:03:01.940> keep<00:03:02.090> winning<00:03:02.420> draws<00:03:03.019> do<00:03:03.230> you

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
need to keep winning draws do you

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.839 
need to keep winning draws do you
actually<00:03:03.500> hurt<00:03:03.830> your<00:03:03.980> chances<00:03:04.220> obviously

actually hurt your chances obviously
dropping<00:03:05.239> points<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.690> never<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.200> good<00:03:06.290> thing<00:03:06.500> so

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
dropping points is never a good thing so

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.820 
dropping points is never a good thing so

consumables<00:04:45.060> get<00:04:45.210> them<00:04:45.300> on<00:04:45.389> full<00:04:45.570> chemistry

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
consumables get them on full chemistry

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.750 
consumables get them on full chemistry
and<00:04:46.260> we<00:04:46.530> can<00:04:46.650> get<00:04:46.800> into<00:04:46.979> our<00:04:47.190> next<00:04:47.340> game<00:04:47.580> and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
give them the check mark on the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.210 
give them the check mark on the
checklist<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.440> list<00:05:01.620> is<00:05:01.770> looking<00:05:02.040> pretty

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
checklist the list is looking pretty

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.190 
checklist the list is looking pretty
full<00:05:02.490> we're<00:05:02.910> already<00:05:03.000> over<00:05:03.330> halfway<00:05:03.750> through

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
full we're already over halfway through

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.629 
full we're already over halfway through
all<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.500> players<00:05:04.680> however<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.250> remaining

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
all the players however the remaining

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.190 
all the players however the remaining
players<00:05:05.850> are<00:05:06.120> more<00:05:06.360> expensive<00:05:06.600> so<00:05:06.960> it's<00:05:07.080> going

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
players are more expensive so it's going

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.100 
players are more expensive so it's going
to<00:05:07.350> take<00:05:07.500> longer<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.330> we're<00:05:09.330> going<00:05:09.540> into<00:05:09.720> our

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
to take longer and we're going into our

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.129 
to take longer and we're going into our
final<00:05:10.470> game<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.680> its<00:05:10.919> against<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.370> 433<00:05:12.150> BPL<00:05:12.900> team

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
final game in its against a 433 BPL team

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.629 
final game in its against a 433 BPL team
but<00:05:13.290> you're<00:05:13.380> playing<00:05:13.560> Neymar<00:05:13.919> left<00:05:14.250> wing<00:05:14.460> not

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
but you're playing Neymar left wing not

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.100 
but you're playing Neymar left wing not
really<00:05:14.850> sure<00:05:15.000> why<00:05:15.180> not<00:05:15.720> getting<00:05:15.990> full

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
really sure why not getting full

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.469 
really sure why not getting full
chemistry<00:05:16.500> on<00:05:16.590> him<00:05:16.740> players<00:05:17.070> are<00:05:17.400> not<00:05:18.030> all<00:05:18.300> in

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
chemistry on him players are not all in

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.570 
chemistry on him players are not all in
the<00:05:18.570> right<00:05:18.720> positions<00:05:19.169> I<00:05:19.260> think<00:05:19.440> that<00:05:19.590> it's

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
the right positions I think that it's

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.750 
the right positions I think that it's
just<00:05:20.960> setting<00:05:21.960> jaan<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.460> Neymar<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.580> aren't

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
just setting jaan and Neymar that aren't

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.430 
just setting jaan and Neymar that aren't
getting<00:05:23.850> full<00:05:24.090> chemistry<00:05:24.479> maybe<00:05:24.660> benteke<00:05:25.289> as

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
getting full chemistry maybe benteke as

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.529 
getting full chemistry maybe benteke as
well<00:05:25.650> so<00:05:26.220> here<00:05:26.430> we<00:05:26.520> go<00:05:26.550> we<00:05:26.970> are<00:05:27.090> in<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.360> game

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
well so here we go we are in the game

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.960 
well so here we go we are in the game
doing<00:05:28.169> all<00:05:28.380> of<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.860> work<00:05:28.889> going<00:05:29.460> in<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:29.880> out
