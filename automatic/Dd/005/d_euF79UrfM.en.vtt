this person I grew feelings and even the
smallest<00:05:41.190> things<00:05:41.639> like<00:05:42.889> watching<00:05:43.889> Tokyo

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:44.339 
smallest things like watching Tokyo

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.709 
smallest things like watching Tokyo
ghoul<00:05:44.610> with<00:05:44.909> her<00:05:45.289> till<00:05:46.289> we<00:05:46.409> pass<00:05:46.620> out<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.719> just

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
ghoul with her till we pass out and just

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.839 
ghoul with her till we pass out and just
like<00:05:48.900> she<00:05:49.589> falls<00:05:49.860> asleep<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:50.520> I'm<00:05:50.610> there<00:05:50.819> on

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
like she falls asleep and I'm there on

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.420 
like she falls asleep and I'm there on
the<00:05:51.029> phone<00:05:51.300> quietly<00:05:51.779> while<00:05:52.469> she's<00:05:52.770> sleeping

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
the phone quietly while she's sleeping

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.450 
the phone quietly while she's sleeping
so<00:05:53.789> she<00:05:53.909> can<00:05:54.240> relax<00:05:54.860> those<00:05:55.860> are<00:05:56.099> the<00:05:56.190> things

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
so she can relax those are the things

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.689 
so she can relax those are the things
that<00:05:56.789> matter<00:05:57.389> the<00:05:57.690> most<00:05:57.719> and<00:06:00.529> yeah<00:06:01.529> I<00:06:01.889> guess

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
that matter the most and yeah I guess

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.990 
that matter the most and yeah I guess
felt<00:06:03.449> like<00:06:03.719> it<00:06:04.440> would<00:06:04.560> be<00:06:04.589> a<00:06:04.979> lot<00:06:05.580> better<00:06:05.819> to

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
felt like it would be a lot better to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.839 
felt like it would be a lot better to
