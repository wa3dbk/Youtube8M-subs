00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
force unleashed in my opinion is the the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.149 
force unleashed in my opinion is the the
fact<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.470> his<00:02:04.649> bridge<00:02:04.920> between

episodes three and four it's a new type
of<00:02:08.099> character<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.060> play<00:02:09.269> in<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> star

character<00:02:12.569> than<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.780> think<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.019> lot<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.200> people

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
