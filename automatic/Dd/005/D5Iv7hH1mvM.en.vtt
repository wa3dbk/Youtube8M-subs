at pulse rifles starting with bad juju
now<00:00:34.090> first<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.930> foremost<00:00:35.350> i<00:00:35.560> noticed<00:00:36.130> this

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
now first and foremost i noticed this

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.340 
now first and foremost i noticed this
weapon<00:00:36.820> look<00:00:37.060> had<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.720> silhouette<00:00:38.110> of<00:00:38.140> a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
weapon look had the silhouette of a

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.050 
weapon look had the silhouette of a
scout<00:00:38.620> rifle<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.160> i<00:00:39.190> mistook<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.579> for<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.850> scout

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
scout rifle so i mistook it for a scout

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.420 
scout rifle so i mistook it for a scout
rifle<00:00:40.180> but<00:00:40.480> then<00:00:40.630> looking<00:00:40.960> at<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.320> it's<00:00:42.070> listed

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
rifle but then looking at it it's listed

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.460 
rifle but then looking at it it's listed
as<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.580> pulse<00:00:42.880> rifle<00:00:43.270> now<00:00:43.510> this<00:00:43.900> seems<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.350> be<00:00:44.380> a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
as a pulse rifle now this seems to be a

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.620 
as a pulse rifle now this seems to be a
common<00:00:44.680> trend<00:00:45.190> for<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.760> legendary<00:00:46.210> weapons

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
common trend for the legendary weapons

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.330 
common trend for the legendary weapons
so<00:00:46.900> it<00:00:47.020> might<00:00:47.200> be<00:00:47.380> an<00:00:47.500> error<00:00:47.740> or<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.160> might<00:00:48.280> be

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
so it might be an error or it might be

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.940 
so it might be an error or it might be
true<00:00:48.700> but<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.690> bad<00:00:49.840> Juju's<00:00:50.200> description<00:00:50.710> is

square or whatever you reload button is

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.770 
square or whatever you reload button is
and<00:01:17.859> it's<00:01:18.070> done<00:01:18.369> or<00:01:18.640> it<00:01:19.240> doesn't<00:01:19.390> have<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.689> be

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
reloaded but it also increases damage

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.080 
reloaded but it also increases damage
for<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:23.079> short<00:01:23.319> period<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.829> time<00:01:23.950> after<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.729> kill

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
for a short period of time after a kill

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.819 
for a short period of time after a kill
so<00:01:25.390> this<00:01:25.659> weapon<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.049> going<00:01:26.259> to<00:01:26.350> shape<00:01:26.469> it<00:01:26.649> be
