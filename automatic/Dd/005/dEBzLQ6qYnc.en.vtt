00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
motherboard to do this you need to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.189 
motherboard to do this you need to
remove<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> four<00:00:24.090> thumb<00:00:24.570> screws<00:00:24.900> holding<00:00:25.109> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
remove the four thumb screws holding it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.990 
remove the four thumb screws holding it
onto<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.619> mount<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.189> once<00:00:26.580> you've<00:00:26.699> done<00:00:26.820> this

onto the mount and once you've done this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
onto the mount and once you've done this
you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:27.300> then<00:00:27.539> lift<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.050> edge<00:00:28.199> 100i<00:00:28.680> pump<00:00:28.980> off

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
you can then lift the edge 100i pump off

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.740 
you can then lift the edge 100i pump off
of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> motherboard<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> will<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.510> see

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
of the motherboard and you will then see

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
of the motherboard and you will then see

cut out if your case doesn't have one of
the<00:00:53.309> CPU<00:00:53.730> cutouts<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:54.989> need<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the CPU cutouts then you will need to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
the CPU cutouts then you will need to
remove<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.710> motherboard<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.910> your

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
remove your motherboard then with your

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
remove your motherboard then with your
fingers<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.480> need<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> unscrew<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> fourth

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

double-sided screws that mount your H
100i<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:01.199> sure<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> hold<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> backplate

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
100i and be sure to hold the backplate

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
100i and be sure to hold the backplate
from<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> other<00:01:02.489> side<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> avoid<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.539> falling

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
from the other side to avoid it falling

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.039 
from the other side to avoid it falling
off<00:01:04.140> once<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:04.799> four<00:01:05.010> screws<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.430> removed<00:01:06.049> the

off once all four screws are removed the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.780 
off once all four screws are removed the
issue<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> h100<00:01:08.040> eyes<00:01:08.130> mount<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
issue with the h100 eyes mount is that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.370 
issue with the h100 eyes mount is that
the<00:01:08.909> four<00:01:09.180> screws<00:01:09.540> cannot<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.930> screw<00:01:10.140> tight

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the four screws cannot be screw tight

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
the four screws cannot be screw tight
enough<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> block<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.640> generate<00:01:11.939> enough

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
enough for the block to generate enough

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.359 
enough for the block to generate enough
pressure<00:01:12.420> against<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> CPU<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.280> we're

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
pressure against the CPU so what we're

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.499 
pressure against the CPU so what we're
going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.850> use<00:01:15.000> our<00:01:15.119> four<00:01:15.360> rubber

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
going to do is use our four rubber

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
going to do is use our four rubber
washers<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.080> place<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.619> each<00:01:16.860> corner<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
washers and place one on each corner of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
washers and place one on each corner of
the<00:01:17.430> backplate<00:01:17.930> once<00:01:18.930> they're<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.110> there

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the backplate once they're on there

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
the backplate once they're on there
carefully<00:01:19.830> place<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> backplate<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.610> on

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
carefully place the backplate back on

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.100 
carefully place the backplate back on
and<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.150> sure<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> hold<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.720> place<00:01:21.810> don't
