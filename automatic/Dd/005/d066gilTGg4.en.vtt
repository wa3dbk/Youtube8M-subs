Boston College and you know it's pretty
gratifying<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.610> my<00:00:38.760> players<00:00:39.030> staff<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.809> and

gratifying for my players staff and and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:55.549 
gratifying for my players staff and and
probably<00:00:40.440> everybody<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:41.010> no<00:00:41.340> decent<00:00:54.559> seperti

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
probably everybody at no decent seperti

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.930 
probably everybody at no decent seperti
to<00:00:55.739> say<00:00:55.920> no<00:00:56.129> actually<00:00:56.309> didn't<00:00:56.699> because

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to say no actually didn't because

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420 
to say no actually didn't because
usually<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.320> only<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.309> look

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
usually you know we only we if you look

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.770 
usually you know we only we if you look
at<00:00:59.550> their<00:00:59.670> thing<00:00:59.910> most<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> season<00:01:00.690> we

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
at their thing most of the season we

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.000 
at their thing most of the season we
never<00:01:01.109> got<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.350> early<00:01:01.530> goals<00:01:01.710> we'll<00:01:01.890> probably

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
never got an early goals we'll probably

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
never got an early goals we'll probably
they'll<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.760> requires<00:01:03.690> wait<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> season

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
they'll have requires wait to the season

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.380 
they'll have requires wait to the season
but<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.129> thought<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.519> scored<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.090> early

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
but I thought we scored we bit early

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.820 
but I thought we scored we bit early
because<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.780> knew<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:07.020> dangerous<00:01:07.229> Boston

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because I knew how dangerous Boston

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.830 
because I knew how dangerous Boston
College<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.510> worried<00:01:09.810> that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
College could be and I was worried that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.390 
College could be and I was worried that
the<00:01:10.200> boys<00:01:10.380> next<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> me<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the boys next to me would get a little

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.130 
the boys next to me would get a little
bit<00:01:11.549> tight<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> try<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> protect<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
bit tight and try just to protect the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.469 
bit tight and try just to protect the
lead<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> some<00:01:14.159> person<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.909> were<00:01:15.060> forced<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
lead and some person we were forced to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.080 
lead and some person we were forced to
because<00:01:15.780> BC<00:01:16.110> was<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.770> good<00:01:16.950> offensively

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
because BC was so so good offensively

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.030 
because BC was so so good offensively
but<00:01:18.110> get<00:01:19.110> Nicole<00:01:19.229> anytime<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:19.979> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.970 

well<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.420> mean<00:03:56.569> it<00:03:57.200> late<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.620> game<00:03:57.769> and

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
well I mean it late in the game and

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.710 
well I mean it late in the game and
Charlie<00:03:58.220> came<00:03:58.340> back<00:03:58.489> on<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.030> they<00:03:59.330> went<00:03:59.569> to

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
Charlie came back on and they went to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.000 
Charlie came back on and they went to
three<00:03:59.930> guys<00:04:00.080> at<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.319> back<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.769> was<00:04:00.860> like<00:04:00.890> a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
three guys at the back and it was like a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.830 
three guys at the back and it was like a
3-5-2<00:04:01.519> but<00:04:01.879> I<00:04:01.910> was<00:04:02.030> really<00:04:02.209> having<00:04:02.360> four<00:04:02.660> guys

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
3-5-2 but I was really having four guys

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.540 
3-5-2 but I was really having four guys
across<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.290> frontier<00:04:03.620> from<00:04:04.069> either<00:04:04.190> front

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
across the frontier from either front

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.550 
across the frontier from either front
and<00:04:04.790> we<00:04:05.180> just<00:04:05.390> were<00:04:05.629> forced<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.349> know<00:04:06.470> it

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
and we just were forced you know it

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.440 
and we just were forced you know it
wasn't<00:04:06.890> anything<00:04:07.099> strategy<00:04:07.670> for<00:04:07.849> me<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:08.330> the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
wasn't anything strategy for me but the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.780 
wasn't anything strategy for me but the
boys<00:04:08.599> realized<00:04:09.140> smell<00:04:09.470> danger<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:10.160> deal<00:04:10.610> with

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
boys realized smell danger and deal with

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.160 
boys realized smell danger and deal with
it<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.000> know<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.420> solutions<00:04:11.810> were<00:04:11.959> to

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
it you know and the solutions were to

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.040 
it you know and the solutions were to
have<00:04:12.319> six<00:04:13.010> against<00:04:13.340> therefore<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.690> then<00:04:14.900> when

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
have six against therefore and then when

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.080 
have six against therefore and then when
we<00:04:15.170> broke<00:04:15.380> trying<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.130> get<00:04:16.250> done<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.729> we<00:04:16.940> had<00:04:17.030> a

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
we broke trying to get done and we had a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.400 
we broke trying to get done and we had a
couple<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.479> wee<00:04:17.570> chances<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.079> we<00:04:18.169> could<00:04:18.320> have

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
couple of wee chances that we could have

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.140 
couple of wee chances that we could have
got<00:04:18.560> them<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:18.919> John<00:04:19.489> was<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.880> goal<00:04:20.030> could

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
got them and John was the goal could

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.819 
got them and John was the goal could
made<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.359> good<00:04:20.570> save<00:04:20.810> him<00:04:20.989> one<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.440> done<00:04:21.650> was

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
made a good save him one and done was

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.770 
made a good save him one and done was
just<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.100> Lawford<00:04:22.490> not<00:04:22.700> one<00:04:22.850> or<00:04:22.970> two<00:04:23.000> which<00:04:23.330> we

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
just the Lawford not one or two which we

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.150 
just the Lawford not one or two which we
knew<00:04:23.900> they<00:04:24.050> would<00:04:24.200> come<00:04:24.290> out<00:04:24.470> at<00:04:24.650> especially

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
knew they would come out at especially

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.580 
knew they would come out at especially

was just going to be one of those and

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.950 
was just going to be one of those and
they<00:04:28.700> actually<00:04:28.940> have<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.210> noticed<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:29.570> changed

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
they actually have you noticed I changed

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
sort of slash really I thought of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.820 
sort of slash really I thought of

to deal with them and was gonna be

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.720 
to deal with them and was gonna be
really<00:05:32.590> difficult<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.740> talk<00:05:35.950> about<00:05:36.160> the

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
really difficult you talk about the

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.400 
really difficult you talk about the
team's<00:05:36.970> ability<00:05:37.240> to<00:05:37.480> win<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:38.050> one<00:05:38.260> that

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
team's ability to win the one that

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:49.400 
team's ability to win the one that
became

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.690 

yeah<00:05:50.410> it's<00:05:50.770> really<00:05:50.890> there's<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.370> good<00:05:51.520> team

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
yeah it's really there's a good team

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.580 
yeah it's really there's a good team
after<00:05:52.000> it<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.330> think<00:05:52.930> every<00:05:53.110> kind<00:05:53.290> digs<00:05:53.470> that

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
after it I think every kind digs that

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.370 
after it I think every kind digs that
feet<00:05:53.800> in<00:05:53.950> and<00:05:54.310> goes<00:05:55.240> place<00:05:55.780> defense<00:05:56.170> for<00:05:56.320> the

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
feet in and goes place defense for the

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.740 
feet in and goes place defense for the
full<00:05:56.530> 90<00:05:56.770> minutes<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:57.190> think<00:05:57.400> as<00:05:57.580> I<00:05:57.610> played<00:05:57.940> even

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
full 90 minutes I think as I played even

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.880 
full 90 minutes I think as I played even
our<00:05:58.840> attacking<00:05:59.170> players<00:05:59.350> don't<00:05:59.500> realize<00:05:59.770> the

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
our attacking players don't realize the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.170 
our attacking players don't realize the
importance<00:06:00.280> of<00:06:00.340> what<00:06:00.460> they<00:06:00.580> can<00:06:00.640> do<00:06:00.910> and<00:06:01.060> they

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
importance of what they can do and they

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.400 
importance of what they can do and they
have<00:06:01.390> they<00:06:01.540> can<00:06:01.600> impact<00:06:01.870> leading<00:06:02.170> if<00:06:02.260> they

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
have they can impact leading if they

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.200 
have they can impact leading if they
track<00:06:02.980> back<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.400> make<00:06:03.490> an<00:06:03.610> unselfish<00:06:04.000> run

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210
