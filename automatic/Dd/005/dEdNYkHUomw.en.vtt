00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
really a sensation if you talk about

really a sensation if you talk about
electric<00:00:44.760> drive<00:00:46.309> if<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:48.120> talk<00:00:48.300> about

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
electric drive if we talk about

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
performance due to the same engine we

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.350 
performance due to the same engine we
are<00:00:51.840> able<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.230> offer<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> performance<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
are able to offer here a performance of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.639 
are able to offer here a performance of
the<00:00:54.539> engine<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> 7.5<00:00:55.949> kilowatt<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.989> due<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the engine of a 7.5 kilowatt but due to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.910 
the engine of a 7.5 kilowatt but due to
the<00:00:58.829> electronic<00:00:59.899> systems<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.199> electronic

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the electronic systems and electronic

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.240 
the electronic systems and electronic
know<00:01:02.129> how<00:01:02.309> we're<00:01:02.609> able<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.239> boost<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
know how we're able to boost the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.890 
know how we're able to boost the
performance<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> bike<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> short<00:01:06.689> time

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
performance of the bike for a short time

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289 
performance of the bike for a short time
so<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:07.470> able<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.950> reach<00:01:08.159> more<00:01:08.670> than<00:01:08.880> 20

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
so we're able to reach more than 20

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.420 
so we're able to reach more than 20

electric<00:01:29.009> drive<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.700> always<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.840> range<00:01:31.049> how

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
electric drive is always the range how

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.580 
electric drive is always the range how
long<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> bike<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.720> said<00:01:33.900> these

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
long you can use a bike as I said these

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
long you can use a bike as I said these
are<00:01:34.650> sport<00:01:35.130> motorcycles<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.060> our<00:01:36.299> goal<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.900> not

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
are sport motorcycles so our goal is not

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.730 
are sport motorcycles so our goal is not

to reach maximum range our goal is to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.819 
to reach maximum range our goal is to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
reach enough range for spotty riding if

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.280 
reach enough range for spotty riding if
we<00:01:44.040> talk<00:01:44.220> about<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.729> bikes<00:01:45.149> first<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> all

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
we talk about this bikes first of all

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
we talk about this bikes first of all
about<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> enduro<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.610> bike<00:01:47.820> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
about the enduro because this bike is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.960 
about the enduro because this bike is
quite<00:01:48.299> close<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.810> production<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:50.100> need<00:01:50.430> this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
quite close to production we need this

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.999 
quite close to production we need this
is<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> demands<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.840> off<00:01:52.110> road<00:01:52.320> rider<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.799> need

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
is the demands of off road rider we need

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.030 
is the demands of off road rider we need
at<00:01:53.399> least<00:01:53.430> 45<00:01:54.090> minutes<00:01:54.570> time<00:01:55.380> where<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.829> can

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
go really sporty off-road and this bike

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.270 
go really sporty off-road and this bike

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
off-road riders so that you have no

stone whatever and that the bike remains
short<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.389> it's<00:03:16.569> getting<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:17.139> too<00:03:17.560> high

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
short that it's getting not too high

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.619 
short that it's getting not too high
because<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.639> battery<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.209> have<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.479> know

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
because of the battery you have to know

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.439 
because of the battery you have to know
the<00:03:19.930> battery<00:03:20.319> itself<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:21.099> even<00:03:22.000> more<00:03:22.180> weight

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
the battery itself is even more weight

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.860 
the battery itself is even more weight
than<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.139> full<00:03:23.349> engine<00:03:23.699> so<00:03:24.699> this<00:03:25.389> is

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
than the full engine so this is

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.949 
than the full engine so this is
something<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:27.370> terms<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.940> balancing<00:03:28.269> and

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
something in terms of balancing and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.069 
something in terms of balancing and
center<00:03:29.859> of<00:03:29.949> gravity<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.940> was<00:03:31.269> really<00:03:31.870> tough

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
center of gravity it was really tough

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.250 
center of gravity it was really tough
but<00:03:32.650> we<00:03:32.829> made<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.400> yeah<00:03:34.389> we<00:03:34.780> are<00:03:34.959> looking

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
but we made it and yeah we are looking

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.050 
but we made it and yeah we are looking
