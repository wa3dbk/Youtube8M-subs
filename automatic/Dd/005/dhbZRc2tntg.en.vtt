mistake like you can see here and also
this<00:00:28.650> looks<00:00:28.890> awkward<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> person's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
this looks awkward when the person's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
this looks awkward when the person's
legs<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.539> cut<00:00:30.779> off<00:00:30.900> below<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> knees<00:00:31.470> now

this<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.579> fact<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.239> rule<00:00:33.510> by<00:00:33.690> any<00:00:33.870> means

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this in fact is not a rule by any means

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139 
this in fact is not a rule by any means
in<00:00:34.469> fact<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:36.030> are

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
in fact I don't really think there are

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.869 
in fact I don't really think there are
any<00:00:36.360> rules<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.840> film<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.790> know

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
any rules in film but it's just you know

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.670 
any rules in film but it's just you know
bad<00:00:39.090> practice<00:00:39.600> if<00:00:39.840> you're<00:00:39.989> gonna<00:00:40.110> frame<00:00:40.500> your

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
bad practice if you're gonna frame your

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.500 
bad practice if you're gonna frame your
subject<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.120> better<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
subject like this then you better have a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.430 
subject like this then you better have a
good<00:00:42.600> reason<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
good reason for it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
good reason for it
otherwise<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> will<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.489> confuse<00:00:45.000> your

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
otherwise it will just confuse your

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360 
otherwise it will just confuse your
audience<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.680> look<00:00:47.190> like

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
audience and it will just be look like

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.729 
audience and it will just be look like
you<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.300> you're<00:00:48.480> doing<00:00:48.780> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you don't know what what you're doing so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
you don't know what what you're doing so
basically<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> full-body<00:00:50.670> shot<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
basically for a full-body shot you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
basically for a full-body shot you
should<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.199> stick<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> something<00:00:53.160> like

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
should you know stick to something like

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.299 
should you know stick to something like
this<00:00:53.719> next<00:00:54.719> shot<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> medium<00:00:55.710> full<00:00:56.070> shot

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this next shot is a medium full shot

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
this next shot is a medium full shot
that's<00:00:56.820> when<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.120> go<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> bit<00:00:57.629> closer<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that's when you go in a bit closer and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.709 
that's when you go in a bit closer and
it's<00:00:58.680> usually<00:00:59.219> also<00:00:59.370> when<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> cut<00:01:00.420> off<00:01:00.539> your

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it's usually also when you cut off your

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's usually also when you cut off your
subject<00:01:01.170> somewhere<00:01:01.469> between<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.460> knees<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
subject somewhere between the knees and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.679 
subject somewhere between the knees and
the<00:01:03.090> waist<00:01:03.439> once<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.589> frame<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.210> above<00:01:06.210> basic

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the waist once you frame up above basic

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.500 
the waist once you frame up above basic
the<00:01:06.869> waist<00:01:07.080> area<00:01:07.909> that's<00:01:08.909> called<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.240> medium

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the waist area that's called a medium

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
the waist area that's called a medium
shot<00:01:09.750> after<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.070> we're<00:01:11.250> moving<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> close

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
shot after that we're moving for a close

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
shot after that we're moving for a close
shot<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.510> frames<00:01:12.830> from<00:01:13.830> around<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> breast

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
shot that frames from around the breast

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.870 
shot that frames from around the breast
area<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.060> apt<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
area and apt and then this here is a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120 
area and apt and then this here is a
close-up<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:19.020> basically<00:01:19.350> frames<00:01:19.710> mainly

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
close-up which basically frames mainly

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
close-up which basically frames mainly
just<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> subjects<00:01:20.850> head<00:01:21.110> once<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.290> move<00:01:22.439> in

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
just the subjects head once you move in

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.350 
just the subjects head once you move in
even<00:01:22.680> closer<00:01:23.040> where<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.490> start<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> cut<00:01:24.240> off

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
even closer where you start to cut off

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.320 
even closer where you start to cut off
the<00:01:24.570> forehead<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.560> chin<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.790> usually

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the forehead or the chin that's usually

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.050 
the forehead or the chin that's usually
referred<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.810> an<00:01:28.049> extreme<00:01:28.650> closeup<00:01:29.060> even

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
referred to as an extreme closeup even

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789 
referred to as an extreme closeup even
once<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> move<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.320> frame<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> eyes

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
once you move in to just frame the eyes

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
once you move in to just frame the eyes
for<00:01:32.070> example<00:01:32.600> now<00:01:33.600> what<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> got<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.049> remember

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
for example now what you got to remember

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.890 
for example now what you got to remember
is<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.130> no<00:01:35.310> standard<00:01:35.939> by<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.270> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
is that there is no standard by which to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.410 
is that there is no standard by which to
go<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:37.259> naming<00:01:37.650> these<00:01:37.770> type<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.130> shots<00:01:38.420> these

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
go when naming these type of shots these

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940 
go when naming these type of shots these
are<00:01:39.570> simply<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> names<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.380> use<00:01:40.680> there

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
are simply the names that I use there

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.499 
are simply the names that I use there
are<00:01:41.040> others<00:01:41.369> out<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.030> use<00:01:42.360> different

that's<00:03:22.810> shot<00:03:23.079> using<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.500> 50<00:03:24.040> millimeter<00:03:24.190> lens

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
that's shot using a 50 millimeter lens

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.649 
that's shot using a 50 millimeter lens
same<00:03:27.379> reviews<00:03:27.829> 100<00:03:28.519> millimeter<00:03:28.879> or<00:03:29.120> even<00:03:29.420> a

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
same reviews 100 millimeter or even a

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.220 
same reviews 100 millimeter or even a
300<00:03:30.170> millimeter<00:03:30.500> telephoto<00:03:31.010> lens<00:03:31.959> they<00:03:32.959> all

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
300 millimeter telephoto lens they all

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.039 
300 millimeter telephoto lens they all
produce<00:03:33.590> medium<00:03:34.189> shots<00:03:34.489> but<00:03:35.299> of<00:03:35.390> course<00:03:35.629> each

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
produce medium shots but of course each

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.839 
produce medium shots but of course each
of<00:03:36.290> those<00:03:36.439> lenses<00:03:36.709> gives<00:03:37.219> that<00:03:37.430> shot<00:03:37.670> a

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
of those lenses gives that shot a

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.899 
of those lenses gives that shot a
different<00:03:38.180> look<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.599> effect<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:40.489> framing

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
different look and effect the framing

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.789 
different look and effect the framing
doesn't<00:03:41.209> change<00:03:41.420> it's<00:03:41.780> just<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.260> perspective

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
doesn't change it's just a perspective

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.250 
doesn't change it's just a perspective
so<00:03:43.549> remember<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.180> shot<00:03:44.480> framing<00:03:45.049> has

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
so remember that shot framing has

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.500 
so remember that shot framing has
nothing<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:45.829> with<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:46.129> lens<00:03:46.340> size<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:47.030> the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
nothing to do with the lens size and the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.089 
nothing to do with the lens size and the
only<00:03:47.720> way<00:03:47.870> you'll<00:03:48.049> ever<00:03:48.319> really<00:03:48.739> know<00:03:48.920> what

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
only way you'll ever really know what

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.920 
only way you'll ever really know what
type<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.400> lens<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.849> use<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.180> your<00:03:50.299> scenario<00:03:50.569> is

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
type of lens to use in your scenario is

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.569 
type of lens to use in your scenario is
once<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.470> have<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.709> lot<00:03:51.890> of<00:03:51.980> experience<00:03:52.400> going

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
once you have a lot of experience going

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.429 
once you have a lot of experience going
out<00:03:52.790> there<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.060> filming<00:03:53.359> you<00:03:54.079> know<00:03:54.109> just

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
out there and filming you know just

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.050 
out there and filming you know just
trying<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.799> different<00:03:54.980> types<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.430> lenses<00:03:55.609> and

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
trying on different types of lenses and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.720 
trying on different types of lenses and
experimenting<00:03:57.019> then<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:58.040> know<00:03:58.129> afterwards

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
experimenting then you know afterwards

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.580 
experimenting then you know afterwards
you<00:03:58.849> should<00:03:58.939> come<00:03:59.299> home<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.750> compare<00:04:00.200> what

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
you should come home and compare what

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.379 
you should come home and compare what
kind<00:04:00.769> of<00:04:00.829> effects<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.430> got<00:04:01.670> using<00:04:02.030> various

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
kind of effects you got using various

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.879 
kind of effects you got using various
lenses<00:04:02.599> on<00:04:02.959> different<00:04:03.379> types<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.680> shots

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
lenses on different types of shots

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.640 
lenses on different types of shots
because<00:04:04.760> there's<00:04:05.209> virtually<00:04:05.810> an<00:04:05.959> infinite

framing shot types angles and lenses for
example<00:04:14.569> let's<00:04:14.720> take<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.930> close-up<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.650> do<00:04:15.709> a

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
example let's take a close-up and do a

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.229 
example let's take a close-up and do a
few<00:04:16.009> versions<00:04:16.190> of<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.639> and<00:04:16.789> see<00:04:16.940> what<00:04:17.060> kind<00:04:17.150> of

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
few versions of it and see what kind of

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.749 
few versions of it and see what kind of
effects<00:04:17.630> we<00:04:17.750> can<00:04:17.870> get<00:04:18.049> if<00:04:18.799> we<00:04:19.039> were<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.340> use<00:04:19.370> a

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 
effects we can get if we were to use a

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.279 
effects we can get if we were to use a
mid-sized<00:04:20.180> lens<00:04:20.449> such<00:04:20.690> as<00:04:20.810> this<00:04:20.959> 50

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
mid-sized lens such as this 50

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.409 
mid-sized lens such as this 50
millimeter<00:04:21.650> then<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.610> would<00:04:23.030> get<00:04:23.210> something

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
millimeter then you would get something

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.010 
millimeter then you would get something
like<00:04:23.630> this

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
like this

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.570 
like this
you<00:04:24.139> know<00:04:24.259> an<00:04:24.410> average<00:04:24.590> type<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.340> kind<00:04:25.490> of

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
you know an average type of kind of

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.700 
you know an average type of kind of
looking<00:04:25.820> shot<00:04:26.060> but<00:04:27.050> for<00:04:27.199> example<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:27.590> you're

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
looking shot but for example if you're

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.469 
looking shot but for example if you're
filming<00:04:28.039> let's<00:04:28.340> say<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> comedy<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.449> you

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
filming let's say a comedy and you

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.000 
filming let's say a comedy and you
wanted<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.870> show<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.050> person<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.710> know<00:04:30.800> in<00:04:30.919> a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
wanted to show a person you know in a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.310 
wanted to show a person you know in a
funny<00:04:31.280> way<00:04:31.400> then<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.449> might<00:04:32.630> be<00:04:32.659> better<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.080> go

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
funny way then it might be better to go

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.469 
funny way then it might be better to go
in<00:04:33.560> real<00:04:33.919> close<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.520> use<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.760> wide-angle<00:04:35.060> such

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
in real close and use a wide-angle such

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.360 
in real close and use a wide-angle such
as<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> 16<00:04:36.110> millimeter<00:04:36.289> lens<00:04:36.680> which<00:04:37.340> will

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
as the 16 millimeter lens which will

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.339 
as the 16 millimeter lens which will
make<00:04:37.699> your<00:04:37.820> subjects<00:04:38.360> features<00:04:38.720> look<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.169> bit

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
make your subjects features look a bit

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.860 
make your subjects features look a bit
distorted<00:04:39.740> or<00:04:40.099> exaggerate<00:04:41.030> it<00:04:41.150> it's<00:04:41.690> not

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
distorted or exaggerate it it's not

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.360 
distorted or exaggerate it it's not
actually<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.349> lens<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.949> makes<00:04:43.130> your

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
actually the lens that makes your

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.339 
actually the lens that makes your
subject<00:04:43.789> look<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.210> way<00:04:44.360> but<00:04:44.720> your<00:04:44.900> relative

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
subject look that way but your relative

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.950 
subject look that way but your relative
position<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.010> subject<00:04:46.840> basically<00:04:47.840> the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
position to the subject basically the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.450 
position to the subject basically the
closer<00:04:48.199> you<00:04:48.470> move<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.770> your<00:04:48.800> subject<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.430> more

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
closer you move to your subject the more

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.909 
closer you move to your subject the more
dramatic<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:50.150> perspective<00:04:50.840> will<00:04:50.960> be<00:04:51.139> but

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
dramatic the perspective will be but

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.020 
dramatic the perspective will be but
obviously<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.400> gotta<00:04:52.580> use<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:52.760> wide-angle

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
obviously you gotta use a wide-angle

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.899 
obviously you gotta use a wide-angle
lens<00:04:53.300> when<00:04:53.690> shooting<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.110> close<00:04:54.760> right<00:04:55.760> now

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
lens when shooting this close right now

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.279 
lens when shooting this close right now
we're<00:04:56.090> about<00:04:56.120> two<00:04:56.599> feet<00:04:56.750> away<00:04:56.900> from<00:04:57.080> the

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
we're about two feet away from the

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.920 
we're about two feet away from the
subject<00:04:57.710> now<00:04:58.400> if<00:04:58.699> we<00:04:58.880> were<00:04:58.970> to<00:04:59.180> use<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.389> 50

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
subject now if we were to use a 50

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.600 
subject now if we were to use a 50
millimeter<00:05:00.349> lens<00:05:00.440> at<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.130> same<00:05:01.370> distance

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
millimeter lens at that same distance

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.879 
millimeter lens at that same distance
then<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.449> perspective<00:05:02.990> doesn't<00:05:03.199> change<00:05:03.530> but

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
then the perspective doesn't change but

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.219 
then the perspective doesn't change but
the<00:05:03.949> framing<00:05:04.370> obviously<00:05:04.820> will<00:05:05.060> because<00:05:06.050> we're

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
the framing obviously will because we're

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.260 
the framing obviously will because we're
basically<00:05:06.470> just<00:05:06.710> zooming<00:05:07.159> in<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:07.490> all<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.150> end

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
basically just zooming in so all you end

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.320 
basically just zooming in so all you end
up<00:05:08.419> seeing<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:08.870> this<00:05:09.669> it<00:05:10.669> would<00:05:10.909> be<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.120> same

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
up seeing is this it would be the same

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.510 
up seeing is this it would be the same
we<00:05:11.599> look<00:05:11.840> at<00:05:11.960> this<00:05:12.110> shot<00:05:12.349> that<00:05:12.830> we<00:05:12.919> got<00:05:13.099> using<00:05:13.430> a

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
we look at this shot that we got using a

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.580 
we look at this shot that we got using a
16<00:05:13.909> millimeter<00:05:14.090> lens<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.840> then<00:05:15.050> digitally

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
16 millimeter lens and then digitally

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.070 
16 millimeter lens and then digitally
zoomed<00:05:15.949> in<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:17.270> only<00:05:17.449> difference<00:05:17.780> being<00:05:17.960> that

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
zoomed in the only difference being that

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.689 
zoomed in the only difference being that
the<00:05:18.320> depth<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.710> field<00:05:18.919> would<00:05:19.010> be<00:05:19.070> the<00:05:19.310> same<00:05:19.490> as

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
the depth of field would be the same as

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.909 
the depth of field would be the same as
that<00:05:19.880> 16<00:05:20.240> millimeter<00:05:20.570> lens<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:20.960> of<00:05:21.560> course<00:05:21.770> we

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
that 16 millimeter lens and of course we

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.800 
that 16 millimeter lens and of course we
end<00:05:21.949> up<00:05:22.280> losing<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.880> lot<00:05:23.030> of<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.240> resolution

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
end up losing a lot of the resolution

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.140 
end up losing a lot of the resolution
which<00:05:24.169> is<00:05:24.320> why<00:05:24.470> we<00:05:24.680> use<00:05:24.710> different<00:05:25.280> lenses<00:05:25.580> or

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
which is why we use different lenses or

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.850 
which is why we use different lenses or
if<00:05:26.630> you're<00:05:26.750> using<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:27.080> camera<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.560> doesn't

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
if you're using a camera that doesn't

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.439 
if you're using a camera that doesn't
have<00:05:28.099> interchangeable<00:05:28.370> lenses<00:05:28.820> then<00:05:29.330> you

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
have interchangeable lenses then you

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.020 
have interchangeable lenses then you
would<00:05:29.570> simply<00:05:29.720> zoom<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.259> or<00:05:30.440> zoom<00:05:30.620> out<00:05:31.030> now

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
would simply zoom in or zoom out now

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.870 
would simply zoom in or zoom out now
let's<00:05:32.300> take<00:05:32.479> a<00:05:32.509> look<00:05:32.690> at<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:32.900> full<00:05:33.440> body<00:05:33.650> shot<00:05:33.880> to

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
let's take a look at a full body shot to

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.550 
let's take a look at a full body shot to
get<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.060> with<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> 60<00:05:35.690> millimeter<00:05:35.870> lens<00:05:36.289> we<00:05:36.529> have

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
get it with a 60 millimeter lens we have

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.890 
get it with a 60 millimeter lens we have
to<00:05:36.889> move<00:05:37.490> away<00:05:37.580> from<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:38.090> subject<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.599> few<00:05:38.779> more

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
to move away from the subject a few more

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.930 
to move away from the subject a few more
feet

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
feet

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.400 
feet
if<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.450> were<00:05:40.540> to<00:05:40.660> move<00:05:40.810> away<00:05:40.930> from<00:05:41.230> your

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
if you were to move away from your

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.280 
if you were to move away from your
subject<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:41.920> about<00:05:42.130> 250<00:05:43.060> feet<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.780> this<00:05:44.020> wide

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
subject to about 250 feet and this wide

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.960 
subject to about 250 feet and this wide
angle<00:05:44.440> might<00:05:44.830> be<00:05:45.010> good<00:05:45.220> if<00:05:45.490> you're<00:05:45.670> trying<00:05:45.850> to

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
angle might be good if you're trying to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.370 
angle might be good if you're trying to
get<00:05:46.090> let's<00:05:46.360> say<00:05:46.480> a<00:05:46.510> white<00:05:47.020> chat<00:05:47.260> of<00:05:47.350> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
get let's say a white chat of the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.770 
get let's say a white chat of the
location<00:05:47.950> because<00:05:48.850> your<00:05:48.970> subject<00:05:49.390> is<00:05:49.540> so

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
location because your subject is so

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.930 
location because your subject is so
small<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.110> it's<00:05:50.470> really<00:05:51.010> hard<00:05:51.190> to<00:05:51.310> even<00:05:51.610> see

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
small that it's really hard to even see

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.120 
small that it's really hard to even see
him<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:53.080> that's<00:05:53.290> when<00:05:53.470> you<00:05:53.560> do<00:05:53.710> want<00:05:53.920> to<00:05:53.980> use<00:05:54.100> a

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
him so that's when you do want to use a

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.520 
him so that's when you do want to use a
long<00:05:54.580> lens<00:05:54.790> such<00:05:55.060> as<00:05:55.210> this<00:05:55.330> 300<00:05:55.900> millimeter<00:05:56.260> to

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
long lens such as this 300 millimeter to

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.550 
long lens such as this 300 millimeter to
basically<00:05:57.190> zoom<00:05:57.430> in<00:05:57.870> now<00:05:58.870> when<00:05:59.200> you're<00:05:59.320> this

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
basically zoom in now when you're this

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.230 
basically zoom in now when you're this
far<00:05:59.620> away<00:06:00.070> that's<00:06:00.310> when<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.580> subjects<00:06:01.030> will

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
far away that's when the subjects will

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.630 
far away that's when the subjects will
look<00:06:01.420> more<00:06:01.630> flat<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.350> less<00:06:02.950> exaggerated

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
look more flat and less exaggerated

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.010 
look more flat and less exaggerated
since<00:06:03.940> you're<00:06:04.090> seeing<00:06:04.360> all<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.690> features

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
since you're seeing all the features

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.280 
since you're seeing all the features
from<00:06:05.290> pretty<00:06:05.890> much<00:06:06.040> the<00:06:06.160> same<00:06:06.280> perspective<00:06:07.290> it

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
from pretty much the same perspective it

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.600 
from pretty much the same perspective it
will<00:06:08.470> also<00:06:08.770> bring<00:06:08.950> other<00:06:09.190> surrounding

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
will also bring other surrounding

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.240 
will also bring other surrounding
objects<00:06:10.210> such<00:06:10.840> as<00:06:10.870> this<00:06:11.170> mailbox<00:06:11.770> that<00:06:12.190> we

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
objects such as this mailbox that we

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.700 
objects such as this mailbox that we
have<00:06:12.400> there<00:06:12.550> in<00:06:12.640> the<00:06:12.730> background<00:06:13.290> closer<00:06:14.290> to

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
have there in the background closer to

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.430 
have there in the background closer to
our<00:06:14.830> main<00:06:15.160> subject<00:06:15.600> whereas<00:06:16.600> if<00:06:16.810> we<00:06:16.840> were<00:06:17.140> you

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
our main subject whereas if we were you

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.560 
our main subject whereas if we were you
know<00:06:17.470> a<00:06:17.560> bit<00:06:17.950> closer<00:06:18.280> and<00:06:18.730> and<00:06:19.180> let's<00:06:19.450> say

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
know a bit closer and and let's say

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.720 
know a bit closer and and let's say
using<00:06:19.840> a<00:06:19.930> 50<00:06:20.230> millimeter<00:06:20.590> lens<00:06:20.680> it<00:06:21.190> looks<00:06:21.610> like

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
using a 50 millimeter lens it looks like

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.350 
using a 50 millimeter lens it looks like
that<00:06:21.850> mailbox<00:06:22.120> is<00:06:22.570> a<00:06:22.600> lot<00:06:22.840> further<00:06:23.140> away

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
that mailbox is a lot further away

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.090 
that mailbox is a lot further away
they're<00:06:25.360> both<00:06:25.540> the<00:06:25.780> same<00:06:25.810> types<00:06:26.350> of<00:06:26.530> shots<00:06:26.830> a

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
they're both the same types of shots a

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.120 
they're both the same types of shots a
full-body<00:06:27.910> shot<00:06:28.110> but<00:06:29.110> what<00:06:29.440> changes<00:06:29.800> now<00:06:29.950> is

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
full-body shot but what changes now is

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.100 
full-body shot but what changes now is
our<00:06:30.310> relative<00:06:30.730> position<00:06:31.240> to<00:06:31.360> the<00:06:31.450> subject<00:06:31.930> and

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
our relative position to the subject and

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.800 
our relative position to the subject and
since<00:06:32.950> with<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.370> 300<00:06:33.820> millimeter<00:06:34.210> lens<00:06:34.450> we

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
since with the 300 millimeter lens we

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.470 
since with the 300 millimeter lens we
have<00:06:34.960> to<00:06:35.140> move<00:06:35.410> away<00:06:35.560> so<00:06:35.770> much<00:06:36.220> further<00:06:36.550> and

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
have to move away so much further and

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.120 
have to move away so much further and
then<00:06:37.630> zoom<00:06:37.840> in<00:06:37.930> optically<00:06:38.440> we<00:06:38.620> end<00:06:38.800> up<00:06:38.950> also

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
then zoom in optically we end up also

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.090 
then zoom in optically we end up also
zooming<00:06:40.120> in<00:06:40.240> on<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:40.480> mailbox<00:06:40.960> which<00:06:41.260> is<00:06:41.470> why
