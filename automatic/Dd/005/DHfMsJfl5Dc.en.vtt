00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
probably like well why is your wireless

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.819 
probably like well why is your wireless
right<00:02:23.389> over<00:02:23.689> there<00:02:23.870> well<00:02:24.200> because<00:02:24.469> I<00:02:24.499> like<00:02:24.799> to

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
right over there well because I like to

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.619 
right over there well because I like to
have<00:02:25.040> my<00:02:25.219> systems<00:02:25.639> connected<00:02:25.939> directly<00:02:26.389> to

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
have my systems connected directly to

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.899 
have my systems connected directly to
the<00:02:27.260> modem<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:27.829> way<00:02:27.980> when<00:02:28.159> i'm<00:02:28.250> online<00:02:28.430> i<00:02:28.609> get

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
the modem that way when i'm online i get

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.759 
the modem that way when i'm online i get
a<00:02:28.939> better<00:02:29.090> connection<00:02:30.159> and<00:02:31.159> then<00:02:31.459> i<00:02:31.489> have<00:02:31.579> two

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
a better connection and then i have two

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.039 
a better connection and then i have two
hard<00:02:33.769> drives<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:35.329> reason<00:02:35.540> i<00:02:35.599> have<00:02:35.719> two<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
hard drives and the reason i have two of

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.929 
hard drives and the reason i have two of
these<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.680> because<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.560> white<00:02:39.769> one<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.219> my

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
these is because the white one is my

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.509 
these is because the white one is my
wireless<00:02:41.150> hard<00:02:41.480> drive<00:02:41.689> so<00:02:42.409> all<00:02:42.829> my<00:02:43.010> computers

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
wireless hard drive so all my computers

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.429 
wireless hard drive so all my computers
that<00:02:43.639> are<00:02:43.700> connected<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.180> my<00:02:44.750> network<00:02:44.780> router
