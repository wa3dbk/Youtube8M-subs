hey guys in this tutorial and continue

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.380 
hey guys in this tutorial and continue
with<00:00:03.360> my<00:00:03.570> series<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.940> tutorials<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.060> Google

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
with my series of tutorials on Google

with my series of tutorials on Google
Chrome<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.930> thought<00:00:07.589> I'd<00:00:07.740> show<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.220> tutorial

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
Chrome I thought I'd show you a tutorial

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.520 
Chrome I thought I'd show you a tutorial
on<00:00:08.849> how<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.059> enable<00:00:09.360> hardware<00:00:10.019> acceleration

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530

that they reference the IE fishbowl as a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.369 
that they reference the IE fishbowl as a
problem<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.829> google<00:00:44.789> chrome<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> can't

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
problem of google chrome that it can't

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.279 
problem of google chrome that it can't
handle<00:00:46.620> hardware<00:00:47.160> acceleration<00:00:47.690> now<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:49.230> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
handle hardware acceleration now out of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.970 
handle hardware acceleration now out of
the<00:00:49.590> box<00:00:49.739> yes<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> true<00:00:51.980> hardware

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the box yes it is true hardware

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.100 
the box yes it is true hardware
acceleration<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
acceleration is not there but the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.000 
acceleration is not there but the
capability<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:57.120> disable<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> notice

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
capability is just disable so notice

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
capability is just disable so notice
right<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.059> fact<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.359> launched<00:01:00.660> say<00:01:01.469> 100

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
right now the fact I launched say 100

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.200 
right now the fact I launched say 100
this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.820> 500<00:01:03.510> pitch<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:06.030> exactly

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
this is just 500 pitch and not exactly

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.560 
this is just 500 pitch and not exactly
going<00:01:06.659> great<00:01:07.580> probably<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.670> 2<00:01:09.180> frames<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
going great probably like 2 frames a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
going great probably like 2 frames a
second

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
second

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.740 
second
three-five<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.660> would<00:01:12.870> be<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:15.360> enable

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
three-five that would be so to enable

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
three-five that would be so to enable
Harvard<00:01:16.680> acceleration<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.190> need<00:01:20.370> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
Harvard acceleration we just need to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.620 
Harvard acceleration we just need to
enable<00:01:20.940> it<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:22.620> configuration<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.510> you

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
enable it in the configuration so as you

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.410 
enable it in the configuration so as you
can<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> canvas<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> set<00:01:26.670> software<00:01:27.300> only

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
can see the canvas is set software only

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
can see the canvas is set software only
it's<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.290> hardware<00:01:28.830> accelerated<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.520> now

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's not hardware accelerated right now

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
it's not hardware accelerated right now
it's<00:01:29.790> disabled<00:01:30.300> so<00:01:30.450> we're<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.990> enable

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's disabled so we're going to enable

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's disabled so we're going to enable
it<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:34.260> do<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.120> go<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
it so to do that you want to go here to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
it so to do that you want to go here to

can enable experimental API is

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.670 
can enable experimental API is
experimental<00:01:52.100> extensions<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.440> one<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
experimental extensions so the one you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.490 
experimental extensions so the one you
want<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.860> look<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.369> called<00:01:57.500> accelerated

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
want to look for is called accelerated

2d<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:03.300> want<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> enable<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> by

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
2d you want to enable this and by

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.859 
2d you want to enable this and by
enabling<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.820> you're<00:02:05.940> effectively<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
enabling it you're effectively going to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.980 
enabling it you're effectively going to
render<00:02:07.140> using<00:02:08.040> huge<00:02:08.910> graphics<00:02:09.450> processing

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
render using huge graphics processing

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.080 
render using huge graphics processing
unit<00:02:10.350> so<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:10.740> your<00:02:10.890> graphics<00:02:11.310> card<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.850> going

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
unit so now your graphics card is going

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.380 
unit so now your graphics card is going
to<00:02:12.180> kick<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:13.100> help<00:02:14.100> accelerate<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
to kick in and help accelerate the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.600 
to kick in and help accelerate the
graphics<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.989> certain<00:02:16.769> rendering<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.430> front

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
graphics of certain rendering of front

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.229 
graphics of certain rendering of front
pages<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.750> now<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.410> watch<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.130> happens<00:02:20.459> now

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
pages so now what watch what happens now

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.509 
pages so now what watch what happens now
for<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.840> take<00:02:21.959> effect<00:02:22.280> talk<00:02:23.280> about<00:02:23.430> this

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
for this to take effect talk about this

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.740 
for this to take effect talk about this
in<00:02:23.760> order<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> take<00:02:24.360> effect<00:02:24.420> you

in order for this to take effect you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.240 
in order for this to take effect you
