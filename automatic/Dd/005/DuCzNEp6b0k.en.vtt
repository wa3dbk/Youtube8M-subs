part two of a factions tutorial on how
to<00:00:05.160> create<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.609> secure<00:00:06.299> base<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.470> segment

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
to create a secure base in this segment

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.530 
to create a secure base in this segment
I'll<00:00:08.069> show<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.400> how<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.580> use<00:00:08.670> craft<00:00:09.090> book<00:00:09.360> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
I'll show you how to use craft book to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.570 
I'll show you how to use craft book to
lift<00:00:09.719> into<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.050> walled-off<00:00:10.590> room<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.219> claimed

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580

called lifting in using craft book you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.380 
called lifting in using craft book you
can<00:00:30.900> use<00:00:31.050> signs<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:32.340> create<00:00:32.640> lifts<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
can use signs to create lifts this is a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.549 
can use signs to create lifts this is a
really<00:00:33.750> neat<00:00:33.930> trick<00:00:36.440> lift<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:40.350> I've

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
really neat trick lift up now that I've

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
really neat trick lift up now that I've
made<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.010> lift<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:43.850> can<00:00:44.850> stand<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.450> his

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
made this lift up I can stand on his

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.990 
made this lift up I can stand on his
land<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.200> still<00:00:46.530> build<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.280> land<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.829> our

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
land and still build on my land so our

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.420 
land and still build on my land so our
building<00:00:51.000> wilderness<00:00:51.570> rather<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
building wilderness rather we have be so

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.479 
building wilderness rather we have be so
I<00:00:53.460> built<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.260> make<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:56.219> sign<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I built that I make a little sign that

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.830 
I built that I make a little sign that
says<00:00:57.590> lift<00:00:58.760> oops<00:00:59.760> has<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> bracket

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
says lift oops has to be a bracket

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.890 
says lift oops has to be a bracket
bracket<00:01:01.230> lift<00:01:01.920> space<00:01:02.780> down<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> I've<00:01:06.750> created

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bracket lift space down so I've created

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.670 
bracket lift space down so I've created
a<00:01:07.170> lift<00:01:07.350> down<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.060> step<00:01:09.390> stand<00:01:10.080> for

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a lift down now if I step stand for

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160 
a lift down now if I step stand for
example<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.640> right<00:01:12.479> click<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.900> sign

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
example here and right click the sign

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.950 
example here and right click the sign
it'll<00:01:13.860> teleport<00:01:14.520> me<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.390> wear<00:01:15.540> over<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it'll teleport me up to wear over that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.100 
it'll teleport me up to wear over that
lip<00:01:16.140> sinus<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.119> same<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:18.900> back

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
lip sinus and same thing I can go back

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.770 
lip sinus and same thing I can go back
and<00:01:19.140> forth<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.979> much<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.540> over

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and forth as much as I like it's over

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
and forth as much as I like it's over
higher<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.979> would<00:01:23.100> work<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
higher it would work all the way to the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.160 
higher it would work all the way to the
sky<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:25.439> cool<00:01:25.770> thing<00:01:25.799> comes<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:27.170> cool

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
sky the cool thing comes in here cool

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.950 
sky the cool thing comes in here cool
and<00:01:28.439> potentially<00:01:29.100> dangerous<00:01:29.310> thing<00:01:31.670> if<00:01:32.670> I

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
and potentially dangerous thing if I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.760 
and potentially dangerous thing if I
lift<00:01:35.960> while<00:01:36.960> standing<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.619> position<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
lift while standing in this position I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.389 
lift while standing in this position I
lift<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.040> adjacent<00:01:41.659> vertical<00:01:42.659> position

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
lift to the adjacent vertical position

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.679 
lift to the adjacent vertical position
now<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.579> would<00:01:44.700> happen<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.240> lift<00:01:45.450> down

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
now what would happen if I lift down

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.289 
now what would happen if I lift down
from<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:47.369> lift<00:01:47.729> into<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.360> base<00:01:49.189> and

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
from here I can lift into your base and

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.499 
from here I can lift into your base and
kill<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:52.070> now<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.280> might<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.880> able<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.180> lift

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
kill you now I might not be able to lift

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.889 
kill you now I might not be able to lift
out<00:01:54.780> um<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.329> were<00:01:57.509> made<00:01:57.689> out<00:01:57.869> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
out um so if this were made out of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.660 
out um so if this were made out of
obsidian<00:01:58.619> I'd<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.490> difficult

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
obsidian I'd have a really difficult

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
obsidian I'd have a really difficult
time<00:02:00.030> doing<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.110> where<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
time doing this but where you can do is

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.020 
time doing this but where you can do is
even<00:02:02.040> though<00:02:02.130> you're<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.430> allowed<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> break

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
even though you're not allowed to break

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209 
even though you're not allowed to break
blocks<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.600> somebody<00:02:03.869> else's<00:02:04.170> land<00:02:04.350> what

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
blocks in somebody else's land what

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.160 
blocks in somebody else's land what
happens<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:05.759> says<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.630> can't<00:02:06.840> break<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
happens as says you can't break the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.650 
happens as says you can't break the
block<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.910> break<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> block

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
block but really you can break the block

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.380 
block but really you can break the block
and<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.140> reappears<00:02:10.860> almost<00:02:11.400> instantly<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.209> in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and it reappears almost instantly but in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.850 
and it reappears almost instantly but in
that<00:02:12.540> almost<00:02:13.080> instant

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that almost instant

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.210 
that almost instant
you<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:16.080> click<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.500> sign<00:02:16.800> really

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
you can you can click that sign really

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.580 
you can you can click that sign really
