 street is not that cold 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.660
 is not going too much the dress that we 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.349

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.529
 am teaching assistant in letters 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.670
 and educational assistant in a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.020
 college and a high school 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.119
 I see that you are a lot of assets and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.769
 wii comes from elsewhere his 6th step 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 ok ok so that's still subscribed to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.289
 all that will last ten years zorg youth 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.029
 hope quickly 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.470
 no, but no, do not worry about saying our 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.560
 time we will start from the first to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.850
 last it will be simpler so the whole thing 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.559
 first is this one I believe that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.000
 this is one of the smallest that I have is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.149
 the effects of wings in 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.250
 martial to brunstatt so in alsace by 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.469
 a tattoo artist called mag you there I 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.399
 did I was 20 years old a kind 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.039
 flight I leave the nest to me freedom 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.750
 the second he is here on the coast 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 it's a lettering ave maria 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.829
 there it has a two-way meaning 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.230
 with marie already because I am 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.789
 someone believer I 'm just doing them 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.039
 before leaving to study in paris 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.780
 because I wanted protection at 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.909
 something about me and because my 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.799
 Mom's name is Mary and my 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 middle name and marie so that was a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.200
 little bit for for the family for him 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.970
 to pay homage therefore follows the third 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.580
 but so is right down my 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.290
 neck is a very beautiful knot and I 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.729
 do my best friend who has the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.150
 even though she is there in color 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.890
 okay we did it by nais to saint 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.049
 dié in the continuous vosges on the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.369
 ribs one coast and that there I have a small 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.960
 leopard knot 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.850
 there is not too much meaning just 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.409
 because the leopard pattern motivates me 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.560
 favorite I like it a little 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.420
 wild 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.220
 and I wanted one like that on 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.020
 ribs honestly from those who tell me 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.079
 yeah I got tattooed that made 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.430
 not bad 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.130
 after it's bad it's going to do that you have 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.600
 wrong but it's true it's true tested 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 at home vault the ribs it's done 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.270
 already hard to imagine a needle that 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.740
 transfer your skin for the little one 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.259
 story of which he was not to be placed 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.560
 also stunned it was the birthday of a 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:06.220
 friend way had taken a drink before 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.920
 I 'm going to get tattooed coach is 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.239
 so arrived at the tattooed it was the one 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.890
 that she did not notice that I 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:18.340
 had to have 6 how to lead and that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.430

 find with a taser on the buttocks 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.349
 so not say so following heavy 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.569
 so 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.610
 a swallow with an old school heart 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.260
 yeah and so that one it was made by 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.570
 sony blick he's really made for 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.100
 so mark the fidelity I have in 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.810
 love and friendship 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.940
 if it's not indiscreet you want m 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.480
 inside containers I think that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.180
 I will give 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.600

 I do not know too much yet I 'll see with 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.920
 she and I think maybe he'll 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.600
 go into color on the agreement yeah 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.280
 it's true that I did not have 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.810
 not want to ask often but he did not 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.700
 not look finished and everything and me at the beginning 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.220
 for me it was finished but there with the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.870

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.889
 even it's not creating affiliates is 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.489
 okay I think I have a problem 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.170
 after 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.960
 I decided to attack the feet at 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.210
 the big order 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.280
 big shipyard I wanted to do the 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.390

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.800
 of a crown under one has small this 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.080
 case and so this one will say that he has 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.270
 a little more proud a lot more I 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.220

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.650
 of ten thousand years throws less and a little 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.090
 more discreet 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.650
 the lettering on the feet that sometimes 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.480
 a little cow but heard that the 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.310

 deepest of the artois for the moment 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.600
 It's certainly fine when you think 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.250

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.630

 I like them surround us in relation 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.820
 with religion too and that's me 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.169
 represents well I had a little bit discussed 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.729
 with a girl precisely who was 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.710
 practicing Catholic and his family 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.100
 not at all 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.259
 tattoos 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.759
 do you see that as a candy is not 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.650
 ultra will emit practicing but it's going 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.479
 to be funny brings anyway a 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.820
 importance to religion she had to 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.100
 bad at first with the tattoos have to 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.840
 know that about the ten tattoo there 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.970
 at least six or mom was with 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.550
 me it's still pretty paradoxical 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.440
 yeah that's funny she does not understand 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.800
 why why am I 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.750
 tattoo 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.130
 but every time it comes with was 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.960
 the impression like his room that it him 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.789
 allows to accept they accept it but 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.130
 that she had a lot of trouble 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:05.660
 beginning what did I do that because 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.889
 I already wanted it because it is 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.930
 my body and that I do what I want 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.910
 with my body and that I needed 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.770
 to have some representations 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.510
 tattooing thing on me and that's it and 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.940
 in the end it's me 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.400
 after me I think it's also 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.110
 generational and that there are some who 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.910
 cares about who are doing this in this 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.550
 moment we have a lot back to the old 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.789
 school in tattoos and that's so much 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.590
 better 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.000

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.470
 not but just do not tell me it's up to 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.419
 the fashion 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.449
