allow you to introduce a new fabric with

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.649 
allow you to introduce a new fabric with
little<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:33.170> no<00:01:33.200> evidence<00:01:33.469> of<00:01:33.829> transition<00:01:34.659> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
little to no evidence of transition the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.120 
little to no evidence of transition the
best<00:01:35.930> part<00:01:36.229> about<00:01:36.380> my<00:01:36.680> method<00:01:37.009> of

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
best part about my method of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.440 
best part about my method of
constructing<00:01:37.460> these<00:01:37.670> rugs<00:01:37.969> that<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.240> fact

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
constructing these rugs that the fact

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.709 
constructing these rugs that the fact
that<00:01:38.630> there<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.960> no<00:01:39.500> sewing<00:01:40.039> required<00:01:40.719> the

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
that there is no sewing required the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.209 
that there is no sewing required the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
fabric strips and we're going to lay one

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.890 
fabric strips and we're going to lay one
strip<00:02:24.980> on<00:02:25.129> top<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.879> other<00:02:26.030> aligning<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
pull just a little bit harder it could

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.750 
pull just a little bit harder it could
indeed<00:02:43.880> rip<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.660> fabric<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.520> point

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
indeed rip the fabric at this point

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.800 
indeed rip the fabric at this point
we're<00:02:46.850> going<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:47.000> turn<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.390> over<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.630> you'll

and<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:03.620> fabric<00:03:03.980> will<00:03:04.100> just<00:03:04.310> pop<00:03:04.940> together<00:03:05.300> in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
and the fabric will just pop together in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.940 
and the fabric will just pop together in
fact<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:05.900> almost<00:03:06.050> feel<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.650> kind<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.890> a

popping sound when those are properly
joined<00:03:10.370> let's<00:03:11.150> try<00:03:11.299> that<00:03:11.420> again

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
joined let's try that again

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.220 
joined let's try that again
now<00:03:12.680> these<00:03:12.920> two<00:03:13.190> strips<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.610> we've<00:03:13.760> just

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
now these two strips that we've just

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.660 
now these two strips that we've just
joined<00:03:15.230> are<00:03:15.500> now<00:03:15.650> considered<00:03:16.100> our<00:03:16.250> working

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
fabric strip to these so again we're

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.650 
fabric strip to these so again we're
going<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.870> lay<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.380> two<00:03:24.530> strips<00:03:24.860> together

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
going to lay the two strips together

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.059 
going to lay the two strips together
folding<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.780> back<00:03:26.959> approximately<00:03:27.319> a<00:03:27.709> half<00:03:27.890> an

up<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.900> again<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.769> working<00:03:37.130> strip<00:03:37.400> if<00:03:37.519> you'll

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
up and again the working strip if you'll

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.030 
up and again the working strip if you'll
notice<00:03:37.970> it's<00:03:38.150> going<00:03:38.390> away<00:03:38.660> from<00:03:38.720> me<00:03:39.049> and<00:03:39.410> the
