00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello how about youtube friends how 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.879
 are the racers friends and in this 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.970
 I bring you a tutorial of 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.429
 minecraft to build a useful and very 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.559
 practical trash can which is going to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 serve a lot since it will help us 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 eliminate those useless objects that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.289
 have in our inventory or in 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.720
 our chests in case you 're already 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.670
 full and we do not want to keep them many 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949
 Sometimes what we do is throw an object 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 out on the map but the problem is 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.390
 that this can worry us a lot 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.279
 acc we can also make a hole in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.110
 the earth and put lava and throw them there 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.320
 but the problem is that if our house 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.470
 it's wood is going to start burning 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.940
 and we do not want that true 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.250
 what to build this trash can 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.780
 it's the simplest thing in the world 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.489
 to occupy very easy materials 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.170
 get and good to do it 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.110
 we're just going to make a 3 hole 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.449
 blocks down like it's there 123 to 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.580
 this one and in the third we're going to put a 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.500
 block of sand there and now we're going to 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.629
 break the blocks that 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.400
 they hinder us here forming as a 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.100
 kind of cross and who are we going to 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.320
 occupying a cactus like this is this cactus that 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.780
 then it bothers us he clicks on us and 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.920
 because we have cut a utility and 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.800
 very well already once we have placed 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.869
 the cactus we are going to put aside here 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.119
 there is a trapdoor there to open 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.860
 up to 12 as the cover of our 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.259
 trash can and here together we're going to 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.509
 place a pressure plate either of 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.820
 wood or stone we're going to put it there 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.680
 is and to decorate we can also 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.680
 place a sign on the top 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.370
 here that says trash can 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.670
 boat of 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.950
 ensures that it is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.290
 very well and now when we approach 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.270
 the trapdoor is going to open and now what 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.759
 that will magically make the cactus will be that 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.159
 when we take an object and throw it 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.470
 this one just disappears that's how 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.049
 if it were the lava but without putting in 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.700
 risk our house and well there it is 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.280
 very easy to make this trash can 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.590
 it's very simple we just take the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.750
 objects that no longer work for us 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.399
 so well we are going to go stretching one 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.399
 for one pulls is also or not 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.060
 and good friends I hope this video 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 tutorial has been very helpful 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.980
 they liked it but they can leave their 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.320

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.680

 Y
