sick<00:02:00.050> this<00:02:00.830> whole<00:02:01.070> story<00:02:01.930> takes<00:02:02.930> place<00:02:03.020> on<00:02:03.350> a

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
sick this whole story takes place on a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.490 
sick this whole story takes place on a
farm<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:04.970> involves<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.720> close-knit<00:02:06.470> family

farm and it involves a close-knit family
kind<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:10.180> DNA<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.390> guess<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:12.170> gets<00:02:12.350> passed<00:02:12.560> on

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
kind of DNA I guess that gets passed on

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.540 
kind of DNA I guess that gets passed on
from<00:02:13.160> father<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.790> son<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.600> kind<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.550> psychotic

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
from father to son of kind of psychotic

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.290 
from father to son of kind of psychotic
nature<00:02:17.620> when<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:19.220> pitched<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.850> book<00:02:20.030> it

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
nature when I was pitched the book it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.420 
nature when I was pitched the book it
was<00:02:20.680> completely<00:02:21.680> different<00:02:22.100> than<00:02:22.220> what<00:02:22.250> I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
was completely different than what I

ended up reading in that I thought it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.290 
ended up reading in that I thought it
was<00:02:25.820> more<00:02:26.030> supernatural<00:02:26.990> with<00:02:27.800> like<00:02:28.300> Satan

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.129 

reading<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:18.579> book<00:04:18.729> with<00:04:18.940> flawed<00:04:19.209> characters<00:04:19.900> I

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
reading a book with flawed characters I

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.890 
reading a book with flawed characters I
think<00:04:21.009> is<00:04:21.130> more<00:04:21.280> interesting<00:04:21.880> because<00:04:22.419> if<00:04:22.810> you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
think is more interesting because if you

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.540 
think is more interesting because if you
just<00:04:23.110> read<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.380> book<00:04:23.680> where<00:04:23.979> everybody<00:04:24.460> is

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
just read a book where everybody is

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.960 
just read a book where everybody is
happy<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:26.080> hero<00:04:26.410> saves<00:04:26.860> someone<00:04:27.370> from<00:04:27.639> a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
happy and the hero saves someone from a

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.600 
happy and the hero saves someone from a
tree<00:04:28.539> or<00:04:28.930> there's<00:04:29.139> a<00:04:29.199> cat<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.130> fireman

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
tree or there's a cat that the fireman

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.270 
tree or there's a cat that the fireman
helps<00:04:30.910> out<00:04:31.090> that's<00:04:31.690> great<00:04:32.139> but<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.710> think<00:04:33.130> we

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
helps out that's great but I think we

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.950 
helps out that's great but I think we
all<00:04:33.310> relate<00:04:33.789> because<00:04:33.940> we<00:04:34.210> all<00:04:34.330> have<00:04:34.509> feelings

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
all relate because we all have feelings

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.120 
all relate because we all have feelings
of<00:04:35.080> insecurity<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.940> we<00:04:37.690> know<00:04:37.960> our<00:04:38.259> own<00:04:38.440> faults

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
of insecurity and we know our own faults

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.080 
of insecurity and we know our own faults
and<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:40.419> think<00:04:40.720> voicing<00:04:41.350> that<00:04:41.380> I<00:04:41.919> enjoy<00:04:42.759> that<00:04:42.789> so

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
and I think voicing that I enjoy that so

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.879 
and I think voicing that I enjoy that so

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
is a sort of detachment that comes I

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.690 
is a sort of detachment that comes I
think<00:05:47.690> if<00:05:47.810> you<00:05:47.900> start<00:05:48.200> to<00:05:48.490> perform<00:05:49.490> the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
think if you start to perform the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.500 
think if you start to perform the
darkness<00:05:51.070> it<00:05:52.070> seems<00:05:52.730> like<00:05:53.030> it's<00:05:53.180> not<00:05:53.360> as

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
darkness it seems like it's not as

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.720 
darkness it seems like it's not as
believable<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:55.010> just<00:05:55.280> kind<00:05:55.430> of<00:05:55.520> have<00:05:55.580> to

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
believable so you just kind of have to

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.050 
believable so you just kind of have to
let<00:05:56.450> the<00:05:56.630> words<00:05:56.900> come<00:05:57.290> out<00:05:57.520> kind<00:05:58.520> of<00:05:58.580> detach
