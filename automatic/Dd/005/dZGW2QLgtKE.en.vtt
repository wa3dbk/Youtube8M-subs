00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.879
 claro l'ia wants to buy a dress she 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.360
 does 1 38 in germany 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.000
 in France she does a 40 without getting fat 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.820
 it's just the label that changes 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 in italy the same cloud brings 1.44 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.240
 and in England in 12 or 1 36 that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.830
 depends you'll have figured out the sizes 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 of clothes are one of the last 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.359
 bastions of anarchy in europe but 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.869
 how do you come up with so many numbers 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.570
 different 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 in germany we start with the bust 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.190
 there it says at a bust of 88 cm 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.550
 we tell him by two that's 44 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.320
 then we go on tr 6 that's it 38 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.420
 for men we also rely on 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.510
 the bust but we stop 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.160
 after division by 2 reiff with his 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.399
 bust 200 cm therefore wears 1 50 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.920
 congratulations you wonder why we 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.800
 withdraws six bodies claudia and pope oral 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.130
 I was also given the explanation 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.890
 next the ready-to-wear manufacturers 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.460
 would have invented this codification in 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.790
 the 50s by pure prudery listen 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.800
 well 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 he wanted to avoid being able to deduce 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.520
 of the dress label the round of 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.850
 breast of the young lady 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.880
 good it is true that take 38 add 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.229
 6 is multiplied by 2 just to see if 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.200
 the lady has a beautiful chest 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 it's a little complicated but good when we 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.610
 do not dare look at the lady in front 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.210
 it's not just the Germans they 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 be prudish 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 in France we also divide the tour 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.320
 woman's chest by two but we do not 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.470
 subtract that four with the same turn 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.330
 chest of 88 cm a claudia 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 French would be 88 / equal 44 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.420
 - 4 equals 40 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.099
 why do we remove 4 instead of six 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.319
 is that the French being in 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.170
 average smaller one waist 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.880
 and hips of 38 German 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.670
 correspond to 1 40 french you me 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.980
 follow me anyway I would have the unif 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.959
 believed at all and the English with their 12 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.760
 mystery and gum ball it seems that 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.690
 it's a purely conventional figure 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.700
 which has no meaning 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.200
 special 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 all that makes the trip turn 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.310
 european shopping by claudio casse 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.620
 head but is especially a problem 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.180
 multinationals in the manufacture and 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.370
 to mail order houses 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.870
 because 50% of the returns are due to a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.989
 size problem to fix a 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:44.349
 European standardization committee 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:46.810
 this n slash tc 248 slash wg 10 plank 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.120
 on a coding system that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.410
 would be valid for all of europe 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.780
 he's been working there for ten years 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.670
 above 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.739
 it's difficult how 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.719
 formatted all is happy that a small 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.090
 fat skinny short legged is 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.650
 launched and menu is round and how 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.900
 take into account the interests of 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.819
 French who prefer to wear tight 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.319
 where a lot of German people are 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.409
 honest does not care a bit 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.239
 for now the experts the 28 countries 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.299
 of the commission were able to agree 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.700
 on how to measure yet this is 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.459
 already that for the common sizes he 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.239
 will have to wait a little longer 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.430
 currently it is a proposal 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.189
 Dutch is on the rise 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.260
 a code with one letter and two digits 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.989
 for example it's for the turn of 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.419
 chest 8 for the waist and 4 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.939
 for the height of the person but the 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:39.489
 France is opposed to these proposals and 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.620
 categorically it is in France 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.209
 these new labels are not thought to be 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.099
 not at all suited to the silhouette 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.280
 of the French woman who would have 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.019
 sure of more ideal proportions than his 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.639
 European girlfriends this is what we 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.019
 could call brigitte syndrome 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.370
 hinny 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.019
 the French want to wait until 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.120
 results of their big campaign of 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.489
 measurement of the population that comes 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.620
 just finished and after 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.720
 only we will see I have 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.049
 the impression that claudia did not come out 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.049
 from the hostel
