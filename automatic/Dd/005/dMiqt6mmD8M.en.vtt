00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.390 

hello<00:00:06.149> I'm<00:00:06.450> tick-tock<00:00:06.990> Tony<00:00:07.229> and<00:00:07.470> today<00:00:08.220> we're

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
hello I'm tick-tock Tony and today we're

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.129 
hello I'm tick-tock Tony and today we're
going<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.700> learn<00:00:08.820> how<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> remove<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
going to learn how to remove the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.340 
going to learn how to remove the
movement<00:00:10.530> from<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.830> British<00:00:11.130> long-case<00:00:11.580> clock

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
movement from a British long-case clock

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.129 
movement from a British long-case clock
so<00:00:13.350> the<00:00:13.470> case<00:00:13.650> consists<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.220> two<00:00:14.430> parts<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
so the case consists of two parts the

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.359 
so the case consists of two parts the
base<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.400> hood<00:00:17.689> the<00:00:18.689> hood<00:00:18.740> moves<00:00:19.740> forward

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
base and the hood the hood moves forward

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.929 
base and the hood the hood moves forward
and<00:00:21.439> comes<00:00:22.439> off<00:00:22.589> the<00:00:22.739> case<00:00:22.919> forward<00:00:25.939> inside

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
and comes off the case forward inside

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.329 
and comes off the case forward inside
the<00:00:27.119> door<00:00:27.300> we<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.169> ways<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.739> the

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
the door we see two ways and the

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.389 
the door we see two ways and the
pendulum<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.710> important<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
pendulum this is very important that

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.110 
pendulum this is very important that
when<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.790> remove<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.360> hood<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.220> so<00:00:35.489> with

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
when you remove the hood you do so with

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.630 
when you remove the hood you do so with
the<00:00:36.269> weights<00:00:36.480> attached<00:00:37.160> this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.309> because

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the weights attached this is because

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.150 
the weights attached this is because
often<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.480> seat<00:00:39.690> board<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.739> movement

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
often the seat board and the movement

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.759 
often the seat board and the movement
and<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.429> dial<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.210> fixed<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.320> cheeks

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
and the dial are not fixed to the cheeks

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.020 
and the dial are not fixed to the cheeks
and<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.269> move<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.690> hood<00:00:45.899> forward<00:00:46.820> it<00:00:47.820> will

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
and as you move the hood forward it will

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.439 
and as you move the hood forward it will
be<00:00:48.149> possible<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> whole<00:00:50.489> movement<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
be possible for the whole movement to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:01.000 
be possible for the whole movement to
come<00:00:51.600> forward<00:00:51.929> and<00:00:52.260> fall<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.859> on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.519> floor

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.009 

but<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.130> you<00:01:02.220> have<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.520> Waze<00:01:02.670> attached<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
but when you have the Waze attached the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.390 
but when you have the Waze attached the
movement<00:01:04.580> stabilizes<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.510> cheeks<00:01:07.400> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
movement stabilizes on the cheeks the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
movement stabilizes on the cheeks the
next<00:01:08.670> step<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> remove<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.930> right

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
next step would be to remove the right

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:21.340 
next step would be to remove the right
hand<00:01:10.530> weight<00:01:10.710> which<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> time<00:01:11.880> side<00:01:12.210> weight

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.320 

with<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> time<00:01:22.740> side<00:01:23.009> weight<00:01:23.250> removed<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:24.150> can

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
with the time side weight removed we can

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:40.160 
with the time side weight removed we can
now<00:01:24.450> remove<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.869> pendulum<00:01:39.080> with<00:01:40.080> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
now remove the pendulum with the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
now remove the pendulum with the
pendulum<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.100> hand<00:01:41.399> side<00:01:41.490> weight

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
pendulum and the right hand side weight

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.540 
pendulum and the right hand side weight
removed<00:01:42.470> just<00:01:43.470> remains<00:01:43.830> for<00:01:44.039> us<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.250> remove

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
removed just remains for us to remove

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.880 
removed just remains for us to remove
the<00:01:44.700> left<00:01:44.910> hand<00:01:45.149> side<00:01:45.390> weight<00:01:45.630> before<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.770> do

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
the left hand side weight before you do

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.999 
the left hand side weight before you do
that<00:01:47.039> be<00:01:47.340> very<00:01:47.700> careful<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.350> dial<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that be very careful that the dial and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.999 
that be very careful that the dial and
the<00:01:50.460> movement<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.030> stable<00:01:51.660> on<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> clock<00:01:52.259> this

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the movement is stable on the clock this

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.249 
the movement is stable on the clock this
may<00:01:53.280> require<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:53.880> people<00:01:54.300> one<00:01:54.509> person<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
may require two people one person to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:05.480 
may require two people one person to
hold<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.979> dial<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> movement<00:02:03.799> now<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.340> can

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
hold the dial in the movement now we can

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.479 
hold the dial in the movement now we can
remove<00:02:05.640> any<00:02:05.939> screws<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.509> happen<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.080> a

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
remove any screws that happen to be on a

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.050 
remove any screws that happen to be on a
seat<00:02:08.489> board<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.989> case<00:02:10.049> of<00:02:10.410> Arnon<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.880> we'd

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
seat board in this case of Arnon so we'd

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.770 
seat board in this case of Arnon so we'd
move<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.390> movement<00:02:12.750> out<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.920> case<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
move the movement out of the case and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.769 
move the movement out of the case and
take<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> workshop
