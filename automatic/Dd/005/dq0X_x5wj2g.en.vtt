the<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:38.460> put<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> band<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:40.020> go

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the right put a band there and then go

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
the right put a band there and then go
all<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> way<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.219> side<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.610> your

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
all the way up the right side of your

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
all the way up the right side of your
loom<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:43.230> pretty<00:00:43.559> easy<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:45.649> think<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
loom it's pretty easy I think this is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
loom it's pretty easy I think this is
the<00:00:47.039> easiest<00:00:47.340> part<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.879> member<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> put<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the easiest part that member to put it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
the easiest part that member to put it
to<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> center<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.590> by<00:00:49.739> Mickey<00:00:50.010> cap<00:00:50.280> band<00:00:50.489> by

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
to the center then by Mickey cap band by

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
to the center then by Mickey cap band by
making<00:00:51.000> eight<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> put<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> those<00:00:51.989> two

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
making eight and put it on those two

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.580 
making eight and put it on those two
bands<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.710> intersect<00:00:54.079> then<00:00:55.079> take<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> white

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
bands that intersect then take a white

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.869 
bands that intersect then take a white
band<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.980> make<00:00:56.129> these<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.460> triangles

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
band and make these little triangles

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
band and make these little triangles
like<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.410> upside-down

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
like so it's kind of like an upside-down

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.090 
like so it's kind of like an upside-down
weird<00:00:59.250> triangle<00:01:00.350> do<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
weird triangle do all the way up the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.109 
weird triangle do all the way up the
left<00:01:02.370> side<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.640> your<00:01:02.910> loom<00:01:04.040> it's<00:01:05.040> pretty<00:01:05.339> easy

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.609 

then<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> same<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.409> up

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
then do the same thing all the way up

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469 
then do the same thing all the way up
the<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.010> side<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.369> your<00:01:11.490> loom<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.299> should

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the right side of your loom you should

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.969 
the right side of your loom you should
get<00:01:12.630> these<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.869> diamond<00:01:13.409> shapes<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
get these little diamond shapes in the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.060 
get these little diamond shapes in the
middle<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.460> you're<00:01:14.880> doing<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:16.070> it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
middle if you're doing it right it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
middle if you're doing it right it's
very<00:01:17.490> easy<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
very easy just go all the way up the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
very easy just go all the way up the
right<00:01:18.960> side<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.439> loom<00:01:19.619> until<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.670> are

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
right side of your loom until you are

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.490 
right side of your loom until you are
finished<00:01:21.090> until<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.930> last<00:01:22.049> green

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
finished until you get to the last green

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.539 
finished until you get to the last green
band<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> should<00:01:24.600> look<00:01:24.780> like

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
band this is what it should look like

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
band this is what it should look like
then<00:01:26.549> take<00:01:26.850> any<00:01:27.090> colored<00:01:27.479> band<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.869> put<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
then take any colored band and put it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520 
then take any colored band and put it
where<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> tube<00:01:28.740> elastics<00:01:29.579> two<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.630> triangles

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
where the tube elastics two of triangles

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
where the tube elastics two of triangles
intersect<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.130> wrap<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.460> around<00:01:32.549> four<00:01:32.970> times

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
intersect and wrap it around four times

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
intersect and wrap it around four times
you're<00:01:33.780> making<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.140> double<00:01:34.500> cap<00:01:34.680> band<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you're making a double cap band just

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
you're making a double cap band just
like<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.880> making<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.600> ponytail<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
like if you are making a ponytail or a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.719 
like if you are making a ponytail or a
hair<00:01:37.619> tie<00:01:37.799> whatever<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> call<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
hair tie whatever you like to call it

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.120 
hair tie whatever you like to call it
just<00:01:39.720> wrap<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> around<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.350> four<00:01:40.619> times<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
just wrap it around at four times the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.850 
just wrap it around at four times the
middle<00:01:41.520> pin<00:01:42.150> where<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> two<00:01:43.350> triangles

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
middle pin where the two triangles

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
middle pin where the two triangles
intersect<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:45.390> should<00:01:45.570> look<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
intersect it should look like that and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.080 
intersect it should look like that and
do<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> middle<00:01:50.090> it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
do it all the way up the middle it's

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.870 
do it all the way up the middle it's
pretty<00:01:51.420> easy<00:01:51.950> just<00:01:52.950> wrap<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.399> around<00:01:53.490> four

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
pretty easy just wrap it around four

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
pretty easy just wrap it around four
times<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.360> each<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> middle<00:01:55.200> pegs

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590
