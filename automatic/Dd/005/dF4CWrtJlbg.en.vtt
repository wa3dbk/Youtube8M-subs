00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.869
 listen for now but that loses 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.619
 a technical staff but in the 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.300
 best conditions 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.450
 even if it's true as a test 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.760
 goal of looking for a club 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.920
 it feels like being in 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.250
 a club enters between the family and the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.960
 club 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.939
 no, but we have everything we need to 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560
 prepare ourselves and now the goal 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.930
 unfortunately for us all it's 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.410
 spend less time here will say 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.329
 what we are unemployed 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.130
 no it's true you're 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.309
 professional above all that's why 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:51.260
 we came here 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:53.390
 after we are a bit of big brothers 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.719
 in relation to our seniority by us 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.899
 and we are in better conditions 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.510
 here to work well so after 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.750
 like dj does it's trying to find 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.920
 a club pretty quickly because this 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.360
 to know that there is 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 no one forcing us to come here 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.560
 to be at home and our side 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.830
 to turn one's thumbs or to 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.330
 prepare each one his way while there 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.830
 a beautiful structure born there we bump 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.890
 like in a club we are getting ready 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.600
 physically we have the trainings the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.130
 simpler for us it's good we 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.630
 prepare to be able to find a club 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.760
 pretty quickly and I tell myself it's 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.390
 better to be here with structures that 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.570
 are a lot of coaches who are 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.810
 quite competent and 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.650
 and rather than stay home at 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.930
 to train alone is what I 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.270
 do we talked about it both in the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.970
 room our goal is to stay in 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.920
 France because there is family because 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.689
 they mainly French after 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.370
 in the current situation it is not 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.570
 obvious also for clubs but 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.630
 we have enough experience to be able to 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.270
 help clubs mentor youth cons 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.160
 as we do here so 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.440
 so we are open to everyone afterwards 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.140
 we will not be choosy for 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.140
 abroad but we prefer more 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.520
 france that the walls but still 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.350
 Realistically, we know that we have already 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.720
 a lot of things to limit now 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.310
 ie the bonus but then we take 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.480
 a little pleasure but we can not 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 the project in any 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:32.740
 condition anywhere anyway 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.810
 more uncle so no but it happens 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.520
 quite naturally because to see more 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.200
 that by the young people's speeches after 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.030
 stacom as if like us when he 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.010
 was young it was more talk it's 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.460
 more by example by the big ones 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.690
 speech then we try to have to be 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.030
 the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.580
 the right arm of the coach on the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.950
 workouts and for that we are pretty 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.490
 often in front of both and is 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:01.040
 like that it also allows young people to 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.040
 I follow a little more studies
