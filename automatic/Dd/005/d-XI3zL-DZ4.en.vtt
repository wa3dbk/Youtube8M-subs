00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.200 
instead of using mail for any sandwiches
I<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.409> recommend<00:01:07.650> using<00:01:08.220> Greek

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
I would really recommend using Greek

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
I would really recommend using Greek
yogurt<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.900> also<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.860> Greek<00:01:11.159> yogurt

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
yogurt and also with this Greek yogurt

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.250 
yogurt and also with this Greek yogurt
and<00:01:11.700> mix<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.119> chia<00:01:12.390> seeds<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and mix it with chia seeds just so that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.590 
and mix it with chia seeds just so that
there's<00:01:13.470> extra<00:01:13.710> protein<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.420> lot

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there's extra protein it's just a lot

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
there's extra protein it's just a lot
healthier<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.040> prefer<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
healthier that way and I prefer the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.560 
healthier that way and I prefer the
taste<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.640> next<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> layering

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
taste and the next is just the layering

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
taste and the next is just the layering
of<00:01:21.810> any<00:01:22.110> type<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.500> toppings<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
of any type of toppings that you like so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.850 
of any type of toppings that you like so
in<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> case<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.479> using<00:01:24.509> lettuce<00:01:25.350> cheese

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
in this case I'm using lettuce cheese

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.609 
in this case I'm using lettuce cheese
and<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.850> turkey<00:01:27.180> breast<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:28.409> don't

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and the turkey breast I really don't

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
and the turkey breast I really don't
like<00:01:28.740> tomatoes<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> keep<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.119> out

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
like tomatoes I like to keep that out

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
like tomatoes I like to keep that out
but<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.140> tomatoes<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.740> would<00:01:31.950> really

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
but if you like tomatoes I would really

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.800 
but if you like tomatoes I would really
recommend<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> put<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
recommend that you put it in just so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.300 
recommend that you put it in just so
that<00:01:34.020> there's<00:01:34.200> more<00:01:34.259> nutrition<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:39.110> and

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
that there's more nutrition in it and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.410 
that there's more nutrition in it and
then<00:01:41.310> after<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> I'll<00:01:42.000> hold<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.270> all

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
then after that I'll hold it all

more<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.350> put<00:03:38.530> some<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:38.920> rice<00:03:39.370> vinegar

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
more to put some of that rice vinegar

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.300 
more to put some of that rice vinegar
and<00:03:39.880> sesame<00:03:40.150> oil<00:03:40.420> mixture<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.530> just<00:03:42.160> so

that<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.519> kind<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.790> lubricates<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.450> knife<00:03:43.720> so

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
that it kind of lubricates the knife so

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.750 
that it kind of lubricates the knife so
that<00:03:44.019> makes<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.500> really<00:03:44.739> easy<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.280> cut<00:03:45.549> through

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
that makes it really easy to cut through

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.840 
that makes it really easy to cut through
the<00:03:45.940> sushi<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.810> then<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.739> just<00:03:47.950> slowly<00:03:48.250> go

tender<00:04:41.600> after<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.020> like<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.470> put<00:04:43.680> that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
tender after that I like to put that

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.439 
tender after that I like to put that
sheet<00:04:44.039> of<00:04:44.190> rice<00:04:44.340> paper<00:04:44.550> bread<00:04:44.880> on<00:04:45.030> top<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.360> a

sheet of rice paper bread on top of a
chopping<00:04:45.780> board<00:04:45.900> because<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.350> find<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.800> it's

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
chopping board because I find that it's

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.550 
chopping board because I find that it's
less<00:04:47.280> likely<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.880> stick<00:04:48.150> on<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.690> then<00:04:49.440> I'm

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
less likely to stick on it and then I'm

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.320 
less likely to stick on it and then I'm
just<00:04:49.620> putting<00:04:50.010> all<00:04:50.190> my<00:04:50.310> toppings<00:04:50.729> on<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:50.910> just

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
just putting all my toppings on it just

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.210 
just putting all my toppings on it just
like<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.660> sushi<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.260> toppings<00:04:52.650> are<00:04:52.800> all<00:04:53.010> the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
like the sushi the toppings are all the

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:02.480 
like the sushi the toppings are all the
same<00:05:00.260> okay<00:05:01.260> so<00:05:01.320> now<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.590> wrap<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.130> you<00:05:02.250> just

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
same okay so now to wrap it you just

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.250 
same okay so now to wrap it you just
grab<00:05:02.699> one<00:05:03.000> end<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.720> try<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.960> squeeze

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
grab one end and you try to squeeze

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.050 
grab one end and you try to squeeze
everything<00:05:04.620> together<00:05:04.919> to<00:05:05.340> condense<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:05.970> all

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
everything together to condense it all

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.060 
everything together to condense it all
and<00:05:06.360> then<00:05:06.870> you're<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:07.229> going<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.620> wrap<00:05:07.830> the

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
and then you're just going to wrap the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.070 
and then you're just going to wrap the
two<00:05:08.310> ends<00:05:08.789> inward<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:09.599> that<00:05:09.750> way<00:05:09.900> nothing

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
two ends inward so that way nothing

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.110 
two ends inward so that way nothing
spills<00:05:10.590> out<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.039> then<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:11.280> continue<00:05:11.460> rolling

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
spills out and then you continue rolling

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.900 
spills out and then you continue rolling
downwards<00:05:12.630> be<00:05:13.440> very<00:05:13.740> gentle<00:05:14.160> because<00:05:14.430> it's

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
downwards be very gentle because it's

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:22.850 
downwards be very gentle because it's
really<00:05:15.120> easy<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.660> rip<00:05:15.840> this<00:05:21.560> after<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:22.710> you
