00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
together once they're done like that so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.310 
together once they're done like that so
once<00:01:37.789> these<00:01:37.880> cards<00:01:38.179> are<00:01:38.270> down<00:01:38.359> locked<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.840> you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
once these cards are down locked in you

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.080 
once these cards are down locked in you

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
so that you squeeze the cards into a

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.880 
so that you squeeze the cards into a
kind<00:01:43.609> of<00:01:43.640> arc<00:01:43.939> position<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:45.200> makes<00:01:45.409> it<00:01:45.560> easier

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
kind of arc position it makes it easier

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.440 
kind of arc position it makes it easier
if<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.100> place<00:01:46.280> your<00:01:46.399> thumbs<00:01:46.700> now<00:01:46.939> on<00:01:47.090> top<00:01:47.299> of

the deck to hold them into place you're

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.550 
the deck to hold them into place you're
lucky<00:01:49.999> it<00:01:50.509> should<00:01:50.659> all<00:01:50.780> stay<00:01:50.960> into<00:01:51.140> position

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
lucky it should all stay into position

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.080 
lucky it should all stay into position
that<00:01:52.130> one's<00:01:52.280> gonna<00:01:52.399> take<00:01:52.579> a<00:01:52.640> little<00:01:52.820> bit<00:01:52.999> of

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
that one's gonna take a little bit of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.700 
that one's gonna take a little bit of
practice<00:01:53.210> but<00:01:53.689> once<00:01:53.899> you've<00:01:54.079> got<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.289> you'll

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
practice but once you've got it you'll

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:07.020
