00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.020

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.960
 Birth 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.990
 and that child may be great but it's 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.720
 totally ugly with this third so 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.580
 easy to twist reading a dragon that 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.540
