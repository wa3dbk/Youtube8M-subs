but here we have the host program what
it<00:01:17.270> does<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.480> it<00:01:17.660> hosts<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.350> whole<00:01:18.560> lot<00:01:18.740> of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
it does is it hosts a whole lot of

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.140 
it does is it hosts a whole lot of
software<00:01:19.970> plugins<00:01:20.710> in<00:01:21.710> this<00:01:21.830> case<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:22.490> VST

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
software plugins in this case it's VST

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.940 
software plugins in this case it's VST
plugins<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:25.220> host<00:01:25.400> program<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:25.910> called<00:01:26.180> a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
probably country that Cantor Billy I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.450 
probably country that Cantor Billy I
think<00:01:30.080> it's<00:01:30.200> pronounced<00:01:30.560> light<00:01:30.890> or<00:01:31.850> cannibal

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
think it's pronounced light or cannibal

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.850 
think it's pronounced light or cannibal
and<00:01:34.460> I've<00:01:35.090> got<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.260> framework<00:01:36.650> version

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
and I've got it the framework version

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.540 
and I've got it the framework version
enables<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.670> hook<00:01:38.240> up<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.600> couple<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:38.990> racks

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
when I say Rex it sounds like there's a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.050 
when I say Rex it sounds like there's a
lot<00:01:42.229> but<00:01:42.500> they<00:01:42.619> actually<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.580> can<00:01:43.729> only<00:01:43.850> hook

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060

eq<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:58.820> you<00:02:59.360> know<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.720> was<00:03:00.080> here<00:03:00.590> I've

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
eq just to get you know I was here I've

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.890 
eq just to get you know I was here I've
got<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.980> base<00:03:01.160> turn<00:03:01.490> down<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
got the base turn down and the the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.580 
got the base turn down and the the
trouble<00:03:03.260> turned<00:03:03.500> up<00:03:03.820> now<00:03:04.820> when<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> said<00:03:06.320> before

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
trouble turned up now when I said before

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.520 
trouble turned up now when I said before
that<00:03:07.400> it's<00:03:07.610> easy<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.180> set<00:03:08.390> up<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.290> can

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
that it's easy to set up but you can

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.200 
that it's easy to set up but you can
have<00:03:09.800> problems<00:03:10.420> I've<00:03:11.420> got<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.950> lag<00:03:13.210> anti-lag

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
have problems I've got a lag anti-lag

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.020 
have problems I've got a lag anti-lag
program<00:03:15.010> well<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:16.160> not<00:03:16.460> really<00:03:16.610> energy

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
program well it's not really energy

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.910 
program well it's not really energy
lagged<00:03:17.240> program<00:03:17.720> but<00:03:17.930> it's<00:03:18.050> called<00:03:18.980> azo<00:03:20.770> or<00:03:21.770> as

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
lagged program but it's called azo or as

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.870 
lagged program but it's called azo or as
yo<00:03:22.190> for<00:03:23.090> all<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:26.090> that's<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:27.050> here<00:03:27.880> it's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
yo for all and that's it here it's

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.060 
yo for all and that's it here it's
freely<00:03:29.180> available<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.620> internet<00:03:31.360> so<00:03:32.360> it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
freely available on the internet so it

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.530 
freely available on the internet so it
either<00:03:34.070> as<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> bit<00:03:34.490> of<00:03:34.580> tweaking<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:35.000> might<00:03:35.420> have

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
either as a bit of tweaking I might have

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.020 
either as a bit of tweaking I might have
been<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:36.080> bit<00:03:36.350> inaccurate<00:03:36.770> when<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.280> said<00:03:37.520> but

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
been a bit inaccurate when I said but

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.880 
been a bit inaccurate when I said but
that<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.720> whole<00:03:38.930> purpose<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.470> clip

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
that the whole purpose of this clip

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.970 
that the whole purpose of this clip
really<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:42.790> show<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:44.690> can<00:03:44.980> set

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
really is to show that you can set

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.850 
really is to show that you can set
something<00:03:46.280> pretty<00:03:46.910> basic<00:03:47.150> up<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:48.320> I'm<00:03:48.650> pretty

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
something pretty basic up and I'm pretty

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.290 
something pretty basic up and I'm pretty
happy<00:03:49.070> with<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.310> sound<00:03:49.670> for<00:03:50.330> practice<00:03:50.750> anyway

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
happy with the sound for practice anyway

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.730 
happy with the sound for practice anyway
and<00:03:53.300> next<00:03:53.750> in<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.050> next<00:03:54.080> clip<00:03:54.500> I'll<00:03:54.710> be

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
and next in the next clip I'll be

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.370 
and next in the next clip I'll be
comparing<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.460> a<00:03:55.690> baby<00:03:56.690> Marshall

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
comparing it to a baby Marshall

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.050 
comparing it to a baby Marshall
amplifier<00:03:57.920> or<00:03:58.730> hardware<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.600> course<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:01.060> this

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
amplifier or hardware of course and this

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.500 
amplifier or hardware of course and this
is<00:04:02.240> a<00:04:02.270> very<00:04:02.540> light-hearted<00:04:04.420> sort<00:04:05.420> of

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
is a very light-hearted sort of

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.580 
is a very light-hearted sort of
comparison<00:04:05.980> is<00:04:06.980> sort<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:08.350> basic<00:04:09.350> software

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
comparison is sort of basic software

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.300 
comparison is sort of basic software
with<00:04:10.010> basic<00:04:10.430> hardware<00:04:10.760> almost<00:04:11.890> if<00:04:12.890> anyone

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
with basic hardware almost if anyone

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.920 
with basic hardware almost if anyone
wants<00:04:13.580> any<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.940> settings<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.480> I've<00:04:14.720> got

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
wants any of the settings that I've got

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.120 
wants any of the settings that I've got
for<00:04:15.170> these<00:04:16.090> just<00:04:17.090> email<00:04:17.600> me<00:04:17.630> as<00:04:18.590> i<00:04:18.830> said<00:04:19.040> the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
for these just email me as i said the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.570 
for these just email me as i said the
email<00:04:19.459> addresses<00:04:19.970> will<00:04:20.209> be<00:04:20.540> four<00:04:20.750> run<00:04:21.430> in<00:04:22.430> a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
email addresses will be four run in a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.230 
email addresses will be four run in a
link<00:04:22.850> or<00:04:23.180> even<00:04:23.840> listed<00:04:24.550> so<00:04:25.550> just<00:04:26.030> going

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
link or even listed so just going

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.540 
link or even listed so just going
through<00:04:27.640> that's<00:04:28.640> the<00:04:28.820> settings<00:04:29.240> for<00:04:29.480> that<00:04:29.750> one

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
through that's the settings for that one

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.710 
through that's the settings for that one
in

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
in

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.110 
in
that<00:04:33.720> one<00:04:33.930> but<00:04:34.590> probably<00:04:35.280> can't<00:04:35.340> see<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.819> so

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
that one but probably can't see that so

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.600 
that one but probably can't see that so
but<00:04:37.080> that's<00:04:37.229> basically<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.190> sound

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
but that's basically it so the sound

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.529 
but that's basically it so the sound
comes<00:04:39.030> in<00:04:39.270> through<00:04:39.539> the<00:04:40.310> line<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.550> goes

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
comes in through the line in goes

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.680 
comes in through the line in goes
through<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.960> processing<00:04:43.949> unit<00:04:44.449> when<00:04:45.449> I<00:04:45.479> say

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
through this processing unit when I say

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.990 
through this processing unit when I say
processing<00:04:46.319> units<00:04:46.650> just<00:04:46.830> software<00:04:47.190> goes

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
processing units just software goes

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.909 
processing units just software goes
through<00:04:48.300> all<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.509> two<00:04:49.020> racks<00:04:49.259> and<00:04:49.560> comes<00:04:49.770> in

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
through all the two racks and comes in

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.529 
through all the two racks and comes in
the<00:04:50.069> output<00:04:50.430> node<00:04:50.639> is<00:04:50.789> plugged<00:04:51.030> into<00:04:51.150> some

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
the output node is plugged into some

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.770 
the output node is plugged into some
speakers<00:04:52.460> okay<00:04:53.460> that's<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.539> one<00:04:56.539> thanks<00:04:57.539> for
