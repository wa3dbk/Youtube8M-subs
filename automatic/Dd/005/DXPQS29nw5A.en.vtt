as well because I like sweet things and
I<00:00:30.740> have<00:00:30.980> some<00:00:31.130> almonds<00:00:31.550> here<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.150> I'm<00:00:32.960> going

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
I have some almonds here and I'm going

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.350 
I have some almonds here and I'm going
to<00:00:33.230> put<00:00:33.470> them<00:00:33.770> in<00:00:33.800> as<00:00:34.070> well<00:00:34.280> now<00:00:34.490> you<00:00:35.150> might

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
to put them in as well now you might

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.590 
to put them in as well now you might
notice<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:35.840> they're<00:00:36.200> a<00:00:36.230> little<00:00:36.410> bit

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
notice that they're a little bit

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.910 
notice that they're a little bit
different<00:00:38.600> looking<00:00:38.750> because<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:39.260> soaked<00:00:39.710> them

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
different looking because I soaked them

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.189 
different looking because I soaked them
overnight<00:00:40.070> now<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.030> thing<00:00:41.149> about<00:00:41.360> almonds<00:00:42.020> is

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
overnight now the thing about almonds is

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.700 
overnight now the thing about almonds is
is<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:42.649> if<00:00:43.340> you<00:00:46.210> just<00:00:47.210> don't<00:00:47.570> soak<00:00:47.960> them<00:00:48.230> then

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
is that if you just don't soak them then

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.189 
is that if you just don't soak them then
what<00:00:48.890> happens<00:00:49.309> is<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.879> not<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:50.930> have<00:00:51.050> an

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
what happens is is that not to have an

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.080 
what happens is is that not to have an
anti-nutritional<00:00:51.859> factor<00:00:52.489> in<00:00:52.609> them<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:52.940> this

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
anti-nutritional factor in them and this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.470 
anti-nutritional factor in them and this
anti-nutritional<00:00:53.840> factor<00:00:54.559> makes<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:56.120> the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
anti-nutritional factor makes the the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.049 
anti-nutritional factor makes the the
nuts<00:00:56.750> indigestible<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.519> you<00:00:58.609> need<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:58.910> do

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
nuts indigestible so you need to do

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.810 
nuts indigestible so you need to do
something<00:00:59.359> to<00:00:59.690> them<00:00:59.809> as<00:00:59.989> I'm<00:01:00.140> soaking<00:01:00.440> them

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
something to them as I'm soaking them

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.720 
something to them as I'm soaking them
starts<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.000> process<00:01:02.149> of<00:01:02.890> sprouting<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.640> you

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
starts the process of sprouting so you

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.190 
starts the process of sprouting so you
just<00:01:04.910> soak<00:01:05.120> them<00:01:05.300> for<00:01:05.330> eight<00:01:05.660> hours<00:01:05.690> just

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
just soak them for eight hours just

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.910 
just soak them for eight hours just
overnight<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:08.119> then<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:09.229> they're<00:01:09.439> very

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
overnight and and then then they're very

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.410 
overnight and and then then they're very
very<00:01:10.130> digestible<00:01:10.400> they're<00:01:11.000> more<00:01:11.210> digestible

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
very digestible they're more digestible

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.499 
very digestible they're more digestible
than<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.470> can<00:01:12.619> roasted<00:01:12.979> ones<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.030> put<00:01:14.360> them

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
than you can roasted ones so I put them

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.270 
than you can roasted ones so I put them
in<00:01:14.659> I<00:01:14.810> put<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.049> few<00:01:15.350> in<00:01:15.500> there<00:01:15.710> I'd<00:01:15.890> like<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.130> put

these really fancy Vitamix ones which
cost<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.340> lot<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.490> money<00:02:12.610> nobody<00:02:12.940> has<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.600> in

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
cost a lot of money nobody has them in

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.630 
cost a lot of money nobody has them in
their<00:02:13.870> homes<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.680> what<00:02:14.950> I've<00:02:15.100> done<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.370> I'm

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
their homes so what I've done this I'm

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.450 
their homes so what I've done this I'm
just<00:02:15.850> using<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.270> very<00:02:16.480> ordinary<00:02:16.780> blender<00:02:17.460> takes

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
just using a very ordinary blender takes

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.370 
just using a very ordinary blender takes
a<00:02:18.670> bit<00:02:18.850> more<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.660> what<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.930> want<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.170> do<00:02:20.290> is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
a bit more and what you want to do is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.140 
a bit more and what you want to do is
not<00:02:20.500> put<00:02:20.770> too<00:02:20.980> much<00:02:21.160> water<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:21.970> if<00:02:22.000> you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
not put too much water in because if you

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.690 
not put too much water in because if you
put<00:02:22.360> too<00:02:22.390> much<00:02:22.750> water<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.620> doesn't<00:02:24.100> blend<00:02:24.460> them

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
put too much water it doesn't blend them

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:43.470 
put too much water it doesn't blend them
so<00:02:24.880> well<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:27.100> in<00:02:27.280> there

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.910 

this<00:02:44.480> often<00:02:44.690> happens<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.440> don't<00:02:45.620> put<00:02:45.800> in

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
this often happens when you don't put in

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.500 
this often happens when you don't put in
a<00:02:46.010> lot<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.190> water<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.700> gets<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.240> little<00:02:47.360> bit

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
a lot of water it gets a little bit

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.880 
a lot of water it gets a little bit
stuck<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:47.840> what<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:47.990> do<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.319> just<00:02:48.380> shake<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.680> up

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
stuck so what I do is I just shake it up

00:02:48.890 --> 00:03:08.000 
stuck so what I do is I just shake it up
a<00:02:48.980> little<00:02:49.480> turn<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.600> off<00:02:50.660> shake<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.080> up

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:31.810 

I<00:03:08.099> have<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:08.909> little

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.110 

okay<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.360> there<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:34.250> it's<00:03:35.250> good<00:03:35.460> to<00:03:35.670> make

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
okay so there it is it's good to make

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.910 
okay so there it is it's good to make
sure<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> blends<00:03:36.930> for<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.470> number<00:03:37.740> of

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
sure that it blends for a number of

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.220 
sure that it blends for a number of
minutes<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.210> you<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.630> really<00:03:39.870> get<00:03:40.050> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
minutes so that you can really get it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.070 
minutes so that you can really get it
blended<00:03:40.410> up<00:03:40.710> well<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.770> see<00:03:44.070> that

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
blended up well and you can see that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.610 
blended up well and you can see that
this<00:03:46.080> does<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.690> if<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.290> too

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
this does and if you if this is too

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.880 
this does and if you if this is too
thick<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:50.970> add<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.420> little<00:03:51.620> more<00:03:52.620> water

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
thick you just add a little more water

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.460 
thick you just add a little more water
and<00:03:53.220> that's<00:03:53.820> just<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.300> tastes<00:03:54.750> like

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.160 

that's<00:03:58.470> very<00:03:58.590> good<00:03:59.060> now<00:04:00.060> here's<00:04:00.930> something

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
