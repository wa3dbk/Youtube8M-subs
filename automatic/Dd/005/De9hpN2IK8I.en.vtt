sight<00:02:36.770> my<00:02:37.770> shotgun<00:02:38.280> isn't<00:02:38.700> working<00:02:39.090> still<00:02:39.390> for

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
sight my shotgun isn't working still for

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.030 
sight my shotgun isn't working still for
some<00:02:39.750> reason<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.290> guess<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> doesn't<00:02:40.680> work<00:02:40.800> with

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
some reason I guess it doesn't work with

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.630 
some reason I guess it doesn't work with
shotguns<00:02:41.520> or<00:02:42.350> rifles<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:43.920> I'll<00:02:44.220> figure<00:02:44.520> that

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
shotguns or rifles but I'll figure that
