00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
played and before I went to Brazil I was

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.129 
played and before I went to Brazil I was
I<00:04:54.550> was<00:04:55.060> playing<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.330> lot<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:55.870> know<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.020> was

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
I was playing a lot you know I was

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.010 
I was playing a lot you know I was
playing<00:04:56.289> every<00:04:56.440> day<00:04:56.650> at<00:04:56.800> least<00:04:56.919> like<00:04:57.160> for<00:04:58.020> like

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
playing every day at least like for like

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.580 
playing every day at least like for like
four<00:04:59.229> hours

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
four hours

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.520 
four hours
so<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.490> was<00:05:00.849> getting<00:05:01.120> good<00:05:01.750> grind<00:05:02.050> on<00:05:02.229> and<00:05:02.440> then

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
so I was getting good grind on and then

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.189 
so I was getting good grind on and then
I<00:05:02.590> come<00:05:02.830> back<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:04.150> haven't<00:05:04.570> I<00:05:04.780> didn't<00:05:04.990> start

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
I come back and I haven't I didn't start

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.850 
I come back and I haven't I didn't start
playing<00:05:05.229> until<00:05:05.590> like<00:05:06.270> three<00:05:07.470> maybe<00:05:08.470> four<00:05:08.800> days

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
playing until like three maybe four days

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.510 
playing until like three maybe four days
ago<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.849> my<00:05:10.599> shot<00:05:10.960> was<00:05:11.080> really<00:05:11.320> off<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.490> I

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
ago and my shot was really off so I

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.909 
ago and my shot was really off so I
guess<00:05:12.759> like<00:05:12.940> three<00:05:13.240> weeks<00:05:13.360> or<00:05:13.750> four<00:05:14.110> weeks<00:05:14.530> can

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
guess like three weeks or four weeks can

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.939 
guess like three weeks or four weeks can
do<00:05:15.009> that<00:05:15.159> to<00:05:15.280> you

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
do that to you

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.809 
do that to you
so<00:05:17.949> that's<00:05:18.130> why<00:05:18.250> I<00:05:18.280> haven't<00:05:18.610> really<00:05:18.789> been

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
so that's why I haven't really been

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.550 
so that's why I haven't really been
putting<00:05:19.180> out<00:05:19.270> any<00:05:19.449> videos<00:05:19.750> but<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.020> definitely
