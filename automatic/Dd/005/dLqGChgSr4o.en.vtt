00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
very good although I personally had a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.480 
very good although I personally had a
hard<00:01:14.940> time<00:01:15.200> playing<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> NES<00:01:16.830> gamepad<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
hard time playing with the NES gamepad I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
hard time playing with the NES gamepad I
prefer<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.600> Atari<00:01:18.869> style<00:01:19.200> joystick<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:20.190> this

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
prefer the Atari style joystick for this

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.820 
prefer the Atari style joystick for this
kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> game<00:01:20.789> and<00:01:21.060> maybe<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> shows<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.200> my

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
kind of game and maybe it shows in my

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100 
kind of game and maybe it shows in my
lack<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> finesse<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.820> playing<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.299> version

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
lack of finesse in playing this version

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.500 
lack of finesse in playing this version
of<00:01:25.200> Dig<00:01:25.380> Dug<00:01:25.820> however<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.030> still<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> very

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
of Dig Dug however it's still a very

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.929 
of Dig Dug however it's still a very
good<00:01:27.840> game<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.439> fun<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.250> faithful<00:01:29.580> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
version of Dig Dug fairly easily I know

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.109 
version of Dig Dug fairly easily I know
it's<00:01:40.830> on<00:01:40.950> most<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> pirate<00:01:41.700> carts<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it's on most of the pirate carts that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's on most of the pirate carts that
are<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.390> there<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.869> that's<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
are out there and that's one of the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.499 
are out there and that's one of the
reasons<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.400> bought<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.759> pirate<00:01:45.119> cart<00:01:45.330> that<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
reasons I bought the pirate cart that I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.109 
reasons I bought the pirate cart that I
had<00:01:45.750> because<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> had<00:01:46.439> games<00:01:46.740> like<00:01:46.979> Dig<00:01:47.670> Dug<00:01:47.700> on

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
had because it had games like Dig Dug on

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.350 
had because it had games like Dig Dug on
it<00:01:48.240> Galaxian<00:01:49.079> Quyen<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.460> original<00:01:50.939> map<00:01:51.150> II

these<00:01:52.320> were<00:01:52.590> all<00:01:52.770> games<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.189> were<00:01:53.369> never

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
these were all games that were never

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.690 
these were all games that were never
ported<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> NES<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.920> North<00:01:56.130> America

ported to the NES here in North America

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.940 
ported to the NES here in North America
which<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.240> shame<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.720> they<00:01:58.500> did<00:01:58.740> make

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
which is a shame because they did make

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.249 
which is a shame because they did make
some<00:01:59.189> very<00:01:59.430> good<00:01:59.670> arcade<00:02:00.090> ports<00:02:00.450> including

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
some very good arcade ports including

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
some very good arcade ports including
Dig<00:02:01.500> Dug<00:02:01.610> which<00:02:02.610> again<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.180> stated<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.689> highly

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
Dig Dug which again as I stated I highly
