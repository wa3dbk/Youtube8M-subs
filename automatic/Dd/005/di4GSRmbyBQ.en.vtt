00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.570
 phoenix 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.070
 fredys good this is the first time 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.139
 I'm going to try this game I do not know 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.759
 absolutely none of this more than everything 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.520
 what they have said not that it is a very game 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.380
 overrated well I do not believe that 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.060
 that is scary is what it says good and 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.250
 I am telling you everything I know 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.599
 about this game so far not so 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.550
 this time I will not decide to try it 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.060
 this is a test video I do not know if I'm going 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.980
 to climb or not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 Well, let's see how it goes 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 first time I put it I just opened it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.220
 just like April I gave him record and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.930
 Well let's start not only 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.250
 will explain the controls before that if 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.559
 he asked a friend of favor to me 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.020
 will explain the controls and as he told me 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.640
 only the mouse is used we start now 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.690
 that's how easy we are playing it seems that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.690
 yes 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.280
 how fast what I 'm doing is sounding 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.750
 the phone answered I 'm going to 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.750
 answer I do not answer the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.559
 collectors that should know it good I do not know 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.079
 if to answer I ask who 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.019
 xd are taxi drivers who do 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.710
 interference with my microphone no that yes 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.970
 pass 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.759
 well here says wood carl what 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.510
 we find it or not because it seems that it is not going to 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.850
 shut up so you have to shut up me 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 what we found not now it stayed very 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.330
 silent good I know this game is from 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.250
 fear but I hope this time do not kill me 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.660
 as in slender man I do not even know 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 what are we going to do, I 'm just moving 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.820
 on the sides and I tried to walk with the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.160
 arrows and then nothing I'm right now 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.630
 interacting with what I can give 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.700
 click on everything and try to click there 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.440
 in front of the fan and everything seems to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.450
 nothing happens 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.910
 here we have two doors that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.680
 we do with this because I can not get 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.470
 I'm very stupid and I have not learned to 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.010
 walk 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.510
 or so of course I do not know well we're going to 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.690
 leave the lights on to see if it 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.790
 can because I'm from the idea is that 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.710
 when there is a dark room better there 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.120
 than to undertake the first to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.240
 tell the ghosts that we do not want 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.640
 surprises true so that's what we're going 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.490
 to do if they stayed on good 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.340
 down here we have power net power 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.020
 remaining 83 percent good 83 for 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.000
 cent is an eternity always when 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.280
 the cell phone is in 80 it is going to last 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.230
 a week I do not always say it to 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.030
 sky and I'm using it at 10 percent 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.550
 but what do we do what is this from here or 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.840
 there is god what is this there are so monkeys 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.840
 ugly what 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.750
 like a camera 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.330
 if it looks like it's like a camera and it 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.709
 move alone I 'm not moving anything 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.090
 let's see let's explore first I'm 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.129
 trying to click everywhere 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.230
 it seems that I can not do more things 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.000
 I can move, I do not know if I think it jumps 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.160
 the kinematics or do not know if the monkey that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.840
 spoke and in the tutorial good neither way 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.340
 I skipped it to see how it goes 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.260
 I can stop the recording because it would be 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.959
 lie to them that our first time not like this 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.290
 that you can know what we do there is no more 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.290
 cameras 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.370
 the cameras these places are something something 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.470
 gloomy as if they give some fear and 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.580
 more right now I'm playing alone in the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.250
 I'm not alone with that, it's already 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.140
 clear gain I do not want to die of 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.920
 fear right now to sleep in the bathroom eyes 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.390
 of girls on camera disabled only 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.860
 good audio is better we do not see it 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.190
 sure here a writes 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:25.090
 what's here is something like 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.020
 'big brother' of bears I do not know is that not 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.550
 I know what I do 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.320
 well let's see all the cameras should 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.490
 have something interesting over there maybe 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.490
 over there tell me how to walk 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.420
 not good but as I see it is a map because 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.720
 here it says there says you or I am in 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.370
 that place and these cameras because they are from 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.590
 good places luckily the animals 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.040
 that's the little animals the animals things 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.440
 and magical are very far from me good if 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.590
 is that what is going to kill me are up 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.590
 here 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.460
 this chicken scares me good looks 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.319
 pretty frightening not the chicken hear 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.650
 but there are only 2 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.920
 well it's not that if I know there was one that 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.260
 while not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.000
 nothing more than these flowers that as I already 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.480
 I am hungry and I eat there is no bus 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.359
 well one starts to rant good and 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.070
 It is enough to see the little cameras that 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.220
 It seems that this is about the game because 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.480
 I do not know what else to do 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.420
 you have to be noise 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.930
 that was there a while ago this here 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.449
 I did not notice 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.680
 it looks like a slider, we're going to 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.930
 change it 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.940
 yes I am sure that he missed the bonus 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.870
 here he has put a goose that had three 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.509
 monkeys we are just the pile right now 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.190
 young right now we do not do that 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.960
 We wanted something because I open the door 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.330
 I feel that having caught these things 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.420
 spending pile but not because it would not be very 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.910
 horrible because I know how to walk dark 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.930
 Well things were not qualified to see 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.600
 I have no idea 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.970
 we closed not already escaped it seems to be 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.080
 a doll we already closed it for 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.139
 prevent there is no lose the light and already 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.659
 here is still standing sure is that has 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.909
 be like in the slender man that walks 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.030
 over there of loquillo not walking and 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.409
 all those good things seems to be that not 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.960
 there are more abnormal things in our 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.770
 cameras has to be like my work has to 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.020
 be I do not know maybe take care of these cameras 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.719
 I do not have the true idea since they saw the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.449
 three areas according to what will happen above 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:38.529
 if God dawns we run out of battery 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.200
 What do I do that I do? 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.950
 and it's over 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.950
 singing 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.139
 for what 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.150

 they almost kill me with fright again 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.480
 none besides with words that I 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.480
 they threw 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.480
 how loud it sounds 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.790
 well let's leave the video here 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.540
 I do not know if I'm going up was a play 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.230
 quite pretty random the truth is not 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.450
 it was then 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.950
 glider I had no idea or is I the 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.560
 I would have left because he did not record the 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.110
 first time I play it and see how 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.720
 it comes out I do not know it will be my decision if there were 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.880
 no more sure that no no frame is not going 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.070
