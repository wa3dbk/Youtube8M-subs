initiatory<00:00:10.769> we're<00:00:10.980> gonna<00:00:11.099> look<00:00:11.280> at<00:00:11.519> an<00:00:12.000> energy

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
initiatory we're gonna look at an energy

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.110 
initiatory we're gonna look at an energy
transfer<00:00:13.320> molecule<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:14.490> occurs<00:00:14.880> with

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
transfer molecule which occurs with

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.890 
transfer molecule which occurs with
inside<00:00:15.509> living<00:00:15.960> cells<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.460> allows<00:00:17.900> very

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
inside living cells and it allows very

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.019 
inside living cells and it allows very
short-term<00:00:19.439> storage<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.949> energy<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.609> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
short-term storage of energy and it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.599 
short-term storage of energy and it
allows<00:00:21.270> energy<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.220> transformed<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.369> one

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
allows energy to be transformed for one

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.670 
allows energy to be transformed for one
part<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> cell<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> other<00:00:25.670> okay<00:00:26.670> so

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
part of the cell to the other okay so

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.019 
part of the cell to the other okay so
there<00:00:28.680> are<00:00:28.710> two<00:00:28.859> molecules<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:29.880> which

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
there are two molecules in here which

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.730 
there are two molecules in here which
can<00:00:30.330> transform<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.289> another

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
can transform for one to another

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.819 
can transform for one to another
the<00:00:31.949> first<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.669> called<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.559> TP<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.800> short<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
the first is called a TP for short and

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.080 
the first is called a TP for short and
that<00:00:37.829> stands<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:40.969> adenosine<00:00:42.050> triphosphate

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
that stands for adenosine triphosphate

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.720 
that stands for adenosine triphosphate
the<00:00:45.090> ad<00:00:45.390> e<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.050> o<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.239> II<00:00:49.430> triphosphate

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.990 

and<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.480> looks<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.989> base<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:57.890> and

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
and that's it looks like a base and and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.539 
and that's it looks like a base and and
a<00:01:00.000> sugar<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.549> identifying

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
a sugar and and that is the identifying

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.899 
a sugar and and that is the identifying
part<00:01:06.439> and<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> triphosphate<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.460> simply

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
part and then the triphosphate is simply

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.420 
part and then the triphosphate is simply
3<00:01:09.270> organic<00:01:09.630> phosphate<00:01:10.290> molecules<00:01:13.280> come<00:01:14.280> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
3 organic phosphate molecules come in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
3 organic phosphate molecules come in
off<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.320> side<00:01:16.369> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:18.020> simplified

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
off the side this is a simplified

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
off the side this is a simplified
version<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.650> molecule<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:20.909> all<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
version of molecule and that's all you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.010 
version of molecule and that's all you
really<00:01:21.240> need<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:21.960> level

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
really need to know at this level

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
really need to know at this level
they've<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> base<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> sugar<00:01:24.060> which

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
they've got a base and the sugar which

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
they've got a base and the sugar which
constitutes<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.350> assign<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
constitutes the and then assign and the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
constitutes the and then assign and the
triphosphate<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:27.210> three<00:01:27.479> phosphate

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
triphosphate are three phosphate

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.789 
triphosphate are three phosphate
molecules<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.119> other<00:01:30.299> molecule<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
molecules now the other molecule and

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.640 
molecules now the other molecule and
this<00:01:31.920> molecule<00:01:31.979> transforms<00:01:32.970> into<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.650> vice

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
this molecule transforms into and vice

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.940 
this molecule transforms into and vice
versa<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:36.350> ADP<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:38.930> again<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.140> adenosine<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.180 

but<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.070> time<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.460> diphosphate<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.610 

is<00:01:53.670> exactly<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.300> same<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.690> as<00:01:55.460> triphosphate

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
is exactly the same as as triphosphate

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.260 
is exactly the same as as triphosphate
and<00:01:58.620> we've<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.340> sugar<00:01:59.670> again

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.490 

and<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.510> time<00:02:03.720> I've<00:02:03.840> only<00:02:03.960> got<00:02:04.140> two

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and this time I've only got two

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.150 
and this time I've only got two
phosphate<00:02:05.040> molecules<00:02:05.550> or<00:02:06.510> two<00:02:06.810> organic

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
phosphate molecules or two organic

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.080 
phosphate molecules or two organic
phosphate<00:02:08.610> molecules<00:02:10.250> Hey<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.490> then<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.910> top

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
phosphate molecules Hey and then on top

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.780 
phosphate molecules Hey and then on top
of<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:12.990> have<00:02:13.310> an<00:02:14.310> inorganic

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
of that we will have an inorganic

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.820 
of that we will have an inorganic
phosphate<00:02:15.540> which<00:02:15.660> denoted<00:02:15.930> by<00:02:16.110> P<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:18.620> plus<00:02:19.620> a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
large amount of energy okay and those

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.900 
large amount of energy okay and those
are<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.920> two<00:02:29.070> molecules<00:02:29.520> now<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
are the two molecules now that is the

are the two molecules now that is the
breakdown<00:02:33.150> process<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.860> we'll<00:02:35.100> release<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
breakdown process so we'll release the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.810 
breakdown process so we'll release the
energy<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:37.290> inorganic<00:02:37.770> phosphate<00:02:38.370> molecule

to<00:03:19.530> ATP<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:21.030> there's<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.239> simple<00:03:21.510> way<00:03:21.630> of

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
to ATP and there's a simple way of

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.080 
to ATP and there's a simple way of
thinking<00:03:22.170> about<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:24.620> if<00:03:25.620> we've<00:03:26.489> got<00:03:26.790> for

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
thinking about this if we've got for

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:41.540 
thinking about this if we've got for
example<00:03:28.670> ATP<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:35.660> DP<00:03:36.769> plus<00:03:37.970> P<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:40.370> let's<00:03:41.370> just

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
example ATP and a DP plus P I let's just

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.220 
example ATP and a DP plus P I let's just
do<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.850> little<00:03:42.030> flow<00:03:42.209> diagram<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.989> make<00:03:43.200> it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
do a little flow diagram just to make it

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.360 
do a little flow diagram just to make it
nice<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.130> clear<00:03:44.640> what's<00:03:44.940> going<00:03:45.150> on<00:03:45.300> here<00:03:46.370> and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
nice and clear what's going on here and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.280 
nice and clear what's going on here and
now<00:03:47.610> these<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.800> transform<00:03:49.800> into<00:03:50.010> each<00:03:50.310> other

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
now these to transform into each other

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.890 
now these to transform into each other
so<00:03:52.489> from<00:03:55.040> ATP<00:03:56.040> we'll<00:03:56.459> go<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.670> your<00:03:56.880> ADP<00:03:57.420> plus<00:03:57.690> P

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
so from ATP we'll go to your ADP plus P

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.050 
so from ATP we'll go to your ADP plus P
I<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.370> ADP<00:03:59.780> plus<00:04:00.780> P<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.050> will<00:04:01.290> go<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.470> ATP<00:04:02.060> that

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
I and ADP plus P I will go to ATP that

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.670 
I and ADP plus P I will go to ATP that
but<00:04:03.960> also

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
but also

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.569 
but also
to<00:04:05.739> make<00:04:05.920> these<00:04:06.989> as<00:04:07.989> transfer<00:04:08.439> possible<00:04:08.980> we

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
to make these as transfer possible we

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.440 
to make these as transfer possible we
have<00:04:09.879> got<00:04:11.219> other<00:04:12.219> processes<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.150> these<00:04:13.209> can

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
have got other processes and these can

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.089 
have got other processes and these can
be<00:04:13.599> as<00:04:13.689> I<00:04:13.719> say<00:04:13.989> through<00:04:14.409> photosynthesis<00:04:15.069> or

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
be as I say through photosynthesis or

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.599 
be as I say through photosynthesis or
respiration<00:04:15.730> these<00:04:16.299> can<00:04:16.570> occur<00:04:16.829> an<00:04:17.829> energy

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.249 

requiring<00:04:21.609> process<00:04:22.419> will<00:04:23.669> transform<00:04:24.669> from

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
requiring process will transform from

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:31.350 
requiring process will transform from
ATP<00:04:26.259> plus<00:04:26.440> P<00:04:26.710> I<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:29.250> that<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.669> would<00:04:31.000> be<00:04:31.180> an

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
ATP plus P I so that it would be an

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.439 
ATP plus P I so that it would be an
energy<00:04:33.449> requiring<00:04:34.449> process<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:40.000> no<00:04:40.240> this

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
energy requiring process so no this

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.320 
energy requiring process so no this
would<00:04:40.599> be<00:04:40.750> an<00:04:41.610> energy<00:04:42.610> releasing<00:04:43.539> process

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.999 

H<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:49.569> so<00:04:50.569> it<00:04:50.840> requires<00:04:51.199> energy<00:04:51.409> to<00:04:51.620> transport

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
H and so it requires energy to transport

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.800 
H and so it requires energy to transport
ATP<00:04:52.759> plus<00:04:53.000> ADP<00:04:53.930> plus<00:04:54.139> pi/2<00:04:54.439> ATP<00:04:55.039> and<00:04:55.490> then<00:04:56.180> here

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
ATP plus ADP plus pi/2 ATP and then here

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.119 
ATP plus ADP plus pi/2 ATP and then here
we'll<00:04:57.199> have<00:04:57.409> an<00:04:57.590> energy<00:04:58.099> and<00:04:59.919> require<00:05:00.919> in

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
we'll have an energy and require in

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.100 
we'll have an energy and require in
process

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.089 

the<00:05:04.830> clay<00:05:05.039> because<00:05:05.220> an<00:05:06.440> ATP<00:05:07.440> releases<00:05:07.919> energy

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
the clay because an ATP releases energy

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.330 
the clay because an ATP releases energy
they<00:05:08.879> just<00:05:09.210> wanted<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.449> ATP<00:05:09.840> plus<00:05:10.229> I<00:05:10.530> and

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
they just wanted to ATP plus I and

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.520 
they just wanted to ATP plus I and
remember<00:05:12.030> this<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.479> is<00:05:12.539> occurring<00:05:13.349> all<00:05:13.500> the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
remember this this is occurring all the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.860 
remember this this is occurring all the
time<00:05:13.860> there's<00:05:14.099> never<00:05:14.310> a<00:05:14.400> buildup<00:05:14.909> either<00:05:15.659> of

these in me molecule it's always a
balance<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:20.280> as<00:05:20.759> I<00:05:20.879> say<00:05:21.030> they<00:05:21.210> only<00:05:21.330> last

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
balance and so as I say they only last

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.210
