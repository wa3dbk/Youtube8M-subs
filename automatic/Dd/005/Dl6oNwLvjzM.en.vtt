00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it's it's a sport but it's also like our

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
it's it's a sport but it's also like our
really<00:01:16.440> creative<00:01:16.830> process<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.670> use<00:01:18.210> your

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
imagination to imagine the way up and

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.270 
imagination to imagine the way up and
you're<00:01:22.080> working<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> rock<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.250> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you're working with the rock like this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
you're working with the rock like this
so<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.119> think<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> creative

so I think it's really like a creative

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
so I think it's really like a creative
thing<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.540> reason<00:01:27.900> why<00:01:28.020> it

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
thing so it's one one reason why it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:40.240 
thing so it's one one reason why it
always<00:01:28.320> attracting

motivations you have got you still up

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.430 
motivations you have got you still up
there<00:02:19.640> yeah<00:02:20.120> it's<00:02:20.300> hard<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.200> this

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
there yeah it's hard to be in this

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.250 
there yeah it's hard to be in this
situation<00:02:21.590> when<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.450> fall<00:02:23.450> in<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:24.140> know

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
situation when you fall in you know

situation when you fall in you know
maybe<00:02:24.440> 50<00:02:25.220> times<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.600> really<00:02:26.870> hard<00:02:27.080> for

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
maybe 50 times and it's really hard for

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.160 
maybe 50 times and it's really hard for
you<00:02:27.470> for<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.890> head<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.000> know<00:02:29.150> yeah<00:02:29.780> when<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
you for the head you know yeah when you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.710 
you for the head you know yeah when you
wanna<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.459> start<00:02:31.730> again<00:02:31.820> with<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.150> you

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
wanna you have to start again with a you

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.570 
wanna you have to start again with a you
know<00:02:32.840> with<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.050> fresh<00:02:33.380> positive<00:02:33.950> attitude<00:02:34.400> and

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
know with a fresh positive attitude and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.570 
know with a fresh positive attitude and
if<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.390> know<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:35.959> fell<00:02:36.500> 50<00:02:36.920> times<00:02:37.130> before

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
if you know that I fell 50 times before

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.790 
if you know that I fell 50 times before
then<00:02:37.790> it's<00:02:38.510> easy<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.930> think<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.590> negative

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
then it's easy to think in a negative

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.590 
then it's easy to think in a negative
way<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.489> know<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:40.820> really<00:02:41.090> important<00:02:41.540> to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
way you know so it's really important to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.170 
way you know so it's really important to
just<00:02:41.810> try<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.830> just<00:02:43.100> clear<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.400> mind<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.000> not

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
just try to just clear your mind and not

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.720 
just try to just clear your mind and not
think<00:02:44.450> about<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.870> past<00:02:44.989> or<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:45.950> not<00:02:46.459> worry

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
think about the past or just not worry

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.420 
think about the past or just not worry
about<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.360> succeeding<00:02:48.170> but<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.739> be<00:02:48.890> in

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
about the succeeding but just to be in

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.300 
about the succeeding but just to be in
the<00:02:49.940> present<00:02:50.360> moment<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.810> enjoy<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
the present moment and enjoy the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.210 
the present moment and enjoy the
movement<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.540> climbing<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.620> this

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
movement and the climbing and and this

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.050 
movement and the climbing and and this
is<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.580> when<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.820> best<00:02:56.150> things<00:02:56.630> happen

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
if you are awesome vessel for sector no

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.640 
if you are awesome vessel for sector no
limits<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.519> big<00:03:05.849> project<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.049> are<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.349> think

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
it's a it's a great fit though it sector

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:22.320 
it's a it's a great fit though it sector
you<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.379> sir

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.630 

if<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.500> reached<00:03:23.740> 1<00:03:24.330> 1<00:03:25.330> goal<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.890> maybe<00:03:27.190> before

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
if I reached 1 1 goal that maybe before

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.150 
if I reached 1 1 goal that maybe before
I<00:03:27.670> thought<00:03:27.970> was<00:03:28.210> like<00:03:28.360> my<00:03:28.540> maximum<00:03:29.080> level<00:03:29.410> but

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
I thought was like my maximum level but

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.280 
I thought was like my maximum level but
if<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.400> achieved<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.970> then<00:03:31.180> but<00:03:31.690> I<00:03:31.750> think<00:03:32.080> well

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
if I achieved it then but I think well

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.740 
if I achieved it then but I think well
well<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.310> achieved<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.210> it<00:03:34.330> must<00:03:34.540> not

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
well I achieved it so that it must not

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.390 
well I achieved it so that it must not
really<00:03:34.990> be<00:03:35.140> my<00:03:35.290> limit<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:35.800> I<00:03:35.920> can<00:03:36.070> go<00:03:36.370> a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
really be my limit then I can go a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.190 
really be my limit then I can go a
little<00:03:36.610> bit<00:03:36.820> more<00:03:36.970> have<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.720> gotten<00:03:37.900> your

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
saying is just to be the present moment

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.190 
saying is just to be the present moment
it's<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.120> most<00:03:52.300> important<00:03:52.750> thing<00:03:52.930> then

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
it's the most important thing then

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.440 
it's the most important thing then
there's<00:03:53.950> not<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:54.310> much<00:03:54.460> for<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.910> know<00:03:55.210> and

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
there's not so much for you you know and

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.430 
there's not so much for you you know and
in<00:03:55.570> climbing<00:03:57.150> if<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:58.690> possible<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.200> be<00:03:59.410> in

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
in climbing if it's possible to be in

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.420

some really dangerous situations but the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.180 
some really dangerous situations but the
