like or look at the rocks they don't
look<00:04:20.919> as<00:04:21.220> they<00:04:21.639> do<00:04:21.699> basically<00:04:21.970> what<00:04:22.150> I'm

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
look as they do basically what I'm

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.520 
look as they do basically what I'm
trying<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.449> say<00:04:22.539> is<00:04:22.599> it<00:04:22.720> kind<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.110> removes<00:04:23.349> that

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
trying to say is it kind of removes that

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.339 
trying to say is it kind of removes that
blackness<00:04:24.120> like<00:04:25.120> I'll<00:04:25.360> show<00:04:25.599> you<00:04:25.660> example

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
blackness like I'll show you example

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.020 
blackness like I'll show you example
actually<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:26.949> can't<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.400> was<00:04:27.550> gonna<00:04:27.639> try<00:04:27.849> to<00:04:27.910> show

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
actually I can't I was gonna try to show

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.020 
actually I can't I was gonna try to show
you<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> character<00:04:28.479> but<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:29.800> probably<00:04:30.759> could

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
you a character but I probably could

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.830 
you a character but I probably could
yeah

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
yeah

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.540 
yeah
so<00:04:32.050> here's<00:04:32.680> an<00:04:32.800> example<00:04:32.889> look<00:04:33.340> at<00:04:33.430> my

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
so here's an example look at my

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.060 
so here's an example look at my
character<00:04:33.610> okay<00:04:34.090> we'll<00:04:35.020> go<00:04:35.169> over<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.530> think<00:04:35.740> you

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
character okay we'll go over I think you

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.830 
character okay we'll go over I think you
can<00:04:36.220> go<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.370> or<00:04:36.610> something<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.330> don't<00:04:37.660> know

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
can go to or something I don't know

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.260 
can go to or something I don't know
guess<00:04:38.740> not

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
guess not

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.939 
guess not
well<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.169> as<00:04:41.289> you'll<00:04:41.530> just<00:04:41.650> look<00:04:41.800> at<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
well it but as you'll just look at the

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.550 
well it but as you'll just look at the
weapons<00:04:42.250> okay<00:04:42.460> they<00:04:43.030> there's<00:04:43.630> not<00:04:43.810> as<00:04:43.990> that

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
weapons okay they there's not as that

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.159 
weapons okay they there's not as that
distinct<00:04:45.070> black<00:04:45.310> line<00:04:45.639> that<00:04:45.669> seems<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.360> play

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
distinct black line that seems to play

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.839 
distinct black line that seems to play
it<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.470> up<00:04:47.560> like<00:04:47.770> but<00:04:48.039> seems<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.639> really

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
it and up like but seems to really

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.760 
it and up like but seems to really
affect<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.449> only<00:04:49.570> kind<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.500> only

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
affect it it's only kind of the only

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.110 
affect it it's only kind of the only
thing<00:04:50.949> where<00:04:51.070> it's<00:04:51.190> black<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.610> basically<00:04:51.909> in

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
thing where it's black is basically in

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.500 
thing where it's black is basically in
the<00:04:52.150> details<00:04:52.659> of<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.900> lines<00:04:53.110> but<00:04:53.470> um<00:04:54.060> yeah<00:04:55.060> it

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
the details of the lines but um yeah it

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.029 
the details of the lines but um yeah it
looks<00:04:55.750> really<00:04:56.020> cool<00:04:56.169> on<00:04:56.229> its<00:04:56.440> own<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.740> have<00:04:56.889> to

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
looks really cool on its own I have to

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.000 
looks really cool on its own I have to
admit<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:58.030> is<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.210> bit<00:04:58.300> laggy<00:04:58.630> obviously<00:04:59.260> but

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
admit it is a bit laggy obviously but

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.219 
admit it is a bit laggy obviously but
it's<00:05:00.130> playable<00:05:00.340> for<00:05:00.639> me<00:05:00.930> when<00:05:01.930> I'm<00:05:02.050> not

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
it's playable for me when I'm not

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.080 
it's playable for me when I'm not
recording<00:05:02.470> though<00:05:02.740> it's<00:05:02.919> it's<00:05:03.430> is<00:05:03.699> I<00:05:03.849> think<00:05:03.909> I

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
recording though it's it's is I think I

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.390 
recording though it's it's is I think I
get<00:05:04.240> like<00:05:04.360> 30<00:05:04.630> 40<00:05:04.930> FPS<00:05:05.260> like<00:05:05.800> here<00:05:06.099> you<00:05:06.220> can<00:05:06.280> see

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
get like 30 40 FPS like here you can see

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.210 
get like 30 40 FPS like here you can see
it<00:05:06.729> it's<00:05:06.940> it's<00:05:07.270> like<00:05:07.539> that<00:05:07.840> style<00:05:08.139> of<00:05:08.349> line<00:05:08.560> but

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
it it's it's like that style of line but

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.499 
it it's it's like that style of line but
on<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.490> ground<00:05:09.759> and<00:05:10.000> that<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.180> weapons

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
on the ground and that the weapons

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.610 
on the ground and that the weapons
that's<00:05:10.630> where<00:05:10.750> it's<00:05:10.840> really<00:05:10.900> more<00:05:11.229> prevalent

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
that's where it's really more prevalent

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.640 
that's where it's really more prevalent
is<00:05:11.740> on<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.190> weapons<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:12.789> they<00:05:13.349> don't<00:05:14.349> look<00:05:14.440> as

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
is on the weapons so they don't look as

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.200 
is on the weapons so they don't look as
washed<00:05:14.919> out<00:05:15.130> but<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:15.460> was<00:05:15.580> graphically<00:05:16.030> let's

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
washed out but it was graphically let's

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.860 
washed out but it was graphically let's
just<00:05:16.360> go<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.539> graphics<00:05:17.050> really<00:05:17.199> quickly

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
just go to graphics really quickly

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.680 
just go to graphics really quickly
everything<00:05:19.870> is<00:05:20.110> on<00:05:20.650> high<00:05:21.310> except<00:05:22.210> for<00:05:22.330> physics

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
everything is on high except for physics

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.180 
everything is on high except for physics
I'm<00:05:23.590> even<00:05:23.889> running

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
I'm even running

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.430 
I'm even running

I'll<00:05:26.680> just<00:05:26.860> bring<00:05:26.979> it<00:05:27.070> down<00:05:27.130> it'll<00:05:27.940> make

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
I'll just bring it down it'll make

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.210 
I'll just bring it down it'll make
everything<00:05:28.270> even<00:05:28.599> a<00:05:28.900> little<00:05:29.199> more<00:05:29.349> less<00:05:29.979> laggy

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
everything even a little more less laggy

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.550 
everything even a little more less laggy
so<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.849> then<00:05:31.720> if<00:05:31.810> we<00:05:31.930> go<00:05:32.110> to<00:05:32.139> say<00:05:34.289> let's<00:05:35.289> see<00:05:35.500> if

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
so and then if we go to say let's see if

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.920 
so and then if we go to say let's see if
we've<00:05:35.710> dropped<00:05:35.949> down<00:05:36.159> foliage<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.940> distance

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
we've dropped down foliage to distance

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.029 
we've dropped down foliage to distance
texture<00:05:38.560> quality<00:05:39.570> drop<00:05:40.570> that<00:05:40.750> down<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.349> yet<00:05:41.949> we

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
texture quality drop that down to yet we

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.529 
texture quality drop that down to yet we
have<00:05:42.159> a<00:05:42.190> high<00:05:42.690> drop<00:05:43.690> ambient<00:05:44.229> occlusion<00:05:44.800> down

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
have a high drop ambient occlusion down

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.999 
have a high drop ambient occlusion down
depth<00:05:46.539> of<00:05:46.750> field<00:05:46.990> down<00:05:47.340> FX<00:05:48.340> AAA<00:05:48.909> down

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
depth of field down FX AAA down

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.040 
depth of field down FX AAA down
yeah<00:05:51.129> a<00:05:51.400> lot<00:05:52.389> smoother<00:05:52.900> but<00:05:53.710> not<00:05:53.860> as<00:05:54.009> beautiful

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
yeah a lot smoother but not as beautiful

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.079 
yeah a lot smoother but not as beautiful
so<00:05:56.050> what<00:05:56.650> I'm<00:05:56.740> trying<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:57.069> say<00:05:57.189> I'm<00:05:57.460> also<00:05:57.639> using

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
so what I'm trying to say I'm also using

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:59.309 
so what I'm trying to say I'm also using
that<00:05:58.270> readyboost<00:05:58.599> so<00:05:58.900> that<00:05:59.020> might<00:05:59.199> be

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
that readyboost so that might be

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.959 
that readyboost so that might be
affecting<00:05:59.649> I<00:05:59.770> don't<00:05:59.979> know<00:06:00.039> as<00:06:00.699> you<00:06:00.789> can<00:06:00.819> see

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
affecting I don't know as you can see

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.170 
affecting I don't know as you can see
the<00:06:01.089> weapons<00:06:01.389> don't<00:06:01.599> they<00:06:01.869> look<00:06:02.050> a<00:06:02.110> lot<00:06:02.319> more

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
the weapons don't they look a lot more

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.279 
the weapons don't they look a lot more
they<00:06:04.180> pop<00:06:04.389> out<00:06:04.569> a<00:06:04.599> lot<00:06:04.839> more<00:06:04.990> as<00:06:05.080> what<00:06:05.199> I'm

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
they pop out a lot more as what I'm

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.439
