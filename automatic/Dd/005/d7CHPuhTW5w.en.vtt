00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.509
 geranium geraniums right verbena 

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.789
 annual plants 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.079
 enlighten me these are plants that 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.759
 start to grow in the month of may 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.499
 until october 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.909
 it does not spend the winter on the other hand 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:32.219
 they are very very floriferous hold 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.959
 you saw the size of my pot in 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.200
 every mark is there are 6 go of like 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.849
 it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.069
 how much do I need for my 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.869
 containing that for your skin the 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.580
 boat and will go very well with 6 go d 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.830
 leave room to put a 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.600
 perennials or a grass so 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.350
 to do a little bit of composition it's a 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.850
 good idea I know the advantage of the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.500
 beausset you can change them from 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.420
 place to create moods 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.770
 so I can work a continent 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.050
 with the tray in shades 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.500
 red and then right next to that with 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.230
 yellow 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.910
 this is a contrast it's very 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.760
 tonic it's dynamic and you can 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.740
 also associate the rose with rape and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.990
 it will be more tender and delicate a little 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.490
 little like you purple blue it's very 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.650
 pretty even in pink containers 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.450
 candy for a successful plantation 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.840
 as usual we finish the shopping 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.450
 together 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.030
 and yes you already have the pot the plans 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.640
 you miss the port vale to the terran 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.520
 makes a potting soil the clay balls the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.410
 felt of garden it will be necessary to think of rezé 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.630
 speaking watering I have you 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.620
 watch I saw a watering can generate the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.620
 pink roses too
