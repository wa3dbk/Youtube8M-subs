00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.360
 hello good at all and I'm loving people 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.060
 today I want to take this video because good 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.250
 there are things that it is good to refresh is 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.800
 good to remember things that were left 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.990
 back in time that we could not give 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.640
 an explanation but that as it goes 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.560
 Spending time as I always say 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.900
 Well we are realizing 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.510
 We are fitting things and we are going 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.210
 realizing why at that time 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.820
 We could not get it out we could not give it a 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.880
 explanation today we will talk about 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.760
 this mark that was here that was that 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.440
 you see the sea you see the water and a fin 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 of shark what appears to be a fin 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.870
 of shark I said in a moment ago 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.289
 quite some time when the map of 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.829
 depp modes that is shark fin and 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.800
 that water could be a next dcc that 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.260
 it would come out that the sea was worth it 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.050
 at sea ​​or had something of importance 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.700
 with water for example that was in the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.720
 'Bermuda triangle' whatever 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.000
 or that it was something related to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.830
 atlantis not with the atlantis something 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.510
 related to that no 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.350
 and with its importance in history as 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.630
 the normal look when I know that in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.090
 that time this here on the wall of 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.690
 verdú that was each one of the maps 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.240
 transit die race to which the bird behind 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.990
 on top of the rock hinting that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.150
 it was the map of motels or like other people 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.670
 I thought it could be someone in mode 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.840
 afterlife for the arms thus stretched 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.330
 here and such not after this that would 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.330
 would represent buried by the thing of 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.310
 that they were all dead and then this 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.650
 last that at first nothing 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.450
 we knew what it was but then 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.450
 we realized that clearly he was 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.119
 alluding to the map of origin by 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.700
 the foot of the giant and by the light that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.770
 has below is the circle that looked 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.440
 with the lights bulbs that was 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.390
 just below the giant's foot was 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.900
 Of course he was alluding to 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.030
 all the maps of black ops 2 and they were 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.600
 here from an origin from the beginning 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.380
 in word war set not because this explains 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.100
 that great story that was here 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.850
 on the watercress wall and up here there was 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.730
 a map that was this water here and this 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.420
 shark fin that good because it was 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.280
 allusion to a map I did not fit it in 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.590
 these white two but as we told ourselves 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.980
 account in the end because it did not belong to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.380
 black ops 2 clear now we 're going 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.050
 we realize why for what reason 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.350
 Well, if you realize everyone is with 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.840
 relative here those of black ops 2 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.900
 transit through the tower by the tower 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.490
 electric trànsit die race for the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.050
 death in die race mother so 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.560
 I said before 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:17.430
 of alcatraz in the rock or mode 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.680
 afterlife after here in buried because 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.530
 they were buried by the people of 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.060
 buried buried and then here origins 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.750
 because of the giant foot as it ended 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.940
 to say but this map look well this 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.550
 watermark and shark fin not 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.790
 is on the same line not the line 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.820
 temporary but is not together with the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:43.020
 white maps 2 what came to us 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.140
 say that this belongs to another map in 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.090
 the future in black ops 3 or who knows 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.970
 but later because this of 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.750
 stars we already know how they are but given 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.880
 account here was what I could do 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.480
 perfectly alluded 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.930
 on the map of what would be new town vale 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.800
 but this one was in a different place 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.620
 above what we come to say that 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.470
 and now we realize why not 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.290
 they were removed earlier because it was not together 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.080
 with the white maps 2 because not 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.740
 belonged to this part of the story 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.920
 belongs to another one because here you have that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.040
 importance that relationship that had that 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.080
 water map in the future with the 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.230
 zombie story marked here in the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.720
 prophecy on the watercress wall 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.210
 but 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.310
 what other details are here that what 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.680
 better we have passed that will be us 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.249
 saying with this brand of the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:50.319
 electricity marked just above 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.319
 of the electric transit tower 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.690
 until the next video
