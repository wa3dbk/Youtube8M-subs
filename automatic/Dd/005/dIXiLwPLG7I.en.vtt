filler<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> edges<00:00:43.410> um<00:00:45.260> now<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
filler on the edges um now this is the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
filler on the edges um now this is the
poster<00:00:47.700> board<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.030> there's<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> paper

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
poster board where there's like a paper

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.959 
poster board where there's like a paper
covering<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> outside<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.760> there's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
covering on the outside and then there's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.850 
covering on the outside and then there's
foam<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.539> center<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> each<00:00:52.199> board<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
foam on the center of each board and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.819 
foam on the center of each board and
this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.280> four<00:00:53.610> layers<00:00:53.820> um<00:00:54.829> it's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
this is about four layers um it's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.099 
this is about four layers um it's
relatively<00:00:56.579> simple<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.090> mean<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.899> got

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
relatively simple I mean it's not got

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.260 
relatively simple I mean it's not got
too<00:00:58.320> much<00:00:58.469> layering<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.640> besides<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
too much layering going on besides that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.429 
too much layering going on besides that
and<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> stuff<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:03.960> annoying<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and the stuff is really annoying that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.429 
and the stuff is really annoying that
cut<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> teeth<00:01:05.369> are<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:06.090> too<00:01:06.510> sharp

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
cut because the teeth are not too sharp

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.160 
cut because the teeth are not too sharp
on<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> side<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:09.030> sharp<00:01:09.479> looking<00:01:09.810> at<00:01:09.990> least

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
on that side or sharp looking at least

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
on that side or sharp looking at least
on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> side<00:01:11.100> I'd<00:01:11.340> say<00:01:11.729> they're<00:01:11.909> fairly

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
on the side I'd say they're fairly

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.920 
on the side I'd say they're fairly
better<00:01:12.619> but<00:01:13.970> overall<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.270> did<00:01:15.900> enjoy

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
better but overall I really did enjoy

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.460 
better but overall I really did enjoy
making<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.549> hand<00:01:17.880> painted

making it it is all hand painted
normally<00:01:19.470> I'd<00:01:19.590> spray<00:01:19.979> paint<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
normally I'd spray paint but this is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.380 
normally I'd spray paint but this is
hand<00:01:21.750> painted<00:01:22.070> with<00:01:23.119> acrylic<00:01:24.119> paint<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.020> oh

the<00:01:51.600> first<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.350> working<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.369> posterboard

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
the first time working with posterboard

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.179 
the first time working with posterboard
by<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> i<00:01:57.770> think<00:01:58.770> i<00:01:58.920> got<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
by the way so i think i got the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.399 
by the way so i think i got the
proportion<00:01:59.729> right<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> blade

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
proportion right if you think the blade

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.780 
proportion right if you think the blade
is<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:01.979> too<00:02:02.130> long<00:02:02.280> i<00:02:02.520> had<00:02:02.610> some
