different bacteria and some of these

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.539 
different bacteria and some of these
bacteria<00:01:36.540> are<00:01:36.869> tissue<00:01:37.259> invasive<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.310> other

bacteria<00:01:44.159> actually<00:01:44.759> find<00:01:45.240> found<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
bacteria actually find found in the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
bacteria actually find found in the
lining<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> arteries<00:01:46.770> which<00:01:47.280> make<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
lining of the arteries which make it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.289 
lining of the arteries which make it
more<00:01:47.759> susceptible<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:49.970> plank<00:01:50.970> release

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
more susceptible to to plank release

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
more susceptible to to plank release
from<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> arteries<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.229> heart<00:01:52.950> attack<00:01:53.189> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
from the arteries to heart attack and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
from the arteries to heart attack and
stroke<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.119> that's<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.689> ways

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
stroke and that that's one of the ways

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.080 
stroke and that that's one of the ways
it<00:01:54.990> doesn't<00:01:55.320> okay<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.369> does<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.880> truth

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it doesn't okay so if does the truth

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.789 
it doesn't okay so if does the truth
last<00:01:57.299> alpha<00:01:57.750> also<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> deal<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
last alpha also have to deal with that

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.010 
last alpha also have to deal with that
with<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.579> inflammation<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> more

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
with the inflammation so the more

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.719 
with the inflammation so the more
inflammatory<00:02:01.439> organs<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.549> more<00:02:02.700> likely

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
inflammatory organs are the more likely

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.880 
inflammatory organs are the more likely
you<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.329> lose

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
you are to lose

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.040 
you are to lose
sure<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.640> more<00:02:04.850> inflammatory<00:02:05.090> your<00:02:05.570> gums<00:02:05.780> are

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
sure the more inflammatory your gums are

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.770 
sure the more inflammatory your gums are
the<00:02:06.650> more<00:02:06.830> likely<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.190> are<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:08.060> lose<00:02:08.270> bone

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the more likely you are to lose bone

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.050 
the more likely you are to lose bone
around<00:02:09.110> your<00:02:09.320> teeth<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:10.550> like<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.670> fence<00:02:10.940> post

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
around your teeth it's like a fence post

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.550 
around your teeth it's like a fence post
if<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.420> have<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.600> fence<00:02:11.780> posted<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.230> deep

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
if you have a fence posted that deep

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.680 
if you have a fence posted that deep
into<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> ground<00:02:13.040> it's<00:02:13.550> pretty<00:02:13.850> stable<00:02:14.150> but

become<00:02:21.590> loose<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.010> lose<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.370> teeth<00:02:22.520> so

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
become loose and you lose your teeth so

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.030 
become loose and you lose your teeth so
it's<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.120> same<00:02:23.330> same<00:02:23.900> reasonable<00:02:24.350> typically

oral health and hygiene and smoking and
I<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:01.910> there's<00:03:02.570> cancers

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
I know that you know there's cancers

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.810 
I know that you know there's cancers
that<00:03:03.260> can<00:03:03.500> be<00:03:03.620> caused<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.160> we<00:03:04.250> obviously<00:03:04.430> know

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
that can be caused and we obviously know

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.600 
that can be caused and we obviously know
the<00:03:04.970> cancers<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.330> are<00:03:05.510> caused<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.080> body

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
the cancers that are caused in the body

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.750 
the cancers that are caused in the body
you<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.730> from<00:03:08.299> smoking<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:09.590> how<00:03:10.220> about<00:03:10.280> oral

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
you know from smoking but how about oral

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.030 
you know from smoking but how about oral
cancers<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:11.989> happen<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.560> because

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
cancers that can happen is that because

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.460 
cancers that can happen is that because
of<00:03:13.070> smoking<00:03:13.610> smoking<00:03:14.120> certainly<00:03:14.870> increases

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
of smoking smoking certainly increases

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.860 
of smoking smoking certainly increases
the<00:03:15.620> risk<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:16.070> oral<00:03:16.280> cancer<00:03:16.549> not<00:03:17.420> only<00:03:17.450> smoking

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
the risk of oral cancer not only smoking

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.410 
the risk of oral cancer not only smoking
but<00:03:18.140> chewing<00:03:19.070> tobacco<00:03:19.489> does<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.910> any<00:03:20.090> kind<00:03:20.330> of

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
but chewing tobacco does to any kind of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.250 
but chewing tobacco does to any kind of
anything<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:21.019> also<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.549> frequent<00:03:22.549> or<00:03:23.260> abusive

alcohol<00:03:24.769> consumption<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.700> also<00:03:26.090> increased

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
alcohol consumption it also increased

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.500 
alcohol consumption it also increased
the<00:03:26.840> risk<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.110> oral<00:03:27.620> cancer<00:03:28.160> um<00:03:28.340> believe<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.420> or

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
the risk of oral cancer um believe it or

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.940 
the risk of oral cancer um believe it or

not sun exposure

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.820 
not sun exposure
can<00:03:31.370> increase<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.299> risk<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.780> oral<00:03:33.200> cancer<00:03:33.470> on

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
can increase the risk of oral cancer on

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.410 
can increase the risk of oral cancer on
the<00:03:33.920> lower<00:03:34.100> lip<00:03:34.400> when<00:03:34.940> people<00:03:35.209> get<00:03:35.299> their

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
lower lip sunburned that makes sense so

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.620 
lower lip sunburned that makes sense so
how<00:03:39.200> do<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.410> detect<00:03:39.739> oral<00:03:40.250> cancer<00:03:40.700> in<00:03:41.390> our
