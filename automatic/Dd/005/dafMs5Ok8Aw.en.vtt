 does not take the result leaves the children 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.900
 we are in our saga by the languages 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.910
 nostradamus circus is happening here 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.990
 even the note says the tricks he swims 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.110
 see with me but finally 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.910
 today we will make of saturn is already a 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.650
 crisis more complicated to help 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.150
 You're still going through the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.890
 solution of state s 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.650
 I do not know, let's accept a riddle of 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.809
 saturn I includes two blades attached 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.239
 justice and accompanied by the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.790
 europe is true and fair fams time 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.100
 time to formulate staff then there are two 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.640
 swords and on the watch the clock since 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.010
 knows some a little obvious right? 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.870
 in a way few more to another 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.250
 team me and all that problem 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.629
 some are not very easy to do 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.379
 animal had the character of morning without 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.240
 want 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.729
 so come on 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.250
 twenty- four petals of light our lady 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.770
 of the Rose Eyes Quiet as Stone on 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.380
 the faithful below for the lady notre dame in 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.540
 lady by the setting sun looks at the rose 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.030
 it's not even that the problem is blooming. 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:31.370
 exactly the problem becomes the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:35.330
 whole but this breaks the 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.320
 problem the program purpose of the video is 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.760
 Actually give me de facto and language cinema and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.840
 ends in notre dame we have two days 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.250
 to solve there following the road is 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.380
 very simple and easy but decorate the city 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.710
 I just know that more from 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.990
 center still has a has an open style 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.409
 the squad almost never returned to do 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.180
 a mission of history and that was it 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.180
 finally we have the front part here 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.080
 then five around here for one of the boxes 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.550
 Marauders who has the video of e3 are reading 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.780
 Immediately here the problem here 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.349
 It really is that it has so much room for 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.310
 climb that ordered you to feel relaxed 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.239
 here it is suddenly right in the middle in 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.069
 stop the man 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.120
 I do not think anyone can handle it, it's not 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.370
 third none 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.790
 father kaka must stop interpreting 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:44.099
 ball Dora stay with our lady in 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.319
 between the competing waters continues 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.319
 for home of trans's pink rose 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.190
 to pronounce her words 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.099
 last longer on our treasure brings in 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.420

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:05.870

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.870

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.049
 Amateur, you have to respect my 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.430
 door of the entire hall this was the only 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.620
