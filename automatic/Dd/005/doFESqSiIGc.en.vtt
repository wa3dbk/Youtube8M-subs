00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
love it in terms of granite there are a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.979 
love it in terms of granite there are a
couple<00:00:35.370> things<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.820> want<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> tell<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.360> granite

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
couple things I want to tell you granite

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.770 
couple things I want to tell you granite
is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> natural<00:00:37.980> stone<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.360> couple<00:00:39.690> things

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is a natural stone so a couple things

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049 
is a natural stone so a couple things
you<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> porous<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.879> your

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you have to know it is porous like your

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.560 
you have to know it is porous like your
skin<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.200> absorb<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.570> product

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
skin and it can absorb a lot of product

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.900 
skin and it can absorb a lot of product
a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.020> color<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.980> absorb<00:00:47.160> it's

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
a lot of color it can absorb it's

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.520 
a lot of color it can absorb it's
absorbent<00:00:48.629> let's<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.020> put<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.289> way

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
absorbent let's just put it that way

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
absorbent let's just put it that way
let's<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> science<00:00:50.550> anyway<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
let's get into the science anyway the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.569 
let's get into the science anyway the
bottom<00:00:51.930> line<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> be<00:00:53.160> careful

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
bottom line is you have to be careful

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
bottom line is you have to be careful
with<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.969> put<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> stain

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
with what you put on it if you stain

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.520 
with what you put on it if you stain
your<00:00:55.590> counter<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.489> put<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:57.449> glass<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
your counter like if you put a glass and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.349 
your counter like if you put a glass and
it<00:00:58.590> has<00:00:58.620> wine<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> bottom<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.210> have

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it has wine on the bottom of it you have

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.889 
it has wine on the bottom of it you have
to<00:01:00.510> wipe<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:00.989> right<00:01:01.410> away<00:01:01.699> or<00:01:02.699> else<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to wipe it up right away or else the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
to wipe it up right away or else the
counter<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.439> absorb<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.890> color<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
counter will absorb that color if it's a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.340 
counter will absorb that color if it's a
light-colored<00:01:06.180> granite<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.260> be

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
light-colored granite and that will be

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.260 
light-colored granite and that will be
very<00:01:07.740> hard<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> clean<00:01:08.340> cleaning<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
very hard to clean cleaning up the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
very hard to clean cleaning up the
counters<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:09.930> quickly<00:01:10.260> especially<00:01:10.500> with

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
counters very quickly especially with

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.429 
counters very quickly especially with
reds<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.640> yellows<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.780> important<00:01:13.320> because

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
reds or yellows very important because

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.980 
reds or yellows very important because
dyes<00:01:13.770> very<00:01:14.460> hard<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> granite<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
dyes very hard to get out of granite the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600 
dyes very hard to get out of granite the
next<00:01:16.320> thing<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> need<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> know<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
next thing you need to know is not to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.230 
next thing you need to know is not to
use<00:01:17.729> anything<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.390> harsh<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.619> counter

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
use anything that's harsh on the counter

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
use anything that's harsh on the counter
assuming<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.540> granite<00:01:21.900> counter<00:01:22.290> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
assuming that's a granite counter you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.499 
assuming that's a granite counter you
don't<00:01:23.400> want<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> use<00:01:23.670> anything<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> glass

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
don't want to use anything like a glass

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
don't want to use anything like a glass
cleaner<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.290> vinegar<00:01:25.860> or<00:01:25.890> anything<00:01:26.189> acidic

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cleaner of vinegar or anything acidic

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.270 
cleaner of vinegar or anything acidic
anything<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:27.930> acidic<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> use<00:01:28.979> on

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
anything that's acidic that you use on

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.370 
anything that's acidic that you use on
granite<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:30.329> mark<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.020> finish

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
granite can actually mark the finish

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
granite can actually mark the finish
which<00:01:31.770> essentially<00:01:32.250> means<00:01:32.430> it'll<00:01:32.700> ruin<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
which essentially means it'll ruin it

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.929 
which essentially means it'll ruin it
it'll<00:01:33.479> dull<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.170> finish<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.280> regrind

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
it'll dull the finish and to regrind

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.840 
it'll dull the finish and to regrind
your<00:01:36.329> granite<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.380> rebuff<00:01:38.280> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
your granite and then have it rebuff so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.030 
your granite and then have it rebuff so
that<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.119> looks<00:01:39.329> brand<00:01:39.659> new<00:01:39.750> again<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.740> very

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that it looks brand new again is a very

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.370 
that it looks brand new again is a very
costly<00:01:41.340> endeavor<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.270> try<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.110> go<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
costly endeavor so try not to go that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
costly endeavor so try not to go that
direction<00:01:43.640> what<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> want<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> find<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
direction what you want to find is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
direction what you want to find is
something<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.049> pH<00:01:46.590> neutral<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.700> best<00:01:47.970> pH

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
something that is pH neutral the best pH

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.929 
something that is pH neutral the best pH
neutral<00:01:48.990> product<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> know<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.159> dish<00:01:50.640> soap

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
neutral product that I know is dish soap

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.120 
neutral product that I know is dish soap
so<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> pinch<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.799> fill<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
so when in a pinch I would just fill a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
so when in a pinch I would just fill a
sink<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.670> some<00:01:53.820> warm<00:01:54.090> water<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.420> put<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.840> a

and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.210> take<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> dry<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.170> buff<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and then take a dry one and just buff it

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160 
and then take a dry one and just buff it
dry<00:02:01.829> that's<00:02:02.579> how<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> would<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:04.020> can

have vacuumed up something what if you
vacuumed<00:02:30.850> up<00:02:30.970> something<00:02:31.420> wet<00:02:31.860> Moisture<00:02:32.860> will

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
vacuumed up something wet Moisture will

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.479 
vacuumed up something wet Moisture will
absorb<00:02:33.430> into<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:35.020> crazy<00:02:35.500> funnel<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.220> James

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
let's say half a cup of baking soda on

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.110 
let's say half a cup of baking soda on
your<00:03:05.530> carpet<00:03:05.950> now<00:03:06.519> when<00:03:06.700> you're<00:03:06.850> vacuuming

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
your carpet now when you're vacuuming

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.240 
your carpet now when you're vacuuming
you've<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:08.110> cue<00:03:08.319> MUP<00:03:08.500> all<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.830> baking<00:03:09.220> soda

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
you've a cue MUP all that baking soda

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.820 
you've a cue MUP all that baking soda
and<00:03:09.819> the<00:03:10.209> baking<00:03:10.239> soda<00:03:10.690> has<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> natural

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
and the baking soda has a natural

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.190 
and the baking soda has a natural
deodorizing<00:03:12.790> property<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.870> what<00:03:14.080> will

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
deodorizing property to it so what will

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.350 
deodorizing property to it so what will
happen<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.769> when<00:03:15.250> it's<00:03:15.430> funneling<00:03:15.970> around<00:03:16.180> in

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
happen is when it's funneling around in

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.720 
happen is when it's funneling around in
your<00:03:16.480> vacuum<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.110> doing<00:03:17.380> its<00:03:17.560> magical<00:03:18.459> thing

your vacuum and doing its magical thing

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.390 
your vacuum and doing its magical thing
it<00:03:19.180> will<00:03:19.600> help<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.260> break<00:03:20.590> down<00:03:20.860> some<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.220> those

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
it will help to break down some of those

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.340 
it will help to break down some of those
owners<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.030> get<00:03:22.150> rid<00:03:22.329> of<00:03:22.360> them<00:03:22.600> then<00:03:23.140> it'll
