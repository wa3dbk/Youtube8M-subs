compared<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.299> these<00:02:00.450> two<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
compared to these two just because of

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.669 
compared to these two just because of
the<00:02:01.439> flatness<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.099> the<00:02:02.189> front<00:02:02.429> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.639> truck

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.220 

heatwave

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
heatwave

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.600 
heatwave
I<00:02:13.790> like<00:02:14.790> heatwave<00:02:15.239> amongst<00:02:15.989> these<00:02:16.140> guys<00:02:16.610> looks

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
I like heatwave amongst these guys looks

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.089 
I like heatwave amongst these guys looks
pretty<00:02:17.880> nice<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:20.489> then<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.390> course<00:02:21.770> blades

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
pretty nice and then of course blades

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.190 
pretty nice and then of course blades
I<00:02:23.130> still<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.300> blades<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
I still think blades is one of the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.690 
I still think blades is one of the
better<00:02:25.380> ones<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:26.030> yeah<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:28.580> getting<00:02:29.580> these

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
better ones but yeah so getting these

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.120 
better ones but yeah so getting these
guys<00:02:29.970> transformed<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.200> course<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.680> breeze

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
guys transformed is of course a breeze

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.300 
guys transformed is of course a breeze
for<00:02:33.030> hoist<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:34.080> all<00:02:34.319> you're<00:02:34.590> gonna<00:02:34.709> do<00:02:34.980> is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
for hoist here all you're gonna do is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.820 
for hoist here all you're gonna do is
kind<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.940> stand<00:02:36.180> them<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.110> then

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
kind of stand them up like this and then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.180 
kind of stand them up like this and then
take<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.610> hook<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.420> flip<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.050> all<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.440> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
take this hook and flip it all up and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.960 
take this hook and flip it all up and
you'll<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.730> transformed<00:02:42.450> everything

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
you'll see that transformed everything

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.610 
you'll see that transformed everything
and<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.019> put<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.470> hook

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and then you just kind of put the hook

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.340 
and then you just kind of put the hook
down<00:02:47.040> somewhere<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.299> there<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.569> go<00:02:48.720> no<00:02:49.170> real

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
down somewhere and there you go no real

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.350 
down somewhere and there you go no real
