00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
storage location on the phone itself so

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.380 
storage location on the phone itself so
another<00:03:54.110> feature<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.190> phone<00:03:55.220> will<00:03:55.820> shrink

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
another feature of the phone will shrink

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.040 
another feature of the phone will shrink
this<00:03:56.570> down<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:57.050> still<00:03:57.290> running<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:59.570> file

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
this down and still running is the file

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.199 
this down and still running is the file
manager<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.769> we've<00:04:00.920> got<00:04:01.070> a<00:04:01.100> file<00:04:01.459> manager<00:04:01.670> here

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
manager so we've got a file manager here

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.560 
manager so we've got a file manager here
that's<00:04:02.450> going<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.780> show<00:04:02.989> us<00:04:03.200> what's<00:04:03.980> on<00:04:04.190> the

device itself we can go back to the
citric<00:05:33.610> session<00:05:34.060> we're<00:05:35.020> still<00:05:35.260> running<00:05:35.500> the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
citric session we're still running the

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.820 
citric session we're still running the
citric<00:05:36.100> session<00:05:36.490> here<00:05:36.760> and<00:05:37.260> we<00:05:38.260> think<00:05:38.440> this<00:05:38.650> is

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
citric session here and we think this is

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.160 
citric session here and we think this is
pretty<00:05:39.010> amazing<00:05:39.340> in<00:05:39.640> terms<00:05:39.670> of<00:05:40.150> changing<00:05:40.870> the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
pretty amazing in terms of changing the

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.970 
pretty amazing in terms of changing the
way<00:05:41.530> people<00:05:42.070> can<00:05:42.640> compute<00:05:43.300> then<00:05:43.570> changing<00:05:44.170> the

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
way people can compute then changing the

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.530 
way people can compute then changing the
