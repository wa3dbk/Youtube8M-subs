00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
a close-up shot you can it does feel

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.620 
a close-up shot you can it does feel
like<00:02:29.980> you're<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.280> little<00:02:30.489> elevated<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.450> don't

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
like you're a little elevated you don't

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.390 
like you're a little elevated you don't
feel<00:02:31.810> really<00:02:32.049> close<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.650> ground<00:02:32.680> which

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
feel really close to the ground which

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.890 
feel really close to the ground which
some<00:02:33.579> people<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.030> some<00:02:34.060> people<00:02:34.480> don't<00:02:34.720> like

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
but overall you can see the movement in

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.840 
but overall you can see the movement in
the<00:02:38.019> Springs<00:02:38.380> I'm<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.799> do<00:02:38.980> some<00:02:39.220> motions

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
the Springs I'm going to do some motions

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.640 
the Springs I'm going to do some motions
here<00:02:40.150> where<00:02:40.570> I'm<00:02:40.660> going<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.870> bend<00:02:41.109> and<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.440> can

see how those Springs move

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.979 
see how those Springs move
kind<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:43.950> give<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.190> extra<00:02:44.819> bounce<00:02:44.989> also

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
kind of give you that extra bounce also

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.119 
kind of give you that extra bounce also
like<00:02:46.170> I've<00:02:46.319> mentioned<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.769> energy

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
like I've mentioned with the energy

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.790 
like I've mentioned with the energy
boost<00:02:47.370> these<00:02:47.940> these<00:02:48.480> things<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.230> kind<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.500> save

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
boost these these things to kind of save

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.449 
boost these these things to kind of save
energy

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
energy

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.869 
energy
I<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:51.750> feel<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.319> when<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> move<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.129> put

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
I really feel it like when I move I put

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.190 
I really feel it like when I move I put
have<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.120> put<00:02:54.269> less<00:02:54.450> energy<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:54.989> because

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
have to put less energy in because

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.740 
have to put less energy in because
there's<00:02:55.379> such<00:02:55.590> great<00:02:55.769> response<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.300> really

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
there's such great response so I really

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.830 
there's such great response so I really
like<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.739> feel<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:58.980> these<00:02:59.269> it<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.450> funny<00:03:00.660> when

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
like the feel of these it is funny when

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.690 
like the feel of these it is funny when
you're<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.140> kind<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.620> harder<00:03:02.310> ground<00:03:02.549> like

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
you're on kind of a harder ground like

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.460
