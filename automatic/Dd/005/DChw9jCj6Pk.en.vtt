actually<00:00:17.760> pricing<00:00:18.359> plenty<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.140> videos<00:00:19.380> maybe

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
actually pricing plenty of videos maybe

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.970 
actually pricing plenty of videos maybe
you<00:00:19.830> haven't<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.820> how<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.119> check<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.330> fluid

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
you haven't on how to check your fluid

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.859 
you haven't on how to check your fluid
should<00:00:22.980> probably<00:00:23.310> driven<00:00:23.730> 15-20<00:00:24.630> minutes

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
should probably driven 15-20 minutes

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
should probably driven 15-20 minutes
warmed<00:00:25.529> up<00:00:25.680> put<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> park

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
warmed up put it in park

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.020 
warmed up put it in park
and<00:00:28.080> there's<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> dipstick<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:32.880> has

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and there's a dipstick right here it has

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.330 
and there's a dipstick right here it has
a<00:00:33.210> hot<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:34.050> cold<00:00:34.320> section<00:00:35.660> on<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.930> dipstick

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
a hot in a cold section on the dipstick

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.380 
a hot in a cold section on the dipstick
this<00:00:38.340> video<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> more<00:00:38.940> about<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this video is more about the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
this video is more about the
transmission<00:00:40.079> fluid<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.890> may<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.219> know

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
transmission fluid you may not know

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.270 
transmission fluid you may not know
about<00:00:42.320> there's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> notice<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> dipstick

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
about there's a notice on the dipstick

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.240 
about there's a notice on the dipstick
so<00:00:44.640> check<00:00:44.940> differential<00:00:45.870> oil<00:00:46.170> level<00:00:47.039> at

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so check differential oil level at

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.160 
so check differential oil level at
filler<00:00:48.350> see<00:00:49.350> repair<00:00:49.680> manual<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.219> information

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
filler see repair manual for information

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
filler see repair manual for information
so<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.590> differentials<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.579> has

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
so the differentials actually has

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.160 
so the differentials actually has
separate<00:00:54.059> fluid<00:00:54.390> although<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.960> still

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
separate fluid although it's still

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.639 
separate fluid although it's still
probably<00:00:55.739> detron<00:00:56.280> fluid<00:00:56.730> red<00:00:57.649> transmission

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
probably detron fluid red transmission

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.650 
probably detron fluid red transmission
fluid<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.309> below<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.000> let's<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.390> below

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
fluid but it is below so let's go below

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.740 
fluid but it is below so let's go below
this<00:01:00.809> car<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.320> check<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> out

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.450 

so<00:01:08.750> here<00:01:08.930> we<00:01:09.050> are<00:01:09.080> underneath<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.770> vehicle

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
so here we are underneath the vehicle

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.700 
so here we are underneath the vehicle
you<00:01:11.150> can<00:01:11.240> see<00:01:11.360> that<00:01:11.660> drain<00:01:12.140> plug<00:01:12.290> right<00:01:12.590> up

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
you can see that drain plug right up

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.910 
you can see that drain plug right up
there<00:01:12.950> or<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.490> check<00:01:13.700> plug<00:01:16.720> right<00:01:17.720> there<00:01:18.080> it's

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
there or the check plug right there it's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.710 
there or the check plug right there it's
a<00:01:18.980> 17<00:01:19.460> millimeter<00:01:19.880> plug<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.450> want<00:01:20.630> to

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
a 17 millimeter plug and you want to

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.570 
a 17 millimeter plug and you want to
make<00:01:20.840> sure<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.140> take<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.470> out<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.920> check

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
make sure you take that out and check

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.010 
make sure you take that out and check
out<00:01:22.700> maybe<00:01:22.850> with<00:01:23.060> your<00:01:23.240> pinky<00:01:23.600> or<00:01:23.690> something

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
out maybe with your pinky or something

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.800 
out maybe with your pinky or something
just<00:01:24.320> reach<00:01:24.560> in<00:01:24.740> there<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.420> basically<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:26.750> you

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
just reach in there and basically if you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.200 
just reach in there and basically if you
could<00:01:26.930> touch<00:01:27.110> fluid<00:01:27.530> it's<00:01:27.680> good<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.940> should<00:01:29.120> be

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
could touch fluid it's good it should be

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.770 
could touch fluid it's good it should be
right<00:01:29.330> at<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.600> bottom<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.080> hole<00:01:31.780> right

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
right at the bottom of the hole right

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.180 
right at the bottom of the hole right
there's<00:01:33.050> an<00:01:33.229> Allen<00:01:33.620> head<00:01:34.360> drain<00:01:35.360> plug<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:37.070> on

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
there's an Allen head drain plug and on

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.310 
there's an Allen head drain plug and on
this<00:01:37.280> particular<00:01:37.460> vehicle<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.630> pulled<00:01:39.229> the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
this particular vehicle I pulled the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.260 
this particular vehicle I pulled the
plug<00:01:39.440> out<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:39.920> did<00:01:40.100> not<00:01:40.280> feel<00:01:40.520> any<00:01:40.700> fluid<00:01:41.119> so

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
plug out and I did not feel any fluid so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.090 
plug out and I did not feel any fluid so
I've<00:01:41.390> added<00:01:41.660> some<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.259> I<00:01:42.350> ended<00:01:42.560> up<00:01:42.680> adding

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
I've added some and I ended up adding

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.730 
I've added some and I ended up adding
about<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.670> quart<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.210> half<00:01:44.590> right<00:01:45.590> around

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
about a quart and a half right around

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.590 
about a quart and a half right around
there<00:01:45.950> that's<00:01:46.130> pretty<00:01:46.310> close<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
there that's pretty close to the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.620 
there that's pretty close to the
capacity<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:48.700> not<00:01:49.700> sure<00:01:49.910> what<00:01:50.030> happened<00:01:50.450> I

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
capacity so not sure what happened I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.630 
capacity so not sure what happened I
think<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.470> maybe<00:01:51.619> someone<00:01:52.040> took<00:01:52.160> this<00:01:52.310> drain

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
think that maybe someone took this drain

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.100 
think that maybe someone took this drain
plug<00:01:52.910> I'll<00:01:53.119> think<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.509> they're<00:01:53.690> draining<00:01:54.020> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
plug I'll think and they're draining the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.200 
plug I'll think and they're draining the
transmission<00:01:54.680> although<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.250> can't<00:01:55.490> be<00:01:55.580> sure<00:01:55.759> it

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
transmission although I can't be sure it

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.590 
transmission although I can't be sure it
has<00:01:56.270> its<00:01:56.540> own<00:01:56.630> drain<00:01:56.930> plug<00:01:57.200> right<00:01:57.380> there<00:01:58.600> so

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
has its own drain plug right there so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020 
has its own drain plug right there so
for<00:01:59.810> some<00:01:59.990> reason<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.530> was<00:02:00.950> empty<00:02:01.369> now<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.910> does

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
for some reason it was empty now it does

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.760 
for some reason it was empty now it does
have<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.210> leak

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.109 

leaking<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.040> seal<00:02:08.310> bond<00:02:08.550> won't<00:02:08.729> expect

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
leaking out that seal bond won't expect

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
leaking out that seal bond won't expect
all<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.750> fluid<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.229> gone<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
all the fluid to be gone out of that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.610 
all the fluid to be gone out of that
hole<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> would<00:02:12.120> expect<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.600> be<00:02:12.780> low<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.410> not

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
hole I would expect it to be low but not

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.660 
hole I would expect it to be low but not
empty<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.980> hope<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.130> helps<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.520> in

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
empty so I hope this helps you in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.010 
empty so I hope this helps you in
checking<00:02:17.970> your<00:02:18.120> transmission<00:02:18.660> fluid<00:02:18.960> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
checking your transmission fluid and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.450 
checking your transmission fluid and
changing<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.590> transmission<00:02:20.070> fluid<00:02:20.220> there

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
changing your transmission fluid there

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.720 
changing your transmission fluid there
is<00:02:20.490> two<00:02:21.000> separate<00:02:21.510> sections<00:02:21.990> for

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
is two separate sections for
