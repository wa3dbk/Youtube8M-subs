00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and so I'm trying to stay away from the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.699 
and so I'm trying to stay away from the
building<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.690> my<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:10.020> here<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.530> front

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
building to my right here and in front

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.550 
building to my right here and in front
of<00:02:10.890> me

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
of me

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.809 
of me
because<00:02:11.739> they're<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.010> spawning<00:02:12.370> around

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
because they're all spawning around

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.729 
because they're all spawning around
there<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.630> sort<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.959> jump<00:02:14.200> on<00:02:14.319> top<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.620> these

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.449 
there so I sort of jump on top of these
rocks<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.430> get<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> good<00:02:16.120> view<00:02:16.330> point<00:02:17.459> giving
