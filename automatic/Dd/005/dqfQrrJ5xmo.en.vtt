whenever it starts working and you know
I'm<00:05:49.550> first<00:05:50.480> impressions<00:05:51.080> I<00:05:51.320> give<00:05:51.590> it<00:05:51.710> a<00:05:51.740> head<00:05:51.920> I

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
I'm first impressions I give it a head I

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.800 
I'm first impressions I give it a head I
you<00:05:52.160> know<00:05:52.250> a<00:05:52.340> thumbs<00:05:52.640> up<00:05:52.820> like<00:05:53.000> a<00:05:53.030> total<00:05:53.510> thumbs

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810

you know a thumbs up like a total thumbs
up<00:05:54.790> more<00:05:55.790> than<00:05:55.940> I<00:05:56.180> guess<00:05:56.630> I<00:05:56.810> would<00:05:56.960> have<00:05:56.990> to

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
up more than I guess I would have to

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.680 
up more than I guess I would have to
give<00:05:57.410> it<00:05:57.500> like<00:05:57.590> an<00:05:57.710> 8<00:05:57.890> out<00:05:58.010> of<00:05:58.040> 10<00:05:58.340> because<00:05:59.240> I

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
give it like an 8 out of 10 because I

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.170 
give it like an 8 out of 10 because I
guess<00:06:00.350> it's<00:06:00.620> not<00:06:00.860> really<00:06:00.920> original<00:06:01.820> in<00:06:02.030> like

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
guess it's not really original in like

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.840 
guess it's not really original in like
anyway<00:06:02.690> they<00:06:03.560> didn't<00:06:03.800> really<00:06:04.010> make<00:06:04.460> a<00:06:04.520> new
