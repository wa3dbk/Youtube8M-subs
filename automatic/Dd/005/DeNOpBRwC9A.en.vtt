00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
gods because I don't see any convincing

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.109 
gods because I don't see any convincing
reason<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.929> believe<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:30.490> makes<00:00:30.789> me<00:00:30.999> an

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
reason to believe this makes me an

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.260 
reason to believe this makes me an
atheist<00:00:31.950> however<00:00:32.950> I<00:00:33.039> recognize<00:00:33.820> we<00:00:34.090> don't

know<00:00:34.450> for<00:00:34.629> sure<00:00:34.690> if<00:00:35.230> there<00:00:35.800> are<00:00:36.010> actually<00:00:36.640> into

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
know for sure if there are actually into

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.290 
know for sure if there are actually into
gods<00:00:37.030> I<00:00:37.329> admit<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.170> there<00:00:38.320> could<00:00:38.559> be<00:00:38.590> cuts

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
gods I admit that there could be cuts

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
reasonable moral position to take in it

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.380

I've had it for over a year and it's
never<00:06:01.120> said<00:06:01.389> anything<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:01.840> no<00:06:02.080> so<00:06:02.889> anyway<00:06:03.310> God

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
knows I have this and he can change that

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.390 
knows I have this and he can change that
dial<00:06:08.080> to<00:06:08.289> guess<00:06:08.500> it's<00:06:08.740> in<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.949> little<00:06:09.159> sealed

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
dial to guess it's in a little sealed

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.600 
dial to guess it's in a little sealed
container<00:06:09.849> but<00:06:10.090> that<00:06:10.240> shouldn't<00:06:10.510> stop<00:06:10.659> God<00:06:11.610> so

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
container but that shouldn't stop God so

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.680 
container but that shouldn't stop God so
I'm<00:06:12.760> going<00:06:12.909> to<00:06:12.940> have<00:06:13.090> that<00:06:13.240> locked<00:06:13.539> away

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
I'm going to have that locked away

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.210 
I'm going to have that locked away
somewhere<00:06:13.840> where<00:06:14.409> only<00:06:14.530> I<00:06:14.590> know<00:06:14.770> where<00:06:14.919> it<00:06:15.070> is

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
somewhere where only I know where it is

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.659 
somewhere where only I know where it is
and<00:06:15.430> if<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.750> dial<00:06:16.960> spins<00:06:17.349> to<00:06:17.530> yes<00:06:17.740> that<00:06:18.550> would

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
and if the dial spins to yes that would

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.560 
and if the dial spins to yes that would
be<00:06:18.729> pretty<00:06:18.970> significant<00:06:19.570> to<00:06:19.720> me<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:21.400> also<00:06:22.120> God

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
be pretty significant to me and also God

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
be pretty significant to me and also God
will<00:06:22.840> know<00:06:23.610> what's<00:06:24.610> convincing

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
will know what's convincing

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.240 
will know what's convincing
to<00:06:25.710> me<00:06:26.780> regardless<00:06:27.780> I<00:06:27.990> mean<00:06:28.260> he's<00:06:28.470> God<00:06:28.770> there

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
to me regardless I mean he's God there

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.470 
to me regardless I mean he's God there
is<00:06:29.400> a<00:06:29.430> god<00:06:29.700> he<00:06:29.880> would<00:06:30.060> know<00:06:30.210> what<00:06:30.390> would

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
is a god he would know what would

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.940 
is a god he would know what would
convince<00:06:30.570> me<00:06:30.900> so<00:06:31.080> I<00:06:31.110> don't<00:06:31.320> necessarily<00:06:31.800> have

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
convince me so I don't necessarily have

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.230 
convince me so I don't necessarily have
to<00:06:32.010> ask<00:06:32.280> for<00:06:32.490> anything<00:06:32.640> specifically

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
to ask for anything specifically

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.270 
to ask for anything specifically
convincing<00:06:34.790> he<00:06:35.790> can<00:06:35.910> just<00:06:36.060> change<00:06:36.420> my<00:06:36.540> beliefs

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
convincing he can just change my beliefs

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.790 
convincing he can just change my beliefs
so<00:06:38.280> that's<00:06:38.850> it<00:06:40.760> I'm<00:06:41.760> mystery<00:06:42.180> box<00:06:42.390> and<00:06:42.800> I'm

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
so that's it I'm mystery box and I'm

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:52.520 
so that's it I'm mystery box and I'm
