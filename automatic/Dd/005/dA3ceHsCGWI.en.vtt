00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.160
 there are 3 2014 in hobby dotcom consoles 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.390
 well the first question focuses on 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.400
 The four protagonists can 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.250
 explain what is your background what is 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.259
 its origin there is basically a 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.810
 main character and his name is 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.880
 shipowner yen but when you play online 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.070
 with other players each of them 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.680
 has its own personalized version of 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.840
 arno in this way is a single character 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.840
 which is divided between four players 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 tell us a little about the atmosphere of the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.739
 game in paris seemed the evolution 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.809
 logic of the franchise but in what 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969
 You decided to set the game in 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.829
 Paris 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.549
 I think the first decision we made 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.049
 was to place this game in Paris we were 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.479
 wishing to return to an atmosphere 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.699
 European and now with the consoles of 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.969
 new generation we can generate 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.039
 crowds and we can also do a lot 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590
 with hand-to-hand combat so 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.020
 I think Paris is a perfect choice 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.850
 when in the demo we have seen how the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.830
 characters can get inside the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.840
 buildings and there attack others 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.549
 characters is something that had not been done 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 never with such depth the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.880
 franchise to what extent is it deep 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.880
 that new mechanics 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.840
 good about the interiors there are 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.640
 many things you can do with them 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.100
 in principle you can use them 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
 just to move around the city 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.330
 there are also many missions that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.179
 pass entirely within 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.710
 interior stages there are small houses 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.720
 but there are also multi-storey houses 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.760
 we have infiltration missions and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.680
 also great fighting that is unleashed 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.390
 in the interiors so there's no 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.760
 limit for what you can do inside 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.430
 of them we have seen a new weapon that 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.440
 hid arno in your hand you can 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.060
 tell us what new weapons and what 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.360
 new gadgets we will find in the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 game 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 the new weapon you are talking about is called the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.259
 ghost sheet and is integrated within 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.179
 the hidden sheet you can use it to 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.709
 shoot at short distances and not 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.170
 alarm any of the others 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.870
 watchers who are near the second 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.420
 Cool weapon to wear is not a gun 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.850
 of multiple guns that simply 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.200
 overtook his time was designed during 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.959
 the French revolution 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.300
 so finally those times are over 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.300
 load 6 seconds now recharges 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.550
 quickly reloads you shoot and go back 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.500
 to load we also have a series of 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.019
 tools that will help to ar not like 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.610
 a smoke bomb that we can use 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.740
 to hide when we have 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.960
 discovered 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.820
 can you give us a clue about the 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.890
 historical characters that we will see in the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.630
 I can not tell you anything about that game 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.220
 this moment but be careful because 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.530
 in our next event we will talk 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.330
 of those historical characters this time 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.460
 it was just about showing the game 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.490
 can you tell us how many years 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.500
 the story of the 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.110
 I can not tell you anything either 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.690
 about that but I can assure you that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.790
 begins at the same time that the 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.160
 French revolution and that the game was 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.020
 will extend enough we will see some 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.840
 part set at present in the 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.550
 game that we will also show in 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.280
 the next presentation so 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.080
 you'll have to wait to talk about the engine 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.270
 graphic has certainly taken the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.890
 franchise to a new level but during 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.490
 how long have you been working 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.050
 to create it 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.210
 we have been developing this game 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.820
 with a new engine for four 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.800
 years the concept arose after 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.170
 assassin's believe the brotherhood yo 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.700
 I have personally been in the project 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.470
 for three years that was when 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.050
 we started using this new engine 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.050
 so I would say four years 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.510
 we have seen a lot of characters 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.640
 side by moving at the same time in the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.530
 game could you tell us how many 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.590
 secondary characters we can see the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.049
 many characters appear on the screen 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.150
 at the same time I could not tell you exactly 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.930
 the number from the top on 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.120
 another age you see approximately 400 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.829
 no playable characters and after 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.500
 the last sequence just before 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.709
 eliminate captain javier there are almost 2000 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.079
 people so it's an exaggerated number 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.180
 in the demo we have seen a lot of 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.460
 secondary missions splashing the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.289
 starting you can tell us in what 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.699
 will consist we will find some 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.090
 new mechanics in those missions 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.090
 high schools 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.259
 there are new mechanics within the 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.300
 development itself although 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.759
 we wanted to keep the pillars of the 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.590
 saga although there are missions that 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.660
 will focus more on one pillar than on another 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.120
 for example there are missions that ask the 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.580
 player that focuses on stealth 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.520
 while others will be focused on 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.729
 the fight and the fight for your life 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.199
 and people have criticized the 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.360
 artificial intelligence of the enemies 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.889
 in previous games as you are working 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.889
 to improve that aspect 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.100
 well I could not tell if it 's a problem 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.710
 of artificial intelligence or that 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.110
 it's just too easy to kill in 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.850
 those previous games but right now 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.250
 we are working on intelligence in 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.840
 that the enemies are much more attentive 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.810
 and you can discover more 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.480
 easily they can talk to each other and 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.320
 now it's a little harder to finish 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.090
 they 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.190
 so if you find that a mission is 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.350
 too hard for you can you try 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.350
 to overcome it helped by several friends
