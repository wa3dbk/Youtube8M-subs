00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.759 

Dan<00:00:30.179> once<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.810> plugged<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.230> we'll<00:00:31.410> turn<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
Dan once it's plugged in we'll turn it

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.459
