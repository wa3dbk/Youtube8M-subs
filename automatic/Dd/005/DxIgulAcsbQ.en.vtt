now as you can see again it's quite
large<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.170> range<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.830> still<00:01:46.009> short<00:01:46.250> but

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
large but the range is still short but

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.550 
large but the range is still short but
because<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:46.909> its<00:01:47.150> size<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.689> can<00:01:47.720> lead<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.080> sweet

and<00:02:55.900> then<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.920> course<00:02:57.190> there's<00:02:57.460> a<00:02:57.550> reload<00:02:57.910> time

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
and then of course there's a reload time

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.450 
and then of course there's a reload time
to<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.630> sawed-off<00:02:58.840> shotgun<00:02:59.470> with<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.220> sod

to the sawed-off shotgun with the sod

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.280 
to the sawed-off shotgun with the sod
off<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.880> get<00:03:01.060> one<00:03:01.300> shot<00:03:01.330> before<00:03:01.780> having<00:03:02.200> to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
off you get one shot before having to

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.710 
off you get one shot before having to
reload<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.830> the<00:03:03.100> reload<00:03:03.400> time<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.820> long<00:03:04.150> even

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
reload in the reload time is long even

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.380 
reload in the reload time is long even
with<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:04.930> perfect<00:03:05.410> act<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.650> reload<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.910> natural

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
with a perfect act of reload the natural

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.910 
with a perfect act of reload the natural
on<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.540> other<00:03:07.660> hand<00:03:07.900> gets<00:03:08.320> eight<00:03:08.590> shots

before having to reload and the reload

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.340 
before having to reload and the reload
is<00:03:10.960> quick<00:03:11.440> easy<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.250> hard<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.940> miss<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:14.230> we

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
is quick easy and hard to miss if we

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.290 
is quick easy and hard to miss if we
take<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.530> look<00:03:14.770> at<00:03:14.860> them<00:03:14.950> side<00:03:15.130> by<00:03:15.160> side<00:03:15.340> you'll

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
take a look at them side by side you'll

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.610 
take a look at them side by side you'll
see<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.570> in<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.780> time<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.080> takes<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.320> salt

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
see that in the time it takes the salt

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.680 
see that in the time it takes the salt
off<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:18.010> go<00:03:18.100> through<00:03:18.310> four<00:03:18.580> shots<00:03:18.880> with<00:03:19.480> all
