00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
wood handle on it fit and finishes I was

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.559 
wood handle on it fit and finishes I was
concerned<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:43.950> very<00:02:44.159> good<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.519> these<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
concerned I was very good on these so I

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.970 
concerned I was very good on these so I
wouldn't<00:02:45.959> be<00:02:46.019> concerned<00:02:46.409> about<00:02:46.500> fit<00:02:46.860> and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
wouldn't be concerned about fit and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.630 
wouldn't be concerned about fit and
finish<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:48.329> where<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:50.010> wood<00:02:50.160> hits<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
finish and in where the wood hits the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640 
finish and in where the wood hits the
frame<00:02:50.910> very<00:02:51.840> well<00:02:52.079> done

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
frame very well done

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.490 
frame very well done
no<00:02:53.459> markings<00:02:54.000> no<00:02:54.239> machine<00:02:54.599> markings<00:02:55.109> on<00:02:55.319> them

no markings no machine markings on them

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.930 
no markings no machine markings on them
so<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.069> was<00:02:56.220> well<00:02:56.430> done

so that it was well done

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.039 
so that it was well done
so<00:02:57.840> I've<00:02:58.440> shot<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> lot<00:02:59.720> probably<00:03:00.720> put

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
so I've shot this one a lot probably put

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.400 
so I've shot this one a lot probably put
500<00:03:01.650> rounds<00:03:01.799> through<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.220> or<00:03:02.489> more<00:03:03.410> very

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
500 rounds through it or more very

accurate very accurate especially 710

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.860 
accurate very accurate especially 710
yards<00:03:07.609> we<00:03:08.609> have<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> target<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.269> there<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.750> think

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
yards we have a target up there I think

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.170 
yards we have a target up there I think
we<00:03:10.019> just<00:03:10.260> measured<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.040> about<00:03:11.220> 13<00:03:12.150> or

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
we just measured it and it's about 13 or

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.559 
we just measured it and it's about 13 or
so<00:03:12.599> 12<00:03:13.049> 13<00:03:13.470> 14<00:03:13.680> yards<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:15.090> we're<00:03:15.209> gonna<00:03:15.329> put

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
so 12 13 14 yards so we're gonna put

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.120 
so 12 13 14 yards so we're gonna put
five<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.430> go<00:03:17.430> ahead<00:03:17.609> fire<00:03:17.879> away<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.200> come

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130

I<00:04:30.660> said<00:04:30.720> fairly<00:04:31.410> at<00:04:31.530> fairly<00:04:31.919> accurate<00:04:32.310> so

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
I said fairly at fairly accurate so

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.990 
I said fairly at fairly accurate so
let's<00:04:33.510> go<00:04:33.690> ahead<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.900> load<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.080> up<00:04:34.940> go<00:04:35.940> ahead

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
let's go ahead and load it up go ahead

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.260 
let's go ahead and load it up go ahead
and<00:04:36.180> open<00:04:36.720> our<00:04:37.440> gate<00:04:39.470> drop<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.500> cartridge<00:04:40.949> in

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
and open our gate drop a cartridge in

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:52.939 
and open our gate drop a cartridge in
skip<00:04:42.270> one<00:04:45.650> load<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.680> rest<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:52.620> again<00:04:52.830> I'm

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
skip one load the rest and again I'm

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.300 
skip one load the rest and again I'm
reloading<00:04:53.160> five<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.910> here

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
reloading five on here

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.870 
reloading five on here
close<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.520> gate<00:04:56.870> timer<00:04:57.870> back<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.650> down<00:04:59.160> and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
close the gate timer back and down and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.480 
close the gate timer back and down and
right<00:05:00.120> now<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.720> sitting<00:05:01.020> on<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.490> empty

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
right now it's sitting on a empty

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.550 
right now it's sitting on a empty
cartridge<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.330> there<00:05:03.510> is<00:05:03.630> no<00:05:03.840> cartridge<00:05:04.289> in

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
cartridge so there is no cartridge in

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.520 
cartridge so there is no cartridge in
there<00:05:04.740> right<00:05:04.919> now<00:05:04.979> so<00:05:05.880> for<00:05:06.539> some<00:05:06.720> reason<00:05:06.750> if

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
there right now so for some reason if

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.980 
there right now so for some reason if
the<00:05:08.160> hammer<00:05:08.370> was<00:05:08.610> bumped<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.510> again<00:05:09.780> this<00:05:09.930> has

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
the hammer was bumped and again this has

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.200 
the hammer was bumped and again this has
got<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.380> transfer<00:05:10.860> bar<00:05:11.520> in<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.030> doesn't

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
got the transfer bar in and it doesn't

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.719 
got the transfer bar in and it doesn't
have<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.449> pin<00:05:12.780> like<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.139> old<00:05:13.260> Colts<00:05:14.070> it's<00:05:14.550> got

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
have the pin like the old Colts it's got

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.580 
have the pin like the old Colts it's got
the<00:05:14.850> transfer<00:05:15.210> bar<00:05:15.570> so<00:05:16.110> nothing's<00:05:16.440> really

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
the transfer bar so nothing's really

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.140 
the transfer bar so nothing's really
gonna<00:05:16.770> happen<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.280> it<00:05:17.400> anyway<00:05:17.669> it's<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:17.940> safe

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
gonna happen to it anyway it's a safe

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.080 
gonna happen to it anyway it's a safe
gun<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.539> carry<00:05:18.750> six<00:05:19.110> in<00:05:19.320> but<00:05:19.979> we<00:05:20.370> still<00:05:20.580> still

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
gun to carry six in but we still still

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.020 
gun to carry six in but we still still
do<00:05:21.270> five<00:05:21.570> just<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.229> be<00:05:22.350> extra<00:05:22.889> safe<00:05:23.070> but<00:05:23.820> right

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
do five just to be extra safe but right

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.360 
do five just to be extra safe but right
now<00:05:24.210> as<00:05:24.720> I'm<00:05:25.199> not<00:05:25.350> sure<00:05:25.590> if<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.800> can<00:05:25.949> see<00:05:26.130> but

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
now as I'm not sure if you can see but

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.879 
now as I'm not sure if you can see but
that<00:05:26.430> there<00:05:26.699> is<00:05:26.820> no<00:05:27.000> cartridge<00:05:27.419> in<00:05:28.199> there<00:05:28.530> down

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
that there is no cartridge in there down

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.219 
that there is no cartridge in there down
the<00:05:29.070> muzzle<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:30.120> but<00:05:30.449> when<00:05:30.570> I<00:05:30.600> cock<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.199> hammer

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
the muzzle so but when I cock the hammer

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:59.290 
the muzzle so but when I cock the hammer
back<00:05:31.680> we'll<00:05:32.490> be<00:05:32.520> ready<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:33.000> go

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.900 

so<00:06:00.620> as<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:01.740> can<00:06:01.830> probably<00:06:01.890> see<00:06:02.220> not<00:06:02.580> too<00:06:02.730> much

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
so as you can probably see not too much

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:24.050 
so as you can probably see not too much

kick off of it later let me go just take
a<00:06:24.120> second<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:24.780> I'll<00:06:25.650> show<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:25.860> that
