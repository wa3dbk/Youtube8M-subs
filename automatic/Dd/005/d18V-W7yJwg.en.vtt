00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.900
 good terms found our channel 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.400
 of youtube this part started for 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.890
 record the third week of the challenge of 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780
 I agree with that since a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.019
 little bit more but hey, be encouraged 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.239
 because he agrees today we 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.590
 focus basically on the train has 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.630
 suffered many doubts about the weather 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.230
 people what we do and how we 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.050
 we organize we will focus on him 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.789
 there were many questions of how we can 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.310
 really take a workout so 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.829
 intensive 90 minutes we are going to 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.500
 specify that we do not say that 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.239
 when we say that it is more than two 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.760
 super series and in between makes a 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.860
 exercise that john a lot of blood like 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.420
 it can be some extreme tests not 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.550
 we say that to consumption with half a ton 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.350
 and that you have said before that it is of 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.930
 with 200 kilos and budget with four 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.760
 stores not just an uncle that 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.129
 we can see a lot of weight and that has 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.320
 moved very much weight goes down a lot and 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.660
 as the training progresses each time in 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.940
 resistance that is logical what defines 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.859
 is that we do as a result of the coming 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.210
 I think bodybuilder blender a 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.940
 trainer to learn fat 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.130
 to congest me I used to make circuits of 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.140
 60 to 90 minutes which has 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.340
 worked an exercise of the superior of 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.570
 the lower and so it rotates with the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.390
 material that we have now we have 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.470
 adapted that type of training to the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.759
 we consider then 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.759
 I considered well 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.930
 and the more than 130 or make us 220 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 kilos a guy who has a record of spain 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.189
 above 250 that is to say happening 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.039
 many weights were for example 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:41.090
 they were lending strong weight in the 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:44.840
 breast and then for example 1,600 ago 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.380
 kilos last with 120 130 inmates of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.750
 leg we have arrived from the sprint 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.130
 between the windows recently the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.990
 press lookout of the experiences 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.509
 as the mind of the weeks advances 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.579
 every time it loses intensity and 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.380
 perfect strength because it is losing 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.450
 fat and so that it is not potable has been 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.369
 clarified the issue is that we say 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.530
 the kind of what we do is like that 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.420
 evidently that eagerness pulling and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.720
 As the weeks progress each 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.610
 time is more loose agreeing this 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.190
 of the training 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.520
 now let's move on despite having heard this 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.520
 week 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.640
 very well 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.110
 and pay 292 with which one is fast 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.600
 loss of 2 kilos 200 with respect to 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.710
 next day the truth that the thing fits 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.080
 in which we had prepared 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.360
 today we are talking about training 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.160
 the subject see doing the same more or 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.200
 less equal we have united with the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.840
 proteins we have lowered the hydrates by 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.850
 that he is getting worse and more tired 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.120
 that we admit that's why these trainings 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.580
 every time it costs more but it is still the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.930
 Evolution is what we thought we 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.630
 all the kilos invested now by 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.430
 week until week 8 which is 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.250
 it removes the one that we will have 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.630
 how has the matter been agreed this 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.160
 patient I have already explained in the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.000
 science is planning has gotten 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.070
 equal and good two kilos 200 less and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.150
 head 2 closer to the kingdom but that you 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.150
 have liked, we will continue working
