00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
good deal of the film it seemed to me

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.570 
good deal of the film it seemed to me
that<00:04:13.030> Tatum<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:14.080> woke<00:04:14.260> up<00:04:14.350> from<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.680> nap<00:04:14.830> or<00:04:15.519> a

you know like almost as if he was out of
his<00:04:21.970> league<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.479> he<00:04:22.570> was<00:04:22.690> just<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:23.440> know

his league and he was just you know
following<00:04:23.979> Jonah<00:04:24.250> Hill<00:04:24.460> around<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:25.030> trying

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
following Jonah Hill around and trying

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.090 
following Jonah Hill around and trying
to<00:04:25.330> keep<00:04:25.479> up<00:04:25.600> as<00:04:25.750> best<00:04:25.780> he<00:04:26.080> could<00:04:26.350> he<00:04:26.919> just

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
to keep up as best he could he just

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.670 
to keep up as best he could he just
didn't<00:04:27.400> seem<00:04:27.490> as<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:28.210> know<00:04:28.470> connected<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
didn't seem as you know connected to the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.560 
didn't seem as you know connected to the
material<00:04:30.100> as<00:04:30.190> he<00:04:30.310> did<00:04:30.430> in<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.610> first<00:04:30.850> film<00:04:31.120> so

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
material as he did in the first film so

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.270 
material as he did in the first film so
it's<00:04:32.140> not<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.410> repeat<00:04:32.890> of<00:04:32.950> his<00:04:33.070> first

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
it's not a repeat of his first

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.040 
it's not a repeat of his first
performance<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.880> that<00:04:34.030> that's<00:04:34.479> why<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.750> guess<00:04:34.960> I

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
performance so that that's why I guess I

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.420 
performance so that that's why I guess I
was<00:04:35.200> confused<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.860> was<00:04:36.010> like<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.280> were<00:04:36.400> a

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
was confused I was like you were a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
little more on the ball the first time

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.420 
little more on the ball the first time
around<00:04:37.870> Channing<00:04:38.290> Tatum<00:04:38.590> I'm<00:04:38.950> not<00:04:39.190> quite<00:04:39.400> sure

might recall I often accused Harrison

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.370 
might recall I often accused Harrison
Ford<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.330> seeming<00:04:43.630> like<00:04:43.750> he<00:04:43.870> just<00:04:44.080> woke<00:04:44.200> up

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
but he is a good deal older than

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.440 
but he is a good deal older than
Channing<00:04:46.950> Tatum<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.400> what's<00:04:47.550> Tatum's<00:04:47.970> excuse

level<00:05:08.130> this<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.640> classic<00:05:09.120> Jonah<00:05:09.330> Hill<00:05:09.540> it's

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
level this is classic Jonah Hill it's

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.210 
level this is classic Jonah Hill it's
why<00:05:09.870> he's<00:05:10.050> successful<00:05:10.590> in<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.770> first<00:05:10.920> place

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
why he's successful in the first place

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.980 
why he's successful in the first place
why<00:05:11.430> audiences<00:05:11.910> love<00:05:12.120> him<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.810> thought<00:05:12.900> it

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
why audiences love him and I thought it

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.470 
why audiences love him and I thought it
was<00:05:13.110> very<00:05:13.470> good<00:05:14.100> here<00:05:14.400> he<00:05:14.790> was<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.030> little<00:05:15.360> bit

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
was very good here he was a little bit

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.420 
was very good here he was a little bit
more<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.840> straight<00:05:16.110> man<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.350> guess<00:05:16.650> well

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
more of the straight man I guess well

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.590 
more of the straight man I guess well
I'm<00:05:17.640> not<00:05:17.760> sure<00:05:18.030> I'm<00:05:18.180> not<00:05:18.210> sure<00:05:18.330> who<00:05:18.540> the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
I'm not sure I'm not sure who the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.420 
I'm not sure I'm not sure who the
straight<00:05:18.900> man<00:05:19.020> is<00:05:19.200> in<00:05:19.350> this<00:05:19.470> you<00:05:19.890> know<00:05:20.010> usually

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
straight man is in this you know usually

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.220 
straight man is in this you know usually
there's<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.670> straight<00:05:20.910> man<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.360> funny<00:05:21.600> guy<00:05:21.780> I

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
there's a straight man and a funny guy I

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.740 
there's a straight man and a funny guy I
think<00:05:22.860> they<00:05:23.070> both<00:05:23.280> take<00:05:23.610> turns<00:05:23.880> between<00:05:24.120> Hill

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
think they both take turns between Hill

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.420 
think they both take turns between Hill
and<00:05:24.930> Tatum<00:05:25.140> but<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.380> guess<00:05:25.560> what<00:05:26.010> I'm<00:05:26.130> thinking

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
and Tatum but I guess what I'm thinking

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.680 
and Tatum but I guess what I'm thinking
is<00:05:26.550> he<00:05:26.730> was<00:05:26.880> a<00:05:26.910> little<00:05:27.030> Johnny<00:05:27.390> who<00:05:27.510> was<00:05:27.630> a

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
is he was a little Johnny who was a

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.210 
is he was a little Johnny who was a
little<00:05:27.900> more<00:05:28.020> funnier<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.590> me<00:05:28.710> at<00:05:28.830> least<00:05:29.010> and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
little more funnier to me at least and

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.860 
little more funnier to me at least and
this<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.670> end<00:05:29.790> but<00:05:30.030> he<00:05:30.120> was<00:05:30.150> very<00:05:30.570> good

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
this is the end but he was very good

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.930 
this is the end but he was very good
here<00:05:31.080> one<00:05:32.040> thing<00:05:32.220> that<00:05:32.370> kind<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.550> took<00:05:32.730> me<00:05:32.850> out

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
here one thing that kind of took me out

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.730 
here one thing that kind of took me out
of<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.120> movie<00:05:33.270> though<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.720> as<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.320> mentioned<00:05:34.350> in

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
of the movie though is as I mentioned in

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.590 
of the movie though is as I mentioned in
the<00:05:34.800> opening<00:05:35.190> he<00:05:35.700> recently<00:05:36.060> got<00:05:36.360> in<00:05:36.480> trouble

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
the opening he recently got in trouble

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.350 
the opening he recently got in trouble
for<00:05:36.780> using<00:05:37.140> a<00:05:37.200> homophobic<00:05:37.770> slur<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.370> quite<00:05:39.330> a

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
for using a homophobic slur and quite a

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.060 
for using a homophobic slur and quite a
big<00:05:39.570> deal<00:05:39.750> is<00:05:39.900> made<00:05:40.050> about<00:05:40.260> homophobic<00:05:40.800> slurs

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
big deal is made about homophobic slurs

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.310 
big deal is made about homophobic slurs
in<00:05:41.370> this<00:05:41.940> movie<00:05:42.330> there's<00:05:42.540> two<00:05:42.810> sequences

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
in this movie there's two sequences

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.630 
in this movie there's two sequences
where<00:05:43.560> they<00:05:43.620> really<00:05:43.860> drive<00:05:44.190> home<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.610> point

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
where they really drive home the point

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.150 
where they really drive home the point
that<00:05:45.000> it's<00:05:45.420> wrong<00:05:45.780> and<00:05:46.560> so<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.770> fact<00:05:47.040> that

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
that it's wrong and so the fact that

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.950 
that it's wrong and so the fact that
Jonah<00:05:47.430> Hill<00:05:47.610> would<00:05:47.820> do<00:05:48.030> it<00:05:48.120> in<00:05:48.240> real<00:05:48.480> life<00:05:48.510> so

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
Jonah Hill would do it in real life so

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.260 
Jonah Hill would do it in real life so
soon<00:05:49.140> after<00:05:49.290> making<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:50.100> film<00:05:50.280> either<00:05:51.030> makes

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
soon after making the film either makes

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.820 
soon after making the film either makes
me<00:05:51.450> think<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.020> it<00:05:52.140> was<00:05:52.290> just<00:05:52.320> all<00:05:52.770> a

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
me think that it was just all a

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.500 
me think that it was just all a
publicity<00:05:53.130> stunt<00:05:53.550> for<00:05:54.000> this<00:05:54.120> film<00:05:54.360> which

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
publicity stunt for this film which

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.330 
publicity stunt for this film which
seems<00:05:54.750> that<00:05:54.900> poor<00:05:55.380> taste<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:55.950> poorly

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
seems that poor taste and poorly

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.240 
seems that poor taste and poorly
calculated<00:05:57.090> or<00:05:57.870> maybe<00:05:58.350> he<00:05:58.590> doesn't<00:05:59.130> really

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
calculated or maybe he doesn't really

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.100 
calculated or maybe he doesn't really
believe<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.000> sentiment<00:06:00.510> behind<00:06:00.600> what<00:06:00.990> was

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
believe the sentiment behind what was

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.300 
believe the sentiment behind what was
said<00:06:01.230> in<00:06:01.350> the<00:06:01.440> movie<00:06:01.560> and<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:01.860> was<00:06:01.920> just<00:06:02.190> in

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
said in the movie and it was just in

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.160 
said in the movie and it was just in
there<00:06:02.430> to<00:06:02.550> try<00:06:02.730> and<00:06:02.850> be<00:06:02.940> funny<00:06:03.120> which<00:06:03.450> isn't<00:06:03.870> a

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
there to try and be funny which isn't a

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.990 
there to try and be funny which isn't a
little<00:06:04.350> bit<00:06:04.590> of<00:06:04.680> poor<00:06:05.310> taste<00:06:05.610> because

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
little bit of poor taste because

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.910 
little bit of poor taste because
obviously<00:06:06.210> that<00:06:06.930> language<00:06:07.260> is<00:06:07.470> hurtful<00:06:07.770> and

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
obviously that language is hurtful and

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.820 
obviously that language is hurtful and
you<00:06:08.370> know<00:06:08.490> is<00:06:08.700> a<00:06:08.730> problem<00:06:09.200> you<00:06:10.200> know<00:06:10.320> in

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
you know is a problem you know in

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.340 
you know is a problem you know in
society<00:06:11.070> so<00:06:11.790> I<00:06:12.030> was<00:06:12.360> just<00:06:12.420> weird<00:06:12.750> to<00:06:12.960> me<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.170> see

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
society so I was just weird to me to see

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.530 
society so I was just weird to me to see
it<00:06:13.560> referenced<00:06:14.100> in<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:14.280> movie<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:14.700> when<00:06:15.420> it

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
it referenced in the movie and when it

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.180 
it referenced in the movie and when it
must<00:06:16.050> have<00:06:16.200> been<00:06:16.290> accidental<00:06:16.920> because<00:06:17.040> I

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
must have been accidental because I

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.530 
must have been accidental because I
don't<00:06:17.430> think<00:06:17.490> they<00:06:17.760> would<00:06:17.910> reshoot<00:06:18.300> those

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
don't think they would reshoot those

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.390 
don't think they would reshoot those
scenes<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:19.560> quickly<00:06:19.860> because<00:06:20.100> this<00:06:20.220> stuff

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
scenes so quickly because this stuff

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.450 
scenes so quickly because this stuff
with<00:06:20.520> hell<00:06:20.700> I<00:06:20.970> like<00:06:21.270> just<00:06:21.600> happened<00:06:22.530> so<00:06:23.070> the

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
with hell I like just happened so the

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.550 
with hell I like just happened so the

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
stuff you know it's it's a good matinee

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.250 
stuff you know it's it's a good matinee
I<00:06:29.790> think<00:06:30.240> I<00:06:30.390> mean<00:06:30.540> it's<00:06:30.660> that<00:06:30.720> kind<00:06:31.020> of<00:06:31.080> like<00:06:31.230> a

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
I think I mean it's that kind of like a

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.170 
I think I mean it's that kind of like a
pleasant<00:06:31.620> experience<00:06:31.950> to<00:06:32.490> go<00:06:32.580> and<00:06:32.730> watch<00:06:32.850> and

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
pleasant experience to go and watch and

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.640

lot to do it's not like they're not
doing<00:06:50.400> as<00:06:50.520> much<00:06:50.640> as<00:06:50.820> they<00:06:50.910> can<00:06:51.030> with<00:06:51.090> their

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
doing as much as they can with their

doing as much as they can with their

material they just don't have a lot of

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.850 
material they just don't have a lot of
material<00:06:53.820> and<00:06:54.510> as<00:06:54.630> for<00:06:54.930> Channing<00:06:55.470> Tatum<00:06:55.770> and

able<00:06:56.900> to<00:06:56.930> really<00:06:57.260> just<00:06:57.500> get<00:06:57.890> away<00:06:58.100> with

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
able to really just get away with

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.940 
able to really just get away with
anything<00:06:59.180> I<00:06:59.210> think<00:06:59.990> that<00:07:00.200> to<00:07:00.350> just<00:07:00.560> rely<00:07:00.920> on

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
anything I think that to just rely on

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.340 
anything I think that to just rely on
that<00:07:01.220> is<00:07:01.670> sloppy<00:07:02.090> filmmaking<00:07:02.690> and<00:07:02.930> this<00:07:03.080> film

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
that is sloppy filmmaking and this film

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.740 
that is sloppy filmmaking and this film
is<00:07:03.530> a<00:07:03.830> little<00:07:04.310> guilty<00:07:04.760> of<00:07:04.880> that<00:07:05.060> but<00:07:05.480> I<00:07:05.510> think

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
is a little guilty of that but I think

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.960 
is a little guilty of that but I think
the<00:07:05.840> real<00:07:06.110> danger<00:07:06.620> is<00:07:06.650> towards<00:07:07.100> 23<00:07:07.670> Jump

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
the real danger is towards 23 Jump

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.460 
the real danger is towards 23 Jump
Street<00:07:08.210> where<00:07:08.330> I<00:07:08.360> can<00:07:08.540> see<00:07:08.660> the<00:07:08.810> film<00:07:09.020> getting

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
Street where I can see the film getting

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.710 
Street where I can see the film getting
even<00:07:09.860> more<00:07:09.890> reliant<00:07:10.550> I'm<00:07:10.670> just<00:07:10.910> following

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
even more reliant I'm just following

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.330 
even more reliant I'm just following
Jonah<00:07:11.960> Hill<00:07:12.200> and<00:07:12.230> Channing<00:07:12.410> Tatum<00:07:12.710> around<00:07:13.190> and

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum around and

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.790 
Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum around and
watching<00:07:14.090> their<00:07:14.240> hijinks<00:07:14.780> and<00:07:14.900> I<00:07:15.170> think<00:07:15.680> they

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
watching their hijinks and I think they

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.860 
watching their hijinks and I think they
just<00:07:16.190> barely<00:07:16.520> got<00:07:16.760> away<00:07:16.970> with<00:07:17.150> it<00:07:17.270> here<00:07:17.600> and<00:07:17.780> I

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870 
just barely got away with it here and I

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.840 
just barely got away with it here and I
don't<00:07:17.930> know<00:07:18.230> if<00:07:18.380> the<00:07:18.590> film<00:07:18.830> could<00:07:19.040> survive<00:07:19.400> you

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
don't know if the film could survive you

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.250 
don't know if the film could survive you
know<00:07:19.910> the<00:07:20.000> franchise<00:07:20.450> could<00:07:20.660> survive<00:07:20.990> another

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
know the franchise could survive another

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.890 
know the franchise could survive another
entry<00:07:21.770> we're<00:07:22.190> more<00:07:22.790> of<00:07:22.910> an<00:07:23.000> effort<00:07:23.150> isn't<00:07:23.480> made

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
entry we're more of an effort isn't made

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.320 
entry we're more of an effort isn't made
so<00:07:24.560> that's<00:07:24.740> my<00:07:24.980> review<00:07:25.160> of<00:07:25.340> 22<00:07:25.790> Jump<00:07:26.090> Street

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
so that's my review of 22 Jump Street

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.970 
so that's my review of 22 Jump Street
again<00:07:26.810> it<00:07:26.960> might<00:07:27.080> be<00:07:27.140> just<00:07:27.470> because<00:07:27.680> I<00:07:27.740> went<00:07:27.920> in

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
again it might be just because I went in

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.410 
again it might be just because I went in
with<00:07:28.100> such<00:07:28.280> high<00:07:28.460> expectations<00:07:28.760> but<00:07:29.300> I'm

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:29.420 
with such high expectations but I'm

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.940 
with such high expectations but I'm
curious<00:07:29.720> to<00:07:29.840> how<00:07:29.930> you<00:07:29.990> guys<00:07:30.230> felt<00:07:30.530> about<00:07:30.830> the

wouldn't say it doesn't deserve its
success<00:07:43.520> I<00:07:44.240> just<00:07:44.810> feel<00:07:44.990> as<00:07:45.230> I<00:07:45.530> said<00:07:45.740> a<00:07:45.890> little
