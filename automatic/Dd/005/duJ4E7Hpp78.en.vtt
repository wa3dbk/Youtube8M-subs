00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello today we are going to talk about 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.289
 of the pulleys of the different policies 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.740
 that uses the engine to transmit the 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.740
 force 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.120
 the most common pulley the first one that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.930
 he invented was the pulley on this pulley 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:29.250
 of different sizes obviously 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.460
 the way the band sits is a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.460
 way of seeing for him to do 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.710
 you are 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.270
 with the pulley the band and then this 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.840
 way we can transmit the strength of 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.640
 one pulley to another there are different widths and 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.080
 different depths depending on 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.860
 the attraction needs that 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.410
 let's have 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.780
 as the needs of 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.610
 force transmission they went 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.040
 inventing new bands as we saw in 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.170
 another one of our capsules and 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.239
 we evolved to the one that most 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.210
 it is commonly used currently which is 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.120
 a band poli see now these bands 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.460
 to transmit the strength they have to 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.030
 lean on both the external part of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.770
 the band as for the internal part this 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.350
 It makes us remove two types of pulleys 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.650
 the pulley that is used to drag it 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.100
 from the outside, let's say it's for 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.780
 support it in the movement so that it does not 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.460
 go to hit with some of the other 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 engine parts is a smooth pulley 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 usually like this guy that I have here 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.380
 this makes it slip on the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.530
 back of the belt and pulleys 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.210
 that are used inside the band 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.080
 which is what really transmits the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.490
 strength is where it takes more strength 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.189
 are the bands with slots 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.549
 that tie with the slots of the band 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:11.160
 itself and in this way transmit the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.740
 force now to be able to maintain 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.460
 band in place 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.220
 because this band is spinning the same 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.260
 and how many turns the engine gives and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.930
 an engine can start from a thousand 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.090
 revolutions to work up to ten thousand 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.720
 fifteen thousand revolutions depending on what 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.410
 so modern and how sporting is the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.450
 engine but let's think about that ten thousand 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.890
 turns per minute 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.200
 they are many laps then for 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.110
 keep it in place you use a 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.510
 apparatus like this one that is a tensor there 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.780
 different ways depending on the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.390
 engine designer to adjust it to the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.950
 spaces that require but basically 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.290
 what it does is an internal spring 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.120
 what it does is that it maintains an attention 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.819
 by holding it in one part we move it and 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.400
 When he returns, he puts tension on the 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.640
 band to keep it in place and from 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.610
 this form is constantly spinning and 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.680
 do not fall and do damage 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.230
 I hope you have found this useful 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.810
 capsule I wait for you in another of our 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.550
 capsules any comment or if 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.060
 Do you want to hear some topic in 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.740
 I hope your comments on 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:36.430
 contact point more mechanical gmail.com 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.430
 thanks for joining us
