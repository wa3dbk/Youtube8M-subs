00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.799
 yes hello people and welcome 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.929
 to a new video on friday from mac 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.940
 pro and today I'll show you how 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.960
 windows programs for free on mac 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.549
 can run 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
 many of you probably know 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.550
 crossover so you can do that well 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.859
 run programs 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.539
 I do not think it works that way 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.330
 as reliable as wine and is not so 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.900
 easy and costs just what yes and you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.790
 Just invite you to wine offered by the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.030
 He stated below the description 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.739
 time down reactions to download is 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 of course only for intel macs no 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.110
 wonderful who has fast today 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.829
 not intermec very few and yes me 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.989
 now would like this application so this 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.050
 3d pinball for windows execute yes to that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.460
 I take the file under load 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 a butler combo opens the times so and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.580
 then I just pull the two here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.950
 things purely well so now we have 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 open here have copied in there open 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.250
 Let's go in and say open everything 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 okay and yes then we already see directly 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:25.590
 ins Tor you must have agreed to a go 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:30.420
 because we also study you in detail 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.159
 have concluded that already some 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.079
 shit here checks updates you need 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.400
 not everything that you can directly 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.650
 close and now we see lifted 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.320
 is a small wine bottle and then 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.680
 let's say here 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.640
 but promptly that means now the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:55.290
 creates the whole windows files in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:59.549
 our enemy and that right under here 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.930
 your user account and then I think 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.090
 not ready now because he still has 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.340
 loads that is now done 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.410
 one concludes that one either and now 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.510
 we have all of our wine files 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.430
 windows 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.080
 if we need it that way 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.379
 after we have everything installed 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.019
 we can now have us at this exe 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.220
 then make a file and we click 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.860
 twice now and here comes now 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.439
 already the first little dialog what would 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.870
 you like to do it there you just click 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.720
 times converteam simple micro asics 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.519
 application that is you make of it 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.019
 in principle a mac application that 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.739
 I think the best because otherwise is 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:43.579
 always reinstall everything so 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:47.150
 for the often allowed the wine beggar 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:50.980
 You can open his own directly 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.030
 click into the valley and into the valley 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.470
 and now we can go here 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.159
 choose desk and pinball 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.569
 so safe was now creating the 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.829
 pin was so this time is not so big 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.769
 that's going to happen relatively quickly now 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.980
 we install it once 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.599
 Now we still have the starter out 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.129
 walls so which file that is with the 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.930
 you start now in this case 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:25.310
 pinball point exe press nokia e6 it for 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.109
 him and now I should be here 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.720
 running shoes and if we do that now 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:37.639
 first open a little bit longer 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:42.620
 then here is 3d pinball working now 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:43.790
 with me on mac yeah that 's it with this one 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.930
 This could actually happen to anyone 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.480
 also make another game and until the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.959
 Do not subscribe bye bye next time 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.959
 Afford
