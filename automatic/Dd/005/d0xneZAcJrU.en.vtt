00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
steering angle I can then make it

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.930

this new non one it's a real 911 it
feels<00:02:57.299> like<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.599> 911<00:02:58.260> that's<00:02:58.620> all<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.739> can<00:02:58.860> say

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
feels like a 911 that's all I can say

feels like a 911 that's all I can say
about<00:02:59.189> it<00:02:59.489> really<00:02:59.670> but<00:03:00.659> what's<00:03:00.840> really

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
about it really but what's really

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.630 
about it really but what's really
interesting<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.739> seems<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.069> achieve<00:03:02.370> two

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
interesting is it seems to achieve two

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.030

and that's very impressive makes it more
