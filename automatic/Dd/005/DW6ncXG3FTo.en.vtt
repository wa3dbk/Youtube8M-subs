ecologist<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.339> it<00:00:38.550> seems<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:38.999> safe<00:00:39.239> bet

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
because they have armor I don't so that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.140 
because they have armor I don't so that
is<00:01:22.680> definitely<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.760> gotta<00:01:23.940> keep

is definitely a thing that I gotta keep

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.440 
is definitely a thing that I gotta keep
in<00:01:24.330> mind<00:01:24.800> but<00:01:25.800> still<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.000> spawn<00:01:27.240> here

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
in mind but still we got to spawn here

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600 
in mind but still we got to spawn here
quite<00:01:27.690> easily<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.650> middle<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.980> suppose<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
quite easily or the middle I suppose and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
quite easily or the middle I suppose and
we<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.240> grab<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.690> fire<00:01:30.900> aspect<00:01:31.230> sword

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
we can just grab the fire aspect sword
right<00:01:31.800> here<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.370> hopefully<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.270> help

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
right here and hopefully that will help

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
right here and hopefully that will help
