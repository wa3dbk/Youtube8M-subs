00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
really beautiful and subtle and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.179 
really beautiful and subtle and
dreamlike<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.830> try<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
dreamlike about it and I do try to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.980 
dreamlike about it and I do try to
incorporate<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.850> into<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.240> pieces<00:01:15.689> or<00:01:15.869> I've

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
incorporate that into my pieces or I've

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
incorporate that into my pieces or I've
already<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.549> cuz<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
already can just just cuz it it's a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.060 
already can just just cuz it it's a
comforting<00:01:19.170> color<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.740> me

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
comforting color for me
yellows<00:01:21.830> especially<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:23.240> bismuth<00:01:24.240> yellow<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
yellows especially like bismuth yellow I

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
yellows especially like bismuth yellow I
think<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.830> cool<00:01:26.100> yellow<00:01:26.400> which<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.850> an

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
think it's a cool yellow which is an

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.609 
think it's a cool yellow which is an
interesting<00:01:27.240> thing<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> because

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
interesting thing I think of because

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.030 
interesting thing I think of because
yellow<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> core<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.850> warmth<00:01:31.040> but

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
yellow is like the core of warmth but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560 
yellow is like the core of warmth but
they're<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.490> cadmium<00:01:33.060> yellow<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.479> like

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
they're you know cadmium yellow is like

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.950 
they're you know cadmium yellow is like
a<00:01:33.689> very<00:01:33.869> warm<00:01:34.439> yellow<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.479> bismuth<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.689> hand

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a very warm yellow and bismuth or hand

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.270 
a very warm yellow and bismuth or hand
so<00:01:37.170> yellow<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:38.210> cooler<00:01:39.210> yellows<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.070> it's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so yellow are cooler yellows and so it's

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.870 
so yellow are cooler yellows and so it's
like<00:01:41.430> yellow<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.790> shadow<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
like yellow and shadow and I think I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.300 
like yellow and shadow and I think I
think<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> whole<00:01:45.930> concept<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> cool<00:01:47.070> yellow

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
think the whole concept of a cool yellow

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.850 
think the whole concept of a cool yellow
is<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.880> interesting<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.170> find<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
is really interesting and I find it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100 
is really interesting and I find it
really<00:01:49.920> beautiful<00:01:50.450> I've<00:01:51.450> stuck<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:51.810> em

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
really beautiful I've stuck with em

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
really beautiful I've stuck with em
Graham<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.890> consistent<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:53.759> every<00:01:54.090> color

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
Graham it's consistent with every color

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
Graham it's consistent with every color
which<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.229> nice<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.829> hard<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.219> mix

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
which is really nice it's hard to mix
