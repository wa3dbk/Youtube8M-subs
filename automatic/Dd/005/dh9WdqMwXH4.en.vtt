00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.699
 batista70phone friends to present I present to you 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:20.289
 the roma pur white is a rom based on 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:23.589
 5.0.2 library enel rails 22 g 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.289
 on the bass letter instead google is one 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:29.080
 very light Rome weighs only 350 megs 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.749
 including the apse laws that they are 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.460
 updated to the last we say 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:37.239
 official update which is that of 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.039
 21 12 to full rom hotels so you can 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.579
 install all the themes all that 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.370
 want 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.870
 the speed is optimized and also the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.399
 battery life I have to say that not 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.199
 it's not bad I'm there 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.230
 faded we say it in a pretty manner 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.399
 quiet with three e-mail accounts and 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.390
 all my social whatsapp 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.399
 synchronized from this morning to 8 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.039
 about and we're at 76 percent I have to say 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.449
 that I find it enough 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.450
 satisfactory ditto regarding 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.060
 the reception are with 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.420
 on this terminal or the sim vodafone e 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 I am perpetually in 4g both here and a 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.799
 parabiago that the country next to mine 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.250
 so I absolutely can't 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:26.789
 complain and there is also surround sound 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.920
 and I must say that he feels he can hear that 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.969
 sounds but fans made the things that are in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.969
 important act of the usual 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.100
 I must say that it works well is equipped 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.840
 also of ambient display what is the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.490
 you can read large displays here 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.260
 responsive the screen lifting of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.820
 device upon notification arrival 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.310
 when notifications arrive there 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.670
 lights up the screen and I have to say that the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.790
 what is rather useful also equipped 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.310
 obviously of multiuser as eto'o 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.970
 now all devices see android 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.980
 and 5.01 dash 2 this is the lowered 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.320
 on the libraries of ii and rome 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.540
 problems said is the most white 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.960
 as we can see we have here the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.210
 multi user here 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.210
 loris adds guest or add a 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.730
 other user then to restart 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.860
 quickly the device is fine with me 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.190
 honestly, you don't need it if you want 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.780
 we have or low light I can do 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.390
 the reboot debut recovery reboot 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.340
 bootloader or the power of you il 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.410
 poor I prefer to do it with screen of 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.210
 and lock and I'm not placed there 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.500
 use on all my terminals 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.380
 we have the gallery of 12 cm then 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.780
 it is not the gallery that quality poses 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.930
 other things we have our own 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.480
 material if you want is the browser 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.440
 let's say besides chrome there is also the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.220
 browser that 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.630
 a os x that material in short then there is 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.730
 for example 12 cm file manager as vi 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.710
 I said browser your material browsers 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.860
 in that google room works gallery 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.530
 12 cm the sound recorder calendar that 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.180
 this sound recorder you can 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.090
 use quietly 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.380
 I must say that the Roma as you see very much 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.020
 fluid I repeat the battery seems to me 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.050
 hold fairly well 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.950
 good in short if you want to try some 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.960
 rom 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.440
 maybe in particular I would say this 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:43.610
 Here I find it very very stable features 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:47.060
 obviously even google never has 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.880
 player music material that to this me 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.450
 use to say usually poor though if you want 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:57.900
 there is also another 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.160
 music player that say a rom 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.980
 usable all young people e 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.290
 facts site josÃ© dei in fact I'm not 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.709
 experiencing problems of any kind 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.680
 maybe in the next few days I'll go to 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.209
 maybe try something a little more 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.489
 I am so experimental about it 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.470
 using as a second smartphone for 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.590
 which I can maybe even afford to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.960
 try something we say on an alpha basis or 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.240
 something a little bit special 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.370
 in the meantime I hope I have been there 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.710
 useful with this conclusion only all 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.710
