 hello good this is my bike is a suzuki 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:08.490
 gsx 1200 inazuma of year 99 that is a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.860
 Pretty unknown model in Spain 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 especially it was quite sold in France 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.140
 and germany is a version that derives from 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.619
 the one 10,200 share motor 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.080
 They are 98 horses 98 or a meter park 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.760
 with education because the computer is 5 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.590
 marches 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.350
 It is a motorcycle that stands out above all for 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.840
 its power in low and medium low 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.350
 revolutions more than in highs but what 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.780
 I'm doing very well 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.149
 good has the top speed pretty 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.289
 eternal high of 240 to be a brand 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:48.100
 that is very good is a very comfortable bike 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.449
 above all very very comfortable that is very 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.430
 well done has a quality of 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.500
 very good construction beyond what 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 that suzuki is accustomed 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.300
 It has fuel level indicator 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.920
 in mine is equipped with cuffs 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.640
 heaters and a brake pump 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.989
 radial the springs have been replaced 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.200
 by progressive springs of the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.700
 fork to make a little bit more 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.509
 hard 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.590
 and good are about 220 kilos of weight is 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:20.320
 an alternative to the r300 pet but 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.219
 it is shorter and lighter therefore 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.219
 it's something more sporty 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.369
 Y 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.130
 nothing more to comment is the bike very 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.060
 pretty that stands out a lot 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.060
 everyone likes it 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.110
 a very simple engine to do it in the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.110
 revisions are air-cooled 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.330
 and such 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.020
 consumption that does not reach on average 6 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.020
 liters at 100 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.730
 with the serial exhaust is pretty 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.730
 pretty silent 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.710
