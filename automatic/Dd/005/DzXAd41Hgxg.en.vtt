00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.870
 hi friends today we are looking at 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.150
 another very interesting universe 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.460
 made in maykravt and this time our 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.730
 card to a warrant from the sovereign 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.740
 rings and in front of us minas morgul 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.230
 we go in it made enough 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.850
 interesting but here it is 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.380
 Sithonia white and black I do not know 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.119
 it seems to me that a little bit 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.099
 unrealistic after all in the same 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.310
 movie for example minas morgul looked 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.840
 somewhat different very much 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 nice that the developers have added such 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.550
 funny tablets they help easier 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.129
 navigate the map but in general 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.230
 generally quite comfortable inside everything 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.379
 but also thought minas morgul far 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 the most beautiful thing here 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 here is just a sea a sea of ​​very interesting 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.239
 objects that I really liked 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 explore here for example memorable for 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.199
 frodo cave in which lives huge 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.969
 spider 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.930
 here everything is so creepy and dark but torches 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.899
 make the atmosphere soft even i would say 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 I really do not know the excursion 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.670
 in life get on a tour that here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.420
 the spider itself is made of cubes 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.570
 looks quite massive but somehow 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.280
 as it does not scare 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.380
 but that it is time to dump out of the cave 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.750
 very interesting here and here and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.400
 central entrance mordor huge black 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.080
 the gate 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.760
 they look very massive in these 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.970
 turrets can climb climb too 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.979
 everything is quite interesting 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.770
 thought out turnover is very fat 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.580
 really not punch the door 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.890
 now open apparently waiting for our visit 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.080
 Mordor itself is somehow not very comfortable 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.009
 monsters poured everywhere lava but 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.070
 such an atmosphere 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.539
 not particularly oppressive mercenary ship 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.710
 who sailed to help the orcs and 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.970
 sauron 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.580
 made here everything is very interesting 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.020
 the ship is very thoughtful there are places 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.420
 under Pushkin, a wonderful cabin captain 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.330
 in general, everything is so very thoughtful 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.450
 funny by the way in the cabin captain 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.040
 nice enough and you can't say he 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.959
 hard killer of all life seems that 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.959
 he is just a nice tourist 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.140
 the ship is huge and made very in 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.610
 original technique he see such 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.260
 wherein multicolored flag him 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.030
 white and black looks great too 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.310
 Interestingly, I think I'll slightly differ 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.660
 show you this more unfortunately 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.270
 the card is very large and models 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.040
 very slow part 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.190
 textures have to wait 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.360
 general loading it is a little sad 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.420
 very much map 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.210
 epically done and here's the main 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.580
 sight of these places 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.710
 the famous eye of saurona here she is not 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.200
 moves sleep in lane i'm impossible at all 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.180
 make her move this 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.000
 epic construction inside can also 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.740
 go for a walk in the face suddenly 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.460
 rain fell so it's about time 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.460
 go inside 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.769
 ok now we are definitely not wetting him and 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.349
 let's see what we have here 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:21.799
 cooked flowing lava also here very 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.890
 many of these stone stone here 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.599
 walls that are very thick probably for 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.030
 order to keep the defense in case 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.430
 which also draws a standard for 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.360
 this eye area and see which one 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.599
 high ceiling 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.000
 it leads to the very heart of the tower if 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:42.379
 You can say so about 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.329
 about about and here it is the smoke from the famous 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.980
 the mountain in which the ring was made 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.920
 here she is 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.650
 and the path by which sometime frodo with 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.709
 Sam and accompanying their goal 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.319
 get the heart of the mountain to 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.020
 destroy the ring well let's go and we 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.900
 let's go 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.380
 let's see what's interesting here 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.780
 meet the zombie pair of creeper and no 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.430
 latch a creeper one stutter 2 2 there is he 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.610
 just just not to burn 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.590
 let's destroy them and finally come 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:19.690
 to the very epic point of ours 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.840
 the narrative creeper fly into the water and here 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.270
 it's very dark room, he's there yet 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.790
 the skeleton is watching us like that 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.670
 you know 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.300
 the viewer and the place itself was 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.770
 ring destroyed 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.140
 lava very much she is a little blind 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.670
 when you come here in general map 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.130
 made interestingly thoughtfully enough 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.390
 but unfortunately on just awesome and 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.310
 developers have included here a few 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.900
 locations which is either not completed either 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.180
 simply 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.090
 conceived so because of this the map is very 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.980
 lags heavily and accounts 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.050
 take off all the fragments not somehow piecemeal 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.150
 nevertheless does not cancel the fine plan 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.700
 the work done, I hope that you she 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.730
 also liked if you know others 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.410
 and interesting and well-known in this world, and 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.850
 which were made by minecraft this 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.630
 turned out well, be sure to throw 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.950
