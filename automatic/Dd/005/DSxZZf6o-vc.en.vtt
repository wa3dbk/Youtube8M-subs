00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
control for it it's a little different

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.270

out for it
the<00:01:16.020> buttons<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.409> rearranged<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:16.950> bit

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the buttons are rearranged a little bit

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.710 
the buttons are rearranged a little bit
and<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> remote<00:01:17.670> control<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.000> very<00:01:18.150> important

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and the remote control is very important

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.440 
and the remote control is very important
so<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> old<00:01:19.350> version<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.009> had<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:21.270> boat

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so the old version of it I had the boat

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
so the old version of it I had the boat
control<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.840> sucked<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> very

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
control just sucked so this one is very

but<00:01:51.229> given<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.259> plasmas<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.890> having<00:01:53.130> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
but given that plasmas are having this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.590 
but given that plasmas are having this
problem<00:01:53.369> sometimes<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.060> fade<00:01:54.299> over<00:01:54.450> time

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
problem sometimes they fade over time

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.709 
problem sometimes they fade over time
LED<00:01:55.380> shouldn't<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.159> much<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> black

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
LED shouldn't that much that the black

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.420 
LED shouldn't that much that the black
really<00:01:58.049> wasn't<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.649> much<00:01:58.710> difference<00:01:59.250> where

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
really wasn't that much difference where

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.800 
really wasn't that much difference where
you'll<00:01:59.610> actually<00:01:59.820> you'll<00:02:00.119> make<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.479> change

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you'll actually you'll make you change

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.780 
you'll actually you'll make you change
your<00:02:00.930> mind<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.009> but

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
your mind which one you want to get but

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.190 
your mind which one you want to get but
the<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.119> blacks<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> look<00:02:03.810> good<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the the blacks are here to look good the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.300 
the the blacks are here to look good the
colors<00:02:04.500> look<00:02:04.710> great<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
colors look great I think it's like a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.639 
colors look great I think it's like a
five<00:02:05.579> million<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.689> ratio<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.259> far<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
five million to one ratio as far as the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.400 
five million to one ratio as far as the
colors<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.340> think<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> guy<00:02:08.729> told<00:02:08.970> me

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
colors on here I think the guy told me

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.740 
colors on here I think the guy told me
and<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> colors<00:02:11.819> really<00:02:12.000> pop<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
and so the colors really pop out all the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.460 
and so the colors really pop out all the
different<00:02:12.840> colors

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
different colors

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
different colors
pop<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.400> has<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> 120<00:02:14.910> Hertz<00:02:15.270> which<00:02:15.510> is

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
pop on it it has a 120 Hertz which is

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.090 
pop on it it has a 120 Hertz which is
kind<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.290> new<00:02:16.380> technology<00:02:16.950> they're

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
kind of like the new technology they're

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.800 
kind of like the new technology they're
putting<00:02:17.310> into<00:02:17.460> TVs<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.150> help<00:02:18.360> smooth<00:02:18.630> out

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
putting into TVs to help smooth out

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.630 
putting into TVs to help smooth out
action<00:02:19.260> scenes<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.830> make<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> little<00:02:20.490> bit

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
action scenes and make it a little bit

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.160 
action scenes and make it a little bit
more<00:02:20.760> clearer<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.180> less<00:02:21.360> blurring<00:02:21.870> all<00:02:22.020> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
more clearer and less blurring all that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
more clearer and less blurring all that
stuff<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.740> does<00:02:22.950> have<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> little

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
stuff it does have that it's a little

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.400 
stuff it does have that it's a little
getting<00:02:24.150> uses<00:02:24.450> my<00:02:24.600> first<00:02:24.810> TV<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.110> have<00:02:25.230> that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
getting uses my first TV to have that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.260 
getting uses my first TV to have that
but<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.770> does<00:02:25.980> look<00:02:26.160> good<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.640> certain<00:02:27.060> cases

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
but it does look good in certain cases

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.950 
but it does look good in certain cases

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
when you navigate the Dominions I hate

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.760

the<00:02:36.630> little<00:02:36.720> delay<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.260> they<00:02:37.320> used<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.590> have

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
the little delay that they used to have

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.520 
the little delay that they used to have
now<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.820> zooms<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:39.600> through<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.140> process

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
now is zooms right through the process

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.060 
now is zooms right through the process
and<00:02:40.620> his<00:02:40.710> TV<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:41.340> zooming<00:02:41.820> through<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.170 
like how it kind of justice to your
liking<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.160> well<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> think<00:02:53.520> it<00:02:53.580> has<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
liking this well I think it has and it

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.790 
liking this well I think it has and it
must<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.540> an<00:02:54.660> ambient<00:02:55.050> light<00:02:55.080> sensor<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
must have an ambient light sensor in it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.980 
must have an ambient light sensor in it
so<00:02:55.890> once<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.160> turn<00:02:56.310> my<00:02:56.400> lights<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:56.970> off<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
so once I turn my lights on and off it

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.390 
so once I turn my lights on and off it
actually<00:02:58.260> adjusted<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.770> screen<00:02:59.010> for<00:02:59.250> me<00:02:59.370> I

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
actually adjusted the screen for me I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.250 
actually adjusted the screen for me I
think<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.820> can<00:02:59.940> turn<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.209> off<00:03:00.270> though

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
think you can turn that off though

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.560 
think you can turn that off though

this<00:03:33.570> TV<00:03:33.780> ran<00:03:34.050> about<00:03:34.170> twenty<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.709> twenty<00:03:35.010> three

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.580 
I think normally their list price was
about<00:03:38.660> twenty<00:03:39.660> nine<00:03:39.810> hundred<00:03:39.840> something<00:03:40.410> like
