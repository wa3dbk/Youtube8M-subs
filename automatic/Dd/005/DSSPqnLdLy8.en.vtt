00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:14.580
 to govern the 2 the gear the arneo o 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
 the gear fit is necessary to use 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.580
 applications within the phone ad 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.980
 example to whom and manager gf manager with 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.010
 chieri managers and manage watches with 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 and simply rfid the model of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.420
 smart band let's take a look at the managers 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.270
 when only and exclusively when the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.000
 product is connected you can have 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.160
 all this series of indications to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.090
 example choose water directly 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.930
 by the dm manager 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.390
 what style do you want for yours 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 phone you can of course select 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.550
 the type of watch you want 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.840
 use on the screen these are 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.760
 functionality that you can obviously do 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.899
 also on the clock but here they come 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 greatly simplified and from here to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.600
 the other you can also manage those that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.240
 are the features regarding 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 the notifications icons this is a part 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.670
 very important because you see the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 especially important speech from 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.259
 use to activate because it is not 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.790
 by default it is the transfer 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.939
 smart this way when you have 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.439
 an icon on your who is 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.520
 just lift the galaxy s 5 for 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.950
 get the display of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.070
 notification directly on the display without 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.470
 do nothing else preview message 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.810
 serves instead to have the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.310
 display a preview of this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 which was sent to you in the notification 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.979
 directly inside licola's 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.590
 notification and here you select who and which 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.270
 what can send you there can send the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.189
 some indication I must say that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.950
 compared to the past there is another thing 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.380
 important you see this personal abse 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.770
 another to manage applications 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.170
 and possibly even install new ones 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.300
 applications this is a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.730
 detail in my opinion is very important 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.580
 also because we begin to find 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:20.069
 something relevant also for the new 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.630
 gr2 or the lakes and managers with taisen ci 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.970
 they are already interesting applications 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.100
 for example that of threads is that it gives the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.690
 possibility to see the news on 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.860
 title is the image of the news 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.110
 directly 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.569
 here you see it at this point 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.550
 this is the area from which you can download 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.220
 there are no new applications 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.040
 however many begin to arrive at 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.980
 destination so this is the point in 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.940
 in which very little you really are 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.220
 able to govern your gere e 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.870
 let's take a look yet see this 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.920
 it concerns above all the management of the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.549
 double tap 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.950
 and of course the g2 clicking 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.410
 twice I for example have activated the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.799
 boys for the voice commands you can 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.280
 make phone calls send also 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.830
 messages regarding others 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.170
 fundamental functions 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.549
 it must be said that there is this for example 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.010
 this is also enough 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.640
 important you see here is launched s 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:25.650
 get up on the phone but with the settings 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:29.280
 you can tell 22 or the ring every 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.430
 how long to transfer s data from 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.459
 wearable device on the phone 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.370
 This action is not automatic if you do not 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.590
 set is right here 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.310
 in short, if you have other questions for the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.220
 ddr2 operation and ibf and also 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.420
 obviously the old samsung like al 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.330
 usually on twitter 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.570
 luca viscardi 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.570
 no
