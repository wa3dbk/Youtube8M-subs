00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.939
 Well, the style of the shirt and that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 although surely you will already 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.529
 deducted from the title that will be below or 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.840
 up depends on where you are seeing 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.189
 this video but good 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.020
 today I'm going to record videos of uniforms 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 because well so I 'm also going to 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.759
 record many more videos back to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 cole that serve us all but yes that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.050
 He has given me realize that there are many 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.730
 videos on youtube back to school and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.360
 this but there are none of uniforms 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 chords and good and I wanted to record one for 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.790
 all that jones uniform and that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.260
 it's a little harder because there's no 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.660
 so many videos and it's a little more 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
 complicated to do it in a subtle way 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 that is still the uniform but that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.820
 now the diamond is and well 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.890
 this is the video and before anything I wanted 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 give thanks from here to the cut 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.519
 English for throwing my backs that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.890
 well actually this way I'm going to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.689
 use in this video 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.969
 is the ad I'm going to put the ad 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.670
 the little box and a little note around here so that 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.210
 you see it because good is still very or 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.450
 It is to ghana 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.970
 good and as you know most of them 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.430
 uniforms are usually a white shirt or 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.940
 a ready shirt and a board skirt 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.020
 like checkered necklines 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.880
 yes 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.460
 but good and good because today I'm going to 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.429
 teach a few ways how 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.579
 do to decorate a bit to say it 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.400
 well and nothing girls that this I hope 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.500
 I wish you like it 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.060
 well this is the first afip and the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.980
 truth is that they are nothing exaggerated 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.260
 because I want it to be the uniform and that 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.210
 let us leave the soft so good 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.730
 I took her to some wool stockings 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 fat and I wear this shirt and I think that 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.040
 what changes is the shirt and well I do not know 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.010
 if it will be because it is a bit far but 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.500
 what this shirt has is the east 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.540
 neck and good what I like is that 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.009
 It can pass like a necklace and you need 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.990
 put on a necklace but that is the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.220
 shirt and the truth is that I like 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.440
 a lot is a super cute and good outfit 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.360
 This is very simple and I hope that you 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.360
 have liked for those who are more 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.830
 all right 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.830
 Well, I'm going to teach you very 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.209
 fast if I'm one of those we like 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.010
 take the shirt inside and you have it 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.870
 on the outside you see very little fabric of the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.520
 wood and this is going to make them look 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.530
 much shorter than it actually is 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.650
 because I'm very little fabric so I'm going 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.390
 my stunt teach it as below 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.760
 the shirt always always always carry 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.100
 a white lycra shirt then what 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.620
 What I do is dress me up to 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.870
 you want to wear the shirt if not me 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.080
 I like ibarra inside like the shirt 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.540
 and hooked on the inside is worth this is 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.980
 the truth is that very cute was disguised 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.260
 montonazo it seems that we will go for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.300
 inside is much more comfortable and you will see 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.840
 more fabric therefore looks longer 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.840
 our skirt 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.370
 well for the second objective the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.989
 shirt that has been taught before and this one 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.880
 it will be then for my taste it makes a 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.430
 little more feminine than a cotton 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.500
 and that's how good it is and I have 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.319
 rolled up like I 've taught you before so 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.720
 shirt and well I think very cute very 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.940
 very simple female we do not want to go either 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.319
 too exaggerated alcohol and henna and 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.030
 instead of the videos I've put these 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.730
 Socks that seem fresher 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.750
 and more monkeys and good when they are cold 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.250
 that as we get a jersey and 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.830
 Well, they always tell us that we have to 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.780
 get us one with blue beak but the 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.130
 truth is that I'm not convinced of the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.370
 all because it does not seem very 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.830
 flatters I really like how it is 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.630
 so well I'll give you in my version 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.150
 of the gesture and I'm going to put on this jacket 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.069
 thick stitch is similar to the one 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.290
 they had the normal bears in title that 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.000
 It will be navy blue and it has a white lining 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.799
 inside and you can not imagine what 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.900
 warm that is and how comfortable it is 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.250
 then this I much too 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.900
 you can wear it overcoat 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.900
 before it gets really cold 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.930
 in the video I wanted it to be very 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.940
 quickie teaching only as teaching 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.620
 it's very fast like changing a shirt 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.990
 You can change the whole look of the uniform 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.680
 and the truth is that I have not taken 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.690
 shoes ni 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.450
 No necklace or bracelets because good 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.010
 in schools yes yes there are rules 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.470
 very strict with the necklaces then 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.360
 I do not turn if they take off a necklace and 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.860
 with the shoes there are also regulations 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.580
 strict then it depends on 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.350
 you in good with the shoes of is 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.240
 something like very personal not because it's something 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.340
 that you have and now every day and not 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.720
 six as you like each one with some 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.060
 that are comfortable and that and good in itself more 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.070
 and nothing girls that I hope you like the 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.620
 next video will be the outfits that 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.220
 I was missing in the other that are the pits 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.470
 much more 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.960
 arranged so to speak this action 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.520
 dispersion is reported for those who 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.440
 like thinner of the institute and 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.000
 well the truth if I like it works 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.750
 even someone would put it to leave 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.450
 so then I do not expect you to like them 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.430
 also when I upload it inside mom and 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.170
 I also have prepared that I in 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.060
 my backpack updated for all 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.040
 that you asked me and if you have more 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.580
 ideas for videos put it in the 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.800
 comments for you to see and what more 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.599
 what else 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.099
 and nothing I hope you have used 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.090

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.090
