00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 johnny depp likes to be very bizarre 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.109
 and different figure embodies white 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.400
 once again showed that in German 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.400
 Trailer too mortal 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.010
 absolute 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.540
 I think I shot already 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:02.320
 who knows, maybe that's a common one 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.320
 Welcome in america no idea 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.950
 Charly mottest funniest one unspeakable 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.720
 probably no place called los angeles me 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.310
 I'm glad you need help with that 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.200
 luggage no i do not need help with 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.580
 my luggage and so I have 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.580
 my damn maid 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.210
 I do not really know what I mean 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.650
 now should behave like this if 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.000
 I see this trailer the first 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.290
 second trainers feel a bit like that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.120
 like the big gatsby on and then 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.130
 the whole again so colorful cured 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.290
 with johnny depp in the middle as charlie 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.850
 But no art dealer is happy 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.680
 sometimes steals and is looking for 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.090
 after a painting on a whole 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.130
 special code notes that one 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.290
 bank locker that supposedly important 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.030
 Nazi gold should be stored so he tries 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.080
 Help a world trip on this painting 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.790
 but the track to come with it is 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.840
 not alone with criminals 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.340
 under organization at the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.480
 underground organization 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.860
 but also one or the other 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.390
 Secret service is at his heels 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.920
 while he plays his sidekick of 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.660
 I have boards on the side 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.580
 the hunted by ewan mcgregor and the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.080
 means that you supplement with winter sports 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.730
 ever has a lot of crass actor 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.920
 As far as the names are concerned in front of the camera and 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.060
 that's why mordecai could be interesting 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.960
 but you also ask yourself 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.220
 bit with johnny dork if that 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.620
 Viewers are not over use these 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.270
 easy on drugs whimsical characters 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.950
 to experience in front of the camera and if you want the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.510
 because not sometime is tired because 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.040
 johnny depp lately, too 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.300
 always delivered so much or 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.590
 The simply did not like that 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.030
 still work properly 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.830
 a basic admiration that many 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.240
 the box office technically always works 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.709
 still like to accompany you to the cinema and 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.480
 but at some point that could be 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.190
 That's why I overcame myself 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.570
 quite skeptical am the look funny 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.709
 find the gags but here in this 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.150
 trailer not funny and find 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.709
 basically you would not have a few 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.970
 press background information would you 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.530
 Also do not really know about this 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.270
 trailer what it should actually be 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.470
 in morte kai that's why we wait 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.760
 maybe second trailer had one 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.200
 bit more storytelling to senate 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.780
 this place and with that I am through 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.239
 you will trailer to mortal from the 5th 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.020
 february 2015 - so still a while 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.820
 waiting 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.900
 and yes that can be a thumb there if 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.550
 this video made it stay that way 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.690
 if not otherwise you know that 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.190
 there are a few left and me around and 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.620
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.560
 a new video and by that time I hope 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.560
 of course again 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.560
 ondra
