00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's very beautiful and yet it's a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.300 
it's very beautiful and yet it's a
period<00:02:23.360> piece<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.560> think<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:25.070> it's

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
period piece so I think that it's

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.160 
period piece so I think that it's
adaptive<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.030> many<00:02:26.240> many<00:02:26.450> ways<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.780> that's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
adaptive in many many ways and that's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
adaptive in many many ways and that's
one<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.860> things<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.400> draws<00:02:28.730> me<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.150> it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
one of the things that draws me to it

one of the things that draws me to it
Hamlet<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.410> one<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.770> Shakespeare's<00:02:31.610> most

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
Hamlet is one of Shakespeare's most

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.510 
Hamlet is one of Shakespeare's most
intense<00:02:34.190> dramas<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.920> Philips<00:02:36.920> music<00:02:37.310> has<00:02:37.490> a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
intense dramas and Philips music has a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.720 
intense dramas and Philips music has a
way<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:38.230> developing<00:02:39.610> this<00:02:40.610> narrative<00:02:41.450> tension

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
way of developing this narrative tension

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.280 
way of developing this narrative tension
that<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.150> really<00:02:44.390> don't<00:02:44.510> expect<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:45.140> his

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
that that you really don't expect in his

that that you really don't expect in his
music<00:02:45.740> so<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.310> think<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.360> marries

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
music so I think that that it marries

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.560 
music so I think that that it marries
very<00:02:48.020> well<00:02:48.290> together
