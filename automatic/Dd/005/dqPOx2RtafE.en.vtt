00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.830 

this<00:01:57.690> one<00:01:57.869> has<00:01:58.250> 49,000<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.399> 88<00:01:59.759> miles<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.330> it

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.450 

the<00:02:03.840> shifter<00:02:04.229> feels<00:02:04.470> really<00:02:04.799> weird<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.280> like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the shifter feels really weird it's like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.399

hard<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> push<00:02:06.630> forward<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.020> feels<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.289> it's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
hard to push forward it feels like it's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.919 
hard to push forward it feels like it's
rubber<00:02:07.890> band<00:02:08.220> II<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.450> again<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
rubber band II but then again this is a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.440 
rubber band II but then again this is a
CVT<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.039> would<00:02:11.190> probably<00:02:11.700> explain<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
CVT so that would probably explain it

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.350 
CVT so that would probably explain it
