00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.680 
combination and you know Tim's got a
pretty<00:00:41.399> good<00:00:41.489> chin<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.059> ate<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.540> right

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
they would go into the half with a huge

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560
