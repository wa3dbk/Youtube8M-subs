00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
very political so that means that

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.140 
very political so that means that
alliances<00:05:49.380> are<00:05:49.470> gonna<00:05:49.590> form<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.820> fact<00:05:51.030> that

out<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.230> some<00:05:58.860> players<00:05:59.220> might<00:05:59.760> end<00:06:00.000> up

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
out and some players might end up

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.450 
out and some players might end up
feeling<00:06:00.180> like<00:06:00.450> they're<00:06:00.750> being<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:01.050> little<00:06:01.080> bit

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
feeling like they're being a little bit

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.010 
feeling like they're being a little bit
left<00:06:02.460> out<00:06:02.640> of<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.880> action<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.690> might

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
left out of the action and that might

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.000 
left out of the action and that might
upset<00:06:04.170> a<00:06:04.350> few<00:06:04.590> players<00:06:04.770> but<00:06:05.700> that<00:06:05.910> is<00:06:06.030> politics

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
upset a few players but that is politics

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.370 
upset a few players but that is politics
so<00:06:08.010> politics<00:06:08.490> aside<00:06:08.820> another<00:06:09.810> potential

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
so politics aside another potential

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.170

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
but you don't have the resources to do

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.240 
but you don't have the resources to do
this<00:06:45.690> without<00:06:46.690> being<00:06:47.080> able<00:06:47.470> to<00:06:47.680> manipulate

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
each other and otherwise really engage

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.379 
each other and otherwise really engage
in<00:06:52.870> actual<00:06:53.620> politicking<00:06:54.220> which<00:06:54.909> makes<00:06:55.180> it

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
in actual politicking which makes it

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.770 
in actual politicking which makes it
very<00:06:55.419> engaging<00:06:56.289> and<00:06:56.680> very<00:06:57.159> very<00:06:57.940> challenging

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
very engaging and very very challenging

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.930 
very engaging and very very challenging
I<00:06:58.810> also<00:06:59.379> particularly<00:07:00.069> like<00:07:00.220> the<00:07:00.520> office

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
I also particularly like the office

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.180 
I also particularly like the office
benefits<00:07:01.389> not<00:07:01.960> only<00:07:02.020> do<00:07:02.469> they<00:07:02.590> add<00:07:02.740> just

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
benefits not only do they add just

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.580 
benefits not only do they add just
enough<00:07:03.490> of<00:07:03.580> a<00:07:03.699> twist<00:07:04.090> to<00:07:04.419> each<00:07:04.780> term<00:07:05.229> that

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
enough of a twist to each term that

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.170 
enough of a twist to each term that
you're<00:07:05.710> going<00:07:05.919> to<00:07:05.949> be<00:07:06.069> varying<00:07:06.520> your<00:07:06.669> strategy

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
you're going to be varying your strategy

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.790 
you're going to be varying your strategy
based<00:07:07.389> on<00:07:07.539> which<00:07:07.780> office<00:07:08.080> benefit<00:07:08.440> you<00:07:08.530> have

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
based on which office benefit you have

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.839 
based on which office benefit you have
but<00:07:09.759> they're<00:07:10.300> also<00:07:10.539> often<00:07:11.199> very<00:07:11.440> important<00:07:12.400> to

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:12.849 
but they're also often very important to

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.930 
but they're also often very important to
a<00:07:12.879> player's<00:07:13.389> strategy<00:07:13.990> and<00:07:14.259> so<00:07:14.979> that<00:07:15.639> phase

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
a player's strategy and so that phase

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.369 
a player's strategy and so that phase
when<00:07:16.210> the<00:07:16.240> mayor<00:07:16.509> is<00:07:16.719> handing<00:07:17.110> them<00:07:17.259> out

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:17.379 
when the mayor is handing them out

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.980 
when the mayor is handing them out
becomes<00:07:17.860> incredibly<00:07:18.639> important<00:07:19.150> and<00:07:19.449> really

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
becomes incredibly important and really

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.930 
becomes incredibly important and really
adds<00:07:20.139> a<00:07:20.319> lot<00:07:20.349> of<00:07:20.590> life<00:07:20.949> and<00:07:21.250> challenge<00:07:21.789> and

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
adds a lot of life and challenge and

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.300 
adds a lot of life and challenge and
energy<00:07:22.389> to<00:07:22.659> the<00:07:22.750> game<00:07:22.960> this<00:07:23.349> is<00:07:23.560> this<00:07:24.099> is<00:07:24.280> a

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
energy to the game this is this is a

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.540 
energy to the game this is this is a
great<00:07:24.729> political<00:07:25.150> game<00:07:25.629> that<00:07:26.409> it<00:07:27.159> doesn't

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
great political game that it doesn't

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.640 
great political game that it doesn't
seem<00:07:27.759> as<00:07:27.940> interesting<00:07:28.389> as<00:07:28.509> it<00:07:28.539> is<00:07:28.750> on<00:07:29.530> the

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.650 
seem as interesting as it is on the

seem as interesting as it is on the
start<00:07:29.860> you<00:07:29.949> look<00:07:30.099> at<00:07:30.190> it<00:07:30.310> and<00:07:30.400> you're<00:07:30.460> like

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
start you look at it and you're like

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.100 
start you look at it and you're like
well<00:07:30.759> it's<00:07:30.909> a<00:07:30.969> map<00:07:31.120> with<00:07:31.389> a<00:07:31.419> bunch<00:07:31.629> of<00:07:31.719> cubes

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110 
well it's a map with a bunch of cubes
