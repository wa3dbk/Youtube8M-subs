00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
very easy and it's going to tighten up

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.359 
very easy and it's going to tighten up
you<00:01:44.150> just<00:01:44.330> go<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.509> watch<00:01:44.860> folds<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:45.950> wrinkles

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.310 

but<00:01:52.369> not<00:01:53.150> too<00:01:53.360> difficult<00:01:55.930> also<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.229> just

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
but not too difficult also it's just

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:17.820 
but not too difficult also it's just
this<00:01:57.740> patience<00:01:58.250> as<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.520> go

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.920 

or<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.610> down<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.060> end<00:02:19.210> that's<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.750> work

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
or just down to the end that's just work

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.360 
or just down to the end that's just work
it's<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.200> little<00:02:20.590> trickier

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.460 

and<00:02:28.370> then<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:29.140> pull<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.170> the
