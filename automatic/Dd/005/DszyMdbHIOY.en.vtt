hello this is putt putt and welcome to
my<00:00:03.540> little<00:00:03.629> tutorial<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:04.980> how<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.430> defend

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
my little tutorial this is how to defend

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.890 
my little tutorial this is how to defend
against<00:00:06.540> six<00:00:06.899> pool<00:00:07.200> as<00:00:07.440> protoss<00:00:08.630> for<00:00:09.630> those<00:00:09.750> of

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
against six pool as protoss for those of

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.150 
against six pool as protoss for those of
you<00:00:09.990> don't<00:00:10.139> know<00:00:10.200> what<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.349> six<00:00:10.590> pool<00:00:10.860> is

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
you don't know what a six pool is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.940 
you don't know what a six pool is
essentially<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.660> zerg<00:00:12.929> does<00:00:13.799> not

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
essentially it is when the zerg does not

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.490 
essentially it is when the zerg does not
build<00:00:14.250> any<00:00:14.490> drones<00:00:14.969> he<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.630> tells<00:00:16.230> them<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
build any drones he just tells them to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.439 
build any drones he just tells them to
mine<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.070> then<00:00:17.190> when<00:00:17.369> he<00:00:17.400> has<00:00:17.609> 200<00:00:18.090> minerals

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
mine and then when he has 200 minerals

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.050 
mine and then when he has 200 minerals
puts<00:00:19.320> down<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.500> spawning<00:00:19.920> pool<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.670> soon<00:00:20.880> as

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
puts down a spawning pool and as soon as

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790 
puts down a spawning pool and as soon as
that<00:00:21.300> spawning<00:00:21.630> pools<00:00:21.930> Donnie<00:00:22.170> uses<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> 3

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that spawning pools Donnie uses a 3

now just go ahead and play this game
this<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.640> myself<00:00:29.849> defending<00:00:30.660> against<00:00:30.990> six

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
this is myself defending against six

pool from an okay player this is just

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.069 
pool from an okay player this is just
pat<00:00:33.120> platinum<00:00:33.690> level<00:00:35.719> one<00:00:36.719> thing<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.020> i

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
pat platinum level one thing that i

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.139 
pat platinum level one thing that i
think<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.380> crucial<00:00:37.649> against<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.370> zerg<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
think is crucial against a zerg on a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.660 
think is crucial against a zerg on a
two-person<00:00:40.020> map<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.379> 210<00:00:41.100> gate<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
two-person map is 210 gate so what that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.670 
two-person map is 210 gate so what that
means<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.329> your<00:00:42.450> supply<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.110> ten<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
means is when your supply is ten at a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.490 
means is when your supply is ten at a
ten<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.460> build<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.850> first<00:00:45.120> pylon<00:00:45.570> followed

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
ten you build your first pylon followed

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500 
ten you build your first pylon followed
by<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.800> gates<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.670> start<00:00:48.270> building

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
by your gates then you start building

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.790 
by your gates then you start building
probes<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> chrono<00:00:49.200> boost<00:00:49.410> them<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> your

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
probes and chrono boost them out of your

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.930 
probes and chrono boost them out of your
Nexus<00:00:50.280> now<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.180> crucial<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.940> somewhat

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Nexus now it's crucial that you somewhat

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
Nexus now it's crucial that you somewhat
block<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.629> ramp<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.050> your<00:00:55.199> pylon<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
block off your ramp with your pylon and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.520 
block off your ramp with your pylon and
your<00:00:56.520> gateway<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> be

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
your gateway because that's going to be

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.369 
your gateway because that's going to be
really<00:00:58.739> crucial<00:00:59.100> in<00:01:00.079> getting<00:01:01.079> rid<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> those

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
really crucial in getting rid of those

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
really crucial in getting rid of those
zerglings<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.460> blocking<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:02.910> from

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
zerglings and I'm blocking them from

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.550 
zerglings and I'm blocking them from
getting<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.570> base<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.500> see

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
getting into your base so as we can see

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.929 
getting into your base so as we can see
from<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.890> player<00:01:08.159> has<00:01:08.189> done<00:01:08.430> exactly<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
from this player has done exactly what I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.830 
from this player has done exactly what I
said<00:01:09.000> he's<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:09.330> he<00:01:10.200> puts<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:10.500> his<00:01:10.740> sixth

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
said he's got he puts down his sixth

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
said he's got he puts down his sixth
drone<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.710> swatting<00:01:14.040> pool<00:01:14.220> makes<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.700> drone

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
drone as in swatting pool makes a drone

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
drone as in swatting pool makes a drone
to<00:01:14.909> come<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.299> bring<00:01:16.110> his<00:01:16.229> apply<00:01:16.470> back<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> six

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to come up bring his apply back to six

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.530 
to come up bring his apply back to six
and<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.729> making<00:01:17.850> some<00:01:18.150> zerglings

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and is going to be making some zerglings

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.219 
and is going to be making some zerglings
there<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.200> I've<00:01:19.320> placed<00:01:19.590> my<00:01:19.770> tent<00:01:20.670> pylon<00:01:21.630> right

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
there so I've placed my tent pylon right

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
there so I've placed my tent pylon right
here<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:23.340> rap<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.240> I'll<00:01:24.360> probably

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
here on my rap and then I'll probably

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.719 
here on my rap and then I'll probably
place<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.200> gateway<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
place my gateway right about here so it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.859 
place my gateway right about here so it
leaves<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.210> tiny<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:28.049> space<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:29.869> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
leaves just a tiny little space for to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.289 
leaves just a tiny little space for to
block<00:01:31.049> off<00:01:31.259> meanwhile<00:01:32.180> scouting<00:01:33.180> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
block off meanwhile scouting is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.580 
block off meanwhile scouting is
absolutely<00:01:33.810> important<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.200> need<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.409> know

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
absolutely important you need to know

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.020 
absolutely important you need to know
this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> coming<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.280> order<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> defend<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.880> so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this is coming in order to defend it so

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.359 
this is coming in order to defend it so
I<00:01:36.060> always<00:01:36.420> send<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:37.140> Susie<00:01:37.409> make<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.189> first

I always send with Susie make that first

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.140 
I always send with Susie make that first
pylon<00:01:38.880> send<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:41.040> probe<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
pylon send out that of that probe and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.569 
pylon send out that of that probe and
Scout<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.340> come

Scout it out so as you can see I come

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.870 
Scout it out so as you can see I come
into<00:01:44.880> his<00:01:45.000> base<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.860> oh<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.700> what's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
into his base and I see oh but what's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
into his base and I see oh but what's
going<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.420> he's<00:01:48.540> only<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:48.899> its<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.320> a

going on here he's only got its got a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.950 
going on here he's only got its got a
few<00:01:49.890> few<00:01:50.310> drones<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.329> oh<00:01:51.479> there's<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.780> pool

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
few few drones and oh there's a pool

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
few few drones and oh there's a pool
okay<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.680> those<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.920> zerglings<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
okay and those are zerglings so I'm you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.600 
okay and those are zerglings so I'm you
know<00:01:54.659> dancer<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.500> probe<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.340> now<00:01:56.490> at

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
know dancer if I probe here so now at

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.310 
know dancer if I probe here so now at
this<00:01:56.670> point<00:01:56.939> I'm<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.570> gonna<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.750> pumping<00:01:57.990> out

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this point I'm just gonna be pumping out

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.030 
this point I'm just gonna be pumping out
probes<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.460> hoping<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.320> delay<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
probes and hoping that I can delay or I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
probes and hoping that I can delay or I
can<00:02:02.820> delay<00:02:03.030> them<00:02:03.119> enough<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.170> zealot

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
can delay them enough to get one zealot

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.289 
can delay them enough to get one zealot
out<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
out and what I like to do with is this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.550 
out and what I like to do with is this
probe<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> put<00:02:06.960> them<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> position<00:02:07.290> where

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
probe is put them in a position where

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.830 
probe is put them in a position where
you<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.340> desert<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.060> coming<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.780> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
you can see the desert is coming so I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.470 
you can see the desert is coming so I
think<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.590> chose<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.979> el<00:02:11.190> Mago<00:02:11.370> watchtower

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
think I chose this el Mago watchtower

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.920 
think I chose this el Mago watchtower
yes<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.930> did<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.280> I'm<00:02:15.269> just<00:02:15.420> continually

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
yes I did that and I'm just continually

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.259 
yes I did that and I'm just continually
pumping<00:02:16.319> out<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:16.590> probes<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.150> see

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
pumping out with probes as you can see

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.759 
pumping out with probes as you can see
it<00:02:18.360> got<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.480> little<00:02:18.569> nervous<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> did<00:02:19.319> build

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
it got a little nervous and I did build

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.470 
it got a little nervous and I did build
anywhere<00:02:20.069> at<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.220> point<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> saw<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.299> go

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
anywhere at this point so I saw this go

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.509 
anywhere at this point so I saw this go
down<00:02:21.629> corner<00:02:22.170> boost<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.530> crap<00:02:22.709> out<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.129> to

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
down corner boost the crap out of it to

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.320 
down corner boost the crap out of it to
go<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.790> zealot<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> i<00:02:26.640> think<00:02:26.730> i<00:02:26.909> believe<00:02:27.090> i

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
go that zealot so i think i believe i

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.610 
go that zealot so i think i believe i
saw<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.599> zerglings<00:02:27.930> coming<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.440> now<00:02:28.500> I'm

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
saw the zerglings coming and now I'm

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.350 
saw the zerglings coming and now I'm
moving<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:28.860> probe<00:02:29.129> so<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:29.730> going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.120> bring<00:02:30.269> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
moving my probe so I'm going to bring a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.030 
moving my probe so I'm going to bring a
bunch<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.690> probes<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.170> block<00:02:31.769> them<00:02:31.920> off

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
bunch of probes and block them off

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.199 
bunch of probes and block them off
because<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.400> probes<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.760> do<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.910> decent

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
because the probes can do a decent

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.070 
because the probes can do a decent
amount<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.420> damage<00:02:33.690> against<00:02:33.930> these

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
amount of damage against these

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.960 
amount of damage against these
Earthlings<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.709> wait<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:34.920> my<00:02:35.160> gel<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
Earthlings and just wait for my gel to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.350 
Earthlings and just wait for my gel to
get<00:02:36.090> out<00:02:37.489> alright<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.879> can<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.209> I'm

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
get out alright so as you can see I'm

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.809 
get out alright so as you can see I'm
going<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.599> pause<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:40.079> here<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
going to pause it right here I the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.130 
going to pause it right here I the
probes<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.299> an<00:02:42.390> interesting<00:02:42.599> needed<00:02:43.049> because

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
probes are an interesting needed because

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.229 
probes are an interesting needed because
they<00:02:43.349> somehow<00:02:43.590> are<00:02:43.920> able<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.879> pushed

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
they somehow are able to like be pushed

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.199 
they somehow are able to like be pushed
out<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.629> way<00:02:45.780> by<00:02:46.019> by<00:02:46.590> other<00:02:46.799> units<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.340> if

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
out of the way by by other units and if

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.180 
out of the way by by other units and if
his<00:02:48.360> player<00:02:48.629> wanted<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.200> he<00:02:49.769> could<00:02:49.799> probably

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
his player wanted to he could probably

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.190 
his player wanted to he could probably
get<00:02:50.489> one<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.150> three<00:02:51.480> servings<00:02:51.690> into<00:02:52.109> my

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
get one to three servings into my

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.119 
get one to three servings into my
mineral<00:02:52.410> line<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:52.829> would<00:02:52.950> have<00:02:53.040> been

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
mineral line and I would have been

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.830 
mineral line and I would have been
screwed<00:02:53.519> here<00:02:53.730> because<00:02:53.970> isn't<00:02:54.120> wolof<00:02:54.569> good

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
screwed here because isn't wolof good

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.710 
screwed here because isn't wolof good
enough<00:02:55.049> but<00:02:55.709> in<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:55.950> case<00:02:56.220> he<00:02:57.120> doesn't<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
enough but in this case he doesn't and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.199 
enough but in this case he doesn't and
he<00:02:58.430> just<00:02:59.430> lets<00:02:59.849> me<00:03:00.090> beat<00:03:00.540> him<00:03:00.720> up<00:03:01.940> now<00:03:02.940> right

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
he just lets me beat him up now right

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.740 
he just lets me beat him up now right
here<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.540> very<00:03:03.720> important<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:06.359> zealot<00:03:06.629> is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
here is very important the zealot is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.660 
here is very important the zealot is
able<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.109> take<00:03:07.349> on<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.560> think<00:03:07.920> three<00:03:08.160> zerglings

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
able to take on I think three zerglings

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.610 
able to take on I think three zerglings
at<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.819> time<00:03:09.060> but<00:03:09.810> its<00:03:09.930> input<00:03:10.290> it's<00:03:10.440> very

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
at a time but its input it's very

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.380 
at a time but its input it's very
important<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.129> use<00:03:11.220> these<00:03:11.730> probes<00:03:12.120> to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
important that you use these probes to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.030 
important that you use these probes to
help<00:03:12.599> him<00:03:12.840> out<00:03:12.959> or<00:03:13.170> else<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.440> going<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.680> die<00:03:13.859> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
help him out or else is going to die and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.740 
help him out or else is going to die and
that<00:03:14.099> zealot<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.609> basically<00:03:15.120> your<00:03:15.269> lifeline

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
that zealot is basically your lifeline

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
that zealot is basically your lifeline
and<00:03:15.930> its<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.560> grid<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.919> kind<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.160> bunch

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
and its really grid to kind of bunch

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.970 
and its really grid to kind of bunch
bunch<00:03:17.819> your<00:03:18.030> probes<00:03:18.299> around<00:03:18.690> your<00:03:19.380> zealot<00:03:19.799> so

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
bunch your probes around your zealot so

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.979 
bunch your probes around your zealot so
that<00:03:20.160> they<00:03:20.819> can<00:03:21.060> kind<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.329> absorb<00:03:21.690> some<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.900> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
that they can kind of absorb some of the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.409 
that they can kind of absorb some of the
damage<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.500> prevent<00:03:23.130> additional<00:03:23.790> zerglings

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
damage and prevent additional zerglings

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
win this I managed to let two circlings

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.740 
win this I managed to let two circlings
by<00:04:19.139> I<00:04:19.169> was<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.579> important<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.269> hold

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
by I was it's important that you hold

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.719 
by I was it's important that you hold
position<00:04:22.229> them<00:04:22.380> right<00:04:22.590> about<00:04:22.770> here<00:04:23.039> or<00:04:23.580> else

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
position them right about here or else

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.520 
position them right about here or else
this<00:04:24.000> happens<00:04:24.450> but<00:04:24.719> luckily<00:04:24.900> it's<00:04:25.169> only<00:04:25.229> two

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
this happens but luckily it's only two

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.150 
this happens but luckily it's only two
on<00:04:25.710> my

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
on my

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.950 
on my
herbs<00:04:26.310> can<00:04:26.430> pretty<00:04:26.610> much<00:04:26.700> take<00:04:26.940> care<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.270> that

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.270 

so<00:04:30.960> speed<00:04:31.200> enough<00:04:31.440> now<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:31.890> doesn't<00:04:32.070> get

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
so speed enough now so this doesn't get

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.450 
so speed enough now so this doesn't get
too<00:04:32.520> boring<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.710> at<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:37.860> point<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.280> Zerg

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
too boring so at this point the Zerg

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.130 
too boring so at this point the Zerg
players<00:04:38.730> going<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.030> say<00:04:39.120> okay<00:04:39.390> he's<00:04:39.600> massing

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
players going to say okay he's massing

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.200 
players going to say okay he's massing
he<00:04:40.890> sees<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.250> with<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.400> over<00:04:41.580> ladies<00:04:41.790> massing

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
he sees it with the over ladies massing

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.430 
he sees it with the over ladies massing
zealots<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:42.690> he's<00:04:42.840> going<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:42.990> try<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.230> go

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
zealots so he's going to try and go

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.220 
zealots so he's going to try and go
roaches<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.910> problem<00:04:45.390> is<00:04:45.540> that<00:04:45.750> his

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
roaches but the problem is that his

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.080 
roaches but the problem is that his
economy<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.740> broken<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:47.340> bad<00:04:47.550> he's<00:04:47.760> not<00:04:47.790> going

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
economy is broken so bad he's not going

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.020 
economy is broken so bad he's not going
to<00:04:48.120> get<00:04:48.240> enough<00:04:48.690> roaches<00:04:49.230> out<00:04:49.440> fast<00:04:49.920> enough<00:04:50.070> so

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
to get enough roaches out fast enough so

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.520 
to get enough roaches out fast enough so
this<00:04:51.150> point<00:04:51.390> just<00:04:51.570> going<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.810> mass<00:04:51.990> zealots

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
this point just going to mass zealots

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.830 
this point just going to mass zealots
and<00:04:52.850> hopefully<00:04:53.850> take<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.180> game<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.510> like<00:04:54.690> to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
and hopefully take the game I like to

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.080 
and hopefully take the game I like to
leave<00:04:55.050> two<00:04:55.800> zealots<00:04:56.190> here<00:04:56.400> because<00:04:56.670> sometimes

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
leave two zealots here because sometimes

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.240 
leave two zealots here because sometimes
players<00:04:57.390> like<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.170> know<00:04:58.320> hide<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.800> bunch<00:04:59.130> of

players like you know hide a bunch of

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.310 
players like you know hide a bunch of
zerglings<00:04:59.490> here<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.030> when<00:05:00.150> they<00:05:00.210> see<00:05:00.270> them<00:05:00.630> see

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
zerglings here so when they see them see

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.080

your<00:05:01.440> zealots<00:05:01.800> run<00:05:01.980> past<00:05:02.220> they'll<00:05:02.670> sneak<00:05:02.940> them

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420

to defend against this to simply bring

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.989 
to defend against this to simply bring
out<00:06:15.969> your<00:06:16.059> probes<00:06:16.389> and<00:06:16.629> build<00:06:17.289> two<00:06:17.529> pylons

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:17.999 
out your probes and build two pylons

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:20.609 
out your probes and build two pylons
that<00:06:18.999> way<00:06:19.180> there's<00:06:19.389> no<00:06:19.449> possible<00:06:20.050> way<00:06:20.110> for<00:06:20.229> him

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.409 
that's fine and it looks like lose all
those<00:06:42.069> probes<00:06:42.369> I'll<00:06:42.550> bring<00:06:42.699> an<00:06:42.819> extra<00:06:43.059> few<00:06:43.270> in

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
those probes I'll bring an extra few in

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.549 
those probes I'll bring an extra few in
here<00:06:43.569> for<00:06:43.779> some<00:06:43.869> support<00:06:44.259> and<00:06:45.479> that<00:06:46.479> all<00:06:47.319> in
