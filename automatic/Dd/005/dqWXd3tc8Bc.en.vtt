00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.610
 I was very nervous when when I arrived 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.559
 to the city ​​it was at night I did not know what 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.110
 wait I did not know if it was going to happen 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.980
 well he used to go bad though if they are 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.060
 various 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.829
 a fear or nerves your fears then my 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.050
 fears was that the matters to be 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.640
 very difficult and if my fear was fulfilled 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.390
 if they were difficult but if we learned 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.640
 things like the distance and feel up 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.590
 a certain point alone was something that 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.790
 suddenly if I was scared before 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.270
 go away 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.220
 but in the end everything went well people 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.170
 is very good and as I say you go with others 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.830
 students who are also new are 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.830
 Like you 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 because of good exchange because I left 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.700
 exchange for experience to see 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.620
 What do you offer other countries that 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.720
 there is not in Mexico because you can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.280
 travel go on vacation travel but 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.589
 another thing is to see what opportunities 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.470
 there are in our places all life 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.510
 I had the concern since entering the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.060
 prepa and more when I entered here andaltec 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.160
 to make an international exchange 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.770
 because he has always caught my attention 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.020
 travel and in my business career 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.980
 international is something that can give you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.590
 one plus one value adding curriculum 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.300
 to apply for exchange is very easy 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.620
 more than anything like they will choose dt 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.480
 you mean the test ones 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.520
 International put you in the 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.130
 calls availability I think that's 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.300
 one of my favorite things that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.640
 has teca monterrey mainly 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.120
 this campus and the bonding program 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.940
 with foreign countries is impressive if 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.650
 a plus definitely because he loves you 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.090
 all the process you just give them to them 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.370
 your papers and they make you all the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.780
 paperwork and they tell you the arrows and you 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.460
 They do as a check list and you have it 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.950
 to go fulfilling the people in this 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.110
 campus works very hard to give us more 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.240
 opportunities abroad for 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.810
 get new agreements 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.970
 schools where you can not imagine there they have 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.970
 an agreement then is something very father 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.889
 decide to Sweden because it is one of the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.769
 most developed countries of europe 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:21.359
 they are always curious about the countries 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.999
 Nordic because they are the fish with more 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.969
 technology better quality of life carry 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.799
 towards the US to the state of california to the 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.810
 city ​​of san diego especially so 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.849
 that I am studying and what I 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.439
 interested in aeronautics and in California there 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.019
 a large aeronautical cluster and there 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.819
 universities that offer in subjects of 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.209
 aviation that was the first thing that we 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.209
 reason 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.599
 You can know many ideas many 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.180
 cultures in the same state in the same 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.390
 place that's the special place 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.239
 australia is an awesome country this 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.400
 it's a huge huge huge country is a 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.209
 country with a population density 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.599
 pretty low compared to mexico 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.280
 but the people is is lovely is they are 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.049
 super friendly from the first day 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.470
 I arrived since I touched the airport in 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.900
 sydney the people were super super friendly 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.239
 also the biodiversity that they have in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.760
 about animal plants how is it a 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.379
 endemic country then they have things that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.370
 I never in my life had not even 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.370
 imagined that there are 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.480
 my best experience because yes I think that 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.450
 like that of many others was traveling with 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.580
 your friends I made a road trip from 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.920
 san diego that is pegadito to the south where 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.840
 is to tijuana to san francisco 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.190
 when during the semester 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.349
 I made a trip to berlin Amsterdam a cruise 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.420
 by the Baltic Sea that was over there 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.090
 in with Sweden to Finland and then to 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.420
 Estonian and already when the semester ended 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.690
 I went to with other friends from mexico 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.280
 to know almost the majority Europe well 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.530
 have 70 years will continue to agree 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.510
 when I went to the movies when I took the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.489
 photos in the opera house when 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.920
 I was in male bonding page jones but 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.840
 If all these things are experiences 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.299
 that last for a lifetime always you 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.370
 you make some expectations and when you arrive 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.459
 it's a completely different thing 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.590
 you can say it was better or worse but 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.090
 it's definitely something you did not expect 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.889
 and that's where the father is because if 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.930
 you imagine what it is going to be and it is such 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.660
 which is how boring 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.669
 when I arrived the nights dark to 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.070
 three in the afternoon and there is almost no 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.250
 there was never sun something very strange to see the sun 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.199
 since summer began to arrive and 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.270
 days lasted longer than the three were 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.330
 the morning and also darkened that a 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.710
 Once I was on campus in Australia 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.320
 the room was in the library 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.449
 computers and suddenly a kangaroo like that 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.660
 out of nowhere he appeared at the door or 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.039
 it was something like the client told me 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.800
 sir very well imagined that happened 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.150
 see it there as if I wanted to 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.979
 entering the library was something 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.169
 amazing that experience is like being 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.180
 with animals I had a lot of back up 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.009
 know the culture and the Swedish food that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.130
 you were there to eat at 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:14.500
 typical restaurant if it was dumplings 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.820
 Pse with mashed potatoes and put them 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.370
 over as jam 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.290
 like raspberry see the kangaroos in my 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.290
 campus jumping from one side to the other was 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.740
 something awesome the meat was you know 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.970
 like normal meat just that more with 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.610
 harder 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.050
 I played from leaving my class had 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.600
 a class out as six and 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.000
 half seven and is now next to the 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.650
 building with some tables so to eat 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.210
 and there they put all the Arabs and 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.460
 remove the shoes and their possibility of 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.050
 all pray to the mecca that I never 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.120
 I had seen it the truth impressed me 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.790
 very much all that you do not have to see 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.220
 here is how you see all cultures and 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.810
 experiences like that are the ones that 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.580
 you take for life and are the 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.980
 that make this exchange have been 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.310
 a totally unforgettable experience 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.290
 the best experiences I think it was 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.470
 the friendships that I made and live with 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.540
 people from other countries and other cultures to 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.250
 the best not all but a great part 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.900
 become friends for life not 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.760
 then you learn also from other 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.220
 cultures even if you're in another country 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.430
 you have as an extra, not because if you have 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.320
 German friends of Japanese finland 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.730
 Chinese you also learn from their cultures 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.710
 because they are also in the 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.660
 same position 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.200
 to be able to work with people of different 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.690
 places with different thoughts and 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.980
 to be in harmony or is it going to 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.980
 take the work forward no matter 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.569
 the ideas but a common good a goal is 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.030
 an experience that changes your life and 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.099
 it's an experience that you're going to have 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.909
 for life and they leave you some memories 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:50.409
 unforgettable and if so, it changes you and if 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.050
 It helps you in many aspects 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:55.650
 so if I feel that it's going to be something that 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.330
 I will never forget if definitely 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:01.949
 I think it was the experience that most 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.949
 It was worth it during the whole race
