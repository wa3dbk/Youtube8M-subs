 inventions of the twentieth century 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.950

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.750
 Eight place one was frame 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.090

 I would say the three fixes mentioned 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.400
 Characters were the usual ones 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:46.200
 Suspect out betrayed for BBX 96's 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.600
 the strongest because he just always 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.220

 has fought and the strongest one her 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.260
 character in your opinion is for 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.540
 Simon Bruber is the strongest of Boko 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:30.690
 because he can defeat anyone or already 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:32.940
