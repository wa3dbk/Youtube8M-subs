00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
was looking he looked confused at times

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.400 
was looking he looked confused at times
especially<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> third<00:00:40.890> round<00:00:42.410> Mayweather

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
especially in the third round Mayweather

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
especially in the third round Mayweather
actually<00:00:43.860> had<00:00:44.070> Victor<00:00:44.579> Ortiz<00:00:44.730> backing<00:00:45.420> up

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
actually had Victor Ortiz backing up

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.220 
actually had Victor Ortiz backing up
which<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.350> something<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.800> wasn't<00:00:47.010> expecting

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
which was something I wasn't expecting

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.660 
which was something I wasn't expecting
but<00:00:49.230> there<00:00:49.350> were<00:00:49.440> times<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:50.100> Victor<00:00:50.520> Ortiz

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
but there were times when Victor Ortiz

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.619 
but there were times when Victor Ortiz
would<00:00:52.550> push<00:00:53.550> Mayweather<00:00:54.000> against<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> ropes

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
would push Mayweather against the ropes

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.090 
would push Mayweather against the ropes
and<00:00:54.840> land<00:00:55.110> ugh<00:00:55.350> here's<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> combination<00:00:57.149> zone

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
and land ugh here's a combination zone

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.229 
and land ugh here's a combination zone
but<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.190> may<00:00:59.309> weather<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.730> landing<00:01:00.120> more

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
but it may weather was landing more

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.950 
but it may weather was landing more
punches<00:01:00.300> landing<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> cleaner<00:01:01.739> punches

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
punches landing the cleaner punches

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.980 
punches landing the cleaner punches
and<00:01:04.140> he<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.620> one<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> fight<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.720> think<00:01:06.720> he

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and he was one of the fight I think he

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.469 
and he was one of the fight I think he
was<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.440> when<00:01:07.680> him<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.420> think<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
was pretty much when him I think I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.290 
was pretty much when him I think I
probably<00:01:09.659> had<00:01:09.960> Mayweather<00:01:10.409> winning<00:01:11.300> either

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
probably had Mayweather winning either

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.540 
probably had Mayweather winning either
all<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> rounds<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.590> had<00:01:13.770> Mayweather<00:01:14.220> head

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
all the rounds or I had Mayweather head

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.160 
all the rounds or I had Mayweather head
two<00:01:14.790> miles<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> think

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
two miles to one but now I think

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.800 
two miles to one but now I think
Mayweather<00:01:19.500> went<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> rounds<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:21.509> only

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
Mayweather went all the rounds and only

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.540 
Mayweather went all the rounds and only
I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.619> went<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> fourth<00:01:23.310> round

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
I think it just went to the fourth round

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.480 
I think it just went to the fourth round
but<00:01:24.479> um<00:01:25.159> then<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:28.050> round<00:01:28.710> three<00:01:29.070> Mayweather

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
but um then and round three Mayweather

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
but um then and round three Mayweather
was<00:01:29.670> doing<00:01:29.909> real<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.149> even<00:01:30.720> though<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
was doing real good even though do a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
was doing real good even though do a
combination<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.550> is<00:01:32.729> something<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.210> had<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
combination which is something I had to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
combination which is something I had to
see<00:01:33.630> Mayweather<00:01:33.990> doing<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> while<00:01:34.670> cuz<00:01:35.670> he<00:01:35.820> had

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
see Mayweather doing a while cuz he had

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.279 
see Mayweather doing a while cuz he had
known<00:01:36.090> II<00:01:36.119> thought<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:36.660> two<00:01:36.780> punches<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:38.690 
known II thought one or two punches at a
time<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.860> he<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.220> starting<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.550> feel

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
time but he was starting to feel

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.820 
time but he was starting to feel
comfortable<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.360> there<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.410> just<00:01:40.590> started

comfortable in there and he just started
letting<00:01:41.009> his<00:01:41.160> hands<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.060> something

but you know so they touch gloves

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.199 
but you know so they touch gloves
afterwards<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.459> know<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:50.580> guess<00:02:50.790> Floyd

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
afterwards you know and I guess Floyd

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.240 
afterwards you know and I guess Floyd
Mayweather<00:02:51.599> was<00:02:51.780> pissed<00:02:52.020> off<00:02:52.230> because<00:02:52.470> you

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
Mayweather was pissed off because you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.820 
Mayweather was pissed off because you
know<00:02:53.340> he<00:02:53.459> got<00:02:53.610> hit<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.209> intentionally<00:02:54.900> so

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
know he got hit but it intentionally so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.740 
know he got hit but it intentionally so
after<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.550> Ortiz<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.150> Mayweather<00:02:57.450> touch

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
after the Ortiz and Mayweather touch

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.979 
after the Ortiz and Mayweather touch
gloves<00:02:58.760> Mayweather<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.880> hits<00:03:00.239> him<00:03:00.390> with<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.569> a

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
gloves Mayweather it hits him with a a

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.240 
gloves Mayweather it hits him with a a
shot<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.310> I'm<00:03:03.270> thinking<00:03:03.540> Victor<00:03:04.140> Ortiz<00:03:04.290> must

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
shot and I'm thinking Victor Ortiz must

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.370 
shot and I'm thinking Victor Ortiz must
have<00:03:05.400> thought<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.880> until<00:03:06.600> Cortez<00:03:07.050> was<00:03:07.200> going

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
have thought that until Cortez was going

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.140 
have thought that until Cortez was going
to<00:03:07.440> take<00:03:07.590> away<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:08.069> point<00:03:08.400> from<00:03:08.519> Mayweather's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
to take away a point from Mayweather's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.949 
to take away a point from Mayweather's
so<00:03:09.360> Ortiz<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:09.989> looking<00:03:10.290> at<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.980> referee

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
so Ortiz was looking at the referee

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.290 
so Ortiz was looking at the referee
would<00:03:12.959> his<00:03:13.080> hands<00:03:13.319> down<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.010> then<00:03:14.880> made<00:03:15.120> one

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
would his hands down and then made one

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.750 
would his hands down and then made one
throws<00:03:15.569> another<00:03:15.870> punch<00:03:16.310> another<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.550> he

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
throws another punch another and he

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.530 
throws another punch another and he
lands<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.239> another<00:03:19.040> punch<00:03:20.040> flush<00:03:20.519> on<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.819> he's

just pissed off because it was a pretty

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.570 
just pissed off because it was a pretty
good<00:03:45.930> fight<00:03:47.359> but

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580

the<00:03:50.030> fight<00:03:50.240> ended<00:03:50.570> too<00:03:50.750> soon<00:03:50.780> because<00:03:51.290> Ortiz

the fight ended too soon because Ortiz

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.550 
the fight ended too soon because Ortiz
being<00:03:52.160> stupid<00:03:52.820> now<00:03:53.540> my<00:03:53.720> prediction<00:03:54.170> was<00:03:54.320> for

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
being stupid now my prediction was for

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.300 
being stupid now my prediction was for
Floyd<00:03:54.800> Mayweather<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.370> win<00:03:55.700> by<00:03:55.940> decision<00:03:57.310> but

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
Floyd Mayweather to win by decision but

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.210 
Floyd Mayweather to win by decision but
I<00:03:58.340> sure<00:03:58.670> as<00:03:58.700> hell<00:03:59.000> wasn't<00:03:59.240> expecting<00:04:00.220> forties

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
I sure as hell wasn't expecting forties

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.050 
I sure as hell wasn't expecting forties
to<00:04:01.520> throw<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.790> headbutt<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:03.040> then<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.610> be<00:04:04.790> dumb

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.800 
to throw a headbutt and then to be dumb
enough<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.510> happy<00:04:06.140> hands<00:04:06.530> down<00:04:07.660> because<00:04:08.660> he's

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
enough to happy hands down because he's

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.030 
enough to happy hands down because he's
supposed<00:04:09.110> to<00:04:09.170> protect<00:04:09.260> yourself<00:04:09.650> at<00:04:10.010> all

supposed to protect yourself at all
times<00:04:11.110> you<00:04:12.110> know<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:12.850> basically<00:04:13.850> it's<00:04:14.210> Ortiz

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
times you know so basically it's Ortiz

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.690 
times you know so basically it's Ortiz
fault<00:04:14.960> for<00:04:15.680> getting<00:04:15.770> knocked<00:04:16.070> out<00:04:16.280> because<00:04:16.580> he

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
fault for getting knocked out because he

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.890 
fault for getting knocked out because he
didn't<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:16.940> his<00:04:17.090> hands<00:04:17.330> up<00:04:17.510> he<00:04:17.660> shouldn't

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
didn't have his hands up he shouldn't

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.410 
didn't have his hands up he shouldn't
have<00:04:17.930> been<00:04:18.080> looking<00:04:18.290> at<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.530> referee<00:04:19.420> you

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
have been looking at the referee you

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.150 
have been looking at the referee you
know<00:04:20.570> expecting<00:04:21.109> them<00:04:21.230> you<00:04:21.410> know<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.799> save

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
know expecting them you know to save

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.260 
know expecting them you know to save
them<00:04:23.440> so<00:04:25.510> if<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.630> ended<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.410> 2-0<00:04:28.340> fourth<00:04:29.090> or

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
them so if I ended in the 2-0 fourth or

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.370 
them so if I ended in the 2-0 fourth or
fifth<00:04:29.480> round<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.750> think<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:29.990> was<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.200> fourth

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
fifth round I think it was the fourth

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.020 
fifth round I think it was the fourth
round<00:04:31.570> now<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.600> was<00:04:32.900> watching<00:04:33.290> his<00:04:33.410> fight<00:04:33.680> at

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
round now I was watching his fight at

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.790 
round now I was watching his fight at
wings<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.300> Wars<00:04:35.510> so<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.110> was<00:04:36.260> pretty<00:04:36.470> crowded

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
wings and Wars so it was pretty crowded

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.340 
wings and Wars so it was pretty crowded
and<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.370> was<00:04:37.490> kind<00:04:37.670> of<00:04:37.700> noisy<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.930> I<00:04:38.960> couldn't

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
and it was kind of noisy so I couldn't

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.630 
and it was kind of noisy so I couldn't
really<00:04:39.500> hear<00:04:41.740> what<00:04:42.740> they<00:04:42.890> were<00:04:43.040> saying<00:04:43.070> during

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
really hear what they were saying during

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.390 
really hear what they were saying during
the<00:04:44.000> at<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.330> fight<00:04:44.540> interviews<00:04:45.500> but<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:45.890> did

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
the at the fight interviews but I did

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.480 
the at the fight interviews but I did
see<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:47.590> Floyd<00:04:48.590> Mayweather<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.190> Larry

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
see that Floyd Mayweather and Larry

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.390 
see that Floyd Mayweather and Larry
Merchant<00:04:50.830> kind<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.920> got<00:04:52.040> into<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:54.400> it's

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
Merchant kind of got into it and it's

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.190 
Merchant kind of got into it and it's
pretty<00:04:55.700> obvious<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.180> Myra<00:04:56.630> merchant<00:04:57.080> does

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
pretty obvious that Myra merchant does

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.500 
pretty obvious that Myra merchant does
not<00:04:57.350> like<00:04:57.530> Mayweather<00:04:57.770> at<00:04:58.640> all<00:04:58.940> and

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.540 

like<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.620> said<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.830> couldn't<00:05:03.160> really<00:05:03.280> hear

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
like I said I couldn't really hear

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.620 
like I said I couldn't really hear
exactly<00:05:03.940> what<00:05:04.120> was<00:05:04.420> being<00:05:05.350> said<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:06.190> I've

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
exactly what was being said but I've

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.300 
exactly what was being said but I've
seen<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:07.840> Floyd<00:05:08.170> Mayweather<00:05:08.560> got<00:05:08.740> angry<00:05:09.250> he

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
seen that Floyd Mayweather got angry he

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.740 
seen that Floyd Mayweather got angry he
told<00:05:09.610> Larry<00:05:09.850> versus<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.360> he<00:05:10.450> don't<00:05:10.630> know

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
told Larry versus that he don't know

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.380 
told Larry versus that he don't know
nothing<00:05:11.080> about<00:05:11.140> boxing<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:13.000> I<00:05:13.030> thought<00:05:13.210> that

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
nothing about boxing and I thought that

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:20.960 
nothing about boxing and I thought that
was<00:05:13.510> kind<00:05:13.750> of<00:05:13.780> funny<00:05:14.080> but<00:05:14.320> um<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:17.770> know<00:05:19.140> Ortiz

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
was kind of funny but um you know Ortiz

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.480 
was kind of funny but um you know Ortiz
had<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.000> big<00:05:22.720> opportunity<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.160> didn't<00:05:24.400> think

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
had a big opportunity and I didn't think

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.160 
had a big opportunity and I didn't think
he<00:05:24.610> was<00:05:24.730> going<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:24.970> win<00:05:25.180> even<00:05:25.780> at<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:25.960> fight

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
he was going to win even at the fight

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.160 
he was going to win even at the fight
wouldn't<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:26.800> got<00:05:26.950> stopped<00:05:27.280> like<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.610> did

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
wouldn't it got stopped like it did

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.810 
wouldn't it got stopped like it did
because<00:05:29.170> of<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.320> knockout<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:30.370> think<00:05:30.730> we're

way so I'm kind of just me I'm kind of
mad<00:06:52.610> because<00:06:53.510> i<00:06:53.720> was<00:06:54.020> expecting<00:06:55.060> award<00:06:56.060> well

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
mad because i was expecting award well

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.870 
mad because i was expecting award well
actually<00:06:57.350> I<00:06:57.590> wasn't<00:06:57.740> expecting<00:06:58.010> to<00:06:58.280> war<00:06:58.550> but<00:06:58.820> I

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
actually I wasn't expecting to war but I

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.630 
actually I wasn't expecting to war but I
was<00:06:59.060> expecting<00:06:59.420> a<00:06:59.870> good<00:07:00.620> fight<00:07:00.980> even<00:07:01.550> though<00:07:01.610> I

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 
was expecting a good fight even though I

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.180 
was expecting a good fight even though I
knew<00:07:01.910> Mayweather<00:07:02.530> was<00:07:03.530> most<00:07:03.740> likely<00:07:03.890> to<00:07:04.070> go<00:07:04.160> to

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
knew Mayweather was most likely to go to

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.310 
knew Mayweather was most likely to go to
win<00:07:04.430> by<00:07:04.610> decision<00:07:06.520> or<00:07:07.520> maybe<00:07:08.120> a<00:07:08.240> late<00:07:08.480> TKO<00:07:08.960> but

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
win by decision or maybe a late TKO but

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.110 
win by decision or maybe a late TKO but
I<00:07:09.350> in<00:07:09.620> my<00:07:09.710> prediction<00:07:10.190> I<00:07:10.280> said<00:07:10.550> Mayweather

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
I in my prediction I said Mayweather

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.330 
I in my prediction I said Mayweather
will<00:07:11.300> win<00:07:11.450> by<00:07:11.600> decision<00:07:11.960> but<00:07:12.350> I<00:07:12.560> just<00:07:13.130> didn't

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
will win by decision but I just didn't

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.740 
will win by decision but I just didn't
want<00:07:13.460> to<00:07:13.520> fight<00:07:13.790> the<00:07:13.940> end<00:07:14.120> this<00:07:14.420> way

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.100 

well

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
well

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.780 
well
that's<00:07:19.680> my<00:07:19.890> thoughts<00:07:20.130> that's<00:07:20.340> all<00:07:20.460> I<00:07:20.490> got<00:07:20.670> to

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
that's my thoughts that's all I got to

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.820 
that's my thoughts that's all I got to
say
