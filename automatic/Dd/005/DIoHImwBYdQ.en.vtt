00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
form-factor case from silverstone it is

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.370 
form-factor case from silverstone it is
there<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.319> PS<00:00:07.830> oh<00:00:08.160> seven<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:09.210> supports<00:00:09.690> Mini

there a PS oh seven and it supports Mini

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.690 
there a PS oh seven and it supports Mini
ITX<00:00:10.910> micro<00:00:11.910> ATX<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.719> GTX<00:00:13.590> motherboards<00:00:14.190> so

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
ITX micro ATX and GTX motherboards so

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:25.410 
ITX micro ATX and GTX motherboards so
let's<00:00:14.849> take<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> look

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
taking a first look at the case here you

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.400 
taking a first look at the case here you
can<00:00:28.550> see<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:29.000> course<00:00:29.300> this<00:00:29.510> is<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.840> white<00:00:30.110> case

as well but as you can see there's a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.640 
as well but as you can see there's a
small<00:00:37.730> form-factor<00:00:38.330> case<00:00:38.810> it's<00:00:39.020> smaller<00:00:39.380> than

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
small form-factor case it's smaller than

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.040 
small form-factor case it's smaller than
your<00:00:39.800> typical<00:00:39.980> case<00:00:40.489> again<00:00:41.360> this<00:00:41.540> supports

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
your typical case again this supports

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.479 
your typical case again this supports
DTX<00:00:42.790> micro<00:00:43.790> ITX<00:00:44.059> in<00:00:44.780> mini<00:00:45.230> ATX<00:00:45.590> motherboards

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
DTX micro ITX in mini ATX motherboards

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.280 
DTX micro ITX in mini ATX motherboards
so<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:46.790> have<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.120> little<00:00:47.510> bit<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.780> variety<00:00:47.900> to

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
so you have a little bit of variety to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.229 
so you have a little bit of variety to
choose<00:00:48.320> from<00:00:48.739> now<00:00:48.770> if<00:00:49.220> we<00:00:49.309> start<00:00:49.460> here<00:00:49.760> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.549 
have two five and a quarter inch bays
and<00:00:56.180> then<00:00:56.629> that<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.080> for<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.290> front<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.470> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
like that moving along to the back of

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.969 
like that moving along to the back of
the<00:02:04.549> case<00:02:04.789> we<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.450> see<00:02:05.719> how<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.770> case<00:02:06.950> is

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
the case we can see how the case is

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.010 
the case we can see how the case is
actually<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.579> to<00:02:07.670> be<00:02:07.820> designed<00:02:08.270> here<00:02:08.539> your

white interior that is of course

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.680 
white interior that is of course
expected<00:03:14.890> since<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.460> white<00:03:15.700> case<00:03:16.000> now

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
expected since this is a white case now

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.780 
expected since this is a white case now
you<00:03:16.720> do<00:03:17.050> have<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.260> very<00:03:17.620> large<00:03:17.890> CPU<00:03:18.400> cutout

right here you have your internal 3.0
connector<00:03:22.990> right<00:03:23.140> there<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.740> do<00:03:23.860> have<00:03:23.890> your

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
connector right there you do have your

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.710 
connector right there you do have your
fan<00:03:24.340> connectors<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:24.970> front<00:03:25.180> fans<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.660> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
fan connectors for the front fans and I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.360 
fan connectors for the front fans and I
did<00:03:25.870> want<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.080> mention<00:03:26.230> they<00:03:26.530> are<00:03:26.740> sleeve<00:03:27.100> and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
did want to mention they are sleeve and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.010 
did want to mention they are sleeve and
they're<00:03:27.820> white<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.420> they<00:03:28.540> do<00:03:28.600> match<00:03:28.990> the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
they're white so they do match the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.370 
they're white so they do match the

two-and-a-half inch hard drive the last

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.800 
two-and-a-half inch hard drive the last
thing<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.370> want<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.580> mention<00:04:00.760> about<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.360> inside

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
thing I want to mention about the inside

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.260 
thing I want to mention about the inside
of<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:02.110> case<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.560> there's<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.040> little

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
of the case is there's this little

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.370 
of the case is there's this little
plastic<00:04:04.270> thing<00:04:04.690> right<00:04:04.870> here<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.170> what<00:04:05.260> this

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
plastic thing right here and what this

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.650 
plastic thing right here and what this
actually<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.890> it's<00:04:06.520> a<00:04:06.610> support<00:04:07.090> for<00:04:07.330> your<00:04:07.480> CPU

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
actually is it's a support for your CPU

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.970 
actually is it's a support for your CPU
core<00:04:08.080> so<00:04:08.230> if<00:04:08.320> you're<00:04:08.440> gonna<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.680> using<00:04:08.890> a

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
core so if you're gonna be using a

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.280 
core so if you're gonna be using a
larger<00:04:09.370> CPU<00:04:09.790> cooler<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.630> can<00:04:10.660> actually<00:04:10.959> move

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
larger CPU cooler you can actually move

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.320 
larger CPU cooler you can actually move
this<00:04:11.440> up<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.770> adjust<00:04:11.890> it<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.820> take<00:04:13.209> the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
this up and adjust it to take the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.060 
this up and adjust it to take the
pressure<00:04:13.540> off<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:13.959> CPU<00:04:14.560> cooler<00:04:14.800> or

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
pressure off that CPU cooler or

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.880 
pressure off that CPU cooler or
something<00:04:15.790> along<00:04:15.970> those<00:04:16.030> lines<00:04:16.799> now<00:04:17.799> I've

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
something along those lines now I've

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.680 
something along those lines now I've
taken<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.370> second<00:04:18.730> side<00:04:18.880> panel<00:04:19.239> off<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.510> case

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
taken the second side panel off the case

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.789 
taken the second side panel off the case
so<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.930> can<00:04:19.959> kind<00:04:20.230> of<00:04:20.260> get<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.530> look<00:04:20.680> at

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
so you can kind of get it look at

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.770 
so you can kind of get it look at
everything<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.609> do<00:04:21.760> notice<00:04:22.000> there's<00:04:22.300> one<00:04:22.540> two

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
everything you do notice there's one two

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.010 
everything you do notice there's one two
three<00:04:24.030> cable<00:04:25.030> routing<00:04:25.330> holes<00:04:25.540> which<00:04:25.840> is

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
three cable routing holes which is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.720 
three cable routing holes which is
actually<00:04:26.440> pretty<00:04:26.650> nice<00:04:26.830> now<00:04:27.310> they<00:04:27.460> don't<00:04:27.580> have

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
actually pretty nice now they don't have

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.970 
actually pretty nice now they don't have
the<00:04:27.940> rubber<00:04:28.150> inserts<00:04:28.570> but<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:28.960> all<00:04:29.140> of<00:04:29.530> the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
the rubber inserts but that all of the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.860 
the rubber inserts but that all of the
metal<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.640> on<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.090> inside<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.419> case<00:04:31.690> is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
metal in on the inside this case is

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.380 
metal in on the inside this case is
rounded<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:32.470> it's<00:04:33.160> very<00:04:33.550> unlikely<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.120> you

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
rounded so it's very unlikely that you

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.420 
rounded so it's very unlikely that you
are<00:04:34.600> going<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:34.900> cut<00:04:35.110> yourself<00:04:35.230> again<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:36.220> very

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
are going to cut yourself again the very

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.310 
are going to cut yourself again the very
large<00:04:36.640> CPU<00:04:37.090> cutout<00:04:37.480> right<00:04:37.660> here<00:04:37.870> as<00:04:37.990> well<00:04:38.169> and

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
large CPU cutout right here as well and

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.310 
large CPU cutout right here as well and
there's<00:04:38.530> actually<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.830> smaller<00:04:39.220> little<00:04:40.320> cable

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
there's actually a smaller little cable

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
there's actually a smaller little cable
routing<00:04:41.530> hole<00:04:41.650> down<00:04:41.830> there<00:04:41.950> as<00:04:42.070> well<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:42.220> I

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
routing hole down there as well so I

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.150 
routing hole down there as well so I
guess<00:04:42.580> that's<00:04:42.880> four<00:04:43.210> total

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
guess that's four total

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.340 
guess that's four total
also<00:04:44.640> one<00:04:45.060> thing<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.330> note<00:04:45.510> about<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:46.080> case

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
also one thing to note about this case

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.740 
also one thing to note about this case
too<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.850> motherboard<00:04:48.330> tray<00:04:48.630> is

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
too is that this motherboard tray is

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.140 
too is that this motherboard tray is
actually<00:04:49.290> removable<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.280> remove<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.730> you

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
actually removable and to remove it you

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.630 
actually removable and to remove it you
simply<00:04:51.480> take<00:04:51.690> out<00:04:51.870> one<00:04:52.200> screw<00:04:52.500> here<00:04:52.800> one<00:04:53.400> screw

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
simply take out one screw here one screw

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.300 
simply take out one screw here one screw
down<00:04:53.790> here<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.270> then<00:04:54.390> there's<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.720> screw<00:04:55.310> right

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
down here and then there's a screw right

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.680 
down here and then there's a screw right
there<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:56.820> I'm<00:04:56.910> gonna<00:04:57.030> go<00:04:57.090> ahead<00:04:57.210> and<00:04:57.330> show<00:04:57.630> you

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
there so I'm gonna go ahead and show you

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.260 
there so I'm gonna go ahead and show you
how<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:57.960> do<00:04:58.140> that<00:04:58.380> so<00:04:59.040> now<00:04:59.250> I've<00:04:59.520> taken<00:04:59.760> out<00:05:00.030> the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
how to do that so now I've taken out the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.910 
how to do that so now I've taken out the
three<00:05:00.570> necessary<00:05:00.750> screws<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.560> I've<00:05:01.680> moved

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
three necessary screws and I've moved

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.190 
three necessary screws and I've moved
our<00:05:02.220> wires<00:05:02.820> out<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> way<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.480> the<00:05:03.840> easiest

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
our wires out of the way and the easiest

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.990 
our wires out of the way and the easiest
way<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.440> take<00:05:04.800> out<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:05.190> motherboard<00:05:05.550> shred

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
way to take out this motherboard shred

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.340 
way to take out this motherboard shred
is<00:05:06.240> extremely<00:05:06.900> simple
