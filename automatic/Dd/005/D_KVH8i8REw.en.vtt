00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
you have to have a lot of time on your

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.340 
you have to have a lot of time on your
hands<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.209> um<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:29.989> need<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.319> very

very careful now

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.940 
very careful now
pretty<00:02:34.040> much<00:02:34.209> you're<00:02:35.209> an<00:02:35.300> apply<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:36.050> decent

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
pretty much you're an apply a decent

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.690 
pretty much you're an apply a decent
amount<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.340> glue<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.269> bottom<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.980> would

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
amount of glue on the bottom I would

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.460 
amount of glue on the bottom I would
recommend<00:02:41.150> starting<00:02:41.209> at<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> heel<00:02:41.959> always

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
recommend starting at the heel always

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.800 
recommend starting at the heel always
start<00:02:42.739> at<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.890> heel<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:44.420> don't<00:02:44.630> want

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
start at the heel because you don't want

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.890 
start at the heel because you don't want
to<00:02:47.410> overdo<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:49.060> don't<00:02:50.060> know<00:02:50.150> how<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.269> say<00:02:50.720> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
to overdo it I don't know how to say it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.250 
to overdo it I don't know how to say it
but<00:02:51.019> like<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.950> want<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.160> make<00:02:52.280> sure<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.610> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
but like you want to make sure that the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.770 
but like you want to make sure that the
everything<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.620> lined<00:02:55.250> up<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:56.540> where<00:02:56.660> it's

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
everything is lined up to where it's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.949 
everything is lined up to where it's
supposed<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.170> be<00:02:58.299> usually<00:02:59.299> if<00:02:59.569> you<00:02:59.660> start<00:02:59.900> at

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
supposed to be usually if you start at

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.229 
supposed to be usually if you start at
the<00:02:59.989> front<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.650> messes<00:03:01.010> up<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:02.030> want

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
the front it messes up and you want

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.900 
the front it messes up and you want
everything<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.690> be<00:03:02.840> flush<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.790> the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
everything to be flush so this is the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.120 
everything to be flush so this is the
way<00:03:05.030> of<00:03:05.180> doing<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.569> just<00:03:05.780> apply<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.530> glue<00:03:06.890> to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
way of doing it just apply the glue to

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.560 
way of doing it just apply the glue to
the<00:03:07.459> shoe<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.790> don't<00:03:07.940> need<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.150> put<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
the shoe you don't need to put it on the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.800 
the shoe you don't need to put it on the
sole<00:03:08.840> if<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.829> um<00:03:10.130> have<00:03:10.970> enough<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.690> you

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
sole if you um have enough on here you

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.400 
sole if you um have enough on here you
should<00:03:11.959> be<00:03:12.079> good<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.350> go<00:03:12.640> now<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.989> want<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.260> put

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
should be good to go now you want to put

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.509 
should be good to go now you want to put
the<00:03:15.530> sole<00:03:15.799> on<00:03:16.720> when<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.200> glue<00:03:18.500> is<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:19.359> curing

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
the sole on when the glue is like curing

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.349 
the sole on when the glue is like curing
you<00:03:22.519> don't<00:03:22.640> want<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.820> put<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:23.150> with<00:03:23.329> the

sole is completely wet or the glue is
completely<00:03:25.370> wet<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.750> want<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.079> glue<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.260> dry

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
completely wet you want the glue to dry

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.340 
completely wet you want the glue to dry
up<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.370> little<00:03:28.400> bit<00:03:28.840> it'll<00:03:29.840> be<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> very

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
up just a little bit it'll be a very

up just a little bit it'll be a very
very<00:03:30.590> sticky<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.280> that's<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:33.019> perfect<00:03:33.320> time

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
very sticky and that's the perfect time

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
to put the soles on so then you don't

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.740 
to put the soles on so then you don't
have<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.019> clamp<00:03:36.459> for<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:38.150> won't<00:03:38.329> be<00:03:38.510> sitting

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
have to clamp for you won't be sitting

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.160 
have to clamp for you won't be sitting
here<00:03:38.959> clapping<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.560> for<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.799> long<00:03:40.160> long<00:03:40.459> time<00:03:41.170> in

here clapping it for a long long time in

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.080 
here clapping it for a long long time in
my<00:03:43.040> case<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:44.200> usually<00:03:45.200> start<00:03:45.500> clamping<00:03:46.040> with<00:03:46.910> my

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
my case I usually start clamping with my

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.150 
my case I usually start clamping with my
hands<00:03:47.510> on<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.720> heel<00:03:48.260> that's<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.680> only<00:03:48.920> part

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
hands on the heel that's the only part

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.039 
hands on the heel that's the only part
that<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.370> clamp<00:03:49.700> with<00:03:49.850> my<00:03:49.970> hands<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.720> rest<00:03:50.930> I

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
that I clamp with my hands the rest I

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.910 
that I clamp with my hands the rest I
use<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> shoelace

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
use a shoelace

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.530 
use a shoelace
but<00:03:52.459> um<00:03:53.140> for<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.230> sake<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:54.829> video<00:03:55.010> I'm

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
but um for the sake of this video I'm

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.390 
but um for the sake of this video I'm
just<00:03:56.540> going<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.989> clamp<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.470> with<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.650> shoelace<00:03:57.950> I

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
just going to clamp it with a shoelace I

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.800 
just going to clamp it with a shoelace I
don't<00:03:58.579> really<00:03:58.760> care<00:03:59.030> about<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.329> creasing<00:03:59.720> on

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
don't really care about the creasing on

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.809 
don't really care about the creasing on
here<00:04:00.019> because<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.260> could<00:04:00.440> fix<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.829> but<00:04:01.370> usually

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
here because I could fix it but usually

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.180 
here because I could fix it but usually
the<00:04:01.940> back<00:04:02.150> will<00:04:02.359> get<00:04:02.450> smashed<00:04:02.840> if<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.650> um<00:04:03.920> if

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
the back will get smashed if you um if

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.740 
the back will get smashed if you um if
you<00:04:04.910> clamp<00:04:05.329> it<00:04:05.540> with<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:07.640> shoelace<00:04:08.329> but<00:04:08.630> if

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
you clamp it with the shoelace but if

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.289 
you clamp it with the shoelace but if
you<00:04:08.840> want<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.049> take<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:09.350> risk<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:10.579> my<00:04:10.819> guest

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299

using a q-tip to get the edges make sure
I<00:04:32.949> get<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.220> edges<00:04:33.550> those<00:04:34.389> are<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:34.630> most

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
pointers and stuff all right so we're

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.529 
pointers and stuff all right so we're
starting<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.050> time-lapse<00:05:08.500> right<00:05:08.800> now

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
starting the time-lapse right now

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.839 
starting the time-lapse right now
basically<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.800> point<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.220> main<00:05:12.370> pointers<00:05:12.759> I

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
basically the point the main pointers I

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.879 
basically the point the main pointers I
should<00:05:13.030> give<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.210> guys<00:05:13.360> is<00:05:13.750> always<00:05:14.080> start<00:05:14.710> at

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
should give you guys is always start at

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.650 
should give you guys is always start at
the<00:05:15.039> back<00:05:15.250> make<00:05:15.669> sure<00:05:15.849> that<00:05:15.970> everything<00:05:16.449> looks

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
the back make sure that everything looks

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.050 
the back make sure that everything looks
flush<00:05:17.050> make<00:05:17.800> sure<00:05:17.979> that<00:05:18.159> the<00:05:18.310> sides<00:05:18.669> line<00:05:19.030> up

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
flush make sure that the sides line up

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.210 
flush make sure that the sides line up
perfectly<00:05:19.720> or<00:05:20.020> else<00:05:20.199> you'll<00:05:20.560> have<00:05:20.740> one<00:05:20.979> side

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
perfectly or else you'll have one side

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.710 
perfectly or else you'll have one side
that's<00:05:21.250> longer<00:05:21.759> than<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.030> other<00:05:22.180> side<00:05:22.479> and<00:05:22.659> it

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
that's longer than the other side and it

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.719 
that's longer than the other side and it
might<00:05:22.900> go<00:05:23.470> over<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:23.979> edge<00:05:24.130> or<00:05:24.370> something<00:05:24.639> like

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
might go over the edge or something like

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.600 
might go over the edge or something like
that<00:05:24.940> so<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.150> want<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.419> just<00:05:25.900> make<00:05:26.139> sure<00:05:26.169> that

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
that so you want to just make sure that

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.219 
that so you want to just make sure that
you<00:05:27.610> start<00:05:27.880> off<00:05:27.970> with<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.210> back<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.690> make

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
you start off with the back and make

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.439 
you start off with the back and make
sure<00:05:29.259> that<00:05:29.530> it's<00:05:29.710> flush<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.460> then<00:05:31.000> before<00:05:31.150> you

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
sure that it's flush and then before you

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.600 
sure that it's flush and then before you
move<00:05:31.659> on<00:05:31.870> make<00:05:32.259> sure<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.770> portion<00:05:33.520> that

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
move on make sure that the portion that

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.180 
move on make sure that the portion that
you<00:05:33.669> just<00:05:34.000> glued<00:05:34.270> is<00:05:34.479> dry<00:05:34.750> now<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.740> didn't<00:05:36.070> get

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
is pretty much the idea you get the idea

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.450 
is pretty much the idea you get the idea
of<00:05:48.059> how<00:05:48.179> to<00:05:48.240> do<00:05:48.449> it<00:05:48.599> use<00:05:49.169> a<00:05:49.259> q-tip<00:05:49.559> to<00:05:50.099> get<00:05:50.249> into

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
of how to do it use a q-tip to get into

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.309 
of how to do it use a q-tip to get into
the<00:05:50.580> small<00:05:50.819> crevices<00:05:51.330> and<00:05:51.659> you<00:05:51.809> use<00:05:51.929> the<00:05:52.080> big

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
the small crevices and you use the big

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:55.820 
the small crevices and you use the big
Brush<00:05:52.369> to<00:05:53.479> go<00:05:54.479> over<00:05:54.719> your<00:05:54.809> like<00:05:54.959> bigger<00:05:55.319> areas

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
Brush to go over your like bigger areas

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.119 
Brush to go over your like bigger areas
and<00:05:56.869> once<00:05:57.869> you<00:05:57.990> glue<00:05:58.199> it<00:05:58.379> you<00:05:58.679> just<00:05:58.860> go<00:05:59.009> ahead

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
and once you glue it you just go ahead

and once you glue it you just go ahead
and<00:05:59.369> tie<00:05:59.639> the<00:06:00.059> string<00:06:00.360> around<00:06:00.389> it<00:06:01.279> kind<00:06:02.279> of

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:02.429 
and tie the string around it kind of

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.929 
and tie the string around it kind of
like<00:06:02.580> a<00:06:02.610> shoelace<00:06:02.879> when<00:06:03.449> you<00:06:04.699> you<00:06:05.699> don't<00:06:05.879> make

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
the loops yet and you just you just tie

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.909 
the loops yet and you just you just tie
it<00:06:08.550> and<00:06:09.240> then<00:06:09.869> if<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.050> tie<00:06:10.229> it<00:06:10.289> again<00:06:10.529> and<00:06:10.770> be
