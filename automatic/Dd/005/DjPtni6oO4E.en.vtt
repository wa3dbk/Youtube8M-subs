anything<00:02:33.230> else<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.400> think<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:35.000> lot<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.180> people

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
anything else so I think a lot of people

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.039 
anything else so I think a lot of people
who<00:02:35.720> choose<00:02:35.750> stories<00:02:36.530> now<00:02:37.510> look<00:02:38.510> at<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.840> I

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
who choose stories now look at it I

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.199 
who choose stories now look at it I
think<00:02:39.620> from<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.860> monetary<00:02:40.280> point<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.730> view<00:02:40.910> and

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
think from a monetary point of view and

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.500 
think from a monetary point of view and
I<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.750> some<00:02:41.989> sort<00:02:42.320> of<00:02:42.410> an<00:02:42.560> embargo

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
I think that some sort of an embargo

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.360 
I think that some sort of an embargo
somewhere<00:02:44.510> down<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.930> line<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:46.220> don't

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
somewhere down the line the you don't

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.220 
somewhere down the line the you don't
mention<00:02:46.549> this<00:02:46.880> let's<00:02:47.690> just<00:02:47.780> just<00:02:48.410> pass<00:02:48.739> on<00:02:49.040> it
