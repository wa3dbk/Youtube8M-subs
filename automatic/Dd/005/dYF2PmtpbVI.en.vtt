00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 well 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.880
 Here we are at the test of some products 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.130
 intel dedicated to the future here in front of 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.559
 so we have a floating display 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.540
 I do not despair so many images in reality 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.330
 they don't even make it 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.140
 interesting this project given by 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.120
 intel is based on an integrated solution 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.850
 that will arrive in the coming months for the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.170
 developers and now we can predict 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.130
 some of its features 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.040
 these are we taken from by the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.240
 camera and we can go too though 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.970
 interact on what are the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.649
 solutions and some demonstration demos for 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.280
 example here we have a simple game 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.200
 as we can see there is no real e 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.649
 own display but the display is 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.800
 floating with ends here we can 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.470
 see the interaction with 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.440
 the various virtual buttons here it is 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.750
 speed is definitely high we can 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.670
 to see that we are going 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.980
 interact with the interface and manner 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.380
 very simple are obviously others 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.480
 functionality these are obviously like 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.330
 we were saying demos so we can 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.850
 also expect future developments 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.530
 obviously based on what they will think 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.990
 developers 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.760
 here we can give to see for example 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.240
 for the drawing here and this one instead 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.660
 reproduction that can also be 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.560
 interactive through user gestures 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.540
 to the user to a sensation 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.980
 definitely weird because it is from 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.970
 front of the objects which then in reality 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.800
 they are not materials though 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.230
 the interaction as we said is a lot 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.260
 quick and very fast too 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.840
 learning to be able to touch 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.870
 virtually the buttons 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.850
 this is obviously a project in 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.130
 development path 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:34.500
 we can see this device 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.230
 current of the current phase obviously is 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.129
 this one 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.129
 to that at first the merit of the whole 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.129
 project
