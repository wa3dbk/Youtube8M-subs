00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
thought I will produce a short video to

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.220 
thought I will produce a short video to
show<00:00:13.099> how<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:13.429> put<00:00:13.790> a<00:00:13.820> DC<00:00:14.420> car<00:00:14.780> decoder

vehicle as you can see we have here a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.260 
vehicle as you can see we have here a
vehicle<00:00:20.010> which<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.610> totally<00:00:21.060> taken

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
vehicle which we have totally taken

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.660 
vehicle which we have totally taken
apart<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> reach<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> vehicle<00:00:23.310> which

apart this is a reach the vehicle which

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.089 
apart this is a reach the vehicle which
are<00:00:23.880> quite<00:00:24.150> easy<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.660> take<00:00:24.869> apart<00:00:25.020> into<00:00:25.829> all

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
are quite easy to take apart into all

it's one of the battery will bus range
and<00:00:33.800> already<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.010> made<00:00:35.220> one<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.519> two<00:00:35.699> little

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
and already have made one or two little

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.020 
and already have made one or two little
modifications<00:00:36.750> I've<00:00:37.530> inserted<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.460> charging

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
modifications I've inserted the charging

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.930 
modifications I've inserted the charging
socket<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.710> actually<00:00:40.890> replace<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
socket here and actually replace the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.829 
socket here and actually replace the
switch<00:00:42.150> that<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.900> here<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:44.480> will<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:45.690> move

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
switch that was here and will then move

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.229 
switch that was here and will then move
on<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> next<00:00:46.589> stage<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.730> see<00:00:48.000> our

Pro<00:00:48.510> removed<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> wiring<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.879> on

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
Pro removed all the wiring that was on

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.529 
Pro removed all the wiring that was on
the<00:00:51.629> vehicle<00:00:52.170> including<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.370> reed<00:00:53.579> switch

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.569 

this<00:00:57.539> particular<00:00:57.899> vehicle<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.829> quite<00:00:59.160> easy<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
this particular vehicle is quite easy to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.170 
this particular vehicle is quite easy to
modify<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> seating<00:01:02.039> section<00:01:02.640> which

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
modify this is the seating section which

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
modify this is the seating section which
I've<00:01:03.390> altered<00:01:03.629> slightly<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.649> actually<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I've altered slightly but actually it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.160 
I've altered slightly but actually it
fits<00:01:05.729> very<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.330> well<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.810> top<00:01:07.259> like<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.160> and

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
fits very very well on top like so and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.359 
fits very very well on top like so and
working<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.259> where<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.530> seating<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:10.979> going

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
working out where the seating is going

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.370 
working out where the seating is going
gives<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:11.820> idea<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.240> where<00:01:12.570> abouts<00:01:12.929> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
gives you an idea of where abouts you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.040 
gives you an idea of where abouts you
will<00:01:13.649> have<00:01:13.800> space<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.640> which<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> actually

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
will have space in which to actually

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.169 
will have space in which to actually
place<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.000> DC<00:01:18.000> card<00:01:18.330> chip<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:20.000> I've<00:01:21.000> actually

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
place the DC card chip and I've actually

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.600 
place the DC card chip and I've actually
decided<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.470> chip<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:23.039> probably<00:01:23.459> need

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
decided that the chip will probably need

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.389 
decided that the chip will probably need
to<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:25.020> space<00:01:25.349> there<00:01:25.709> that<00:01:25.920> says<00:01:26.190> that

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
to go in that space there that says that

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:34.370 
to go in that space there that says that
seems<00:01:26.670> quite<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.270> roomy<00:01:27.690> area<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
seems quite a roomy area the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.249 
seems quite a roomy area the
communications<00:01:35.190> socket<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:36.179> a<00:01:36.209> DC<00:01:36.690> card<00:01:37.020> do

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
communications socket with a DC card do

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.430 
communications socket with a DC card do
Takoda<00:01:37.739> chip<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.390> already<00:01:39.440> pre

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
Takoda chip I which have already pre

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.430 
Takoda chip I which have already pre
wired<00:01:40.709> and<00:01:41.149> I'm<00:01:42.149> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> place<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.140> in

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
wired and I'm going to place this in

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.190 
wired and I'm going to place this in
fact<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.670> position<00:01:45.179> where<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.989> reed

switch<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:47.429> was<00:01:50.450> as<00:01:52.429> you<00:01:53.429> can<00:01:53.580> see<00:01:53.880> I've

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
switch actually was as you can see I've

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.900 
switch actually was as you can see I've
actually<00:01:55.050> fixed<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.679> communication<00:01:56.429> socket

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
actually fixed the communication socket

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.350 
actually fixed the communication socket
here<00:01:57.380> onto<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:58.500> are<00:01:58.709> soldered<00:01:59.160> thin<00:02:00.030> wires

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
here onto which are soldered thin wires

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
here onto which are soldered thin wires
using<00:02:01.140> lacquered<00:02:01.800> wire<00:02:02.069> I<00:02:03.289> usually<00:02:04.289> trim<00:02:04.800> off

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
using lacquered wire I usually trim off

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639 
using lacquered wire I usually trim off
the<00:02:05.099> ends<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.759> wires<00:02:06.149> by<00:02:06.539> gently<00:02:06.959> scraping

vehicle as you can see relative to the
vehicle<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.970> actually<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.360> very<00:02:34.540> very

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
vehicle this is actually a very very

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.680 
vehicle this is actually a very very
small<00:02:34.990> chip<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:36.130> has<00:02:36.460> an<00:02:36.760> amazing<00:02:37.210> range<00:02:37.420> of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
small chip it has an amazing range of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.340 
small chip it has an amazing range of
functions<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.600> where<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.320> a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
functions this is where we have to be a

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.100 
functions this is where we have to be a
little<00:02:44.560> bit<00:02:44.710> brave<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.630> actually<00:02:47.020> solder<00:02:49.110> the

normally goes through to the reed switch
which<00:04:24.910> if<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.210> remember<00:04:25.330> I've<00:04:25.930> actually

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
which if you remember I've actually

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.970 
which if you remember I've actually
removed<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:27.610> then<00:04:27.940> becomes

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
removed so this then becomes

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.020 
removed so this then becomes

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
we should now be able to see if it's

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.240 
we should now be able to see if it's
working<00:04:41.670> if<00:04:42.000> we<00:04:42.090> just<00:04:42.300> switch<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:43.100> you<00:04:44.100> can

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
working if we just switch it on you can

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.250 
working if we just switch it on you can
see<00:04:44.400> now<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.940> wheels<00:04:45.180> are<00:04:45.540> beginning<00:04:46.110> to

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
see now that the wheels are beginning to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.410 
see now that the wheels are beginning to
turn<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:47.580> we<00:04:47.700> know<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.240> moment

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
turn so we know that the moment

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:57.560 
turn so we know that the moment
everything<00:04:49.320> is<00:04:49.440> working<00:04:49.650> fine<00:04:49.950> so<00:04:56.450> we<00:04:57.450> have

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
everything is working fine so we have

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.260 
everything is working fine so we have
now<00:04:57.780> completed<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:59.040> first<00:04:59.250> part<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.880> the
