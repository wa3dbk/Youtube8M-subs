00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.309 
about it but the reason why we don't do
this<00:02:04.640> because<00:02:04.759> we<00:02:04.940> don't<00:02:05.179> want<00:02:05.539> to

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
this because we don't want to

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.870 
this because we don't want to
overcomplicate<00:02:06.770> things<00:02:07.130> we<00:02:07.460> don't<00:02:07.550> want<00:02:07.789> to

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
overcomplicate things we don't want to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.080 
overcomplicate things we don't want to
like<00:02:08.060> because<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.720> thing<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.140> let's<00:02:09.350> say

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
like because the thing is like let's say

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.910 
like because the thing is like let's say
let's<00:02:11.090> say<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:12.260> get<00:02:12.530> into<00:02:12.740> like<00:02:12.860> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
let's say that we get into like a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.220 
let's say that we get into like a
relationship<00:02:13.640> or<00:02:13.910> do<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.569> think<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.870> right

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
relationship or do you think that right

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.250 
relationship or do you think that right
if<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.890> goes<00:02:15.920> bad<00:02:16.340> then<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.510> can't<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.900> friends

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
if it goes bad then we can't be friends

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.090 
if it goes bad then we can't be friends
after<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:20.950> value<00:02:21.950> each

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
after that and we actually value each

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.610 
after that and we actually value each
other's<00:02:22.460> time<00:02:23.330> together<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:24.140> friendship

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.469 
record my commentaries and talk on skype
but<00:05:40.830> there's<00:05:40.979> no<00:05:41.130> real<00:05:41.370> way<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.550> do<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:42.030> and

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
but there's no real way to do that and

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.110 
but there's no real way to do that and
third<00:05:43.410> one<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.770> have<00:05:44.340> a<00:05:44.400> really<00:05:44.610> really<00:05:44.790> big

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
third one is I have a really really big

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.620 
third one is I have a really really big
head<00:05:45.479> and<00:05:45.800> so<00:05:46.800> like<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.310> can't<00:05:47.820> wear<00:05:48.000> a<00:05:48.030> hat<00:05:48.330> and

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
head and so like I can't wear a hat and

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.659 
head and so like I can't wear a hat and
that's<00:05:48.810> at<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.110> same<00:05:49.290> time<00:05:49.470> so<00:05:50.400> that's<00:05:50.550> pretty

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
that's at the same time so that's pretty

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.760 
that's at the same time so that's pretty
much<00:05:50.760> about<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.180> so<00:05:51.450> those<00:05:52.200> are<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:52.410> negative

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.469 
much about it so those are the negative
