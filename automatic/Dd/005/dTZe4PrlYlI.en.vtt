that many usually I would get around 50
crystals<00:00:45.270> by<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> time<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> completed<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
crystals by the time I completed one of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
crystals by the time I completed one of
the<00:00:47.010> daily<00:00:47.280> quests<00:00:47.700> obviously<00:00:48.539> since<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the daily quests obviously since the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
the daily quests obviously since the
group<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.590> does<00:00:49.890> give<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.489> crystals<00:00:51.030> it's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
group one does give more crystals it's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
group one does give more crystals it's
best<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.860> suspect<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.550> lot

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
best to do that and I suspect that a lot

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.040 
best to do that and I suspect that a lot
of<00:00:53.820> people<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.300> doing<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> lot<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> guilt

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
of people will be doing a lot of guilt

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
of people will be doing a lot of guilt
content<00:00:55.530> anyway<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.850> five<00:00:57.149> player

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600

heroics and challenge modes being pretty

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
heroics and challenge modes being pretty

now<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.219> crystals<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.850> also<00:01:03.000> come<00:01:03.329> from

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
now these crystals can also come from

when I was soloing I was getting about

when I was soloing I was getting about
I'd<00:02:58.140> say<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.350> hundred<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:59.100> 120<00:02:59.940> per<00:03:00.090> hour<00:03:00.270> with

I'd say a hundred to 120 per hour with

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.750 
I'd say a hundred to 120 per hour with

my item level 636 gear and a tier 17 4
piece<00:03:06.000> bonus<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.170> had<00:03:07.470> pretty<00:03:07.710> decent<00:03:08.100> gear

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
piece bonus so I had pretty decent gear

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490 
piece bonus so I had pretty decent gear
on<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.460> beta<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.450> was<00:03:09.570> only<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.990> hundred<00:03:10.230> an

on the beta and it was only a hundred an
hour<00:03:10.620> when<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.950> consider<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.030> highest

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630

I<00:03:16.710> think<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.550> see<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.120> not

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
I think you can see that this is not

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.630 
I think you can see that this is not
particularly<00:03:18.840> lucrative<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:20.460> you<00:03:20.550> are

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
particularly lucrative so if you are

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.820 
particularly lucrative so if you are
soloing<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.270> ya<00:03:21.480> go<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> shattrath<00:03:22.140> lots

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
soloing it then ya go to shattrath lots

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.800 
soloing it then ya go to shattrath lots
of<00:03:22.980> packed<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.340> mobs<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.450> large<00:03:24.720> enough

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810

so<00:03:25.140> there<00:03:25.410> shouldn't<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.800> too<00:03:25.980> much

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
so there shouldn't be too much

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.650

competition<00:03:26.520> with<00:03:26.880> other<00:03:26.910> players<00:03:27.330> obviously

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
competition with other players obviously

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.900

though<00:03:28.500> an<00:03:28.710> uncontested<00:03:29.100> farm<00:03:29.490> spot<00:03:29.760> is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
though an uncontested farm spot is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.760 
though an uncontested farm spot is
better<00:03:30.120> than<00:03:30.240> a<00:03:30.330> contested<00:03:30.840> one<00:03:30.990> so<00:03:31.440> feel<00:03:31.710> free

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
better than a contested one so feel free

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.740 
better than a contested one so feel free

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
have the garrisons be sure to bring

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.850

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
increase your dps now there is a more

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.780 
increase your dps now there is a more
efficient<00:03:52.410> way<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.530> doing<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.340> first<00:03:53.670> of

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
efficient way of doing this and first of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.090 
efficient way of doing this and first of
all<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:53.880> really<00:03:54.390> don't<00:03:54.720> recommend<00:03:55.170> farming<00:03:55.800> but

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
all I really don't recommend farming but

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.860 
all I really don't recommend farming but
if<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.280> really<00:03:56.610> want<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.880> then<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.690> should

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
if you really want to then you should

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.540 
if you really want to then you should
get<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:58.020> group<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.470> people<00:03:58.530> together<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.340> just

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
get a group of people together and just

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.210 
get a group of people together and just
slaughter<00:04:00.110> everything<00:04:01.110> inside<00:04:01.830> shattrath

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
slaughter everything inside shattrath

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.670 
slaughter everything inside shattrath
and<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:03.270> is<00:04:03.510> probably<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.110> most<00:04:04.200> efficient

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
and this is probably the most efficient

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.920 
and this is probably the most efficient
way<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.770> do<00:04:05.070> this<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:06.360> know<00:04:06.450> even<00:04:06.600> doing

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
way to do this and you know even doing

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.360 
way to do this and you know even doing
this<00:04:07.020> you're<00:04:07.290> still<00:04:07.530> going<00:04:07.770> to<00:04:07.830> spend<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.130> lot

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
this you're still going to spend a lot

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.190 
this you're still going to spend a lot
of<00:04:08.430> time<00:04:08.580> even<00:04:09.480> just<00:04:09.630> trying<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.870> get<00:04:09.990> a<00:04:10.020> half

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200

recommend<00:04:14.640> just<00:04:15.240> doing<00:04:15.480> everything<00:04:15.630> apart

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
recommend just doing everything apart
