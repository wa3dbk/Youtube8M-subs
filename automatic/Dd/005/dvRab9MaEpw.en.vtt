00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
desktop for example and this is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.010 
desktop for example and this is
extracted<00:01:54.579> there<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.569> just<00:01:55.750> going<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:55.960> be

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
extracted there this is just going to be

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.910 
extracted there this is just going to be
the<00:01:56.399> eat<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:58.409> programmer<00:01:59.409> they<00:01:59.619> need<00:01:59.829> to

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the eat the the programmer they need to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.760
