00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
last game that just ended on express and

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.779 
last game that just ended on express and
I<00:05:47.110> did<00:05:47.319> quite<00:05:47.500> well<00:05:47.560> i<00:05:47.710> finished<00:05:48.219> first<00:05:48.550> place

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789

you<00:05:49.060> know<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.419> kill<00:05:49.839> to<00:05:49.960> death<00:05:49.990> ratio<00:05:50.289> was<00:05:50.589> ok

you know the kill to death ratio was ok

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.559 
you know the kill to death ratio was ok
i<00:05:50.919> think<00:05:51.099> it<00:05:51.370> was<00:05:51.430> like<00:05:51.490> a<00:05:51.639> four<00:05:52.029> or<00:05:52.210> something

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
i think it was like a four or something

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:54.959 
i think it was like a four or something
so<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.529> was<00:05:53.860> quite<00:05:54.099> happy<00:05:54.129> with<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.639> second

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:54.969 
so I was quite happy with the second

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.369 
so I was quite happy with the second
would<00:05:55.240> second<00:05:55.599> game<00:05:55.719> because<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:56.050> control

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
would second game because the control

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.860 
would second game because the control
fit<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:57.039> controller<00:05:57.430> like<00:05:58.060> I<00:05:58.150> said<00:05:58.210> felt
