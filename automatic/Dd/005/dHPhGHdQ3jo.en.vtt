so<00:01:35.310> why<00:01:35.610> does<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.390> artists<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.040> having<00:01:38.040> four

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so why does the artists for having four

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.330 
so why does the artists for having four
diners<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.630> floor<00:01:39.869> liner<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.380> doesn't

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
diners it's a floor liner and doesn't

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.389 
diners it's a floor liner and doesn't
have<00:01:41.549> any<00:01:41.820> single<00:01:42.299> unshielded<00:01:42.630> line<00:01:43.189> even<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
have any single unshielded line even a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.020 
have any single unshielded line even a
top<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.049> yes<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:47.220> first<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.880> is

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
top and yes because because first it is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
top and yes because because first it is
a<00:01:48.060> big<00:01:48.420> lighter<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.229> try<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.829> as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
a big lighter and we try as much as

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.789 
a big lighter and we try as much as
possible<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:51.360> keep<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.689> simple<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.170> pilots

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
possible to keep it simple for pilots

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.510 
possible to keep it simple for pilots
for<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.100> two<00:01:53.429> files<00:01:53.670> categories<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.840> B<00:01:54.990> and

whatever<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.060> say<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:58.020> soon<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.740> in

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
whatever we can say as soon as we are in

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
whatever we can say as soon as we are in
difficult<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.549> take<00:01:59.729> off<00:01:59.939> conditions<00:02:00.539> with

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
difficult to take off conditions with

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.980 
difficult to take off conditions with
some<00:02:01.080> stones<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.770> grounds<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.399> pushes<00:02:02.990> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
some stones on the grounds of pushes it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.270 
some stones on the grounds of pushes it
becomes<00:02:04.439> quite<00:02:04.710> difficult<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
becomes quite difficult with the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.790 
becomes quite difficult with the
punchy<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.209> unshaded<00:02:08.630> lines<00:02:09.020> the

punchy to the unshaded lines the
competition<00:02:10.369> lines<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:11.750> feel<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.020> it's

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
competition lines so we feel that it's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.710 
competition lines so we feel that it's
much<00:02:13.069> preferable<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.209> goateed

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
much preferable to have the goateed

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.540 
much preferable to have the goateed
lines<00:02:14.959> everywhere<00:02:15.319> they<00:02:15.709> they<00:02:15.980> are<00:02:16.010> easier<00:02:16.520> to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
lines everywhere they they are easier to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.030 
lines everywhere they they are easier to
see<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.300> ground<00:02:17.569> we<00:02:17.870> can<00:02:18.050> easier<00:02:18.500> see<00:02:18.770> that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
see on the ground we can easier see that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.130 
see on the ground we can easier see that
one<00:02:19.340> line<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.880> going<00:02:20.060> around<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.569> bush<00:02:20.750> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
one line is going around the bush and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.620 
one line is going around the bush and
this<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.310> part<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.819> safety<00:02:23.240> not<00:02:23.450> to

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
this is the part of the safety not to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.330 
this is the part of the safety not to
have<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.989> line<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.560> tangled<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.130> bush

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
have one line and tangled in the bush

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.970 
have one line and tangled in the bush
when<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.730> try<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.060> make<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> difficulty<00:02:27.020> you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
when you try to make a difficulty you

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.979 
when you try to make a difficulty you
could<00:02:28.160> easily<00:02:28.310> make<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.700> three<00:02:29.000> liner<00:02:29.209> but<00:02:29.810> why

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
could easily make a three liner but why

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.240 
could easily make a three liner but why
did<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.970> leave<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> line<00:02:32.330> ABCD<00:02:33.050> it's<00:02:34.010> a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
did you leave a line ABCD it's a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.100 
did you leave a line ABCD it's a
technical<00:02:34.760> choice<00:02:35.030> from<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.510> beginning<00:02:35.660> to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
technical choice from the beginning to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.130 
technical choice from the beginning to
try<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.440> start<00:02:36.890> from<00:02:37.540> concept<00:02:38.540> which<00:02:38.750> is<00:02:38.959> not

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
try to start from concept which is not

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.640 
try to start from concept which is not
extreme<00:02:39.680> because

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
extreme because

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.220 
extreme because
the<00:02:40.739> concept<00:02:41.189> is<00:02:41.810> reasonable<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.019> can

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the concept is reasonable you can

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.220 
the concept is reasonable you can
basically<00:02:43.470> let<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.220> fly<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.900> much

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
basically let it fly and it's much

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.399 
basically let it fly and it's much
better<00:02:46.439> to<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:46.890> reasonable<00:02:47.930> guy<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.260> you

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
better to have a reasonable guy that you

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.550 
better to have a reasonable guy that you
left<00:02:49.620> right<00:02:49.920> rather<00:02:50.280> than<00:02:50.430> extreme<00:02:51.560> concept

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
left right rather than extreme concept

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.280 
left right rather than extreme concept
that<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.769> have<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.370> trim<00:02:54.180> back<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.780> go<00:02:55.019> through

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that you have to trim back to go through

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
that you have to trim back to go through
scientific

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.970 

there<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.270> another<00:02:59.540> philosophy<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.470> don't<00:03:00.680> go

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
there is another philosophy we don't go

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.120 
there is another philosophy we don't go
in<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.850> passion<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:03.110> ideas<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.800> fashion

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
in the passion of the ideas the fashion

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.650 
in the passion of the ideas the fashion
of<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.370> ideas<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.030> mountains<00:03:05.510> for

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
of the ideas that the mountains for

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.230 
of the ideas that the mountains for
instance<00:03:06.110> that<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.440> line<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.340> drag<00:03:07.850> and

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
instance that the line is a drag and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.080 
instance that the line is a drag and
this<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> bit<00:03:09.500> simplified<00:03:09.950> basically<00:03:10.910> the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
this is a bit simplified basically the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.610 
this is a bit simplified basically the
line<00:03:11.300> is<00:03:11.630> not<00:03:11.840> fast<00:03:12.200> drag<00:03:12.739> it's<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.620> point

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
line is not fast drag it's it's a point

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.970 
line is not fast drag it's it's a point
to<00:03:15.980> set<00:03:16.370> up<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:17.150> canopy<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.989> trim<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.530> canopy

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
to set up the canopy to trim the canopy

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.370 
to set up the canopy to trim the canopy
and<00:03:19.190> if<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.120> simply<00:03:20.540> follow<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.870> glider<00:03:21.200> you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
and if you simply follow the glider you

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.710 
and if you simply follow the glider you
have<00:03:21.680> more<00:03:21.980> movements<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.880> canopy<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.510> as

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
have more movements in the canopy and as

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.380 
have more movements in the canopy and as
soon<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.440> be<00:03:24.950> turbulent<00:03:25.489> air<00:03:25.730> will<00:03:26.060> lose

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
soon as to be turbulent air will lose

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.970 
soon as to be turbulent air will lose
the<00:03:27.370> prefer<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.700> add<00:03:28.850> more<00:03:29.300> lines<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.410> more

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
the prefer to add more lines and more

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.160 
the prefer to add more lines and more
points<00:03:31.610> where<00:03:31.820> we<00:03:31.970> can<00:03:32.180> make<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.959> nice

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
points where we can make the nice

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.770 
points where we can make the nice
trimming<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.040> knife<00:03:34.220> movement<00:03:34.940> for<00:03:35.150> speeding

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
trimming the knife movement for speeding

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.830 
trimming the knife movement for speeding
of<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.050> glider<00:03:36.290> then<00:03:37.070> trying<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:38.090> make<00:03:38.810> a

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
of the glider then trying to make a

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.380 
of the glider then trying to make a
record<00:03:39.260> on<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:40.040> leased<00:03:40.430> lines<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.120> glider

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
record on the leased lines on the glider

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.479 
record on the leased lines on the glider
and<00:03:41.750> bring<00:03:42.350> some<00:03:42.590> more<00:03:42.800> difficult<00:03:43.250> either

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
and bring some more difficult either

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.960 
and bring some more difficult either
this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.720> basic<00:03:45.170> idea<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.610> mentioned

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
this is the basic idea and you mentioned

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.300 
this is the basic idea and you mentioned
also<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.330> more<00:03:47.840> lines<00:03:48.140> means<00:03:48.590> thinner

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
also that more lines means thinner

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.910 
also that more lines means thinner
profiles<00:03:49.940> Center<00:03:50.569> profiles<00:03:51.050> fly<00:03:51.410> better<00:03:51.650> than

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
profiles Center profiles fly better than

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.009 
profiles Center profiles fly better than
thicker<00:03:52.160> profiles<00:03:52.670> yes<00:03:53.060> this<00:03:53.330> is<00:03:53.569> this<00:03:53.810> is

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
thicker profiles yes this is this is

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.440 
thicker profiles yes this is this is
basically<00:03:54.680> when<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:55.670> want<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.060> show<00:03:56.300> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
basically when you want to show the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.690 
basically when you want to show the
performance<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:57.200> always<00:03:57.560> show<00:03:57.830> one<00:03:58.310> side<00:03:58.670> of

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
performance you always show one side of

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.660 
performance you always show one side of
the<00:03:58.970> medal<00:03:59.300> we<00:03:59.480> say<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.860> every<00:04:01.220> medal<00:04:01.519> has

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
the medal we say and and every medal has

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.000 
the medal we say and and every medal has
two<00:04:01.850> sides<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.570> of<00:04:02.870> course<00:04:03.110> if<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.530> put<00:04:03.739> less

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
two sides so of course if you put less

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.860 
two sides so of course if you put less
lines<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.640> should<00:04:04.700> go<00:04:05.030> with<00:04:05.060> take<00:04:05.840> a

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
lines you should go with take a

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.199 
lines you should go with take a
diameters<00:04:06.590> on<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.160> line<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.760> lose

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
diameters on the line so you lose

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.690 
diameters on the line so you lose
already<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.870> little<00:04:09.019> bit<00:04:09.290> there<00:04:10.040> are<00:04:10.190> some<00:04:10.400> big

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
already a little bit there are some big

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.970 
already a little bit there are some big
lies<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.450> are<00:04:11.570> told<00:04:11.840> about<00:04:12.049> the<00:04:12.380> lines<00:04:12.590> like

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
lies that are told about the lines like

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.340 
lies that are told about the lines like
we<00:04:13.280> have<00:04:13.519> three<00:04:13.880> liners<00:04:14.329> so<00:04:14.540> it's<00:04:14.690> twenty-five

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
we have three liners so it's twenty-five

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.039 
we have three liners so it's twenty-five
percent<00:04:15.560> less<00:04:16.070> land<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.640> a4<00:04:16.970> liner<00:04:17.239> which

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
percent less land and a4 liner which

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.529 
percent less land and a4 liner which
looks<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.680> logical<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.489> any<00:04:19.820> customer<00:04:20.359> will

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
looks so logical that any customer will

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.930 
looks so logical that any customer will
believe<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.109> but<00:04:21.769> basically<00:04:21.979> on<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.460> standard

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
believe it but basically on a standard

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.760 
believe it but basically on a standard
gallardo<00:04:23.210> is<00:04:23.240> for<00:04:23.570> all<00:04:23.630> anti<00:04:24.050> air<00:04:24.140> brakes<00:04:24.470> and

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
gallardo is for all anti air brakes and

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
as a B or C lines so you don't have

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.730 
as a B or C lines so you don't have
twenty-five<00:04:32.480> percent<00:04:32.660> last<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:33.380> twenty

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
twenty-five percent last but twenty

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.940 
twenty-five percent last but twenty
percent<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.280> second<00:04:34.700> fact<00:04:34.970> is<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.300> D<00:04:35.960> Rho<00:04:36.650> is

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
percent the second fact is that D Rho is

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.040 
percent the second fact is that D Rho is
never<00:04:37.220> complete<00:04:37.760> row<00:04:38.030> it's<00:04:38.300> two<00:04:38.510> thirds<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:38.990> a

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
never complete row it's two thirds of a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.290 
never complete row it's two thirds of a
row<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.620> it's<00:04:39.800> another<00:04:40.070> difference<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
row so it's another difference and the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.690 
row so it's another difference and the
next<00:04:41.660> differences<00:04:42.230> is<00:04:42.500> that<00:04:42.560> you<00:04:42.950> usually<00:04:43.280> use

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
next differences is that you usually use

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.900 
next differences is that you usually use
tikl<00:04:44.180> lines<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:45.080> little<00:04:45.560> by<00:04:45.800> little<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:46.580> lose

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
tikl lines so little by little you lose

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.120 
tikl lines so little by little you lose
the<00:04:47.210> advantage<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.140> are<00:04:48.380> promoting<00:04:48.590> in

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
the advantage that you are promoting in

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.380 
the advantage that you are promoting in
advertising<00:04:50.440> next<00:04:51.440> fact<00:04:52.010> is<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.280> if<00:04:52.700> you<00:04:52.940> go

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
advertising next fact is that if you go

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.530 
advertising next fact is that if you go
for<00:04:53.750> glider<00:04:54.530> with<00:04:54.800> three<00:04:55.190> lines<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.820> order<00:04:56.390> to

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
for glider with three lines in order to

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.890 
for glider with three lines in order to
distribute<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.320> load<00:04:58.120> from<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.150> hanging

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
distribute the load from the hanging

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.970 
distribute the load from the hanging
point<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.130> top<00:05:01.340> surface<00:05:02.230> you<00:05:03.230> have<00:05:03.440> to

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
point to the top surface you have to

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.950 
point to the top surface you have to
distribute<00:05:04.400> it<00:05:04.790> wider<00:05:05.210> because<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:05.840> have

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
distribute it wider because you have

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.540 
distribute it wider because you have
less<00:05:06.230> lines<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.770> means<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.130> have<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.280> make<00:05:07.520> a

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
less lines it means you have to make a

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.180 
less lines it means you have to make a
thicker<00:05:07.970> profile<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:09.110> distribute<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:09.950> you<00:05:10.070> the

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
thicker profile to distribute it you the

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.240 
thicker profile to distribute it you the
same<00:05:10.430> hang<00:05:10.670> so<00:05:11.510> once<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:12.110> see<00:05:12.530> all<00:05:12.800> what<00:05:13.040> you

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
same hang so once you see all what you

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.130 
same hang so once you see all what you
lose<00:05:13.460> through<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.030> fact<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.600> glider<00:05:14.900> is

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
lose through the fact that the glider is

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.560 
lose through the fact that the glider is
less<00:05:15.350> table<00:05:15.890> by<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.580> fact<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.210> large

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
less table by the fact that the large

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.020 
less table by the fact that the large
bistec<00:05:18.260> by<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:18.890> fact<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.490> canopy

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
bistec by the fact that the canopy

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.630 
bistec by the fact that the canopy
should<00:05:20.240> be<00:05:20.420> thicker<00:05:20.750> at<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.050> end<00:05:21.680> you<00:05:22.340> lost

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
should be thicker at the end you lost

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.580 
should be thicker at the end you lost
all<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.090> performance<00:05:23.720> that<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:24.050> gained<00:05:24.290> with

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
all the performance that you gained with

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.670 
all the performance that you gained with
the<00:05:24.710> concept<00:05:25.190> version<00:05:25.880> real<00:05:26.240> ugly<00:05:26.420> lost<00:05:27.410> the

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
the concept version real ugly lost the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.730 
the concept version real ugly lost the
bit<00:05:27.890> of<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.430> safety<00:05:28.790> as<00:05:29.060> well<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:29.600> we<00:05:30.290> take<00:05:30.590> it

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
bit of the safety as well so we take it

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.530 
bit of the safety as well so we take it
opposite<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.460> seems<00:05:31.700> it's<00:05:31.910> work<00:05:32.150> we

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
opposite and it seems it's work we

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.510 
opposite and it seems it's work we
finally<00:05:33.080> come<00:05:33.290> to<00:05:33.560> very<00:05:33.890> similar<00:05:34.310> performance

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
finally come to very similar performance

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.810 
finally come to very similar performance
like<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.360> other<00:05:35.480> glasses<00:05:35.950> with<00:05:36.950> what<00:05:37.280> we<00:05:37.490> feel

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
like the other glasses with what we feel

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.260 
like the other glasses with what we feel
is<00:05:38.320> nicer<00:05:39.320> to<00:05:39.740> fly<00:05:39.980> and<00:05:40.310> most

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
is nicer to fly and most

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.420 
is nicer to fly and most
thank<00:05:42.270> you<00:05:42.390> when<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.200> will<00:05:43.410> have<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:44.040> entire

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
thank you when you will have the entire

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.460 
thank you when you will have the entire
to<00:05:45.240> replacement<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:47.300> will<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.450> be<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.080> high-end

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
to replacement and will it be a high-end

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.770 
to replacement and will it be a high-end
see<00:05:49.710> when<00:05:50.580> you<00:05:50.700> collaborate<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.330> us<00:05:51.480> so

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
see when you collaborate on us so

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.310 
see when you collaborate on us so
basically<00:05:52.380> we<00:05:53.270> are<00:05:54.270> just<00:05:54.540> collecting<00:05:55.080> now<00:05:55.260> the

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
basically we are just collecting now the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.080 
basically we are just collecting now the
information<00:05:56.100> we<00:05:56.250> get<00:05:56.430> back<00:05:56.700> from<00:05:56.880> the

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
information we get back from the

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.420 
information we get back from the
existing<00:05:57.600> on<00:05:57.750> there<00:05:57.990> too<00:05:58.230> because<00:05:58.890> this<00:05:59.250> is

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
existing on there too because this is

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.640 
existing on there too because this is
how<00:05:59.610> we<00:05:59.670> work<00:06:00.120> we<00:06:00.390> try<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.020> hear<00:06:01.380> what<00:06:01.530> the

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
how we work we try to hear what the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.800 
how we work we try to hear what the
pilots<00:06:01.860> say<00:06:02.310> about<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.700> glider<00:06:02.970> what<00:06:03.630> they

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
pilots say about the glider what they

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.440 
pilots say about the glider what they
complain<00:06:04.200> about<00:06:04.380> and<00:06:04.920> then<00:06:05.640> we<00:06:05.850> move<00:06:06.060> from<00:06:06.240> the

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
complain about and then we move from the

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.930 
complain about and then we move from the
new<00:06:06.600> projects<00:06:07.260> if<00:06:07.950> we<00:06:08.280> want<00:06:08.580> to<00:06:08.760> make

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
new projects if we want to make

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.030 
new projects if we want to make
something<00:06:09.210> really<00:06:09.390> new<00:06:09.960> we<00:06:10.170> need<00:06:10.350> time<00:06:10.770> we

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
something really new we need time we

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.460 
something really new we need time we
need<00:06:11.190> time<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.790> test<00:06:12.210> we<00:06:12.420> need<00:06:12.570> time<00:06:12.870> to<00:06:13.110> design

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
need time to test we need time to design

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.190 
need time to test we need time to design
when<00:06:13.770> time<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.310> think<00:06:14.550> about<00:06:14.730> it<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.810> this<00:06:16.080> is

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
when time to think about it and this is

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.810 
when time to think about it and this is
one<00:06:16.380> of<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.620> big<00:06:16.800> trouble<00:06:17.220> at<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.430> moment

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
one of the big trouble at the moment

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.580 
one of the big trouble at the moment
that<00:06:17.940> people<00:06:18.450> use<00:06:18.840> it<00:06:18.960> on<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.200> smartphone

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
that people use it on the smartphone

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.160 
that people use it on the smartphone

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.340 
wish to have something new every year
and<00:06:23.940> this<00:06:24.060> is<00:06:24.240> not<00:06:24.390> possible<00:06:24.660> so<00:06:25.170> what<00:06:25.320> is

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
and this is not possible so what is

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.500 
and this is not possible so what is
possible<00:06:26.040> is<00:06:26.250> to<00:06:26.310> tell<00:06:26.760> you<00:06:26.880> its<00:06:27.060> new<00:06:27.270> by

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
possible is to tell you its new by

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.090 
possible is to tell you its new by
putting<00:06:27.960> on<00:06:28.170> there<00:06:28.410> are<00:06:28.470> three<00:06:28.710> on<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:28.890> glider

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
putting on there are three on the glider

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.920 
putting on there are three on the glider
and<00:06:29.280> changing<00:06:29.670> the<00:06:29.760> color<00:06:29.970> this<00:06:30.360> we<00:06:30.540> can<00:06:30.720> do<00:06:30.840> in

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
and changing the color this we can do in

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.050 
and changing the color this we can do in
one<00:06:30.960> year<00:06:31.320> is<00:06:31.350> no<00:06:31.470> problem<00:06:32.070> if<00:06:32.610> you<00:06:32.850> want

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
one year is no problem if you want

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.880 
one year is no problem if you want
something<00:06:33.390> really<00:06:33.930> new<00:06:34.140> then<00:06:34.380> it<00:06:34.500> needs<00:06:34.680> a

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
something really new then it needs a

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.130 
something really new then it needs a
study<00:06:35.220> it<00:06:35.370> needs<00:06:35.700> a<00:06:35.850> lot<00:06:36.000> of<00:06:36.060> flights<00:06:36.480> it<00:06:36.810> needs

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
study it needs a lot of flights it needs

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.530 
study it needs a lot of flights it needs
more<00:06:37.500> experience<00:06:37.740> that<00:06:38.520> we<00:06:38.880> can<00:06:39.180> pile<00:06:39.510> up

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
more experience that we can pile up

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.360 
more experience that we can pile up
value<00:06:40.080> making<00:06:40.410> some<00:06:40.590> other<00:06:40.800> gliders<00:06:41.340> the

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
value making some other gliders the

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.330 
value making some other gliders the
intermediate<00:06:42.120> riders<00:06:42.830> gather<00:06:43.830> with<00:06:44.070> more

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
intermediate riders gather with more

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
intermediate riders gather with more
performance<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.120> then<00:06:46.250> after<00:06:47.250> two<00:06:47.730> to<00:06:48.030> three

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
performance and then after two to three

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.080 
performance and then after two to three
years<00:06:48.660> we<00:06:48.960> might<00:06:49.230> bring<00:06:49.620> the<00:06:50.130> glider<00:06:50.430> that<00:06:50.940> is

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
years we might bring the glider that is

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.000 
years we might bring the glider that is
at<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:51.450> same<00:06:51.660> time<00:06:51.900> performing<00:06:52.530> a<00:06:52.590> little<00:06:52.860> bit

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
at the same time performing a little bit

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.860 
at the same time performing a little bit
better<00:06:53.190> bringing<00:06:53.820> a<00:06:53.880> little<00:06:54.030> bit<00:06:54.360> more<00:06:54.570> safety

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
better bringing a little bit more safety

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.700 
better bringing a little bit more safety
being<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.680> little<00:06:55.890> bit<00:06:56.220> more<00:06:56.460> nicer<00:06:57.450> to<00:06:57.750> fly<00:06:57.990> so

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
being a little bit more nicer to fly so

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.920 
being a little bit more nicer to fly so
that's<00:06:59.130> how<00:06:59.430> we<00:06:59.460> can<00:06:59.880> work<00:06:59.940> but<00:07:00.450> we<00:07:00.600> cannot

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
that's how we can work but we cannot

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.440 
that's how we can work but we cannot
just<00:07:01.130> we<00:07:02.130> are<00:07:02.220> not<00:07:02.340> magicians<00:07:02.580> we<00:07:03.150> cannot<00:07:03.390> just

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
just we are not magicians we cannot just

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.500 
just we are not magicians we cannot just
take<00:07:03.930> the<00:07:04.380> head<00:07:04.590> and<00:07:05.040> take<00:07:05.760> the<00:07:05.940> rabbit<00:07:06.300> out<00:07:06.480> of

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
take the head and take the rabbit out of

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.900 
take the head and take the rabbit out of
the<00:07:06.690> Hat<00:07:06.960> we<00:07:07.290> need<00:07:07.560> to<00:07:07.980> work<00:07:08.220> hard<00:07:08.550> to<00:07:08.700> bring

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
the Hat we need to work hard to bring

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.330 
the Hat we need to work hard to bring
something<00:07:09.240> new<00:07:09.600> working<00:07:10.260> hard<00:07:10.470> means<00:07:11.010> working

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
something new working hard means working

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.510 
something new working hard means working
long<00:07:11.730> and<00:07:12.630> now<00:07:12.720> the<00:07:12.780> glider<00:07:13.140> is<00:07:13.410> about<00:07:13.680> two

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
long and now the glider is about two

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.150 
long and now the glider is about two
years<00:07:14.760> it's<00:07:15.150> the<00:07:15.330> time<00:07:15.600> when<00:07:15.630> we<00:07:16.560> really<00:07:16.590> start

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
years it's the time when we really start

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.860 
years it's the time when we really start
to<00:07:17.310> think<00:07:17.520> about<00:07:17.640> it<00:07:17.970> and<00:07:18.060> design<00:07:18.480> it<00:07:18.660> but

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
to think about it and design it but

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.010 
to think about it and design it but
before<00:07:19.350> 12<00:07:19.830> to<00:07:19.980> 15<00:07:20.430> months<00:07:20.640> we<00:07:21.180> will<00:07:21.480> not<00:07:21.720> be

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
before 12 to 15 months we will not be

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.430 
before 12 to 15 months we will not be
able<00:07:22.200> to<00:07:22.560> bring<00:07:22.740> something<00:07:23.160> really<00:07:23.820> new

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
able to bring something really new

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.520 
able to bring something really new
go<00:07:25.920> wet<00:07:26.100> thank<00:07:26.310> you
