00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.590
 eaton from toronto from touchdown it ends up we end up today for a little 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.089
 left 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.790
 so I did not call so he can echo 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.770
 and yes I was hot potato that day 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.830
 it's a gameplay that takes place on the map I have an uncle in a match to death by 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 silent commando day team with pro closet pro sleight 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.759
 and the marathon 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.319
 L was 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.769
 the only one I did not play with subscribers or with people from my 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.060
 friends list 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.980
 and it's a gameplay in mind that go there as part of the favorite 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.300
 tell us by grouping I'm showing you a typical example eventful and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.940
 then cno was hot it was hot potato 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.920
 at the club always 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.140
 the same start is that but small cages that it's often there is a 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.490
 year 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.490
 the first contacts with the nights 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.880
 at this level and you will see in this part 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.230
 and listen well it's about this kind of gameplay that I saw I'm looking for the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.740
 favorite of the cnosf do not say that to highlight the part but I think 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.210
 that of yourself 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.290
 you find this part interesting 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 since I'm going to do that must be reluctant I'm starting super bad 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.979
 the part d since I missed a stab 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.080
 what to eat always harm less safe black ops 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.940
 and then good as I recommend tactical for drops ie that is to say shoot 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.290
 on the enemy and kill him all the time lying down well 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.920
 in fact I lose a little bit in fact what city at the level of the fight 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.470
 close to the knife but it's still a lot of dueling thanks 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.450
 drop shock 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 and so where it went from then on I was rather 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.810
 in e per month the show 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 you will see a very interesting part 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.330
 in e a good little sailor mp 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.990
 in the meantime I can talk to you and listen I can talk to you 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 already of the crush of the cnosf precisely you saw there immediately 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.100
 the parentheses i get back my spamassassin fama i'm not going you have everything 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.450
 to his dolphin mass 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.990
 jules kibonge love it 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.329
 d it is a blow of heart a good certainly it is powerful even if now 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.040
 frankly they destroyed because he could have been as stable as before he moved 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.279
 in all directions 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.790
 r this advice i also fell back on the commando which is overpowering in 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:15.829
 a year for me these tears au mans powerful pen to my taste attention 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.619
 for my way of playing tears that I prefer is the commando after the 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.870
 tastes and colors of everyone it is not discussed and I respect everyone 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.080
 so I'll be able to travel unblocks my editorial and my 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.280
 blackburn and for those you will see a name klaba what am I doing 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.430
 estimating life in a small sequence that I do not range since it was 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.660
 well all this time 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.990
 men after the hosts on me 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.720
 and it is useless the French is mentioned at that time but simply 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.030
 to run to the point 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.260
 and that's so I develop my dear you'll understand and then what this 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.509
 joke of a fisherman 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.629
 this is my new favorite trio why 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.020
 and well because while the speeches 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.129
 e is in the air the dogs can wreak havoc and get out the enemies 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.369
 buildings like the principle go more expensive 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:04.549
 except that I can still go on preaching and that's true 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.830
 that it raises me in a chopper and farms and that it was said that 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.560
 I find it much more beautiful% and not continue to la rochelle and the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.100
 rega exceeded what I'm doing there I can blame it as not possible to the 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.589
 looking for zealous enemies see a nice little sequence 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.719
 I chained the enemies I'll do little jumps I do not know if you 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.229
 see every time I see an island to participate in the meal and and of 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.429
 vegetables here is that my ticket for a little delusion 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.950
 ats the cars all the senses without saying a real little chip 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.890
 here is anyway so I wanted to talk to you about May 24th in quebec ltÃ©e% au 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.410
 chosen moment and I like it I'm in the third episode and that cartonne 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.609
 something terrible 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.589
 it's simple the announced of the launch of the series that earned me 8 100% 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.469
 over 600 likes and 8000 goal 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:56.839
 the first episode earned me more halal arms almost 4000 views and more than 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:02.579
 500 g the second episode more than 5000 lasted almost six thousand bubbles for more 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.789
 500 channels 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:08.159
 and for that the third episode right now in 24 hours is already 3000 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.939
 for more than 500 young women 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.639
 a series that lost already hardened a level slightly the pressure goes up 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.479
 no more 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.359
 paris if you give me more and I take but the mclaren 500 I like 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.209
 why am I blaming five or six and I do not like 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.180
 frankly but it's nice here so keep it up 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.330
 now I just hope that the views to be proportional is good 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.710
 my voice is proportional to the gene that is to say that I will finally be able to do 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.520
 videos Eric Allard to my name prod subscribers that's it but I never think 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.940
 happened apart when I was at a thousand subscribers at least 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.979
 ie but I am currently at ten thousand 500 subscribers 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.659
 what would I like to have a video that is seen as many times as my 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.160
 name of the currency to know go we're going to say dimitrov would be awesome finally in 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.729
 anyway it's a good start with this series we will see the CEO of the blocks 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.779
 a second time the helico the blackburn man 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:59.110
 so really you saw the game I'll do it 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.409
 2 reshef we can not say 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.409
 I camp for a single second I think you agree with that 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.270
 here I have fun and normal on this part 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.389
 frankly I am super-happy 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.159
 1 7% is really 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:17.610
 1 top what 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.599
 so here I am a little on the rock it is true that I ask myself but here I am 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:21.340
 say no 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.689
 you have to keep going well 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.349
 themselves steamworks once too bad studio finds that this turtle and 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.069
 unlock the tanks auchan that's what is done I want blocks a second 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.389
 times dogs so I have two blackburn helicopters and once dogs 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.220
 I suggest to 34 2 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.760
 and at that moment I say good, you have to fuel even more 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.130
 besides, I did not understand why I did not even have more than 40% 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.960
 frankly it did not look anymore 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.860
 I had learned his art a lot a lot of traces and to my purpose and tdc 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.699
 exceed 40 prague 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.139
 continuing even but also beautiful gameplay that is to say, feel 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.169
 as always 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.169
 and so the junta 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.169
 hasten to go you have seen the age I have small cut for that how much 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.520
 so here I am a little triple my dogs who helped well 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.250
 and so there I join rabies rage to get in touch with the enemy this media 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.319
 mass and reissue look but I was happy 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:12.289
 jp ap 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.309
 40 tf1 frag against death 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:18.619
 so a really nice part with a small cellar of my dog 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.300
 so really here I killed myself from the beginning 01 and after I got 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.039
 did kill just between but series which allowed me to do so so 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.889
 I hope you had a lot of fun on this gameplay I was it 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.150
 case I tell you next time 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.469
 it will not help 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.739
 but the player of the tic c'st x10 liane 10 07 since it is apparently 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.270
 two brothers who are most in danger counters for this part 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.770
 so it will be a dilemma 10 07 ski jousse 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.080
 on behalf of these 74's and vice versa 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.020
 of which 44% and you're going to see here the team are made by cc 74 but these 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.470
 dilemmas 10 07 which you will have its chain in the description 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.780
 so he does not play the cac 40 7 silent with like everyone
