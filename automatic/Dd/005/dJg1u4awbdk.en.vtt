00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
 2 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.020
 my turbo bin 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.120
 everyone had an activity in the 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.550
 life that makes him particularly happy 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.800
 and for me it was always rolled to 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.779
 open tomb 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.720
 yes the beautiful blonde la la is what you 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.430
 want to sleep well please sleep 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.410
 takes hours to decompress after 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.269
 a race like this turbo attention 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.400
 ivory cut the road 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.019
 my name is turbo it's a real good 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.969
 guy over there is you who has not hurt 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:45.410
 game does not do in life there is 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.880
 still an attachment that is created 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.100
 with the character and it becomes 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.510
 really a little bit our our 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.520
 adventure that is really part of 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.670
 this project there and I did not think they 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.200
 would have this implication on six mates 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.879
 try by a stopwatch that will have to 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.920
 it's a calendar ci denounced a whole 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.210
 little bit cruel me it makes me laugh 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.100
 you still have a rios test that is done 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.100
 catch by a bird for example hello 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.070
 and then, well, they're all used to it 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.030
 that's how it's the destiny of a 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.950
 snail or bad 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.710
 that's not lucky think what 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.420
 what is difficult is to be 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.770
 the writing I'm sure if I see myself in 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.510
 doubling I'm going ridiculous 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.000
 what get married ci have resulted 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.810
 to secrete slime decidedly you're 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.640
 my Sunshine 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.740
 we already have a lot of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.229
 of game directions to follow by 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.590
 compared to what was created by the actor 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.590
 American 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.070
 it's enough 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.980
 what is that I am null 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.370
 hand then recognized that stands up to 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.740
 the dengue 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.430
 he goes back the peloton is in fourth 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:10.940
 2nd 3rd position 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.680
 the ferry is not a rebel but he is 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.710
 considered one as a sweet dreamer 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.510
 snails hover the snail dreaming 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.160
 impossible things 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.090
 so it's going a little bit in the margin 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.740
 time that's what they learn to do 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.200
 his strength he will be able to show everyone and 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.610
 to all his community that he did well 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.790
 to dream since it has become a 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.430
 reality no dream is too big and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.430
 no dreamer is too small 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.770
 it's going so fast that the rest of the world has 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.770
 the air of idling baby
