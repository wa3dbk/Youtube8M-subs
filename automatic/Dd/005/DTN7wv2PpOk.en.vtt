okay<00:00:37.000> this<00:00:37.420> is<00:00:37.600> a<00:00:37.630> car<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.260> we've<00:00:38.530> done<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.160> few

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
okay this is a car that we've done a few

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.630 
okay this is a car that we've done a few
bits<00:00:39.580> and<00:00:39.640> pieces<00:00:39.850> with<00:00:40.090> before<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:41.440> now

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
bits and pieces with before it's now

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.850 
bits and pieces with before it's now
basically<00:00:42.640> going<00:00:43.060> from<00:00:43.180> our<00:00:43.930> first<00:00:44.200> stage<00:00:44.530> of

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
basically going from our first stage of

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.950 
basically going from our first stage of
eat<00:00:45.490> and<00:00:45.670> supercharger<00:00:46.240> system<00:00:46.420> where<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.840> got

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
eat and supercharger system where it got

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.810 
eat and supercharger system where it got
its<00:00:47.110> modified<00:00:47.770> bonnet<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.340> bits<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:48.610> pieces

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
its modified bonnet and bits and pieces

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.180 
its modified bonnet and bits and pieces
to<00:00:48.970> go<00:00:49.270> with<00:00:49.450> it<00:00:49.600> in<00:00:49.660> that<00:00:49.750> form<00:00:50.020> I<00:00:50.260> think<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:51.070> was

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
to go with it in that form I think I was

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.680 
to go with it in that form I think I was
running<00:00:51.460> around<00:00:51.960> 420<00:00:52.960> 430<00:00:53.350> horse<00:00:53.770> crap<00:00:53.950> tires

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
running around 420 430 horse crap tires

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.820 
running around 420 430 horse crap tires
and<00:00:55.690> then<00:00:55.810> got<00:00:55.930> an<00:00:56.020> upgrade<00:00:56.350> in<00:00:56.530> an<00:00:56.620> Eaton

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
and then got an upgrade in an Eaton

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.600 
and then got an upgrade in an Eaton
system<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.400> it<00:00:58.270> got<00:00:58.540> went<00:00:58.810> to<00:00:58.990> a<00:00:59.020> 383<00:00:59.710> where

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
system and it got went to a 383 where

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.690 
system and it got went to a 383 where
I've<00:01:00.760> got<00:01:00.880> to<00:01:00.970> stroke<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.270> crank<00:01:01.510> showed<00:01:01.750> and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
I've got to stroke the crank showed and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.189 
I've got to stroke the crank showed and
rods<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:03.850> pistons<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.330> things<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.960> we<00:01:05.080> go

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
rods and pistons and things and we go

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.410 
rods and pistons and things and we go
into<00:01:05.350> around<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.770> 5<00:01:05.950> 65<00:01:06.610> 70<00:01:06.970> horse<00:01:07.150> trailer

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
into around the 5 65 70 horse trailer

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.410 
into around the 5 65 70 horse trailer
tires<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:09.100> then<00:01:09.850> let's<00:01:10.000> go<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.270> next

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
tires and then let's go to the next

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.940 
tires and then let's go to the next
level<00:01:10.690> I've<00:01:11.020> actually<00:01:11.200> gone<00:01:11.440> through<00:01:11.560> that's

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
level I've actually gone through that's

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.410 
level I've actually gone through that's
a<00:01:12.010> cast<00:01:12.220> iron<00:01:12.490> block<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:12.880> there<00:01:13.030> so<00:01:13.240> it's<00:01:13.360> a

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
a cast iron block in there so it's a

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.590 
a cast iron block in there so it's a
6-litre<00:01:13.920> block<00:01:14.920> out<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:15.970> cast<00:01:16.210> iron

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
6-litre block out of the cast iron

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
truck engine in America that then we've

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.090 
truck engine in America that then we've
gone<00:01:19.210> from<00:01:19.390> put<00:01:19.660> a<00:01:19.750> off<00:01:19.869> our<00:01:20.050> heads<00:01:20.350> on<00:01:20.590> put<00:01:21.070> a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
gone from put a off our heads on put a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.630 
gone from put a off our heads on put a
stroker

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
stroker

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.219

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
Kelly's crankshaft scat rods and gone

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.210 
Kelly's crankshaft scat rods and gone
through<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.500> done<00:01:26.590> all<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.740> forged<00:01:27.100> pistons

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
through and done all the forged pistons

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.920 
through and done all the forged pistons
bits<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:27.790> pieces<00:01:27.940> in<00:01:28.150> there<00:01:28.390> with<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.600> with<00:01:28.900> a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
bits and pieces in there with a with a

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.719 
bits and pieces in there with a with a
comp<00:01:29.200> cam<00:01:29.410> we've<00:01:30.130> gone<00:01:30.280> through<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.580> probably

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
comp cam we've gone through and probably

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.900 
comp cam we've gone through and probably
built<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.150> engine<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:32.050> this<00:01:32.979> is<00:01:33.280> the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
built the engine and then this is the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.620 
built the engine and then this is the
3.4<00:01:34.750> liter<00:01:34.960> Whipple<00:01:35.320> which<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.100> sitting<00:01:36.310> on

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
3.4 liter Whipple which is sitting on

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630 
3.4 liter Whipple which is sitting on
the<00:01:37.630> yellow<00:01:37.869> terror<00:01:38.340> well<00:01:39.340> it's<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.490> bit

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
the yellow terror well it's a bit

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.550 
the yellow terror well it's a bit
complicated<00:01:39.880> actually<00:01:40.330> that's<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.899> it's<00:01:41.289> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
complicated actually that's a it's the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.590 
complicated actually that's a it's the
Whipple<00:01:42.780> marine<00:01:43.920> intercooled<00:01:44.920> manifold<00:01:45.910> with

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
Whipple marine intercooled manifold with

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.570 
Whipple marine intercooled manifold with
a<00:01:46.630> yellow<00:01:46.960> terror<00:01:47.369> modification<00:01:48.369> with

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
a yellow terror modification with

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.790 
a yellow terror modification with
intercooler<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.780> top<00:01:49.990> plate<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.619> the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
intercooler and the top plate and the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.249 
intercooler and the top plate and the
top<00:01:51.009> structure<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.149> yellow<00:01:52.990> terror

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
top structure of it is yellow terror

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.650 
top structure of it is yellow terror
then<00:01:53.619> it's<00:01:53.770> actually<00:01:54.039> got<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.520> 3.4<00:01:55.390> litre

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
then it's actually got the 3.4 litre

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.660 
then it's actually got the 3.4 litre
whipple<00:01:56.560> supercharger<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.580> we've

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
whipple supercharger on it and we've

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.790 
whipple supercharger on it and we've
done<00:01:57.819> the<00:01:58.030> custom<00:01:58.390> drive<00:01:58.600> system<00:01:59.050> we've<00:01:59.619> made

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
done the custom drive system we've made

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.440 
done the custom drive system we've made
some<00:02:00.039> more<00:02:00.399> modifications<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.330> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
some more modifications to the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.090 
some more modifications to the
intercooler<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.050> make<00:02:02.229> it<00:02:02.350> all<00:02:02.470> flow<00:02:02.679> properly

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
intercooler to make it all flow properly

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.520 
intercooler to make it all flow properly
and<00:02:04.090> then<00:02:04.179> we've<00:02:04.300> set<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.600> all<00:02:04.720> up<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:05.080> there<00:02:05.319> on

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
and then we've set it all up in there on

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.850 
and then we've set it all up in there on
this<00:02:05.950> engine<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.509> actually<00:02:08.380> going<00:02:08.590> to

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
this engine so this is actually going to

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.650 
this engine so this is actually going to
have<00:02:09.069> quite<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.580> bit<00:02:09.819> more<00:02:09.850> intercooler<00:02:10.420> than

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
have quite a bit more intercooler than

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.220 
have quite a bit more intercooler than
what<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.790> Whipple<00:02:12.790> marine<00:02:13.360> system<00:02:13.810> has<00:02:13.990> in

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
what the Whipple marine system has in

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.960 
what the Whipple marine system has in
the<00:02:14.319> way<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.770> flow<00:02:15.130> side<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.520> things<00:02:15.730> but

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the way of the flow side of things but

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.240 
the way of the flow side of things but
if<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.180> squish<00:02:16.450> down<00:02:16.600> a<00:02:16.690> bit<00:02:16.870> lower<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.980> still

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
if you squish down a bit lower we still

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.949 
if you squish down a bit lower we still
need<00:02:18.640> all<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.120> space<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.630> our<00:02:19.750> bio

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
need all the space in our bio

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.650 
need all the space in our bio
modifications<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.800> make<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.069> all<00:02:21.190> fit<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:22.420> I

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
modifications to make it all fit but I

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.260 
modifications to make it all fit but I
running<00:02:23.020> with<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.459> same<00:02:24.459> system<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.910> had

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
running with the same system I had
