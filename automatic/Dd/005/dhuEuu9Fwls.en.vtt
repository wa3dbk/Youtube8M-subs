00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.400 
going into material I wasn't that into
it<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> time<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.660> taste<00:00:48.960> hadn't

later<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.379> found<00:00:55.590> myself<00:00:55.860> getting<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.550> so

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
later I found myself getting into so

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.420 
later I found myself getting into so
many<00:00:56.879> more<00:00:57.120> acts<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> originally<00:00:57.960> found

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
many more acts that I originally found

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.410 
many more acts that I originally found
inaccessible<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.670> Marina<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> Diamonds

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
inaccessible and Marina and the Diamonds

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
inaccessible and Marina and the Diamonds
especially<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.379> new<00:01:01.530> record<00:01:01.739> fruit<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
especially with this new record fruit is

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
especially with this new record fruit is
something<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:02.879> getting<00:01:03.750> into<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
something that I'm really getting into I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410 
something that I'm really getting into I
would<00:01:04.890> say<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.280> stylistically<00:01:06.060> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
would say if it's stylistically this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.780 
would say if it's stylistically this
album<00:01:06.810> reminds<00:01:07.200> me<00:01:07.350> more<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.710> her<00:01:07.979> debut<00:01:08.310> album

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
album reminds me more of her debut album

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.660 
album reminds me more of her debut album
than<00:01:09.210> her<00:01:09.330> last<00:01:09.540> 2012<00:01:10.320> record<00:01:10.710> Electra<00:01:11.340> heart

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
than her last 2012 record Electra heart

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
than her last 2012 record Electra heart
I<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.510> mainly<00:01:12.930> because<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I say that mainly because of the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.140 
I say that mainly because of the
wordplay<00:01:13.920> that's<00:01:14.250> used<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.700> throughout<00:01:14.970> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
wordplay that's used all throughout this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.550 
wordplay that's used all throughout this
record<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.750> seems<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.290> bit<00:01:16.530> more

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
record it seems a little bit more

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
record it seems a little bit more
tongue-in-cheek<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.119> will<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.780> I'm

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
tongue-in-cheek if you will I think I'm

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.480 
tongue-in-cheek if you will I think I'm
definitely<00:01:19.200> hearing<00:01:19.860> some<00:01:20.070> more<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> those

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
definitely hearing some more of those

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.150 
pass on to others that is what lives on
forever<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.319> big<00:02:38.470> thing<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.769> noticed<00:02:39.099> about

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
forever the big thing I noticed about

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.470 
forever the big thing I noticed about
this<00:02:39.489> record<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.030> something<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.390> was

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
this record and something that was

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.600 
this record and something that was
obviously<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:41.050> decision<00:02:41.260> bringing<00:02:42.099> on<00:02:42.220> kind<00:02:42.550> of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
obviously a decision bringing on kind of

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.970 
obviously a decision bringing on kind of
a<00:02:42.700> live<00:02:42.970> band<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.690> really<00:02:43.930> fully<00:02:44.290> round<00:02:44.709> out

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
a live band to really fully round out

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.309 
a live band to really fully round out
her<00:02:45.250> sound<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.000> I'm<00:02:46.090> hearing<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.480> all<00:02:46.780> over

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
her sound and I'm hearing that all over

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.840 
her sound and I'm hearing that all over
the<00:02:47.410> record<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:47.860> think<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.130> first<00:02:48.370> track<00:02:48.670> that

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
the record I think the first track that

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.940 
the record I think the first track that
really<00:02:49.299> gives<00:02:49.810> us<00:02:49.930> a<00:02:50.080> sense<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
really gives us a sense of that is the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.240 
really gives us a sense of that is the
track<00:02:51.190> blue<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.180> song<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.900> disco<00:02:53.530> tinged<00:02:54.130> I

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
track blue the song is so disco tinged I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.580 
track blue the song is so disco tinged I
can<00:02:54.459> almost<00:02:54.730> taste<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.989> hook<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.290> almost

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
can almost taste it the hook is almost

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.740 
can almost taste it the hook is almost
impossible<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.640> miss<00:02:57.849> it's<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.150> simple
