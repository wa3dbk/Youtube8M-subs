the<00:00:22.770> illusion<00:00:23.040> is<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.849> fact<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.240> he's

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
the illusion is the fact that he's

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.780 
the illusion is the fact that he's
shifting<00:00:25.439> weight<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.800> he<00:00:26.220> usually<00:00:26.310> does<00:00:26.610> in

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
shifting weight as he usually does in

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.220 
shifting weight as he usually does in
most<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.329> his<00:00:27.419> moves<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.779> he's<00:00:27.900> shifting

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
most of his moves but he's shifting

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
most of his moves but he's shifting
weight<00:00:28.400> using<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.880> terminology<00:00:30.509> from

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
weight using the terminology from

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.100 
weight using the terminology from
gliding<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.150> in<00:00:33.329> mind<00:00:33.570> let<00:00:33.900> us

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
gliding so with that in mind let us

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.670

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that the leg that slide back you don't

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
that the leg that slide back you don't
want<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.929> weight<00:00:55.109> to<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.010> leg<00:00:56.309> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
want the weight to be on this leg you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.319 
want the weight to be on this leg you
want<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.660> sorely<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.670> right<00:00:59.910> since

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
want it to be sorely on the right since

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.790 
want it to be sorely on the right since
this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.780> that's<00:01:00.870> creating<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.440> push

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this is the one that's creating the push

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.299 
this is the one that's creating the push
so<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.120> did<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> slow<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:05.100> would<00:01:05.190> look<00:01:05.250> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so if I did it slow it would look like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.140 
so if I did it slow it would look like
this<00:01:06.170> boom<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:08.220> what's<00:01:08.460> gonna<00:01:08.520> happen<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.030> I'm
