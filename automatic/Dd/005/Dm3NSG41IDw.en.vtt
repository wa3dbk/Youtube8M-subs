00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 its input began the New Year holidays and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.270
 finally there is time to fix 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.420
 another collapse 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.420
 oh yeah almost forgot the decoration 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.410
 Well , now you can start 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.270
 since the time until the new year is left 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.869
 little is not right for today will be pretty 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.900
 simple 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 with sega dreamcast as it turned out 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.119
 The prefix is ​​quite reliable but it turned out 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.349
 that it happens some flaws 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.510
 the fault is as follows 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.090
 the prefix can be arbitrarily turned off 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 no apparent reason to fix it 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.300
 decorations 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.340
 and randomly turn on the problem 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 appears due to bad block contact 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.820
 power supply from the motherboard 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.190
 repaired quite simply 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 you need to disassemble the console and just 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.540
 clean them cook the cross 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.610
 screwdriver and anything alcohol 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.720
 only with the second one be careful i am for 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.970
 healthy lifestyle 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.900
 first disconnect the modem from the console 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.730
 behind him is one of the bolts 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.110
 by the way interesting fact you knew that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.530
 dreamcast can display a picture 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.360
 formats game 640 by 480 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.790
 this requires a small box 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.100
 under the name of Goa box with her 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.140
 you can turn it off to any monitor well 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 or modern TVs in a 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.009
 goa port picture quality can 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.090
 argue with component cable them what 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.090
 to speak about the company 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.380
 Well, we got to her inside 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.659
 on the right is the power supply with which 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.810
 we have problems just these 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.259
 contacts and need to wipe unscrew 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.259
 two screws 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.730
 and now without much overdoing 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.590
 take out the power supply do not forget 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.060
 bend the small cap as well 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.060
 disable power button 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.490
 well now take a cotton swab with 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.500
 urinary alcohol solution and 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.570
 carefully wipe contacts with two 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.239
 parties and here you have another interesting 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.190
 fact not so long ago Glinka began to do 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.980
 these hole cards thanks to which you can 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.410
 connect the usual sd card and read 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.140
 with her various homebrew can of course and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.900
 pirated images and uah but i am against it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.700
 the truth is they are pretty clumsy that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:32.970
 can't be said about homebrew and various 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:35.340
 emulators well that's it and we are ready 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 collected washed even stayed on it 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.510
 yellow color well there is nothing 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.830
 do it it's time to run it and 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.830
 check how it works 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.569
 oh hooray so glad that finally repaired 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.280
 his dreamcast I already have about three 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.790
 months together did not reach the hands 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.690
 spend it in life about him very much 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.269
 cool games 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.200
 although most of it is part is 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.239
 arcade machines myself but they are not 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.620
 really what you have plus a lot 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.780
 good exclusives 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.060
 of course most of them lately 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.700
 pulled apart on other consoles did 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.579
 various hd reissues but we know 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.280
 where did it all come from personally i want to go 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.950
 one game on the engine beat freud it 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.530
 a clone of archers ridge but there you can 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.359
 play immediately four in the moisture at mkas 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.640
 allows she has four ports for 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.579
 joysticks need to be assembled somehow 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.799

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:35.510
