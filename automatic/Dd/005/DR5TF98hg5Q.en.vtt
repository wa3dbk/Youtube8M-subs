00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.229 
off toward the northwest at about 10 or
so<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.420> far<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.469> threat<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.129> shower<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
so as far as the threat of shower and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.549 
so as far as the threat of shower and
thunderstorm<00:00:57.719> activity<00:00:57.840> producing

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
thunderstorm activity producing

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.830 
thunderstorm activity producing
tornadoes<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.460> definitely<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
tornadoes it is definitely there and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.389 
tornadoes it is definitely there and
will<00:01:00.989> continue<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.829> especially

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
will continue to be there especially

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
will continue to be there especially
along<00:01:02.969> into<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> north<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> northeast

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
along into the north and the northeast

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.310 
along into the north and the northeast
of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.100> track<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.810> center<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
of the track and so the center of the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
of the track and so the center of the
hurricane<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.950> moving<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.430> bat<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
hurricane will be moving a bat like this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.560 
hurricane will be moving a bat like this
over<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> next<00:01:10.110> six<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> 12<00:01:11.070> hours<00:01:11.729> certainly

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
over the next six to 12 hours certainly

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.230 
over the next six to 12 hours certainly
within<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> core<00:01:13.670> anywhere<00:01:14.670> within<00:01:14.909> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
within the core anywhere within this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
within the core anywhere within this
region<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> expect<00:01:16.320> winds<00:01:16.560> gusting<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
region we can expect winds gusting to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.280 
region we can expect winds gusting to
over<00:01:17.280> 90<00:01:17.880> miles<00:01:18.299> per<00:01:18.509> hour<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.869> occasionally

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
up to over 100 miles per hour but even

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
up to over 100 miles per hour but even
within<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> strong<00:01:22.259> bands<00:01:22.710> coming<00:01:23.159> ashore

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
within the strong bands coming ashore

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.390 
within the strong bands coming ashore
and<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.240> those<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> eastern<00:01:26.250> half

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and for those of you in the eastern half

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
and for those of you in the eastern half

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
of Louisiana that is east of the center

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.999 
of Louisiana that is east of the center
you<00:01:28.140> still<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.680> 12<00:01:29.540> at<00:01:30.540> least<00:01:30.869> three<00:01:31.409> regions

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you still have 12 at least three regions

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.859 
you still have 12 at least three regions
where<00:01:32.159> strong<00:01:32.549> bands<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.240> thunderstorms<00:01:33.750> will

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
where strong bands of thunderstorms will

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.630 
where strong bands of thunderstorms will
come<00:01:34.020> through<00:01:34.290> obviously<00:01:35.100> producing<00:01:35.549> heavy

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
come through obviously producing heavy

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
come through obviously producing heavy
rains<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.360> within<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:36.900> bands

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
rains but it's also within these bands

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.050 
rains but it's also within these bands
in<00:01:37.380> which<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.950> could<00:01:38.100> quickly<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.850> some

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
in which we could quickly see some

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450 
in which we could quickly see some
tornadoes<00:01:39.479> touch<00:01:39.689> down<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.159> idea

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
tornadoes touch down and so a good idea

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.980 
tornadoes touch down and so a good idea
that<00:01:41.939> even<00:01:42.150> though<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.420> between<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:42.869> going

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that even though in between you're going

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
that even though in between you're going
to<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> break<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> weather<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.189> those

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to get a break in the weather as those

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.120 
to get a break in the weather as those
bands<00:01:45.119> fly<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.750> through<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.590> continue

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bands fly on through it we will continue
