in this tutorial we will talk about the

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.940 
in this tutorial we will talk about the
best<00:00:06.299> thing<00:00:06.660> that<00:00:06.720> happened<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.470> amateur

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
best thing that happened to amateur

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.509 
best thing that happened to amateur
filmmakers<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.510> shallow<00:00:09.809> depth-of-field

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
filmmakers the shallow depth-of-field

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.110 
filmmakers the shallow depth-of-field
but<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:12.509> curse<00:00:12.780> or<00:00:13.110> blessing<00:00:13.710> most<00:00:14.400> DSLR

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
but is it curse or blessing most DSLR

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180 
but is it curse or blessing most DSLR
filmmakers<00:00:15.809> are<00:00:16.080> glad<00:00:16.440> with<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> shallow

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
filmmakers are glad with the shallow

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.170 
filmmakers are glad with the shallow
depth-of-field

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
depth-of-field

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.900 
depth-of-field
because<00:00:18.960> they<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.920> create<00:00:20.250> some<00:00:20.490> stunning

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
because they can create some stunning

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.019 
because they can create some stunning
images<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.869> major<00:00:22.170> Hollywood<00:00:22.830> studios<00:00:23.369> but

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
images like major Hollywood studios but

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.779 
images like major Hollywood studios but
especially<00:00:24.750> beginners<00:00:25.650> are<00:00:25.890> often<00:00:26.340> lost<00:00:26.550> in

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
especially beginners are often lost in

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.900 
especially beginners are often lost in
the<00:00:26.910> DSLR<00:00:27.390> world<00:00:27.869> because<00:00:28.859> they<00:00:29.490> don't<00:00:29.730> know

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the DSLR world because they don't know

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.179 
the DSLR world because they don't know
how<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> depth<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.140> field<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> if

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
how to get the depth of field and if

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.639 
how to get the depth of field and if
they<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:33.329> don't<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> use<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
they do they don't know how to use it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.670 
they do they don't know how to use it
and<00:00:34.829> how<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> control<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.719> off<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.530> need

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and how to control it first off you need

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
and how to control it first off you need
a<00:00:37.739> lens<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> wide<00:00:38.610> open<00:00:39.030> aperture

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
a lens with a wide open aperture

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.760 
a lens with a wide open aperture
let's<00:00:40.020> say<00:00:40.230> f<00:00:40.640> 1.4<00:00:41.640> as<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.739> have

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
let's say f 1.4 as you can see you have

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.490 
let's say f 1.4 as you can see you have
a<00:00:43.950> lovely<00:00:44.370> shallow<00:00:44.820> depth<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> field<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:46.260> at

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
a lovely shallow depth of field but at

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.610 
a lovely shallow depth of field but at
f/8<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.180> clearly<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> background

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
f/8 you can clearly see the background

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860 
f/8 you can clearly see the background
and<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.250> effect<00:00:50.610> isn't<00:00:50.820> working<00:00:51.390> anymore

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and the effect isn't working anymore

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.860 
and the effect isn't working anymore
of<00:00:52.050> course<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.370> depth<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.850> field<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.449> very

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
of course the depth of field can be very

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.380 
of course the depth of field can be very
nice<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.739> almost<00:00:56.219> doesn't<00:00:56.520> matter<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:57.210> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
nice it almost doesn't matter what you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.139 
nice it almost doesn't matter what you
filming<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.770> look<00:00:58.980> professional<00:00:59.730> but

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
filming it will look professional but

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
filming it will look professional but
you<00:01:00.329> shouldn't<00:01:00.660> overdo<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.410> because<00:01:02.219> not

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you shouldn't overdo that because not

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.910 
you shouldn't overdo that because not
every<00:01:02.730> shot<00:01:02.910> has<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.719> such<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> low<00:01:04.409> focal

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
every shot has to be in such a low focal

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.490 
every shot has to be in such a low focal
area<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.729> general<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.510> makes<00:01:06.750> sense<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.290> shoot

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
area in general it makes sense to shoot

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
area in general it makes sense to shoot
wide<00:01:07.740> open<00:01:08.159> when<00:01:08.760> you're<00:01:08.909> shooting<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
wide open when you're shooting a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.840 
wide open when you're shooting a
close-up<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.229> person<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.640> that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
close-up of a person and don't want that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
close-up of a person and don't want that
the<00:01:12.060> audience<00:01:12.510> knows<00:01:12.810> what's<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.770> in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the audience knows what's going on in

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.780 
the audience knows what's going on in
the<00:01:14.100> background<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> few<00:01:15.810> examples

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.150 

this<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.630> shot<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:21.930> an<00:01:22.230> expensive<00:01:22.920> high

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
this was shot with an expensive high

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.640 
this was shot with an expensive high
quality<00:01:23.700> lens<00:01:23.940> but<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.050> you're<00:01:25.230> shooting<00:01:25.440> with

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
quality lens but if you're shooting with

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.860 
quality lens but if you're shooting with
the<00:01:25.920> cheap<00:01:26.160> lens<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:27.060> has<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.300> low<00:01:27.600> aperture

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
the cheap lens that has a low aperture

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.590 
the cheap lens that has a low aperture
you<00:01:28.680> will<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> lot<00:01:29.370> of<00:01:29.550> blur<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you will get a lot of blur but the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
you will get a lot of blur but the
things<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.830> focus<00:01:32.070> aren't<00:01:32.700> really

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
things that are in focus aren't really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.870 
things that are in focus aren't really
sharp<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.260> lens<00:01:34.500> quality<00:01:34.880> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
sharp because of the lens quality you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.970 
sharp because of the lens quality you
shouldn't<00:01:36.300> shoot<00:01:36.480> to<00:01:36.720> wide<00:01:36.930> open<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.500> you're

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
shouldn't shoot to wide open if you're

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.100 
shouldn't shoot to wide open if you're
filming<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.520> big<00:01:38.730> crowd<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.540> front<00:01:39.840> or

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
filming a big crowd from the front or

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.610 
filming a big crowd from the front or
above<00:01:40.440> why<00:01:41.330> because<00:01:42.330> almost<00:01:42.780> nothing<00:01:43.230> will<00:01:43.470> be

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
above why because almost nothing will be

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.040 
above why because almost nothing will be
in<00:01:43.800> focus<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.940> image<00:01:45.240> won't<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.690> really

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
in focus and the image won't be really

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.400 
in focus and the image won't be really
sharp<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.280> an<00:01:47.400> example<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:49.050> clearly

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
sharp here is an example you can clearly

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.520 
sharp here is an example you can clearly
see<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.550> video<00:01:50.670> taken<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.450> f/8<00:01:51.990> looks

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
see that the video taken at f/8 looks

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
see that the video taken at f/8 looks
better<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.100> sharper<00:01:53.580> because<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.570> people

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
better and sharper because more people

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
better and sharper because more people
are<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.350> focus<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.580> brings<00:01:56.880> us<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.420> next

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
are in focus this brings us to the next

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.140 
are in focus this brings us to the next
point<00:01:57.960> how<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.650> control<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.430> depth<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.850> field

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
point how to control the depth of field

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.690 
point how to control the depth of field
if<00:02:00.780> someone<00:02:01.350> walks<00:02:01.650> from<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.100> background<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
if someone walks from the background of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.060 
if someone walks from the background of
your<00:02:02.729> video<00:02:03.180> into<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.720> front<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.260> you<00:02:04.830> want

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
your video into the front and you want

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.400
