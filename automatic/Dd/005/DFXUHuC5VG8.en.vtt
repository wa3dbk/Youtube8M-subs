00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.700
 Montpellier is a typical southern city 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.380
 de france enjoys a historic setting 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.160
 narrow alleys and an atmosphere 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.650
 Mediterranean 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.110
 between its old facades is not 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.000
 strange to discover modern art this 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.099
 city ​​is known for its street art 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.099
 signed by names like salami 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 I paint in the form of graffiti to share 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.500
 my vision of the city and my way of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.500
 think with the rest of the world 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.360
 sadam in whose real name is Adrian has 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.699
 won fame in montpellier the streets of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 this southern French metropolis are not 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.129
 only your home but also your source of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.129
 inspiration 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.890
 He loves to garden desplantes to 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:06.040
 walk the oldest botanical garden 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.040
 of the country that was founded in 1593 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.030
 also by the royal square of peiró 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 from there located ruins of ya 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.780
 all you can almost see the Mediterranean Sea 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.719
 located 10 kilometers from here you can see 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.479
 how the city grows from the other side 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.750
 you can also see the sea that limits 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.729
 the growth of the city is about 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.799
 a young city with many students 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.270
 and also has a heritage 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.420
 historical so we have an exclusive 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.680
 mix of youth and history 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.810
 and historical 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.810
 contemporary art is almost 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.180
 omnipresent on the contrary the sound 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.680
 of the city is rather classic because 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.680
 to the manufacture of violins 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.690
 you have to tune the strings every morning 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.580
 the german friedrich saves was one of the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.050
 first builders of violins that 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.340
 they settled in montpellier 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.770
 since 1990 he runs his own workshop every 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.380
 one of his instruments costs about twelve 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.160
 thousand euros so it is not difficult that the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.950
 business go well the special thing is that in 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.170
 the last 25 years have settled here 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.600
 many young violin makers and 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.820
 dynamic so you can not talk about 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.560
 a tradition in this sense 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.720
 however when I became autonomous 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.020
 there were three workshops now there are already 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.450
 thirteen obviously because it's a city 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.070
 nice to live but also because 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.350
 meanwhile it is a place of reference 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.350
 for the violin builders 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.180
 we go back to the historic center of 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.180
 city 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.800
 here between the cathedral of san pedro and the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.650
 baroque villas that frame the plaza de 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.360

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.360
 everyone has left their mark 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.680
 in montpellier there has always been a lot 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.599
 urban art and graffiti as it 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.500
 located halfway between paris and 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:39.829
 barcelona and in france paris is the mecca 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.099
 for graffiti artists this world here 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.850
 It has always been impressive since 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.890

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.350

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.359
 the flavors of the city ​​of montpellier 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.670
 are framed by the location of the 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:06.139

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.820
 the products in search of new ideas and 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.780
