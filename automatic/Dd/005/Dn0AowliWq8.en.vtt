00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.230
 fired in the man truck 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.889
 so madam only 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.650
 we have one here together 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.540
 a dairy farm 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.129
 organic dairy farm 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:11.979
 we started guaranteeing it some ten years ago 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.419
 the usual 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.320
 couples switched to organic which here about 80 dairy cows and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.029
 now 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.509
 in the past we had killed the 60 by a little louder 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.249
 now the production has fallen somewhat because there were no lumps alone 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.730
 but county scarce are still scarce 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.949
 a little bit of sweating 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.010
 we leave the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.430
 drink the calves with the cows 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.510
 we think that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.590
 has many benefits 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.260
 does cost a lot of milk 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.330
 we are in 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.280
 we are in 19 and ninety in the fall they have switched we have 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.670
 decided to go organic 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.870
 The reason for this was that we had a lot of land 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.870
 available already had very little fertilizer 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 And yet we want to have more gas left 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.840
 So then once again with the Arts Sprinkle 10 if you then switch to 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.240
 organic anyway 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510
 that is something that is only very small 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.290
 and then you are free of organic milk, that was quite 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.370
 interesting 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.320
 plus that of course there is a very nice area here between the Veluwe and the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.660
 ijssel 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.570
 and there the government wants to ask 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.640
 really many problems with farmers 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.010
 the program states that the space is made of organic farmers 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.940
 just let our time go with the flow instead of the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.770
 not a headwind 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 the past building the movie ajax 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.860
 for the advance of his two sons of cows 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 all maes like and choice around the cows 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.159
 but maes biological building irene sandy soil it is not easy 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 in addition, the mechanization is actually not for a platform 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.160
 the writer prefers to grow more and more gas 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
 yes then you go a bit more into how you 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.690
 how to earn the most money with road closures soon 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.170
 look in ireland and new zealand 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.310
 there is a look at how those farmers are doing there 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.080
 you see a lot of things can be done differently there 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.519
 the milk production of the cows is one at that time 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.409
 it is just under 5000 meters 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.859
 around 5000 meters in the 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.909
 the cows give the most milk the older cows possess worry about 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.349
 the 7 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 varese that sit around the cane the 4000 liters of milk 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.879
 but here too, the mortar of jade applies to the cows and they experience them 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.939
 heifer calves the holes and so three namely have already sought 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.189
 I think that on the lactation does cost a thousand to fifteen hundred and that costs 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.049
 we think we will get a lot back 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.859
 Calculate from the outset, and that saved all the cupboards from the outside 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.529
 are very many 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.489
 grow well say 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.949
 it is now very hard of course anyway 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.719
 if we calves taken away 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.269
 now at a good price 7 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.809
 they grow very fast as promised 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.519
 there are also some disadvantages to the system 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.909
 we have our ladies pay each other that is much more correct now 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.470
 the cows where the calves when running if you then experience certitude can me so 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.179
 that he is completely out if you never 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:07.489
 we had bad luck 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.329
 so we have the spring campaign party evening 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.409
 the judge 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.679
 four needs of the cows a beautiful coincides with the grass gerrit peak 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:16.889
 in the spring 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.909
 that's essential I think to keep the costs down we want 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 the small size of 350,000 the market 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.889
 so there must be life it is a sign that it is how much money per liter of milk 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.209
 must be earned 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.259
 and think that this way 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.609
 if you calve the cows all in the spring this way alone 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.579
 from grass milk market we have very low costs 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.039
 That the health of the cows is very good 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.269
 the us that actually comes just for the vvd is more 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.309
 occasionally on your own for inflammation 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:49.629
 the last 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.789
 five years I have no plans hairdresser in the yard 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.059
 I think I caught three or four cows in the year 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.870
 we try the other here 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.129
 control the costs very much 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.780
 on the advice of ado we started with the internet 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.239
 strip grazing 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.619
 and think we are trying to surprise the cows a little longer 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:12.929
 and also have a stop for a little longer so that there is 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.139
 guests a very good one 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.139
 their heads will have gas production 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.300
 therefore also more gas the cows project, many more cows graze 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.490
 we set the thread about four to five times and one more often in the summer 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.759
 times or five in a day 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.639
 but that is the best moment of the day 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.729
 be brave 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.659
 especially with more 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.759
 a pleasure to do this is actually the first year the cows work 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.360
 all beautiful in the spring 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 so thick this will finally be the first real year 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.039
 or what meaningful can say about the costs up to now are pretty good 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.099
 decreased 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.819
 But it should now come so gradually you should really be able to see the benefits 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.309
 of the system 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.309
 because the previous years were actually still transition year 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:01.619
 nevertheless I think it can still be better, especially the grassland management 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:04.930
 there is still something more to catch up with, I estimate at the moment 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.020
 there is certainly a child in the future 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.319
 that in the Netherlands is not possible or very difficult to cows the summer and 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.509
 winter keep kohnstamm out all winter anyway 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.830
 nevertheless, the worries about not having another opportunity for a good one 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.039
 find 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.889
 we lived with riders, so you can gelder 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.289
 ended up about that shed 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.240
 this one is 15 and 40 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.439
 and so about 90 cows can lie 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.819
 in the cows outside during the winter, there are some varying reactions 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:34.849
 people who 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.849
 get up a bit further from nature who think it's sad for the cows 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:39.620
 they threaten 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.449
 he does not see himself out all day ashamed that I have the cows 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.129
 a nice thick coat and that goes well 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.539
 the two years ago we had one but they did that 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.539
 very strange in the mountain calves had not counted on it 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.799
 and I always lay outside in the snow this but the beginning it goes with the 

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:58.020
 involved banks 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.430
 well well have birth announcement later go to the pasture 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.439
 He said that mother and daughter are okay with it 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.409
 walking outside on the farm at home 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.569
 with that it would be great to come and have a look that is why Oosterveer wants to 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.389
 Cases are very good 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.440
 it says but with a temporary permit but hope that he is in the 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.300
 may remain in the future 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.710
 we just have to wait 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.389
 after that we would really like to have judo and cubicle stable in the future 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.839
 a new policy of building because of the wall 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.709
 milking eighty cows, the shifts were 50 degrees that other marketer twenty 

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:33.099
 also 50 years old 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.189
 then it actually fits if we cannot milk quickly 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:37.949
 to do a lot more cows now
