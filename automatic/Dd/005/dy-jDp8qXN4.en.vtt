to your device even though because like

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
to your device even though because like
let's<00:01:51.899> say<00:01:51.990> someone<00:01:52.680> else<00:01:52.860> has<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> bamboo<00:01:53.579> back

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
let's say someone else has a bamboo back

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460 
let's say someone else has a bamboo back
but<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.450> chances<00:01:54.750> are<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.140> won't<00:01:55.259> have

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
but the chances are that they won't have

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
but the chances are that they won't have
the<00:01:55.590> same<00:01:55.710> cutout<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.939> does<00:01:57.090> look

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the same cutout is you and it does look

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
the same cutout is you and it does look
pretty<00:01:57.360> cool<00:01:57.810> because<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.350> apple<00:01:58.590> logo<00:01:58.619> does

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
pretty cool because the apple logo does

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.130 
pretty cool because the apple logo does
shine<00:01:59.159> through<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.820> opinion<00:02:00.240> looks<00:02:00.960> very

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
shine through and my opinion looks very

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
shine through and my opinion looks very
very<00:02:01.200> nice<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> things<00:02:02.820> i<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.240> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
very nice one of the things i do like is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.179 
very nice one of the things i do like is
that<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.659> does<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.380> doesn't<00:02:04.649> actually<00:02:04.740> shake

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that it does it doesn't actually shake

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.740 
that it does it doesn't actually shake
the<00:02:05.369> MacBook<00:02:05.700> Airs<00:02:05.909> hinged<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.600> much

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the MacBook Airs hinged very much

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.240 
the MacBook Airs hinged very much
because<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> macbook<00:02:07.409> air<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:07.979> thin

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
because the macbook air is a very thin

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.520 
because the macbook air is a very thin
computer<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.450> are<00:02:09.599> basically<00:02:09.959> attaching

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
computer and you are basically attaching

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.590 
computer and you are basically attaching
something<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> back<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
something to the back of it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.020 
something to the back of it
and<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.650> most<00:02:13.190> people<00:02:13.280> are<00:02:13.520> expected<00:02:14.000> to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
and so most people are expected to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.330 
and so most people are expected to
loosen<00:02:14.660> up<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> hinge<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:15.140> little<00:02:15.350> bit<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.680> it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
loosen up the hinge a little bit and it

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.830 
loosen up the hinge a little bit and it
honestly<00:02:16.640> doesn't<00:02:17.060> do<00:02:17.240> anything<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:17.780> that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
honestly doesn't do anything like that

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.050 
honestly doesn't do anything like that
at<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.160> very<00:02:19.340> thin<00:02:19.820> and<00:02:19.850> light

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
at all this is a very thin and light

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.700 
at all this is a very thin and light
product<00:02:20.480> which<00:02:20.690> does<00:02:20.900> look<00:02:21.110> very<00:02:21.140> very<00:02:21.530> nice

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
product which does look very very nice

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.280 
product which does look very very nice
and<00:02:21.950> does<00:02:22.070> add<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.550> unique<00:02:23.240> styling<00:02:23.810> element<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and does add a unique styling element to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.900 
and does add a unique styling element to
your<00:02:24.320> Mac<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.890> differentiate<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.670> from<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
your Mac to differentiate it from the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.550 
your Mac to differentiate it from the
crowd<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.360> know<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.960> for<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.170> fact<00:02:27.230> because

crowd I know this for a fact because

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.740 
crowd I know this for a fact because

the few that uses macbook air rather

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.680 
the few that uses macbook air rather
than<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.310> macbook<00:02:34.640> pro<00:02:34.820> now<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.300> do<00:02:35.450> have<00:02:35.540> this

bamboo back at the back of my computer

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.770 
bamboo back at the back of my computer
which<00:02:37.430> really<00:02:37.640> does<00:02:37.820> differentiate<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.630> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
which really does differentiate it and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.290 
which really does differentiate it and
quite<00:02:39.260> honestly<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.740> have<00:02:39.980> got<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.220> pretty<00:02:40.550> large

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
quite honestly I have got a pretty large

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.940 
quite honestly I have got a pretty large
number<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.660> questions<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.800> where

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
number of questions what it is and where

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.340 
number of questions what it is and where
I<00:02:42.980> got<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.280> from<00:02:43.540> now<00:02:44.540> essentially<00:02:44.960> this<00:02:45.110> hell

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
I got it from now essentially this hell

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.830 
I got it from now essentially this hell
