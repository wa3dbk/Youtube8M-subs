00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.909
 very good at all phase before giotto 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:05.740
 for kinect commenting a video of 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.420
 battlefield responding to one of the 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.240
 questions that are being repeated most of 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.679
 one way I think quite justified 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.049
 what are you doing to me that is that 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.849
 which of the four times of debate film 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.710
 liked it more and I think it's been 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.840
 time to clarify certain things a little 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.550
 since I've always told you and it's 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.670
 absolutely true that debate fil me 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.039
 love it but with the arrival of doing more 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.359
 already there are four the dlc is that from the 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.490
 game output without counting 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.410
 obviously the original and I think that 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.300
 they are enough or at least enough 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.329
 so that we can get an idea 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.280
 more or less than battlefield 3 does not 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.290
 is being offered that is very much and in 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.809
 Actually, only what I intend is 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.110
 bring is a small ranking through the 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.059
 what do you see a bit what are my 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.430
 specific preferences within the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.560
 of the four of lcs 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.600
 of the celestial vate we are watching channels 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.150
 to show that same normal peace and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.550
 basic stream of discussions that the 3 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.320
 gave us bad mass is just my opinion with 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.710
 those that I enjoy the most 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.270
 spectacular seem to me and nothing in the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.280
 comments you can leave me as always 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.550
 obviously if you share my opinion or 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.710
 no and nothing I start I give way to 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.260
 ranking four positions four 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.240
 squares one for each d lc that has left 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.780
 waiting for good that will come out for the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.690
 2013 the last of lg debate fil will be and 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.690
 nothing staying at 0% I start the ranking 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.310
 yes 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.670
 and we started ranking in the position 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.530
 number 4 being this the tlc that less me 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.590
 I liked it without getting upset 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.990
 It is obviously close workers and it is a 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.940
 little the most similar game mode 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.850
 a call of duty within the saga of 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.860
 bates within these dlc are very maps 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.920
 small hued especially 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.210
 Shotguns and all these short weapons 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.560
 reach explosives and somehow 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.180
 It has its pros and cons 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.040
 It can obviously be a way 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.230
 some pretty fun game modes 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.990
 but at the same time it's where most effect 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.510
 camping we can find as we see in 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.430
 in picture right now this guy that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.040
 he just killed me with the crossbow and that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.140
 just dropped and here we see how with the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.110
 crossbow of vÃ©lez blocked in the after 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.390
 man is a small mode of good of 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.040
 encouragement because in these small maps 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.450
 killing with the crossbow can become 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.520
 a tad easier than in according to that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.390
 larger maps and be able to get out 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.310
 the challenges 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.110
 is the good thing that has phil bat that 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.720
 is continuously proposing new 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.450
 challenges and new game forms 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.070
 to extend the life of this game 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.990
 What is this DLD about? 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.150
 they are saving a lot of life inside 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.000
 What fits is the tlc that I have least 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.090
 played or that less good times were 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.130
 they passed shots take crossbows pieces 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.270
 and with this one go station we go to the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.270
 position number 3 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.799
 and in the aforementioned position number 3 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.470
 we have the lcd make it warmer 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.810
 fresh out of the super addictive oven 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.370
 super moved and dynamic and the truth is 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.560
 I'm really enjoying the only thing 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.829
 it has stopped me from putting the position 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.650
 number 2 is precisely that recent 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.440
 incorporation in playstation premium the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.019
 truth is that it promises and very much the 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.220
 new game modes like this 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.730
 modality that we are seeing on screen 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.160
 that is scavenger that this one practically 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.510
 forces to go for the enemy and looking 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.760
 of new weapons since you start with very 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.440
 few weapons are too bad over 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.780
 more inrri we can make big jumps 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.879
 in several maps doing in this way of 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 I play something that promises enough we'll see 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.680
 if you climb position number two, let's continue 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.930
 and in position number 2 we have a back 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.299
 To sing in the truth has cost me 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.069
 much to decide between this same back to 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.439
 karkand or aftermath to put the 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.060
 position number 2 in silver medal 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.359
 within my preferences the fact of 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.739
 that zermatt is so so very recent 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.840
 I think I'm going to give him the benefit of 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.430
 doubt back to karkand which was also the 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.930
 first dlc that we got our 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.510
 consoles and pc system 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.229
 battlefield 3 right at Christmas of the year 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.870
 past back to karkand is a dlc which 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.090
 offers us three or four new maps 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.650
 quite complemented with what was coming 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.900
 being the original butterfield video 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.970
 very very very balanced where all the 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.940
 classes have a place and they all have their 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.880
 function to fulfill are urban environments 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.889
 although also wrapped in zones 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.750
 pretty desert where the sliders 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.360
 can account with vehicles 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.949
 enough land aerial vehicles 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.780
 whereupon those engineers and those of 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.880
 assault can can do theirs 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.570
 and obviously within the city the 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.550
 doctors 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.900
 they perform their hard work in 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.630
 frankly I think it has a merit 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.449
 tremendous this this dlc for being the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.729
 first and be so so so so good 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.680
 generally the companies could be 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.830
 save something for the end but the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.020
 truth is that this worthy dlc worthy of 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.879
 catch if you still can not see it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.710
 you have caught it on my recommendation 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.150
 is that you do it if you liked it 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.180
 Beat the 3 because if you liked it 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.719
 patricio 3 extra is going to be your biggest 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.099
 guarantee because it does not offer practically 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.279
 nothing new beyond the maps that already 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.809
 it's a lot if you liked basic c3 bat 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:27.089
 all maps these are also going to 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:28.680
 I like them very much and I recommend them to be 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.150
 collectively I do not recommend this 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.759
 knife that just nailed me 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.069
 much less but for example if you are from 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.379
 rustlers like me and you love the water theme 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.199
 reilly you are going to enjoy a lot of 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.080
 this map environment since the 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:46.409
 vehicles have to do but you have to 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.029
 you have to be quite skilled with the 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.279
 controls from all these vehicles for 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.020
 that does not destroy you in practically makes 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.659
 Four fours ago I will finish 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.039
 destroyed but for you to see the 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.899
 modality of this game that also removes 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.969
 party to the frostbite engine in a way 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:03.739
 exaggerated since these buildings 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.739
 we go to position number 1 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.500
 yes 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.820
 and number do not have to go Armon 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.770
 pc this undoubtedly the tlc that more hours of 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.080
 amusement is giving me and has given me 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.990
 but that is a real aberration 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.420
 play it I started as opposed to 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.420
 console is a real pleasure because 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.850
 this dlc I think is absolutely faithful 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.490
 to the batesville philosophy of maps 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.640
 absolutely huge and open and 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.440
 besides the fact of being able to play 64 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.150
 people within this map all the 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.340
 world and with vehicles and such because here 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.630
 on foot you're going to go little offers a 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:50.090
 Awesome experience full of rhythm 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.280
 full of moments of pure adrenaline and 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.070
 hard and frankly in the difference with 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.550
 the versions of the consoles that already 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:01.010
 we know to walk a little short of 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.290
 physical and and of hardware it is 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.050
 absolutely gargantuan even in this 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.210
 clip you're going to see that it's quite a maneuver 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.850
 well with him with the cocktail he even finished 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.770
 killing good not disabling the 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.810
 tank that you have down there 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.060
 the modalities that this dlc brings that 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.970
 we came out just in August at the end of 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.490
 August or early September is a 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.009
 authentic barbarity of vehicles in addition 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.120
 the super addictive modality of superior 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.250
 to constant is everyone there 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.789
 constant to stop to see who is killed 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.169
 before someone and the truth is here 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:35.990
 I jump already with the count that no longer 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:38.720
 could more frankly be an authentic 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.940
 last I reiterate the pc because I think 

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.740
 that is quite important this this dlc 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.919
 if it did not start I lost quite a bit since 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:48.229
 the map the maps are not so big 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:51.169
 it costs more to charge the truth is that it 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:53.830
 note and the technological delay that there is 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.420
 between the consoles and the last fish 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.340
 and well up to here the ranking has 

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.110
 cost a little time the work to see if you 

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.720
 he liked you can give him the square and 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.210
 you know is to be killed this rat jacket 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.090
 you tell me in the comments and if it has 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.740
 liked if you think differently you can 

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.450
 argue what you give your reasons and 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.970
 Obviously you already know that I read everything 

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.310
 and nothing favorite white is a hug if 

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.580
 you liked everything we see each other and 

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.580
 soon
