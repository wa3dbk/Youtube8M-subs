00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.440
 for children so today 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.670
 so in fact we had already told you about 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.830
 so this table is actually 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.439
 polaroid so here we had you 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 already spoken but you were told that this 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.070
 was not possible 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.689
 my children say m the market of china 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.580
 google yes we did not get there because 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.960
 that she was road and because good 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.800
 it was not very possible even with 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.120
 our our our trick then the trick 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.489
 who is the children is that there is a 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.320
 surfer who gave us a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.719
 alternative so here is an alternative 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 at market google dechy who is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.520
 practically as provided as the little 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.719
 twin brother so should have scored from home 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 google but that can be installed like 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 a simple apk on apparently 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.649
 any tablet so how 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.620
 we then make children what he 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:05.939
 must do is that you go 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:11.780
 directly here so go on rolle 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:17.759
 your browser and you're going to type 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:22.409
 directly a space to their expectations 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:27.659
 and that's when I wait 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.820
 this is a mobile market space 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.689
 here you have it a mobile space 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.689
 market and then you click here in 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.780
 do you have it first under google 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.650
 and so you're going to access mobile so 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.200
 markets 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.040
 so here it is then we are 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.960
 had it on the net 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.909
 and as google pays and where the ps 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.970
 store if you want is what you 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.390
 can do quite directly 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.950
 either see her here so in fact on the on 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:06.950
 the store or for the donation blake d then the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:15.770
 double but you go here then 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:17.450
 wait, here we are, no, that's it 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.610
 had it under our dolphin just now 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:25.220
 that's it to be here that's going to happen 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.470
 I have a little slow internet here 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.880
 you go on first so stuff and 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.560
 there you do in the land so that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.660
 you have it on the phone or without 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.700
 you have it on the tablet version so 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.170
 So either widescreen or Phone 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.360
 once you have recovered this little 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.300
 apk it's simple you take your 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.110
 tablet and you have here so a port 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.400
 usb you take your cable to one side 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.050
 you put it on the usb port of 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.830
 the computer and on one side here you 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.440
 connect the cable 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.430
 this is how you are going to have 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.230
 the tablet and that will open 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.690
 directly on your windows hilali 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.480
 directly copy the apeca once 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.470
 so you actually copy an apeca 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.730
 so in fact the market what you 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.060
 do it is that you go directly 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 on your tablet and you have in the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.720
 file manager 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.459
 so in fact you have alas you 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.230
 have you double click 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.730
 directly on here so in fact 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.470
 mobile market then clicking 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.880
 this is the right they ask you 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.489
 to install it right there it is already 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.540
 installed or done on installed at the dock 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.910
 and that's it over 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.170
 and then you have it after you get it 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.700
 So here it is the marine mobile 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.810
 mobile market you click directly 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.480
 on it and that's really like you 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.190
 like two drops of water or google like 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.240
 see two dogs 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.830
 google that's top news I mean it's 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.260
 enough it's really nice 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.420
 so here I do not know what she has my 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.420
 collection but see a little bit so here 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.130
 see it you have the top top fruit the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.870
 gruyÃ¨re and there you brought some 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:07.370
 arches arcade categories as 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.090
 action arcade extra racing 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.080
 communication and all etc 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.330
 for example if we click here and there 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.430
 you have games then for example one 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.140
 will snap so this one is it 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.140
 just click on download 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.850
 here and normally it is downloaded 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:40.170
 so it seems to me that after you go 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:44.160
 there it is and so it has in fact just 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.260
 so just so of doubt by 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.970
 example manager of this is it is in 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.220
 download it and afterwards in 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.790
 does it simply directoire the state the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.230
 So that's a little bit more 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.419
 complex that google pays but 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.180
 frankly I think it's their 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.860
 alternative market is the most provided 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.810
 of all children 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.050
 it's the most provided and the one that 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.880
 looks really like the global standard 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.120
 it even makes you the updates of 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.010
 installed software and where it really is 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.650
 relatively friendly children me 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.700
 I love it and it allows you even if your 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.830
 tablet is rooted since it is a 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.480
 little apk that you launch even if your 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.940
 tablet and road and it allows you 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.660
 directly so in fact is good of 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.830
 to access many software that 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.380
 you could not do with the 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.720
 little Chinese spell that you have on the 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.419
 most of the Chinese tablets 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.590
 that's a pity that android 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.419
 see after they ask you to 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.190
 install it so you actually make it to 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.570
 install and in the front he installs then 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.800
 so here the voice you clicked 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.560
 installed and so he is in the process 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.360
 to directly install the game here and 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.940
 afterwards it suffices to precisely 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.470
 ok for example and then after that then 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.750
 if you come back what's nice is 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.460
 that here you nevertheless still 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.320
 so it updates you so different 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.380
 applications see even the applications 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.270
 from google like gmail and all that 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.610
 and that's so it's really very very 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.680
 friendly kids so let's see 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:19.020
 if the game when the download so 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.039
 works it's there and at the right it's 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:32.610
 really an alternative 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:33.960
 so ok playes stage 1 and see so 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.140
 it's still is so friendly 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:42.289
 if I know that even good I had proposed 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:45.030
 so in fact a whole talent here 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:48.710
 I had proposed a lot of software 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:52.500
 if you want that allow you to 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:55.400
 to have in fact the country store 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.840
 directly on your tablets 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.370
 I said delivered to a tutorial 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.090
 apparently there is a lot of people who 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.180
 have had problems 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.840
 so there a mobile market is really 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.940
 the top 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.070
 if you really want children so 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.710
 actually have on any 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.690
 tablet the android market 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.120
 finally the equivalent the little twins of 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.919
 the android market or the pay google 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.280
 it will be much simpler for you 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:22.040
 to install it and 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.340
 to directly enjoy a maximum 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.180
 of software on your Chinese tablet 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.200
 android 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.200
 thank you see you soon
