redstone<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.830> how<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.190> can<00:00:05.370> use<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.640> with

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
redstone and how you can use it with

redstone and how you can use it with
students<00:00:06.859> in<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.370> 21<00:00:08.760> question<00:00:09.150> map<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.480> had<00:00:09.690> I

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
students in my 21 question map I had I

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.360 
students in my 21 question map I had I
don't<00:00:10.320> know<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.559> it's<00:00:10.679> actually<00:00:10.800> called<00:00:11.040> but

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
don't know what it's actually called but

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.459 
don't know what it's actually called but
I<00:00:11.400> call<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.820> flip<00:00:12.090> flop<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.960> something<00:00:13.349> that

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
I call it a flip flop so something that

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.620 
I call it a flip flop so something that
remembers<00:00:13.889> its<00:00:14.040> state<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> one

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
remembers its state and this is the one

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.240 
remembers its state and this is the one
I<00:00:15.660> had<00:00:15.870> over<00:00:16.139> here<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.949> what<00:00:17.130> i<00:00:17.160> use

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
I had over here and this is what i use

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.429 
I had over here and this is what i use
to<00:00:17.699> stop<00:00:17.970> students<00:00:18.480> getting<00:00:18.690> down<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.230> two

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
to stop students getting down so two

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.890 
to stop students getting down so two
students<00:00:19.980> getting<00:00:20.160> down<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> same<00:00:20.730> path<00:00:21.029> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
students getting down the same path so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.570 
students getting down the same path so
the<00:00:21.930> students<00:00:22.470> ran<00:00:22.650> over<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> pressure<00:00:23.369> plate

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the students ran over a pressure plate

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.160 
the students ran over a pressure plate
which<00:00:24.570> triggered<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.470> piston<00:00:26.750> which<00:00:27.750> stayed

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
which triggered a piston which stayed

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.640 
which triggered a piston which stayed
open<00:00:28.580> given<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> if<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.140> set<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> up

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
open given that so if I set that up

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.810 
open given that so if I set that up
again<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:32.880> set<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.630> again<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.350> I

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
again and one set it up again here I

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:51.209 
again and one set it up again here I
actually<00:00:35.820> had<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:40.129> piston<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.370> top<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.739 

that<00:00:52.219> stopped<00:00:52.670> people<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.359> in<00:00:53.449> there<00:00:53.600> again

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
that stopped people going in there again

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.369 
that stopped people going in there again
you<00:00:54.530> have<00:00:54.679> to<00:00:54.739> manually<00:00:55.219> reset<00:00:55.789> it<00:00:56.230> but<00:00:57.230> as

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
you have to manually reset it but as

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.439 
you have to manually reset it but as
soon<00:00:57.530> as<00:00:57.679> a<00:00:57.710> student<00:00:58.129> walks<00:00:58.339> across<00:00:58.609> this<00:00:58.940> it

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
soon as a student walks across this it

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.990 
soon as a student walks across this it
activates<00:00:59.960> that<00:01:00.170> piston<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.000> prevents

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
activates that piston and prevents

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600 
activates that piston and prevents
people<00:01:02.210> other<00:01:02.629> people<00:01:02.750> coming<00:01:03.350> in<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.430> that

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
people other people coming in so that

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.639 
people other people coming in so that
was<00:01:04.790> how<00:01:04.970> I<00:01:05.000> prevented<00:01:05.689> students<00:01:06.140> doubling<00:01:06.530> up

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
was how I prevented students doubling up

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.410 
was how I prevented students doubling up
and<00:01:06.890> going<00:01:07.159> through<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.520> same<00:01:07.700> path<00:01:08.000> with<00:01:08.299> one

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
and going through the same path with one

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.670 
and going through the same path with one
another<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:11.420> these<00:01:11.570> are<00:01:11.630> pretty<00:01:11.930> pretty<00:01:12.409> easy

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
another so these are pretty pretty easy

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.020 
another so these are pretty pretty easy
to<00:01:12.979> build<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.950> now<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.310> people<00:01:16.640> can't<00:01:16.880> get

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
to build so now that people can't get

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.149 
to build so now that people can't get
through<00:01:17.270> there<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.289> will<00:01:18.649> go<00:01:18.679> and<00:01:18.979> quickly

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
through there so I will go and quickly

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.419 
through there so I will go and quickly
build<00:01:19.549> one<00:01:19.729> over<00:01:19.970> here<00:01:20.920> just<00:01:21.920> clear<00:01:22.189> a<00:01:22.220> little

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
build one over here just clear a little

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.669 
build one over here just clear a little
bit<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.729> land<00:01:25.929> so<00:01:26.929> those<00:01:27.110> ones<00:01:27.409> are<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
bit of land so those ones are the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:35.800 
bit of land so those ones are the
easiest<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:29.630> have<00:01:31.119> two<00:01:32.119> blocks<00:01:34.810> redstone

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
easiest you have two blocks redstone

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.840 
easiest you have two blocks redstone
torches<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:38.679> redstone<00:01:39.679> dust<00:01:40.069> between<00:01:40.369> them

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
torches and redstone dust between them

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.300 
torches and redstone dust between them
so<00:01:41.840> what<00:01:42.020> happens<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.590> when<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.920> redstone

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
so what happens is when this redstone

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.249 
so what happens is when this redstone
torches<00:01:43.880> on<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.179> powers<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:44.750> block<00:01:45.049> which

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
torches on it powers this block which

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.249 
torches on it powers this block which
means<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:45.740> torch<00:01:46.459> gets<00:01:46.759> turned<00:01:47.060> off<00:01:47.240> but<00:01:48.049> if

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
means this torch gets turned off but if

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.260 
means this torch gets turned off but if
you<00:01:48.500> power<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:49.100> block<00:01:49.429> i'm<00:01:49.640> standing<00:01:50.179> on

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
you power this block i'm standing on

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.960 
you power this block i'm standing on
with<00:01:50.479> something<00:01:51.340> for<00:01:52.340> instance<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.729> pressure

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
with something for instance a pressure

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.150 
with something for instance a pressure
plate<00:01:53.179> it<00:01:53.810> will<00:01:54.020> reverse<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.679> because<00:01:55.009> this

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
plate it will reverse it because this

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.710 
plate it will reverse it because this
tortures<00:01:55.580> off<00:01:55.729> which<00:01:55.910> will<00:01:56.060> allow<00:01:56.179> this<00:01:56.420> torch

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
tortures off which will allow this torch

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.779 
tortures off which will allow this torch
to<00:01:56.840> be<00:01:56.959> on<00:01:57.110> which<00:01:57.709> then<00:01:57.950> powers<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.519> block

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
to be on which then powers is block

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.719 
to be on which then powers is block
permanently<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.440> this<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.099> how<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:04.610> get

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
permanently so this is how you can get

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.380 
permanently so this is how you can get
something<00:02:05.149> to<00:02:05.300> save<00:02:05.569> a<00:02:05.599> state<00:02:06.110> if<00:02:06.319> you<00:02:06.500> will<00:02:07.390> so

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
something to save a state if you will so

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.779 
something to save a state if you will so
I<00:02:08.420> call<00:02:08.750> them<00:02:08.899> flip-flops<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.310> it'll<00:02:10.489> save<00:02:10.759> a

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
I call them flip-flops so it'll save a

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.970 
I call them flip-flops so it'll save a
state<00:02:11.150> depending<00:02:11.599> on<00:02:11.660> what's<00:02:11.810> happened<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.830> in

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
state depending on what's happened so in

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.949 
state depending on what's happened so in
the<00:02:13.099> case<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.670> sticky<00:02:14.150> piston<00:02:14.540> down<00:02:14.690> here

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
the case of the sticky piston down here

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.690 
the case of the sticky piston down here
this<00:02:15.200> sticky<00:02:15.530> piston<00:02:15.860> will<00:02:16.010> stay<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.459> and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
this sticky piston will stay out and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.300 
this sticky piston will stay out and
stop<00:02:17.330> other<00:02:17.510> students<00:02:17.900> going<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.349> until<00:02:18.560> you

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
stop other students going in until you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.420 
stop other students going in until you
manually<00:02:19.670> reset<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.680> now<00:02:21.680> I've<00:02:21.860> been<00:02:22.010> watching

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
manually reset it now I've been watching

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
manually reset it now I've been watching
some<00:02:22.610> videos<00:02:22.909> by<00:02:23.239> etho<00:02:24.099> if<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.430> are<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> fan<00:02:26.390> of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
some videos by etho if you are a fan of

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.360 
some videos by etho if you are a fan of
redstone<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.080> really<00:02:27.620> cool<00:02:27.800> stuff<00:02:27.950> i

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
redstone and really cool stuff i

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.040 
redstone and really cool stuff i
recommend<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:28.879> drop<00:02:29.120> by<00:02:29.269> his<00:02:29.480> channel<00:02:29.870> its

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
ethos lab eth osla be so he does some

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.780 
ethos lab eth osla be so he does some
pretty<00:02:36.080> amazing<00:02:36.440> stuff<00:02:36.709> with<00:02:37.099> redstone<00:02:37.459> and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
pretty amazing stuff with redstone and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.020 
pretty amazing stuff with redstone and
this<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.629> a<00:02:39.409> smaller<00:02:40.069> version<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.790> flip-flop

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
this is a smaller version of a flip-flop

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.190 
this is a smaller version of a flip-flop
that<00:02:41.540> etho<00:02:41.870> uses<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:44.390> at<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.599> moment<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:45.080> can

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
that etho uses so at the moment you can

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.589 
that etho uses so at the moment you can
see<00:02:45.409> my<00:02:45.620> signal<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.010> out<00:02:46.280> here<00:02:46.580> i<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:47.360> turn

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
see my signal is out here i can turn

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.610 
see my signal is out here i can turn
that<00:02:47.810> signal<00:02:48.230> off<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:50.049> make<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.170> come<00:02:51.349> out<00:02:51.379> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
that signal off and make it come out the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.259 
that signal off and make it come out the
other<00:02:51.709> end<00:02:51.830> by<00:02:52.190> using<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:52.700> pressure<00:02:52.970> plate

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
other end by using that pressure plate

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.820 
other end by using that pressure plate
there<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.750> will<00:02:53.900> stay<00:02:54.049> coming<00:02:54.560> at<00:02:54.680> this

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
there and it will stay coming at this

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.539 
there and it will stay coming at this
end<00:02:55.040> until<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:56.769> stand<00:02:57.769> on<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.980> pressure<00:02:58.250> plate

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
end until I stand on that pressure plate

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.880 
end until I stand on that pressure plate
there<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.060> will<00:02:59.180> reverse<00:02:59.480> it

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
there and that will reverse it

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.860 
there and that will reverse it
so<00:03:01.580> same<00:03:01.940> principle<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.720> bit<00:03:03.470> smaller<00:03:03.830> design

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
so same principle a bit smaller design

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.470 
so same principle a bit smaller design
and<00:03:05.870> over<00:03:06.260> here<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:06.860> another<00:03:07.670> thing<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.060> I've

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
and over here is another thing that I've

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.430 
and over here is another thing that I've
seen<00:03:08.720> on<00:03:08.900> ethos<00:03:09.290> channel<00:03:09.730> same<00:03:10.730> flip-flop<00:03:11.440> in

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
seen on ethos channel same flip-flop in

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.080 
seen on ethos channel same flip-flop in
this<00:03:12.709> in<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.069> area<00:03:13.459> here<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.390> I've<00:03:14.660> also<00:03:15.080> got

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
this in this area here but I've also got

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.390 
this in this area here but I've also got
repeaters<00:03:17.090> set<00:03:17.300> up<00:03:17.420> around<00:03:17.750> here<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.740> reset

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
repeaters set up around here that reset

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.610 
repeaters set up around here that reset
the<00:03:19.490> system<00:03:19.670> after<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.360> amount<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.720> time<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
the system after that amount of time so

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.420 
the system after that amount of time so
you'll<00:03:22.310> notice<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:24.380> line<00:03:24.740> here<00:03:25.010> is<00:03:25.250> on

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
you'll notice that this line here is on

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.720 
you'll notice that this line here is on
if<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.300> hit<00:03:26.570> my<00:03:26.720> button<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.950> line<00:03:28.220> will<00:03:28.400> go<00:03:28.550> off

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
if I hit my button that line will go off

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.090 
if I hit my button that line will go off
this<00:03:29.390> line<00:03:29.660> will<00:03:29.840> go<00:03:29.989> on<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.350> will<00:03:30.830> stay<00:03:31.069> on

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
this line will go on and will stay on

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.150 
this line will go on and will stay on
for<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:32.330> amount<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.020> time<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.500> then<00:03:33.739> this<00:03:33.980> line

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
for a amount of time and then this line

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.590 
for a amount of time and then this line
will<00:03:34.310> go<00:03:34.430> back<00:03:34.610> on<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.000> that's<00:03:35.209> a<00:03:35.300> self

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
will go back on so that's a self

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.770 
will go back on so that's a self
resetting<00:03:36.230> one<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:38.030> just<00:03:38.239> allows<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.690> to

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
resetting one so it just allows you to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.320 
resetting one so it just allows you to
make<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> button<00:03:39.350> press<00:03:39.620> last<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.760> lot<00:03:40.970> longer

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.380 

that's<00:03:44.330> pretty<00:03:44.540> much<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.750> for<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.140> flip-flop

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
that's pretty much it for this flip-flop

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.580 
that's pretty much it for this flip-flop
tutorial<00:03:47.390> I<00:03:47.570> probably<00:03:48.050> should<00:03:48.260> show<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.470> how

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
tutorial I probably should show you how

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.350 
tutorial I probably should show you how
to<00:03:48.650> make<00:03:48.800> one<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:49.040> them<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.370> hang<00:03:49.820> on<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.970> second

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
to make one of them so hang on a second

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360 
to make one of them so hang on a second
so<00:03:50.959> these<00:03:51.110> ones<00:03:51.380> are<00:03:51.500> even<00:03:51.739> easier<00:03:51.950> than<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
so these ones are even easier than the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.340 
so these ones are even easier than the
other<00:03:52.489> ones<00:03:53.470> make<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.500> little<00:03:54.830> one<00:03:55.010> like<00:03:55.220> that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
other ones make a little one like that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.590 
other ones make a little one like that

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
redstone torch underneath redstone torch

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.330 
redstone torch underneath redstone torch
on<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.900> back<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:02.500> redstone<00:04:03.500> along<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.100> top

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
on the back and redstone along the top

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
on the back and redstone along the top
and<00:04:04.580> then<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.540> have<00:04:05.840> an<00:04:06.170> out<00:04:07.090> signal<00:04:08.090> there

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
and then you have an out signal there

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.740 
and then you have an out signal there
and<00:04:08.709> out<00:04:09.709> signal<00:04:10.190> there<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:13.450> reset<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.480> you

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
and out signal there and to reset it you

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.260 
and out signal there and to reset it you
need<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.170> power<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:17.390> block<00:04:17.720> down<00:04:17.989> there<00:04:22.270> so

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
need to power that block down there so

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.000 
need to power that block down there so
if<00:04:23.300> I<00:04:23.510> power<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:24.020> block<00:04:24.350> there<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.860> will

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
if I power that block there that will

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.330 
if I power that block there that will
will<00:04:25.580> reset<00:04:26.330> it<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.380> said<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:27.950> single<00:04:28.280> out

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
will reset it and said to single out

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.430 
will reset it and said to single out
this<00:04:28.550> way<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:28.970> if<00:04:29.450> you<00:04:29.570> want<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.840> reset<00:04:30.229> it<00:04:30.260> the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
this way and if you want to reset it the

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.469 
this way and if you want to reset it the
other<00:04:30.590> way<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:33.080> need<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.890> I<00:04:34.520> recommend<00:04:35.390> a

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
other way you need a I recommend a

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.840 
other way you need a I recommend a
repeater<00:04:35.840> there<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.169> stops<00:04:36.470> things<00:04:36.850> doubling

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
repeater there it stops things doubling

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.390 
repeater there it stops things doubling
back<00:04:39.910> when<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.000> don't<00:04:41.210> want<00:04:41.419> them<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.900> and

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
back when you don't want them to and

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.290 
back when you don't want them to and
then<00:04:43.400> redstone<00:04:44.330> line<00:04:44.600> running<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:46.729> here<00:04:47.030> and

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
then redstone line running to here and

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.820 
then redstone line running to here and
I'll<00:04:47.450> put<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.690> pressure<00:04:47.900> plate<00:04:48.200> there<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.560> show

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
I'll put a pressure plate there to show

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.100 
I'll put a pressure plate there to show
you<00:04:48.890> so<00:04:49.610> now<00:04:49.640> when<00:04:50.120> I<00:04:50.210> stand<00:04:50.539> on<00:04:52.750> this<00:04:53.750> pressure

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
you so now when I stand on this pressure

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.450 
you so now when I stand on this pressure
plate<00:04:54.440> here

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
plate here

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.790 
plate here
that<00:04:57.120> resets<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.169> go<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.470> stand<00:04:58.650> on

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
that resets and if I go and stand on

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.640 
that resets and if I go and stand on
this<00:04:59.039> one<00:04:59.280> it'll<00:04:59.699> go<00:04:59.910> back<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.300> other<00:05:00.330> way<00:05:00.650> so

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
this one it'll go back the other way so

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.689 
this one it'll go back the other way so
that's<00:05:01.830> how<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.039> make<00:05:02.280> one<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.520> those

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
that's how to make one of those

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.760 
that's how to make one of those
flip-flops<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.660> I've<00:05:04.319> shown<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.560> how<00:05:04.740> to

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
flip-flops and I've shown you how to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.230 
flip-flops and I've shown you how to
make<00:05:04.949> one<00:05:05.009> of<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.280> earth<00:05:05.370> flip-flops<00:05:05.849> I<00:05:06.030> hope

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
make one of the earth flip-flops I hope

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.779 
make one of the earth flip-flops I hope
this<00:05:06.389> has<00:05:06.539> been<00:05:06.569> helpful<00:05:07.250> like<00:05:08.250> say<00:05:08.460> I've<00:05:08.610> only

my<00:05:14.190> map<00:05:14.400> generations<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.000> i'll<00:05:15.120> be<00:05:15.210> doing

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
my map generations that i'll be doing

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.059 
my map generations that i'll be doing
over<00:05:15.599> the<00:05:15.750> christmas<00:05:16.199> break<00:05:16.289> i'm<00:05:16.680> sure<00:05:16.949> i'll

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069
