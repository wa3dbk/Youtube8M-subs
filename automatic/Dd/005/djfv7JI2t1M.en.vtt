have<00:01:29.880> expected<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.420> off<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> sludge<00:01:30.810> wave

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
have expected more off the sludge wave

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
have expected more off the sludge wave
this<00:01:31.470> could<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> tank<00:01:32.159> sylveon<00:01:32.640> which

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this could just be a tank sylveon which

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.249 
this could just be a tank sylveon which
is<00:01:32.970> why<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.240> doing<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.659> lot<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.930> damage

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
is why it's not doing a lot of damage

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.380 
is why it's not doing a lot of damage
but<00:01:34.979> overall<00:01:35.220> sylveon<00:01:35.700> dropped<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> red

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
but overall sylveon dropped to the red

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
but overall sylveon dropped to the red
after<00:01:36.810> all<00:01:36.930> those<00:01:37.079> trades<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.340> gallied

faked<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.430> could<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.970> could<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.240> really

faked this could this could get really

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.539

interesting<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.259> Gallade<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> be

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
interesting here but Gallade going to be

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.580 
interesting here but Gallade going to be
faster<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> sylveon<00:01:49.020> off<00:01:49.320> the

faster going to get the sylveon off the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.530 
faster going to get the sylveon off the
field<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> means<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
field and then that means we have the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.450 
field and then that means we have the
counter<00:01:51.810> pick<00:01:51.960> situation<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.950> bled<00:01:53.189> Skinner

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
cuz he might he might expect either that

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
cuz he might he might expect either that
could<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.649> been<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:59.009> faked<00:01:59.369> earlier<00:01:59.820> or<00:02:00.060> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
could have been or faked earlier or that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
could have been or faked earlier or that
give<00:02:00.930> um<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.469> new<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.579> he

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
give um just a new you know is he

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.940 
give um just a new you know is he
doesn't<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> speed<00:02:03.899> boost<00:02:04.140> Blaziken<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
doesn't have a speed boost Blaziken and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.560 
doesn't have a speed boost Blaziken and
now<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.119> see<00:02:06.360> Gallade<00:02:06.840> getting

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
now we get to see Gallade getting

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.410 
now we get to see Gallade getting
drawn<00:02:08.250> maybe<00:02:09.250> maybe<00:02:09.640> he<00:02:09.789> knows<00:02:09.970> what's<00:02:10.149> up<00:02:10.300> I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
drawn maybe maybe he knows what's up I

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.270 
drawn maybe maybe he knows what's up I
don't<00:02:10.479> know<00:02:10.720> or<00:02:11.020> he's<00:02:11.200> not<00:02:11.650> he<00:02:11.860> goes<00:02:12.010> into

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
don't know or he's not he goes into

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.030 
don't know or he's not he goes into
suicune<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.150> he<00:02:13.330> wants<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.800> Blaziken<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.890> get

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
suicune so he wants the Blaziken to get

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.150 
suicune so he wants the Blaziken to get
handled<00:02:15.430> by<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.580> suicune<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.950> that's<00:02:17.950> going

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
handled by the suicune and that's going

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.850 
handled by the suicune and that's going
to<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.280> counter<00:02:18.930> who<00:02:19.930> might<00:02:20.350> have<00:02:20.470> shown<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.740> bit

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
to be counter who might have shown a bit

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.350 
to be counter who might have shown a bit
right<00:02:21.100> there<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.430> Blaziken<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> throw

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
right there so Blaziken going to throw

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.510 
right there so Blaziken going to throw
the<00:02:22.480> dark<00:02:22.690> holes<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.140> that<00:02:23.560> definitely<00:02:24.250> shows

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
the dark holes and that definitely shows

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.520 
the dark holes and that definitely shows
that<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:25.390> going<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:25.840> Zorich<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.410> a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that you are going to be Zorich that's a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.290 
that you are going to be Zorich that's a
flinch<00:02:26.800> though<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.700> now<00:02:27.790> we're<00:02:27.910> getting<00:02:28.120> more

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
flinch though so now we're getting more

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.570 
flinch though so now we're getting more
dark<00:02:28.540> forces<00:02:28.900> more<00:02:29.200> flinches<00:02:29.800> out<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.400> way

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
dark forces more flinches out of the way

weekend was just going for that sculpt

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.340 
weekend was just going for that sculpt
we've<00:02:43.120> seen<00:02:43.330> him<00:02:43.450> take<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.720> damage<00:02:43.900> option

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
we've seen him take the damage option

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.199 
we've seen him take the damage option
before<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:45.160> might<00:02:45.400> have<00:02:45.520> been<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.760> case<00:02:45.910> and

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
before that might have been the case and

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.600 
before that might have been the case and
then<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.900> would<00:02:47.050> have<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.350> been<00:02:47.410> trying<00:02:48.400> I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
then it would have just been trying I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.580 
then it would have just been trying I
didn't<00:02:48.970> see<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.150> coal<00:02:49.300> mine<00:02:49.540> shenanigans<00:02:50.050> so

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
didn't see in coal mine shenanigans so

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.290 
didn't see in coal mine shenanigans so
that's<00:02:51.310> going<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.610> be<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.820> drain<00:02:52.060> punch

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
that's going to be the drain punch

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.870 
that's going to be the drain punch
that's<00:02:52.959> going<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.650> crazy<00:02:53.950> damage<00:02:54.520> into

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
that's going to be the crazy damage into

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.670 
that's going to be the crazy damage into
the<00:02:55.000> Zork<00:02:55.360> that's<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.930> super<00:02:56.110> effective<00:02:56.530> hit

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
the Zork that's the super effective hit

focus ash going to show but now we just

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.140 
focus ash going to show but now we just
get<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.930> see<00:02:58.959> Zoroark<00:02:59.739> with<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.489> counter

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
get to see Zoroark with the counter

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.570 
get to see Zoroark with the counter
that's<00:03:01.900> where<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.440> at<00:03:02.590> right<00:03:02.800> there<00:03:03.070> so

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
that's where it's at right there so

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.970 
that's where it's at right there so

that's going to redemption onto the
Gallade<00:03:06.580> pretty<00:03:06.880> hard<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.570> like<00:03:07.810> that

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
Gallade pretty hard and I like that
