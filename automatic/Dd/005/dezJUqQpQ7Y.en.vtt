00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.050
 ceramics firstly very elastic solid 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.840
 material 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.380
 and secondly the ceramics allows for exactly 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.940
 do the job in any form 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.430
 ceramics are absolutely bio compatible if 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.800
 combine high hardness quality 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.650
 also wonderful biological 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.470
 compatibility of ceramics with the ability 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.190
 how glass let light through then 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.630
 available 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.629
 equally stable and translucent 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.760
 tooth material prosthetic ceramics 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.289
 it is great for doing 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.649
 crowns and bridges 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:44.649
 all ceramic all-ceramic 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.690
 crowns and bridges even with different 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.139
 lighting options do not look like 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.179
 cermet dental work 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:53.819
 that is, only lined ceramics 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.289
 metal crowns and bridges 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.600
 opaque since their metallic 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.449
 the frame does not let the rays of light through 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 time as all-ceramic crowns 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.930
 consist entirely of one only 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.020
 ceramics so they let in light 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.730
 just like natural teeth is 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.560
 looks very aesthetic before 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.280
 fulfillment goal on ceramic crowns 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.950
 and bridges 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.260
 confined only to the region not bearing 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.300
 heavy load of front teeth but 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.760
 today it is already possible to fulfill 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.430
 individual crowns or even bridges from 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.320
 three units two abutments and one 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.460
 missing between them in the area 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.920
 chewing teeth target on ceramic 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.140
 crowns and bridges have merged everything 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.100
 the best qualities of ceramics as 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.220
 material and here is the result reliability 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.970
 biocompatibility 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.280
 beauty accomplishment purpose on ceramic 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.200
 crowns and bridges 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.180
 hard and long work at 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.780
 which requires complex equipment 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.970
 for the dental laboratory so 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.810
 there is a goal on a ceramic denture 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.620
 a bit more expensive than a denture 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.620
 made of metal ceramics 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.100
 but it looks all-ceramic dental 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.660
 prosthesis in the mouth as if it were 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.660
 naturally grown tooth
