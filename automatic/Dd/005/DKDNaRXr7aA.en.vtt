00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.450
 so we will make a presentation of 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.790
 noise mittens that also serve 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.210
 anti cold and anti rain 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:17.340
 so it's different models 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.970
 There are three colors and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.560
 different concepts then the three 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.000
 black green brown colors 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 these models shame an opening 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.869
 total that is to say that we 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.280
 computer science the air that allows 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.070
 installing dutil goals without 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 disassemble the summer the camera lens 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:48.120
 photo and its models here which is one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 the used with small focal zooms and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.660
 who is telling us so we install 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.460
 the camera by sliding the camera 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.079
 and his goal through the hole there 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.770
 So it must not you're the big ctive 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.350
 and obviously not 1500 it already goes 1 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.860
 302 8 it does not work either so it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 need small small focal length with this 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.939
 last model which is so much 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.110
 cheaper probably made in china 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.000
 so we do not have the zipper 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.979
 who opens his side which means 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.030
 that if we put a big telephoto lens 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.290
 we will have to dismount the 502 of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 case if it's a reasonable zoom 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.990
 also it's a pretty short focal length 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.240
 well we slide the lens is his friend 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.170
 the device through the hole here to be able 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.060
 install the hardware 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.979
 in any case we pass the hand here 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.430
 for triggering 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.399
 in any case we have a window on 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.990
 the top to see the indications 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.920
 techniques and velcro here for 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.939
 possibly install the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:13.190
 the flash the south and the here the opening 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:16.670
 for the tone here is also a small detail 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.250
 on the models we manufacture it 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.650
 there is an inner sleeve for sliding 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.239
 a heater if one uses in 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.750
 extremely cold conditions 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:31.310
 extremely low temperatures of the months 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:36.160
 10 of - 20 minus 30 degrees so here 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.799
 we see the double slider for 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:46.569
 lock up to radiate the output 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:49.880
 tripod and 2nd slider to close 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.190
 here so the window with window 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:59.030
 be careful not to fold it otherwise 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:04.209
 leave a mark here is we see the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:09.790
 small pouch for m lachaud fort est 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:13.250
 if we see well here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.560
 so here I took an average goal 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.060
 that's 10,200 so here I settle 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.920
 the device so I took a model with 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.519
 total opening then it gets pretty 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.440
 easily 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.060
 so no need to disassemble the lens 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.030
 of the device 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.030
 we install like that 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:51.040
 and we close the future is clear no 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:56.180
 possibly we serve the small the c1 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:03.310
 the camera is ready the others 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.850
 models there an example we can not pass 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.270
 the sun visor 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.600
 we must dismount that we will try to 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.790
 pass but we see quite complicated 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.580
 is obliged from there again it's a small 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.290
 focal if it's a bigger focal length 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.700
 kind 500 obviously it's impossible 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.450
 so we have to dismount 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.450
 the device if a little bit complicated 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:38.240
 here we go and we have the possibility with the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.460
 small shutter we can then the little calf 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.720
 the sacer has also when one is not 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.730
 behind the device is happening 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.300
 nothing happens that allows you not to 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.140
 to be seen by the other side so that's 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.060
 interesting 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.980
 a little detail every time he 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.420
 there is double slider so that will allow 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:05:07.340
 to install the camera on a tripod 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:11.030
 it's planned and the Chinese model so 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.770
 the same we will try to put it in 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.240
 unclassified 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:19.090
 on big focal length it's not going to go 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.620
 there will be a disassembly of the lens 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.040
 to install the device 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:30.640
 photo on his lens so here have 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.640
 little does too 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.850
 here 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.050
 little difference is that at the back 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:51.550
 we do not have the opening for the 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:54.820
 viewing the screen otherwise it's 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.210
 basic but less than enough for this 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.790
 limited budget 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.300
 it's still not bad so now 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:05.270
 we will make an audio presentation of 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.880
 to show the effectiveness of mittens 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.840
 anti-noise obviously we do not cheat 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.190
 again to decrease the audio levels for 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.280
 make you think it's more or 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.890
 less effective we will play it true with 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.470
 the microphone of the camera 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:29.000
 so that's the sound the device makes 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:37.520
 nude photo now here with the 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:38.330
 noise muffle now from a few 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.800
 meters further 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.800
 it changes things a little bit 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:58.520
 there we are at I am ten meters from the 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:58.520
 meaning camera where his picture by photo 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:18.000
 and without the burst cover the model 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:21.500
 Chinese have actually the Chinese model 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.500
 have seen by bus 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.100
 so the model jama in view by sight 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.570
 and a burst mode 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.030
 you have seen the effectiveness of 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.669
 anti noise moves it does not suffocate 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:00.460
 completely the noise but a big one 

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:03.009
 part of the tones especially acute that 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.500
 the birds perceive enormously 

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:08.330
 not forget also that his mittens 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.120
 protects from the rain and protects from the cold 

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:15.669
 so that's important in 

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.669
 the use of this kind of mittens
