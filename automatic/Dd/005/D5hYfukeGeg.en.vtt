00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
numbers that are less than 100 we don't

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.190 
numbers that are less than 100 we don't
write<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> digits<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:30.480> look<00:00:30.600> at<00:00:30.720> lesson<00:00:30.869> 2

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
take a look at this number here we of

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.300 
take a look at this number here we of
course<00:00:45.660> know<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> number<00:00:46.739> 21

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
way to write that number now let's take

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.660 
way to write that number now let's take
a<00:00:56.550> look<00:00:56.790> at<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.000> number<00:00:58.160> many<00:00:59.160> people<00:00:59.399> would

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
a look at this number many people would

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.200 
a look at this number many people would
say<00:00:59.880> that<00:01:00.059> number<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.980> 101<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.850> actually

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
say that number as 101 that's actually

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
say that number as 101 that's actually
not<00:01:03.360> correct<00:01:03.840> we're<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.320> supposed<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.769> say

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
not correct we're not supposed to say

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
not correct we're not supposed to say
the<00:01:05.159> end<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:06.240> proper<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.780> say<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.320> write

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the end the proper way to say and write

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
the end the proper way to say and write
this<00:01:07.619> number<00:01:08.009> is<00:01:09.709> 101<00:01:10.909> we<00:01:11.909> use<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> word<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
this number is 101 we use the word and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.469 
this number is 101 we use the word and
to<00:01:13.259> mean<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.469> decimal<00:01:14.130> point<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.969> example<00:01:15.359> we

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to mean a decimal point for example we

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
to mean a decimal point for example we
would<00:01:15.569> say<00:01:15.810> ten<00:01:16.289> dollars<00:01:16.709> and<00:01:16.950> ninety<00:01:17.340> seven

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
would say ten dollars and ninety seven

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
would say ten dollars and ninety seven
cents<00:01:17.999> the<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.840> represents<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> decimal

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
cents the and represents the decimal

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
cents the and represents the decimal
point<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.700> since<00:01:20.939> there's<00:01:21.149> no<00:01:21.270> decimal<00:01:21.779> it's

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
point here since there's no decimal it's

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.639 
point here since there's no decimal it's
proper<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.649> just<00:01:22.920> say<00:01:23.179> 101<00:01:24.179> again<00:01:25.079> not<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> big

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
proper to just say 101 again not a big

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.199 
proper to just say 101 again not a big
deal<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.310> proper<00:01:26.639> way<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:26.819> doing

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
deal but this is the proper way of doing

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:31.569 
deal but this is the proper way of doing
it<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:28.350> let's<00:01:28.529> take<00:01:28.679> a<00:01:28.709> look<00:01:28.889> at<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.069> number

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.069 

okay<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.789> can<00:01:32.969> be<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.270> hard<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.599> read<00:01:33.899> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
okay that can be very hard to read and

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.209 
okay that can be very hard to read and
what<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.099> do<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:36.389> put<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.929> comma<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> left

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
what we do is we put a comma to the left

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.760 
what we do is we put a comma to the left
of<00:01:38.340> every<00:01:38.729> three<00:01:38.999> digits<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.599> that<00:01:39.689> helps<00:01:40.590> us

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
of every three digits and that helps us

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
of every three digits and that helps us
see<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.609> number<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.090> easily<00:01:42.389> and<00:01:42.569> from<00:01:43.529> that

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
see the number more easily and from that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.959 
see the number more easily and from that
we<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.700> number<00:01:44.999> is<00:01:45.409> 1<00:01:46.409> million

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.019 

ten<00:01:50.969> thousand<00:01:51.509> ten<00:01:52.069> okay<00:01:53.069> this<00:01:53.609> is<00:01:53.789> just<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:54.029 
ten thousand ten okay this is just a

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:55.609 
ten thousand ten okay this is just a
basic<00:01:54.179> lesson<00:01:54.749> about<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.109> write<00:01:55.439> out

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
basic lesson about how to write out

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.980 
basic lesson about how to write out
numbers<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.130> words<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.669> later<00:01:57.389> lessons<00:01:57.630> will

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
numbers in words in later lessons will

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.549 
numbers in words in later lessons will
learn<00:01:58.139> much<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.499> about<00:01:58.740> how<00:01:59.099> numbers<00:01:59.399> work
