sunburst<00:00:38.449> now<00:00:39.290> this<00:00:39.500> guitar<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:40.300> probably<00:00:41.300> one

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
sunburst now this guitar is probably one

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.939 
sunburst now this guitar is probably one
of<00:00:41.449> our<00:00:41.570> star<00:00:41.780> favorites<00:00:42.230> in<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.410> shop<00:00:42.620> it's

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
of our star favorites in the shop it's

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.889 
of our star favorites in the shop it's
got<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:43.370> really<00:00:43.520> nice<00:00:43.670> relic<00:00:44.030> in<00:00:44.149> on<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.390> not

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
got this really nice relic in on it not

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:45.610 
got this really nice relic in on it not
too<00:00:45.079> invasive

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
too invasive

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.310 
too invasive
it's<00:00:45.829> just<00:00:46.040> classy<00:00:46.550> looking<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:46.910> think<00:00:47.320> it's

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
it's just classy looking I think it's

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.840 
it's just classy looking I think it's
got<00:00:48.440> 3-way<00:00:48.830> pickup<00:00:49.040> selector<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.550> well<00:00:49.670> even

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
got 3-way pickup selector as well even

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.340 
got 3-way pickup selector as well even
though<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.089> Esquire<00:00:50.390> only<00:00:50.600> has<00:00:50.720> one<00:00:50.900> pickup

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
though the Esquire only has one pickup

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.380 
though the Esquire only has one pickup
now<00:00:51.680> what<00:00:51.920> we<00:00:51.980> have<00:00:52.160> here<00:00:52.400> in<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.150> back

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
now what we have here in the back

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.750 
now what we have here in the back
position<00:00:53.540> there<00:00:54.110> it's<00:00:54.650> bypassing<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.579> town

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
position there it's bypassing the town

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.979 
position there it's bypassing the town
circuit<00:00:56.269> so<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:56.510> makes<00:00:56.720> no<00:00:56.960> difference

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
circuit so it makes no difference

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.619 
circuit so it makes no difference
whether<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.710> have<00:00:57.920> this<00:00:58.070> tone<00:00:58.430> on<00:00:58.699> or<00:00:58.820> off<00:00:58.970> so

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
whether I have this tone on or off so

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.329 
whether I have this tone on or off so
basically<00:01:00.050> with<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:00.290> it<00:01:00.800> puts<00:01:01.220> its

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
basically with that it puts its

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.790 
basically with that it puts its
bypassing<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.660> tone<00:01:02.840> knob<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.320> just<00:01:03.559> get

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
bypassing the the tone knob you just get

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.529 
bypassing the the tone knob you just get
a<00:01:03.829> lot<00:01:04.100> more<00:01:04.160> output<00:01:04.640> coming<00:01:04.879> from<00:01:05.119> it<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:05.449> it

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
a lot more output coming from it so it

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:06.430 
a lot more output coming from it so it
makes<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.780> difference<00:01:05.869> if<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.229> want<00:01:06.380> a

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
makes the difference if you want a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.620 
makes the difference if you want a
little<00:01:06.649> bit<00:01:06.830> more<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.640> pushed<00:01:07.940> sound<00:01:08.300> coming

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
little bit more the pushed sound coming

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.050 
little bit more the pushed sound coming
from<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:08.990> in<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.860> middle<00:01:10.100> it's<00:01:10.610> just<00:01:10.820> kind<00:01:11.030> of

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
from it in the middle it's just kind of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.190 
from it in the middle it's just kind of
dead<00:01:11.210> standard<00:01:11.539> wiring<00:01:11.869> like<00:01:12.020> you'd<00:01:12.110> expect

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
dead standard wiring like you'd expect

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.749 
dead standard wiring like you'd expect
you've<00:01:12.560> got<00:01:12.649> your<00:01:12.770> volume<00:01:12.890> there<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.580> your

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
you've got your volume there and your

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.600 
you've got your volume there and your
tone<00:01:14.000> there<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.770> nothing's<00:01:15.770> bypassed<00:01:16.190> just

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
tone there and nothing's bypassed just

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.940 
tone there and nothing's bypassed just
the<00:01:16.670> way<00:01:16.729> you'd<00:01:16.880> expect<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:17.360> in<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.440> final<00:01:18.800> one

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
the way you'd expect it in the final one

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.740 
the way you'd expect it in the final one
with<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.490> Eldred<00:01:19.970> wiring<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:20.570> got<00:01:20.660> on

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
with this Eldred wiring that it's got on

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.180 
with this Eldred wiring that it's got on
here<00:01:20.990> you've<00:01:21.259> got<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.649> you've<00:01:22.070> got<00:01:22.100> a

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
here you've got the you've got a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.859 
here you've got the you've got a
capacitor<00:01:22.729> in<00:01:22.850> there<00:01:23.000> which<00:01:23.090> basically<00:01:23.539> gives

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
capacitor in there which basically gives

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.710 
capacitor in there which basically gives
you<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.679> pickup<00:01:25.190> there<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:25.580> with<00:01:25.729> tone<00:01:26.270> half

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
you the pickup there but with tone half

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.050 
you the pickup there but with tone half
off<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.830> it's<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> quick<00:01:28.280> way<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.490> switching<00:01:28.940> to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
off so it's a quick way of switching to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.820 
off so it's a quick way of switching to
a<00:01:29.090> bit<00:01:29.330> more<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.810> kind<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.020> vocally<00:01:30.530> sound

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
a bit more of a kind of vocally sound

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.740 
a bit more of a kind of vocally sound
coming<00:01:31.190> from<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.610> little<00:01:31.759> bit<00:01:31.880> softer<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:32.600> bit

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
coming from it a little bit softer a bit

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.350 
coming from it a little bit softer a bit
more<00:01:32.899> mid-range<00:01:33.380> coming<00:01:34.009> up<00:01:34.159> which<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:35.090> really

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
more mid-range coming up which I really
