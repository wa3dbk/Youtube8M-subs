very<00:02:01.829> successful<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.969> walking

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
very successful is to have walking

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.899 
very successful is to have walking
tandems<00:02:04.079> throughout<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> machine<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.879> see

we go towards the rear of the machine

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.599 
we go towards the rear of the machine
and<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.410> look<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:01.829> down<00:03:02.099> through<00:03:02.489> the
