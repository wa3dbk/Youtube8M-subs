00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.930

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.010
 little of your career I read 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.420
 Well, check out last year 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.640
 I participated in the classic arnold not 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 classify the four best go that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 it was an event too strong is a 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.880
 event you know better than anyone that the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.820
 participate in a tree and stay in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.870
 four best is a very much triumph 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.820
 good for 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.220
 now I plan to rest in this year and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.990
 part of the other and try to look for a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.980
 same follow him with the same thing I think 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.140
 as long as there is health and there is a lot of desire 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.720
 to keep going I can still give 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.630
 war in a world cup in a field in a 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.280
 north america I think so let's hope 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.110
 give time to time to prove it 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.570
 not how far you want to get in this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.550
 sport leon notice that if I would like 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.150
 win a class and maybe a lot of people 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.720
 say this because it is not very difficult but 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.670
 I think the event is going to be difficult 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.140
 If I see it difficult, I think that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.720
 while I sit with all that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.640
 power that energy to keep going 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.880
 and above all, why is it going 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.550
 in the physical not that right now for the age 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.070
 that I have stature that I have then I 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.350
 I think it 's very good weight 92 93 kilos 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.930
 I bring up 30 kilos above me 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.440
 weight with good muscle quality 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.360
 still if people know you for your 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.520
 muscle quality and tell us how you have 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 developed that positive mentality 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.240
 that determined mentality look 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.520
 which I think is 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.280
 is that as long as you're 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.470
 completely firm in the mind that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.910
 you are looking for everything you want 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.710
 I believe that once you are passionate 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.350
 enthusiastic too I think not 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.730
 there may be another goal to be searching already 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.980
 be football box this I do not know x discipline 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.250
 more than the one that you have always formed 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.140
 in mind no and one of my goals then 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.180

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.180

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.060

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.380

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.320
 percent once you do not like me 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.580
 side and go the physicoconstructivism 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.120
