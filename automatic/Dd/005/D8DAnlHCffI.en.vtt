00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
and installing Ford trans range sensors

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.839 
and installing Ford trans range sensors
and<00:00:18.869> aligning<00:00:19.869> them<00:00:20.340> they're<00:00:21.340> pretty<00:00:21.580> common

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
and aligning them they're pretty common

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.850 
and aligning them they're pretty common
to<00:00:22.000> go<00:00:22.180> bad<00:00:22.360> on<00:00:22.390> the<00:00:22.630> CD<00:00:22.960> for<00:00:23.230> ease<00:00:23.439> and<00:00:23.470> the

rotting out issues at the pins and the

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.760 
rotting out issues at the pins and the
connector<00:00:36.940> so<00:00:37.149> you<00:00:37.989> may<00:00:38.110> find<00:00:38.320> yourself

connector so you may find yourself

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.620 
connector so you may find yourself
changing<00:00:39.100> one<00:00:39.309> out<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.760> I'm<00:00:40.390> going<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.570> show

changing one out and I'm going to show

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.240 
changing one out and I'm going to show
you<00:00:40.719> how<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.840> do<00:00:41.050> without<00:00:41.410> needing<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.800> special

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
you how to do without needing a special

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.730 
you how to do without needing a special
alignment<00:00:42.760> tool<00:00:42.969> and<00:00:43.440> we're<00:00:44.440> going<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.620> get

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
alignment tool and we're going to get

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.350 
alignment tool and we're going to get
started<00:00:45.040> on<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.190> right<00:00:45.460> now<00:00:45.490> okay<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:46.180> the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
started on that right now okay so the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.640 
started on that right now okay so the
first<00:00:46.540> thing<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:46.840> need<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:46.990> do<00:00:47.170> is<00:00:47.350> get<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
first thing we need to do is get the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.400 
first thing we need to do is get the
transmission<00:00:48.160> into<00:00:48.940> neutral<00:00:49.300> so<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.140> park

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
transmission into neutral so the park

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.610 
transmission into neutral so the park
first<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.360> you'll<00:00:52.510> feel<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:52.810> spring<00:00:53.170> tension

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
first and you'll feel a spring tension

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.010 
first and you'll feel a spring tension
then<00:00:54.370> go<00:00:54.520> back<00:00:54.670> two<00:00:54.910> clicks<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.390> neutral<00:00:58.020> okay

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
then go back two clicks to neutral okay

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.130 
then go back two clicks to neutral okay
now<00:00:59.260> we're<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.470> neutral<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.600> can<00:01:01.780> slip

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
now we're in neutral then you can slip

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.609 
now we're in neutral then you can slip
the<00:01:02.520> trans<00:01:03.520> range<00:01:03.820> sensor<00:01:04.269> on<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:05.079> has<00:01:05.320> little

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
the trans range sensor on it has little

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.310 
the trans range sensor on it has little
nubs<00:01:05.950> right<00:01:06.220> there<00:01:06.570> top<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.780> bottom<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.229> on

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
nubs right there top and bottom and on

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.039 
nubs right there top and bottom and on
top<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.220> they<00:01:12.640> go<00:01:12.790> into<00:01:12.880> little<00:01:13.390> slots<00:01:13.720> on<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
top and they go into little slots on the

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.639 
top and they go into little slots on the
actual<00:01:14.500> manual<00:01:15.179> positioning<00:01:16.179> shaft<00:01:16.499> push<00:01:17.499> it

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
actual manual positioning shaft push it

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.219 
actual manual positioning shaft push it
all<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.889> way<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.159> we're<00:01:19.149> ready<00:01:19.479> a<00:01:19.569> neutral<00:01:20.079> up

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
all the way in we're ready a neutral up

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:31.670 
all the way in we're ready a neutral up
here<00:01:20.499> okay<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:24.729> your<00:01:24.850> bolts<00:01:25.179> in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.570 

by<00:01:32.220> hand

it's
then<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.940> city<00:01:45.210> using<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.690> special

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
then the city using that special

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.920 
then the city using that special
alignment<00:01:46.409> tool<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.970> got<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.659> make

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
alignment tool all you got to do is make

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.359 
alignment tool all you got to do is make
sure<00:01:50.420> those<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:51.750> fine<00:01:52.530> lines<00:01:52.950> right<00:01:53.340> there

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
sure those two fine lines right there

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.570 
sure those two fine lines right there
are<00:01:53.820> lined<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.190> tighten

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
are lined up and then you can tighten

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.560 
are lined up and then you can tighten
down<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.759> bolts<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.610> then<00:01:59.610> recheck<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.330> make

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
down your bolts and then recheck it make

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.320

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
sure those are still lined up well this

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.969 
sure those are still lined up well this
one's<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.659> little<00:02:03.899> bit<00:02:04.200> off<00:02:04.350> let's<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:04.860> if<00:02:04.950> I

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
one's a little bit off let's see if I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.300 
one's a little bit off let's see if I
going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.250> one-handed<00:02:09.770> it's<00:02:10.770> got<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> little

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
going to do one-handed it's got a little

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.880 
going to do one-handed it's got a little
bit<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.520> leeway<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.709> see<00:02:13.709> it's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
bit of leeway but you can see it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.380 
bit of leeway but you can see it's
aligned<00:02:16.370> those<00:02:17.370> two<00:02:17.610> little<00:02:17.850> lines<00:02:18.150> right

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
aligned those two little lines right

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.550 
aligned those two little lines right
there<00:02:18.420> those<00:02:18.630> fine<00:02:18.989> lines<00:02:21.140> it's<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.290> got<00:02:22.350> to
