put a link to right here
alright<00:00:15.139> here's<00:00:15.410> how<00:00:15.559> the<00:00:15.620> intro<00:00:15.950> goes<00:00:16.160> just<00:00:16.430> a

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
alright here's how the intro goes just a

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:50.200 
alright here's how the intro goes just a
brief<00:00:16.700> demonstration<00:00:16.940> of<00:00:17.510> it

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.180 

okay<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> gets<00:00:51.630> into<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> song<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.650> this

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
okay then it gets into the song so this

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.229 
okay then it gets into the song so this
is<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.580> starts<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.540> C<00:00:55.820> really<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> starts

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
is how it starts on a C really it starts

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
is how it starts on a C really it starts
on<00:00:57.390> three<00:00:57.930> lower<00:00:58.170> C's<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.830> I'm<00:00:58.890> playing<00:00:59.160> one

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
on three lower C's and I'm playing one

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.619 
on three lower C's and I'm playing one
down<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.000> probably<00:01:00.210> can't<00:01:00.540> see

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
down here that you probably can't see

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.950 
down here that you probably can't see
but<00:01:02.390> we'll<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.420> start<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.019> an<00:01:04.199> octave<00:01:05.960> low

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but we'll just start on an octave low

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
but we'll just start on an octave low
seat<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.979> lower<00:01:08.430> seat<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.910> this<00:01:09.060> C<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.390> here's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
seat the lower seat to this C and here's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.900 
seat the lower seat to this C and here's
middle<00:01:09.750> C<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.910> that's

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
middle C so we're going like this that's

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.910 
middle C so we're going like this that's
it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.490 
it
low<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.979> high<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:14.880> hand<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.830 

in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.800> very<00:01:20.070> beginning<00:01:20.220> G<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.820> B<00:01:20.850> flat<00:01:21.000> or

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
in the very beginning G and B flat or

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.820 
in the very beginning G and B flat or
twice<00:01:22.259> F<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.460> flat<00:01:23.759> twice<00:01:24.170> B<00:01:25.170> flat<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.619> G

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
twice F and a flat twice B flat and G

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.980 
twice F and a flat twice B flat and G
twice<00:01:26.130> G<00:01:26.850> once<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.520> then<00:01:29.520> C<00:01:29.789> an<00:01:29.910> E<00:01:30.090> flat<00:01:30.330> one

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
twice G once and then C an E flat one

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.090 
twice G once and then C an E flat one
so<00:01:32.590> we<00:01:32.979> start<00:01:33.250> on<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.430> C<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.150> left<00:01:34.180> hand

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.609 

I'm<00:01:39.640> showing<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.869> fingering<00:01:41.530> on

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
I'm showing you the the fingering on

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.770 
I'm showing you the the fingering on
this<00:01:41.830> just<00:01:42.040> because<00:01:42.100> I'm<00:01:43.030> just<00:01:43.630> for

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
this just because I'm just for

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.420 
this just because I'm just for
demonstration<00:01:44.380> purposes<00:01:44.409> but<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.100> can<00:01:45.310> use

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
demonstration purposes but you can use

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.460 
demonstration purposes but you can use
any<00:01:45.580> fingering<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.180> want<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.990> spite<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.350> what

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
any fingering you want in spite of what

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.810 
any fingering you want in spite of what
some<00:01:47.710> people<00:01:47.950> will<00:01:48.070> tell<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.280> but<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:48.670> can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
some people will tell you but you can

00:01:48.820 --> 00:02:00.400 
some people will tell you but you can
use<00:01:49.090> any<00:01:49.479> finger<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.229> want<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:50.950> again

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.930 

that's<00:02:01.410> it<00:02:01.650> now<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:01.920> move<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> e-flat

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
that's it now we move up to the e-flat

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.250 
that's it now we move up to the e-flat
same<00:02:03.360> thing<00:02:03.660> lower<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.920> upper<00:02:05.870> octaves<00:02:06.870> in<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
same thing lower to upper octaves in the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.350 
same thing lower to upper octaves in the
left<00:02:07.770> hand<00:02:08.040> and<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.790> this<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.180> right

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
left hand and we do this in the right

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.540 
left hand and we do this in the right
hand<00:02:09.660> similar<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.250> bit<00:02:11.430> different

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.060 

so<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> same<00:02:17.850> notes<00:02:18.090> G<00:02:18.390> B<00:02:18.540> flat<00:02:18.570> F<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.440> flat<00:02:19.770> E

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
so the same notes G B flat F a flat E

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.050 
so the same notes G B flat F a flat E
flat<00:02:20.190> G<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.540> like<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.920> twice

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
flat G but we do it like this twice

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:35.450 
flat G but we do it like this twice
twice<00:02:24.060> twice<00:02:25.760> once<00:02:27.140> once<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:34.040> now<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.280> back

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
twice twice once once so now we go back

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.340 
twice twice once once so now we go back
down<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> C<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.330> repeat<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:36.960> we<00:02:37.110> played

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
down to the C and repeat what we played

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.080 
down to the C and repeat what we played
a<00:02:37.620> moment<00:02:38.100> ago<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.670> beginning<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.790> one

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
a moment ago in the beginning now one

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.970 
a moment ago in the beginning now one
more<00:02:45.300> on<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.600> intro<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.230> repeats<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.800> E<00:02:46.830> flat

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
more on the intro it repeats the E flat

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.440 
more on the intro it repeats the E flat
sequence<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.209> played<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:53.270> back<00:02:54.270> to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
sequence that we just played so back to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.630 
sequence that we just played so back to
the<00:02:54.570> C<00:02:55.580> repeating

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.190 

now<00:03:00.640> we<00:03:00.700> come<00:03:00.940> down<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.300> part<00:03:03.870> that's<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
now we come down to this part that's a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.140 
now we come down to this part that's a
flat<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.800> we're<00:03:06.040> again<00:03:06.250> same<00:03:06.700> deal<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.000> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
flat and we're again same deal on the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.610 
flat and we're again same deal on the
left<00:03:07.390> hand<00:03:07.600> we're<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:08.080> low<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
left hand we're just going low to the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.260 
left hand we're just going low to the
high<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:09.310> flat<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:10.530> flat<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:12.130> see<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:13.000> can<00:03:13.120> also

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
high a flat a flat and see you can also

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.320 
high a flat a flat and see you can also
add<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.690> E<00:03:13.720> flat<00:03:14.140> if<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.500> really<00:03:14.740> want<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:19.240> we

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
add the E flat if you really want and we

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.470 
add the E flat if you really want and we
hold<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.630> through<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.990> two<00:03:20.170> measures<00:03:24.480> now

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
hold that through the two measures now

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.360 
hold that through the two measures now
we<00:03:25.540> come<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.990> see<00:03:26.290> that's<00:03:26.590> an<00:03:26.740> E<00:03:26.830> flat<00:03:27.010> chord

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
we come to a see that's an E flat chord
