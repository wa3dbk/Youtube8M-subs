eye exam the vital sign of the eye of
course<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> vision<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.460> vision<00:00:14.670> is

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
course is the vision so the vision is

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.340 
course is the vision so the vision is
