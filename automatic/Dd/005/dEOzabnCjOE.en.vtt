huge difference I mean you can see that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.170 
huge difference I mean you can see that

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
I have no lashes so down there wiggle I

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.550 
I have no lashes so down there wiggle I
really<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> brush<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.079> gets<00:01:37.380> in

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
really like the brush it really gets in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.340 
really like the brush it really gets in
there<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.710> separates<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
there and separates I think that was a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.219 
there and separates I think that was a
big<00:01:40.650> issue<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.100> me<00:01:41.460> especially<00:01:41.960> because<00:01:42.960> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
big issue for me especially because I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.130 
big issue for me especially because I
have<00:01:43.409> thick<00:01:43.829> short<00:01:44.490> lashes<00:01:44.759> low-income<00:01:45.630> thick

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
have thick short lashes low-income thick

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
have thick short lashes low-income thick
but<00:01:46.409> they're<00:01:46.890> thicker<00:01:47.159> than<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.670> long

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
but they're thicker than they are long

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.440 
but they're thicker than they are long
so<00:01:49.610> wiggle<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.360> those

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so wiggle in there and get some of those

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.830 
so wiggle in there and get some of those
clumps<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.930> before<00:01:52.170> i<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.229> those<00:01:52.500> fibers<00:01:52.950> on

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
clumps up before i put those fibers on

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.760 
clumps up before i put those fibers on
already<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.930> huge<00:01:55.259> difference<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:57.649> can't<00:01:58.649> even

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
