00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
wrecking stuff and I it kind of felt

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.060 
wrecking stuff and I it kind of felt
filler<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.570> can't<00:04:15.989> recall<00:04:16.410> if<00:04:16.770> that<00:04:16.980> was

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
filler I can't recall if that was

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.590 
filler I can't recall if that was
exactly<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.549> mom<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.940> wasn't<00:04:18.090> too<00:04:18.330> long

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
exactly the mom it wasn't too long

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.380 
exactly the mom it wasn't too long
thankfully<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.650> wasn't<00:04:19.830> like<00:04:20.030> but<00:04:21.030> uh<00:04:21.090> that

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
thankfully so I wasn't like but uh that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.460 
thankfully so I wasn't like but uh that
was<00:04:21.419> probably<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.780> slowest<00:04:22.169> part<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.380> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
was probably the slowest part of the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.529 
was probably the slowest part of the
episode<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.370> best<00:04:23.550> part<00:04:23.789> was<00:04:23.820> really<00:04:24.150> the

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
episode and the best part was really the

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.629 
episode and the best part was really the
flashbacks<00:04:25.169> that<00:04:25.350> we<00:04:25.410> got<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.680> see<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.220> you
