00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.859
 and like the Alessandro squash board 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.309
 Milan and today I'll talk about how to do the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.309
 muted 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.950
 the forced one is a very read and vast shot 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.530
 which is done in the front 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.960
 of the field you should get used to 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.240
 of speaks forced whenever 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.520
 eat your opponent back 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.890
 in the back corner and he answers you 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.890
 with a shot that returns to the center 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.059
 given the fast nature of this sport 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.670
 you should train yourself on the damped at least 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.059
 when you train on the long line it is a lot 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.580
 difficult to boil damped are 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.360
 in fact two fundamental elements of the 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.360
 squash game 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.960
 there are three situations in which you should 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.060
 definitely make a muffled one 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.060
 when you're near the front wall 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.659
 when you're in the center and yours 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.050
 opponent throws a ball that returns 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.130
 towards your position and when you are 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.079
 in the back of the field 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.960
 in your opponent's ball back 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.810
 towards the center the following instructions 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.509
 they are valid both for the right and for the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.729
 backhand when doing a damping 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.610
 you will try to aim at the lower part 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.549
 of the front wall the closest to the team 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.310
 try not to aim in the corner so that 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.350
 the ball can indirectly give on 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.229
 nyt 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.310
 now to make a muffle he opened the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.369
 racket with the plate upwards 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.920
 megale two knees assured that the 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.420
 ball is in a higher position than 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.380
 that of the team when you try to 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.630
 damping the swing in the damper is a bit 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.849
 different from that of the long line that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.289
 hit the ball when the nearest one 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.810
 to you 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.549
 this guarantees you to give a touch 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.849
 to the ball 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.980
 using your shoulder here are two 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.950
 exercises you can use now for 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.410
 work on your muffled then play 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.540
 the damped and alternate with strokes 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.480
 high and easy so then you can 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.730
 dampen again when you dampen try to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.340
 play to win and don't worry 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.750
 if he can't recover the ball 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.690
 another exercise I consider 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 better to do a boss then 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.410
 run towards the ball for later 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.209
 sell it and then come back 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.790
 back and do another post is another 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.109
 shelled out and so on 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.819
 this is a great exercise for that 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.250
 simulates a game 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.170
 if you want to make things 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.050
 i cd weigh an exercise called i 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.920
 four corners I talk about in the video 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.770
 here linked I wish you to train 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.190
 heavily and have fun thanks for 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.190
 having looked
