00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 and back with over 115 this one is the worst 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.389
 right it's a rom that's android it 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.849
 predicted 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 only she comes with some things acm 11 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.190
 so he is the developer she 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.449
 filled in the flaws that it does not have 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.660
 so the interesting thing is that it comes 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.910
 with fx audio which is the cna equalizer 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.849
 11 actually of the semi um cs that the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.189
 version is even better because you have a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.550
 control of the bass and here the effect 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.040
 surround is what you can change is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 perfect has profiles of serious pop rock 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.950
 there are not several types there you can ride 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.050
 Yours and not thinking is in the custom 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.950
 not to change the mid and treble 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 and here you can change is the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
 audio a small big room effect 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.219
 eco etc 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.800
 and here you can switch to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.010
 heard with loudspeakers does not have several 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.289
 options is very cool this equalizer and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.899
 darron also comes with a 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.979
 aac files from cm 11 that I find in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.750
 my opinion is much better than the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.320
 management of what goes on android is very 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.530
 This is basic here, it 's really cool. 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 unfortunately this street is not supported by 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.049
 usb connector 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 no you can not connect a pen drive 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.850
 or hd so the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.799
 files the law will not access the improvement 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.200
 has a built-in screen recorder. 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.549
 if you touch this button it will record screen 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.190
 the smartphone is pretty cool this 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.810
 coming app 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.930
 wen also here the application of a 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.320
 ground you use the flash and the camera 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.050
 as a flashlight and also have here the apollo 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.430
 which is the music player that comes in femi 11 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.480
 so here it is if you do not like it 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.080
 It's google music, you can use this baby. 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.210
 here the goal is you and managing is the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.950
 access then cultivate their applications 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.870
 arrange with the latest and with apps 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.670
 to manage and also the camera that 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.070
 This camera is the sp 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.230
 It is not the camera that comes google 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.850
 android l so is the camera is 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.619
 accustomed to seeing in the semi 11 for example 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:14.060
 you play safe they have access to the options 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:16.280
 For this, here for her speed is 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.310
 the focus 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.310
 now rate the shooting speed 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.010
 reasonable oiliness is not among the 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.720
 better but ok it comes with the gallery 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 also old was not when the joy 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.800
 of android l so there goes that they think of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.540
 gaucho is each of these a blend 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.660
 half of the 100,000 eleven cast kit 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.250
 with android is what a preview version 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.230
 but otherwise all that android it has 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.200
 offered here 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.030
 the question is whether these settings 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:00.120
 barrel currency in version is the version 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.870
 more leaked than fpv and we have 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.959
 and then the last code is that google 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.150
 released and started with very good fluidity 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.190
 also stable all the resources already 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.540
 are working well at least until the 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 text is all ok 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.540
 battery life also equal in there 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:24.930
 Profile's nice here that he made the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:27.120
 changes without interfering with the 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.070
 all applications are very good at 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.350
 everything is working ok then those 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.450
 who want to test and even want Japan 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.720
 played whatever already have empathy and 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.180
 android she did not like the pure version 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.230
 This is going to be here that comes with some 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.790
 more resources then one fill some 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.050
 some holes still left on the street 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.209
 predicted 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.170
 and then you have some components of cma 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.810
 11 For you to use here it's pretty cool this one 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.150
 Street when you're there it takes too long. 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.420
 to format the system partition as 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.750
 Strange you 're there there was twb is 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.230
 formatting is system parent took 15 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.970
 minutes on this screen but there is normal 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.390
 first post also takes a lot here 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.250
 in this clothing but the others are there 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.700
 tranquil 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.060
 and do not need to install apps is the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.940
 application is already there is narrated the app 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.670
 store you notice if the hangouts the chrome is 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.570
