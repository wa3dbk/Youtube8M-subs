switching to front view and now just I
think<00:04:04.849> that<00:04:04.969> demonstration<00:04:05.540> provides<00:04:06.349> a

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
think that demonstration provides a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.649 
think that demonstration provides a
pretty<00:04:06.650> good<00:04:06.920> indication<00:04:07.549> of<00:04:07.909> how<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.359> thing

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
pretty good indication of how this thing

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.509 
pretty good indication of how this thing
works

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
works

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.259 
works
camera<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:11.329> fell<00:04:11.569> over<00:04:12.189> so<00:04:13.189> I'm<00:04:13.790> gonna<00:04:14.000> pull

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
camera just fell over so I'm gonna pull

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:14.800 
camera just fell over so I'm gonna pull
over

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
over

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.459 
over
and<00:04:18.190> disconnect<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.280> off
