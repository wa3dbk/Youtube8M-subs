00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
a capture of them I think it's a little

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.050 
a capture of them I think it's a little
bit<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.099> it<00:02:00.190> with<00:02:00.220> shown<00:02:00.459> actually<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:00.880> my

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
maybe check it out down below but anyway

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.820 
maybe check it out down below but anyway
two<00:02:04.330> minutes<00:02:04.750> into<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.080> gameplay<00:02:05.259> just<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.709> bit

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
two minutes into the gameplay just a bit

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.559 
two minutes into the gameplay just a bit
of<00:02:05.890> sniping<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.459> the<00:02:06.580> background<00:02:06.970> this<00:02:07.360> sniper

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
of sniping on the background this sniper

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:08.850 
of sniping on the background this sniper
was<00:02:07.810> really<00:02:08.050> awesome<00:02:08.319> it's<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.500> only<00:02:08.619> sniper

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
was really awesome it's the only sniper

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.139 
was really awesome it's the only sniper
we<00:02:09.069> were<00:02:09.130> able<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.399> use<00:02:09.550> at<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.729> event<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.090> as

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
we were able to use at the event and as

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.390 
we were able to use at the event and as
you<00:02:10.239> see<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.539> one<00:02:10.780> shooter<00:02:11.410> kind<00:02:12.190> of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
you see it's a one shooter kind of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.250 
you see it's a one shooter kind of
sniper<00:02:12.640> bolt-action<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.659> has<00:02:13.780> one<00:02:14.049> bullet

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
sniper bolt-action and it has one bullet

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.649 
sniper bolt-action and it has one bullet
at<00:02:14.469> a<00:02:14.560> time<00:02:14.590> which<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.400> pretty<00:02:15.700> weird<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.269> I

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
at a time which is pretty weird but I

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.270 
at a time which is pretty weird but I
think<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.230> creates<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.650> sniper<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.099> works

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
think it creates a sniper that works

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.059 
think it creates a sniper that works
better<00:02:18.519> than<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.730> kind<00:02:18.879> of

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
better than this kind of

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.500 
better than this kind of
situation<00:02:19.489> while<00:02:19.609> you're<00:02:19.730> shooting<00:02:19.879> from

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
situation while you're shooting from

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.849 
situation while you're shooting from
rains<00:02:20.780> using<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.140> as<00:02:21.230> an<00:02:21.319> actual<00:02:21.560> sniper

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
rains using it as an actual sniper

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.259 
rains using it as an actual sniper
rather<00:02:22.280> than<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.579> running<00:02:22.760> around<00:02:22.939> getting

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
rather than just running around getting

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.020 
rather than just running around getting
you<00:02:23.480> know<00:02:23.599> quickscope<00:02:24.409> quad<00:02:24.769> feeds<00:02:25.040> which<00:02:25.639> you

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
you know quickscope quad feeds which you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.250 
you know quickscope quad feeds which you
could<00:02:26.180> still<00:02:26.359> get<00:02:26.510> some<00:02:26.659> really<00:02:26.810> cool<00:02:26.989> clips

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
could still get some really cool clips

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.009 
could still get some really cool clips
with<00:02:27.409> this<00:02:27.590> that's<00:02:28.489> sad<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:28.969> yeah<00:02:29.150> cool

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019

meant that that was a very little skill

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.869 
meant that that was a very little skill
gap<00:04:03.560> if<00:04:03.739> some<00:04:03.889> came<00:04:04.099> up<00:04:04.219> behind<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.639> that<00:04:04.759> was

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
no way you're getting out of that

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.020 
no way you're getting out of that
situation<00:04:06.290> which<00:04:07.219> is<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.489> reason<00:04:07.669> I<00:04:07.879> love

huge<00:04:10.849> that's<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.060> big<00:04:11.180> skill<00:04:11.449> gap<00:04:11.659> so<00:04:12.169> that's

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
huge that's a big skill gap so that's

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.199 
huge that's a big skill gap so that's

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
that's quite hard this video was

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.100 
that's quite hard this video was
supposed<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.910> be<00:05:02.090> first<00:05:02.600> impressions<00:05:03.050> from

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
supposed to be first impressions from

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.570 
supposed to be first impressions from
advanced<00:05:03.470> warfare<00:05:03.560> we'll<00:05:04.040> get<00:05:04.190> there<00:05:04.400> we're

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
advanced warfare we'll get there we're

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.470 
advanced warfare we'll get there we're
getting<00:05:04.790> there<00:05:04.880> we're<00:05:04.970> about<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.210> get<00:05:05.300> there

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.540 
getting there we're about to get there
so<00:05:05.990> yeah<00:05:06.230> I<00:05:06.260> think<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.890> good<00:05:07.130> game<00:05:07.310> it's

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
so yeah I think it's a good game it's

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.360 
so yeah I think it's a good game it's
you<00:05:07.670> know<00:05:07.760> what<00:05:08.000> Call<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.300> Duty<00:05:08.570> needed<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.170> do

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
you know what Call of Duty needed to do

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.650 
you know what Call of Duty needed to do
time<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.490> kill<00:05:10.670> could<00:05:10.820> be<00:05:10.880> potentially<00:05:11.630> a

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
time to kill could be potentially a

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.000 
time to kill could be potentially a
little<00:05:11.870> longer<00:05:12.320> I'm<00:05:12.380> just<00:05:12.560> thinking<00:05:12.800> with<00:05:12.920> all

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
little longer I'm just thinking with all

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.590 
little longer I'm just thinking with all
the<00:05:13.100> jumping<00:05:13.460> around<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:14.060> parkouring

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
the jumping around the parkouring

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.970 
the jumping around the parkouring
element<00:05:14.900> you'll<00:05:14.990> see<00:05:15.200> in<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.440> gameplay<00:05:15.590> quite

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
element you'll see in the gameplay quite

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.100 
element you'll see in the gameplay quite
