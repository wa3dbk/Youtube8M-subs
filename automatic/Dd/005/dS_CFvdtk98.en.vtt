00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.869 

okay<00:00:01.020> you<00:00:01.079> remember<00:00:01.439> from<00:00:01.979> before<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:02.550> did<00:00:02.760> the

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay you remember from before we did the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.810 
okay you remember from before we did the
turnaround<00:00:03.360> progression<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.609> 19<00:00:05.609> or<00:00:05.790> 69<00:00:06.750> or<00:00:07.820> 25

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
turnaround progression of 19 or 69 or 25

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.470 
turnaround progression of 19 or 69 or 25
and<00:00:09.240> then<00:00:10.019> back<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.559> well<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:12.120> can<00:00:12.300> apply

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and then back to one well we can apply

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.299 
and then back to one well we can apply
the<00:00:12.570> seventh<00:00:13.049> chords<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.679> same<00:00:13.920> theory

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
the seventh chords to that same theory

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.340 
the seventh chords to that same theory
and<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.360> outline<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.839> chords<00:00:16.109> even

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
and we can outline the chords even

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.560 
and we can outline the chords even
further<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> difference<00:00:17.550> also<00:00:18.060> listen

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
further here the difference also listen

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
further here the difference also listen
for<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> difference<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.289> chords<00:00:19.830> play<00:00:20.400> it

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
for the difference in the chords play it

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
for the difference in the chords play it
on<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> guitar<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.480> example<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.230> play<00:00:22.500> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
on a guitar in this example or play it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.890 
on a guitar in this example or play it
on<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> piano<00:00:22.980> or<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.910> 7th<00:00:24.240> scale<00:00:24.359> degree<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
on a piano or the 7th scale degree is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.019 
on a piano or the 7th scale degree is
added<00:00:25.289> gives<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.220> jazzy<00:00:26.670> sometimes

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
added gives it more of a jazzy sometimes

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.019 
added gives it more of a jazzy sometimes
more<00:00:27.560> fulfilled<00:00:28.560> out<00:00:28.800> feeling<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> chords

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
more fulfilled out feeling to the chords

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.319 
more fulfilled out feeling to the chords
themselves<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.470> let's<00:00:31.650> try<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> key<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.210> C

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
themselves so let's try in the key of C

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.110 
themselves so let's try in the key of C
major<00:00:33.510> where<00:00:34.140> c<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:35.780> okay<00:00:38.000> start<00:00:39.000> with

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
major where c is our one okay start with

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:55.680 
major where c is our one okay start with
C<00:00:41.420> 2<00:00:42.440> 3<00:00:43.489> 4<00:00:47.030> 1230<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.660> minor<00:00:49.760> 7<00:00:52.100> de

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.740 

now<00:00:56.289> G<00:00:56.859> dominant<00:00:58.469> f

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.420 

try<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:02.740> again

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:18.160 

d

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.890 

okay<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.979> might<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> try<00:01:20.689> working<00:01:21.689> on

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
okay you might want to try working on

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.450 
okay you might want to try working on
the<00:01:22.020> Triads<00:01:22.409> first<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.250> proves

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the Triads first if that proves

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.910 
the Triads first if that proves
difficult

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:46.760 

then<00:01:31.920> moving<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:44.960> okay<00:01:45.960> try

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
then moving your way up okay try

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.830 
then moving your way up okay try
applying<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.310> same<00:01:47.520> principle<00:01:48.150> maybe<00:01:48.600> with

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
applying that same principle maybe with

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
applying that same principle maybe with
with<00:01:49.080> cords<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.620> without<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.400> key<00:01:50.550> of<00:01:50.580> F

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
with cords or without in the key of F

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.120 
with cords or without in the key of F
nature<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.420> example<00:01:51.680> F<00:01:52.760> nature<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:55.500> six

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
nature for example F nature the six

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.040 
nature for example F nature the six
chord<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.640> d<00:01:57.150> minor<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:01.620> two<00:02:02.250> chord<00:02:02.550> minor<00:02:03.050> is

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
chord is d minor the two chord minor is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.490 
chord is d minor the two chord minor is
G<00:02:05.240> then<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> dominant<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.869> C<00:02:09.229> try<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.290> remember

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
G then the dominant is C try to remember

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140 
G then the dominant is C try to remember
to<00:02:10.619> keep<00:02:10.800> alternating<00:02:11.250> these<00:02:11.520> fingers<00:02:11.880> over

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to keep alternating these fingers over

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.110 
to keep alternating these fingers over
here<00:02:12.390> now<00:02:12.870> you've<00:02:13.110> been<00:02:14.030> introduced<00:02:15.030> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
here now you've been introduced to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.310 
here now you've been introduced to
outlining<00:02:15.540> chords<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.350> major<00:02:16.980> keys
