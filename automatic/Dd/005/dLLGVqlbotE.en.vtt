I'll<00:01:01.109> use<00:01:01.350> your<00:01:01.469> car<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.100> basically

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
I'll use your car and you can basically

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
I'll use your car and you can basically
see<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.840> thing<00:01:04.019> recording<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.830> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
see what is this thing recording on this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.929 
see what is this thing recording on this
screen<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:07.189> basically<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
screen here basically that's it

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.890 
screen here basically that's it
I<00:01:10.880> think<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> four<00:01:12.180> bodies<00:01:12.420> camera<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
I think you four bodies camera is that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.880 
I think you four bodies camera is that
it<00:01:13.229> doesn't<00:01:13.470> uses<00:01:13.740> digital<00:01:15.080> storage<00:01:16.080> yeah<00:01:16.560> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it doesn't uses digital storage yeah so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.030 
it doesn't uses digital storage yeah so
it<00:01:17.100> uses<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.759> thing<00:01:18.030> called<00:01:18.270> eg<00:01:18.869> tapes<00:01:19.140> which

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
it uses this thing called eg tapes which

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
it uses this thing called eg tapes which
you<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.520> such<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:22.759> so<00:01:23.759> basically<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.420> tip

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you in such here so basically the tip

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.830 
you in such here so basically the tip
for<00:01:24.780> myself<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.100> touch<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
for myself I got to touch it and this is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.010 
for myself I got to touch it and this is
a<00:01:27.869> dips<00:01:28.579> as<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.790> editing<00:01:30.030> time<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> transfer

also a ski basically means the
sensitivity<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> light<00:01:45.530> sensitivity

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sensitivity of the light sensitivity

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.560 
sensitivity of the light sensitivity
code<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> higher<00:01:47.700> gear<00:01:48.119> means<00:01:48.450> is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.810 
code like so the higher gear means is
more<00:01:48.750> sensitive<00:01:49.049> would<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:50.100> thing<00:01:50.430> bad

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
more sensitive would like one thing bad

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960 
more sensitive would like one thing bad
about<00:01:50.970> gain<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:53.040> Morgan<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.640> put<00:01:53.850> me

about gain is the Morgan you put me
small<00:01:54.299> also<00:01:54.509> more<00:01:54.720> sensitive<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.229> noise<00:01:55.439> yeah

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
small also more sensitive to noise yeah

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.590 
small also more sensitive to noise yeah
we<00:01:56.189> only<00:01:56.310> use<00:01:56.549> hiding<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.210> low-light

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
we only use hiding in low-light

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.490 
we only use hiding in low-light
conditions<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:58.200> during<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.799> night

have a big Irish that hopelessly so
focal<00:02:17.230> line<00:02:17.410> will<00:02:17.740> be<00:02:17.860> much<00:02:18.130> more<00:02:18.490> short

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
focal line will be much more short

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.700 
focal line will be much more short
though<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.210> means<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.630> can<00:02:20.110> only<00:02:20.200> focus<00:02:20.410> on

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
though that means I can only focus on

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.000 
though that means I can only focus on
like<00:02:20.950> my<00:02:21.070> hand<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.580> front<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:23.010> things

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
like my hand in front of you and things

shutter<00:02:30.970> speed<00:02:31.270> if<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.570> have<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:32.230> slow

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
shutter speed if you have a really slow

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.770 
shutter speed if you have a really slow
shutter<00:02:32.770> speed<00:02:33.160> you'll<00:02:33.670> see<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:34.270> learning

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
shutter speed you'll see in learning

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.199 
shutter speed you'll see in learning
that<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.410> swing<00:02:35.650> my<00:02:35.680> hand<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.970> lot

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
that if I swing my hand you have a lot

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.430 
that if I swing my hand you have a lot
of<00:02:37.240> motion<00:02:38.110> behind<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.920> higher<00:02:39.730> shutter<00:02:40.000> speed

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
of motion behind so higher shutter speed

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.780 
of motion behind so higher shutter speed
basically<00:02:41.440> means<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.430> catch<00:02:42.580> some

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
basically means you can catch some

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.460 
basically means you can catch some
motion<00:02:43.480> Mossman<00:02:45.840> another<00:02:46.840> important<00:02:47.320> thing

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
motion Mossman another important thing

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.100 
motion Mossman another important thing
when<00:02:47.650> using<00:02:47.860> cameras<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
when using cameras like this is the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.660 
when using cameras like this is the
audio<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.740> camera<00:02:51.100> has<00:02:51.190> two<00:02:51.400> types<00:02:51.580> of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
audio of this camera has two types of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.730 
audio of this camera has two types of
audio<00:02:51.940> sources<00:02:52.240> one<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:53.200> internal<00:02:53.620> mic

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
audio sources one is the internal mic

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.830 
audio sources one is the internal mic
which<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.280> here<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.910> other<00:02:55.030> two<00:02:55.240> is<00:02:55.390> external

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
which is here the other two is external

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.770 
which is here the other two is external
mic<00:02:55.990> okay<00:02:56.410> sometimes<00:02:57.340> if<00:02:58.000> we<00:02:58.390> want<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.750> more

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
mic okay sometimes if we want a more

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.020 
mic okay sometimes if we want a more
directional<00:02:59.530> we<00:02:59.860> are<00:02:59.980> speaking<00:03:00.190> boom<00:03:00.580> might

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
directional we are speaking boom might

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.449 
directional we are speaking boom might
use<00:03:01.270> Mac<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.170> never<00:03:02.380> attach<00:03:02.740> it<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.430> a

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
use Mac like that never attach it to a

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.330 
use Mac like that never attach it to a
cable<00:03:03.760> taking<00:03:04.720> point<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> more

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
cable taking point so this is a more

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.050 
cable taking point so this is a more
advanced<00:03:07.030> camera

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
advanced camera

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.490 
advanced camera
