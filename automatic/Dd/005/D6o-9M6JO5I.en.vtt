plastic<00:00:17.150> texture<00:00:17.539> pack<00:00:17.740> so<00:00:18.910> we're<00:00:19.910> going<00:00:20.029> to

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
plastic texture pack so we're going to

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.849 
plastic texture pack so we're going to
go<00:00:20.269> join<00:00:20.599> us<00:00:20.749> in<00:00:20.900> creative<00:00:21.439> and<00:00:21.740> we're

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
go join us in creative and we're

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.329 
go join us in creative and we're
checking<00:00:22.009> out<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.160> little<00:00:22.369> quick<00:00:22.699> look<00:00:22.910> around

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
checking out a little quick look around

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.550 
checking out a little quick look around
you<00:00:25.339> can<00:00:25.460> use<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:25.880> both<00:00:26.179> the<00:00:26.659> texture<00:00:27.349> packs

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
you can use the both the texture packs

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.470 
you can use the both the texture packs
you<00:00:27.769> can<00:00:27.800> use<00:00:28.220> as<00:00:28.429> a<00:00:28.490> trial

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
you can use as a trial

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.929 
you can use as a trial
you<00:00:29.869> just<00:00:30.079> can't<00:00:30.320> actually<00:00:30.499> save<00:00:30.919> in<00:00:31.189> them<00:00:31.339> so

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939
