it is directly opposite the Sun it would

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.960 
it is directly opposite the Sun it would
be<00:02:26.599> visible<00:02:26.750> all<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.470> hours<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.950> Sun<00:02:28.129> is<00:02:28.340> not

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
be visible all the hours the Sun is not

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.580 
be visible all the hours the Sun is not
which<00:02:29.569> means<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.900> will<00:02:29.959> rise<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.409> the<00:02:30.470> east

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
which means it will rise in the east

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.830 
which means it will rise in the east
after<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.280> Sun<00:02:31.489> sets<00:02:31.519> in<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.940> west<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.360> we'll

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
after the Sun sets in the west and we'll

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.170 
after the Sun sets in the west and we'll
slowly<00:02:33.200> travel<00:02:33.950> up<00:02:34.069> the<00:02:34.159> heavens<00:02:34.340> ever<00:02:34.909> each

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
slowly travel up the heavens ever each

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.300 
slowly travel up the heavens ever each
its<00:02:35.390> highest<00:02:35.750> point<00:02:35.930> at<00:02:36.110> midnight<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.129> then

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
its highest point at midnight and then

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.920 
its highest point at midnight and then
we'll<00:02:37.459> slowly<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.060> send<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.450> heavens<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
we'll slowly just send the heavens and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.589 
we'll slowly just send the heavens and
set<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.500> West<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.640> Sun<00:02:40.879> rises<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.569> the

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
set in the West as the Sun rises in the

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.360 
set in the West as the Sun rises in the
east<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.370> can<00:02:43.609> see<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:43.940> all<00:02:44.120> night<00:02:44.840> long

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
east so you can see it all night long

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.039 
east so you can see it all night long
now<00:02:46.370> although<00:02:47.090> Mars<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:47.989> very

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
now although Mars is that it's very

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.619 
now although Mars is that it's very

brightest this week it will still be
very<00:02:51.290> bright<00:02:51.620> throughout<00:02:51.950> februari<00:02:52.549> but

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
very bright throughout februari but

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.449 
very bright throughout februari but
because<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.840> only<00:02:54.109> half<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.530> size<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.340> our
