00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
at the time it was kind of easy because

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530

it is a little easier to kind of pick

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
it is a little easier to kind of pick
you<00:01:35.909> know<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.270> choose<00:01:36.479> who's<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> do
