00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.500
 when it comes to home decor 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.010
 beach the first thing that usually 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 come in mind is the color white or blue 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.369
 but in this season many other shades 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:25.710
 can even be used the gold already 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:29.070
 just hi I'm the bruna today I'm here 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.619
 in the international home company store 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.860
 to give some decorating tips for 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.380
 environments and residences on the coast as 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
 these environments are and residences 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.809
 serve as a haven for 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.360
 families and I believe that people 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.360
 should bet on a decoration that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 ensure warmth is a sensation of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.949
 freshness and mainly objects that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.039
 be practical is our decoration where the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.800
 people prioritizes the white is interesting to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.320
 people make up is with other colors colors 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.930
 such as blue 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.930
 and emerald green that are trends 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.050
 in the beach environment decoration very 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.540
 common people see objects with reference 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.940
 of the nautical theme but that we escape a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.000
 few common objects such as 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.430
 Dolphin fish is interesting to 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.540
 We create compositions using 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.380
 most rustic materials crafts and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.180
 which are also practical objects and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.350
 functions for coastal environments 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.229
 as for example the wood is the candles the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.400
 ceramics objects that people who 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.050
 composed with cords bamboo vines then 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.979
 all elements 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.110
 they are rich in detail and yet not 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.110
 has a beach climate in its decoration 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.360
 Who already said kan? 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.000
 pizza another trend is that people 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.130
 has bet is a trend that has come 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.830
 of fashion that is the high low where people 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.160
 composes simpler objects with objects 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.739
 more names such as betting on 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.160
 who knows in a more rustic wood with 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.860
 a cake with a mirror in crystals 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.400
 or a crystal vase with a foliage 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.140
 and natural green or on the same object 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.380
 simple but finished material 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.780
 more sophisticated then this composition is 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.030
 What will leave this visited? 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.650
 priced to your decor 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.950
 the difference of a decoration in a 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.319
 residence with a residence on the coast 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.470
 is that people can dare more with 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.750
 colors shapes and formats 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.720
 because as this residence on the coast 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.049
 it works as a refuge for people not 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.540
 they'll be sick of having so much information right? 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.209
 so here's how you can see us 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.799
 made a very harmonic composition 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.440
 using blue which is a strong color 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.540
 cheerful but that's easy to remember one 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.630
 good example we have are these objects 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.200
 which has a core and a print and refers 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.200
 Portuguese tiles 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.010
 talking a little more about the colors in the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.790
 other color decoration that is highlighted 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.280
 is the orange that are signed ceramics 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.680
 for a design is recognized and here the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.270
 people can see that she composed this color 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.180
 strong with a more neutral cord composed 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.670
 also with the candle which is an element that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.670
 compose and value any environment 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.380
 another interesting tip for people 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.300
 who like more classic decorations 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.380
 are these more finished objects 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.070
 golden 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.080
 here are some examples of parts in 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.780
 golden but with a more modern shape 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.959
 this kind of contract that is ideal for 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.650
 you mark with a piece of pretty 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.280
 refinement and do not leave much of the decor 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.280

 Who warned you want Campana recipe 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.770

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.900
 which refer to the seabed 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.720
 these objects used in a manner 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.430

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.430

 It's a very interesting thing. 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.490
 ensure the sensation of freshness 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.490
 besides we can easily create 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.380
 various compositions compositions with much 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.870
 personality such as 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.870

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.610
