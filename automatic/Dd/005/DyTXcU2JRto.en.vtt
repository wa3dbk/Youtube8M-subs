00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
couple different things first there's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880

two<00:02:00.630> ways<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> lock<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.710> actually

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
two ways to lock it you can actually

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.810 
two ways to lock it you can actually
lock<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.369> visor<00:02:02.549> down<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> tab<00:02:03.990> here

lock the visor down with this tab here
slides<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.090> down<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> ratcheting

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
slides up and down on the ratcheting

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.460 
slides up and down on the ratcheting
system<00:02:08.119> locks<00:02:09.119> into<00:02:09.330> place<00:02:09.509> won't<00:02:10.050> come<00:02:10.319> up

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
system locks into place won't come up

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.550 
system locks into place won't come up
you<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:11.520> lock<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.510> hinge<00:02:12.750> pin<00:02:13.050> so

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
oh I will come off and not that it would

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.589 
oh I will come off and not that it would
for<00:02:16.050> any<00:02:16.080> reason<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:17.060> when<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.330> pull

this thing off it's a lot easier or a
lot<00:02:20.700> different<00:02:21.150> i<00:02:21.209> guess<00:02:21.239> than<00:02:21.599> some<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
lot different i guess than some of the

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.880 
lot different i guess than some of the
other<00:02:22.140> systems<00:02:22.680> simply<00:02:23.610> click<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:24.030> off<00:02:24.890> it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
like is that this is a self centering

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.390 
like is that this is a self centering
design<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.510> when<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.230> visor<00:02:31.500> comes<00:02:31.830> off<00:02:32.130> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
design so when this visor comes off and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.100 
design so when this visor comes off and
you<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.880> put<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.180> back<00:02:33.390> on<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.780> don't<00:02:33.959> have

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you go to put it back on you don't have

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.870 
you go to put it back on you don't have
to<00:02:34.290> fiddle<00:02:34.530> with<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.099> try<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> get<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> line

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
to fiddle with it and try to get to line

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.580 
to fiddle with it and try to get to line
up<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.269> mean<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.720> thing<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.110> goes<00:02:37.349> straight

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
up I mean the thing just goes straight

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.390 
up I mean the thing just goes straight
into<00:02:37.980> place<00:02:39.349> put<00:02:40.349> this<00:02:40.530> back<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:43.250> lock<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
into place put this back on and lock it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120 
into place put this back on and lock it
in<00:02:44.519> that's<00:02:45.510> pretty<00:02:45.720> simple<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.410> one<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
in that's pretty simple it's one of the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.500 
in that's pretty simple it's one of the
features<00:02:47.370> i<00:02:47.519> kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:47.940> because<00:02:48.209> I've<00:02:48.360> got

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
features i kind of like because I've got

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.850 
features i kind of like because I've got
to<00:02:48.600> hang<00:02:48.750> up<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:49.049> with<00:02:49.350> some<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.739> way

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
to hang up with with some of the way

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.580 
to hang up with with some of the way
that<00:02:50.100> visors<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:51.120> face<00:02:51.390> shields<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.930> attach<00:02:52.230> I

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
that visors or face shields can attach I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.350 
that visors or face shields can attach I
think<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.250> kind<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.670> slick<00:02:53.940> way<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.150> do

think this is kind of a slick way to do

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.660 
think this is kind of a slick way to do
