00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.830
 greet you friends on the channel i 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.780
 carpenter is not clean and or primachenko 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.529
 today at the request of subscribers I want you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.960
 tell about the brake that we 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.570
 installed on your milling machine and 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 Some asked this question to him 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.460
 I will try to answer immediately warn that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.140
 I'm not a departure technician 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.610
 electrical equipment is not very common 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.410
 I have a concept but the author here it is 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.300
 the whole economy was a man who 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.700
 it works for us a cycle which is good 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.460
 understands electrical equipment he 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.760
 just shy of getting into frame and and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.969
 so I will try to explain how they say 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.840
 the essence of this brake means the essence of it 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:04.880
 brakes is next in the way 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.770
 from the off button to the engine 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.290
 diode bridge is installed but we 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.810
 this bridge diode bridge it consists 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 a total of two diodes here in diagram 4 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 diode and when you press and hold the button 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.210
 shutdown happens conversion 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.110
 ac ac voltage 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.369
 in direct current and this direct current 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.939
 getting on the motor winding brakes the anchor 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.220
 forcing the engine to stop at this 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.159
 the circuit shown slowed down the retarder 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.040
 shown they are set as vacuum 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.780
 there and 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.490
 they are configured for some 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.980
 a certain number of seconds that is 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.940
 just pressed the shutdown button and not 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.160
 you need to hold this retarder but here 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.740
 Look at this scheme carefully 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.660
 I think that any electra will figure out 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.020
 this scheme if you will need 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.540
 do such a brake then you do well in 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.140
 nature looks like this 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.460
 set this diode bridge over here 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.830
 and you need to install it 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.190
 so that he does not touch 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.709
 the case that is , were these diodes 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.690
 isolated this is the first moment of the second 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.270
 The moment why such big diodes but not 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.180
 we were on things you can diodes much 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.000
 they will put less exactly the same 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.570
 effect does like this like this 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.890
 diodes 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:37.610
 so what is the brake for, but I guess 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.980
 first of all for quick changeovers 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.480
 machine if you want to change something 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 do the operation for the operation it 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.080
 helps to quickly stop 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.360
 no need like we did it once 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.019
 put there rail on the pulley to 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.120
 slow down and so on and the second 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.500
 this is a safety measure i.e. turn off 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.320
 machine and leaving him you do not leave 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.860
 working and rotating worker 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.310
 the tool in this case is the cutters 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.519
 I plan to put similar brakes and on 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.760
 plans and on a circular but all you need 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.060
 time i will just demonstrate now 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.670
 how does this brake work 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.670
 already installed on the mills 14 Komi 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:40.459
 once again that is 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.300
 braking happens literally in 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.190
 some seconds 1 2 strength 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.110
 thank you for your attention subscribe to 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.019
 my channel if this video was you 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.019
 Useful Like before New Meetings
