00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.759
 I repeat to you, even if I go to work or 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:10.090
 the players ask me and I'll give it to them 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.130
 and then I see here I put no 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.840
 for example now with morelia I think that 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.140
 I arrive the day before the game with 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.910
 morelia nothing happens if they arrive well 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.910
 I put if if they arrive tired by the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.439
 others and I'm not going to complain because 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.160
 any player they call me 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.330
 illusion about the greyhound at 20 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.550
 any player who call the lion a 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 what generates me is pride pride 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.629
 because they are players and boys who 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.129
 I have seen where they come from where 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.870
 we all come together and this marks a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.019
 situation for the rest of the youth 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 guanajuatense and mexico that does not matter 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.710
 where do you come from or maybe a person 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.629
 humble it matters if you are willing to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 pay the price of success that is to leave 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.440
 absolutely all the workouts 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.050
 on the court to take care of you to have a life 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 professional and that's what they are 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.670
 proving not cases like the one of mounts 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.940
 the bully visit the rooster returns aris 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.920
 hernandez 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.720
 what we have achieved thus is in you 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.720
 let's be blank 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 for 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.150
 and as I tell you, those who were 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.150
 our 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 it would never be 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.080
 yes yes it's something that I like a lot 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.420
 I have some people in charge looking 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.490
 players and not in the first division is 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.730
 to be lower because I think that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 Mexico has a very good potential and 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.180
 simply that sometimes some 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 players do not have the opportunity or not 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.700
 have been well-routed then this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.289
 I never rule out bringing players that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.060
 Sometimes people do not know how was the 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.200
 case of several of burbano de lobo a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.200
 when we ascended 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.480
 yes but it's a theme like Denis 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.040
 Now that it is here that came from the USA 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.750
 has played professional ever but when 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.640
 I saw it in practice I broke my eyes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.640
 any time you will have your chance 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.130
 also because I like how he plays 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.280
 they understand what I want from the team 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.540
 then I do not rule out quality 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.540
 when I see a good player
