00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.510 

no<00:00:18.330> we're<00:00:18.630> gonna<00:00:18.750> switch<00:00:18.900> over<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.140> these<00:00:19.520> yeah

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
no we're gonna switch over to these yeah

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.279 
no we're gonna switch over to these yeah
a<00:00:20.550> little<00:00:21.000> mini<00:00:21.150> uzi<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.810> things<00:00:22.020> become

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
a little mini uzi these things become

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.609 
a little mini uzi these things become
invaluable<00:00:23.300> accuracy<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.570> range<00:00:24.930> pretty

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
invaluable accuracy and range pretty

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.230 
invaluable accuracy and range pretty
much<00:00:25.740> comparable<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> pistols<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
much comparable to the pistols but a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.009 
much comparable to the pistols but a
rate<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> fire<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.990> tell<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.820> and

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
rate of fire to tell about it and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.500 
rate of fire to tell about it and
executions<00:00:31.019> are<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> same<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> basically

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
executions are the same so basically

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 
executions are the same so basically
once<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.110> start<00:00:34.290> collecting<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.739> lot<00:00:34.770> more<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
once you start collecting a lot more of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.950 
once you start collecting a lot more of
these<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.790> recommend<00:00:36.329> using<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.690> over<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
these I recommend using them over the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.799 
these I recommend using them over the
pistols<00:00:37.610> you'll<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> lot<00:00:38.969> happier<00:00:39.030> once<00:00:39.690> you

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
pistols you'll be a lot happier once you

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.200 
pistols you'll be a lot happier once you
do<00:00:40.129> other<00:00:41.129> than<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> shotgun<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.180> pretty

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
do other than that the shotgun is pretty

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
do other than that the shotgun is pretty
much<00:00:42.540> worthless<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.379> pistols<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.010> your

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
much worthless the pistols will be your

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.729 
much worthless the pistols will be your
best<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.969> until<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:45.739> unless
