00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.070

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.920
 but rods how are you my name is 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.869
 pablo martínez pablo martínez yes yes the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 that is butt hung doing the 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.640
 videos with you are not realizing that 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.109
 I'm leaving the pot well I hope that 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.369
 I'm with windows 10 I see that 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.800
 some if I'm already falling 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.390
 first questions, well, very, very, very 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.900
 happy that you are encouraged to ask and 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.630
 the question that I have had then repeated 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.940
 on several occasions is how to change here 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.180
 in the little clock, well, give me that 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.220
 put the 22 hours to see forgiveness that I 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.320
 messages are coming everywhere 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.240
 good that instead of putting the 22 hours 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.670
 so that puts the 10 hours not as it puts 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.860
 here then and in the way that I 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.530
 I have come to the best there is one more way 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.750
 short but good I'll explain 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.190
 for which I have come to flight the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.890
 configuration is simple you just have to 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.110
 change a letter 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.930
 how to get to the configuration and that already 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.760
 has that already has ctera so good 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.409
 let's go to the roll we pike here in the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.830
 clock and we give to the configuration 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.190
 of date and time because we're going all 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.990
 well come now I am going to go marking 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.270
 the clicks where you have to do what 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.460
 found the tool is 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.530
 it will give you options click here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.080
 additional timestamp and 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.300
 regional configuration 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.510
 we give you here a click and this opens 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.090
 great once we're here where he's going 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.600
 the following click goes here up here in 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.190
 date and time ok we give you here and you already 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.510
 opens up well in the configuration 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.880
 will still be this now we could 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.070
 close and so we see behind computing 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.530
 for newbies that cool a lot for once 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.870

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.850
 this is click more click click on there 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.010
 fastest way to get there and see if 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.230
 I find some equal or some second 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.050
 video tutorial good change date and 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.260
 time we click here and back to 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.400

 in now 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.599
 and if we look if we look we're going 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.269
 with arrow here it says that with lowercase h 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.980
 are 12 hours and with capital H are 24 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.660
 hours ok 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.420
 as I have now put the h 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.030
 tiny because it puts me 10 but if I 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.910
 now I change the lowercase h for a 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.130
 capital letter at the beginning ok 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.470
 just that change and I give you to apply 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.489
 let's look at the clock please friends and 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.489
 attentive friends 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.829
 it has changed that we want to go back to 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.200
 change so we change it here we have a 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.489
 drop down with some configurations 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.840
 we see that the tiny h 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.209
 capital letter h capital letter h 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.700
 ok the lowercase h 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.680
 tiny uppercase I'm failing in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.739
 upper case lower case 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.170
 for egypt as you good we see that here 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.640
 lowercase h and uppercase h if new 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.040
 appears in the drop-down as I what 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.920
 I made it easy you go back and what 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.269
 you change according to lowercase che 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 12 hour format 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.159
 h uppercase format of 24 hours ok here 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.879
 we would accept 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:32.069
 we would accept and accept ok if we see 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.090
 that are many quiet clicks because 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.560
 now I'm going to do a little more 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.659
 quick, it's like you're already seeing 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.790
 where are we going to see how it does not take 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.260
 so much ok you can count the seconds 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.920
 since we explain here we prick here 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.900
 we go down to button 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.239
 If there are many clicks I do not say no 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.390
 but we see that it comes with relative 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.390
 ease 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.160
 half second 34 seconds two seconds 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.020
 three seconds I'll look to see if 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.709
 we can execute this to customize the 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.540
 format from another from another part there 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.580
 said I'll see if I'm not at 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.290
 investigate it at another time and if 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.790
 I find and you want it, I'll tell you 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.130
 as this command is executed I will make a 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.650
 second video so we can do 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.720
 This much faster change agreement 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.370
 so no milkshakes new aunts I hope that 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.460
 are looking for these these glasses 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.450
 Spanish theme tutorials on windows 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.220
 10 which is the one that goes after 8.1 by 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.410
 I've found out why I do not know 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.130
 called because they did not go to 9 this 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.150
 first they did the 8.0 808 I did not 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.120
 at 8.18 plus 19 so then I played 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.090
 windows 10 is my theory since you tell me and the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.670
 you share a saved friends not 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.980
 shakes not rods 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.470
 to see what to say around here if you have not 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.660
 subscribed if you have not subscribed already 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.100
 I should have subscribed but hey 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.820
 here is a red button that you can give 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.950
 it does not wear out here and you can 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.320
 subscribe and be part of this small 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.640
 community that is going to grow and with a 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.920
 good vibes in the videos that I think 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.540
 I am demonstrating and well then with 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.940
 a lot of material that I 'm taking out 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.870
 windows 10 and many other things 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.870
 See you goodbye
