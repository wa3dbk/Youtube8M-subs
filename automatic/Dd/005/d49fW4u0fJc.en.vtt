00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
little bit about why people say muscle

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.910 
little bit about why people say muscle
is<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.670> dense<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.360> fat<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.470> weighs

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
is more dense than fat and it weighs

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.480 
is more dense than fat and it weighs
more<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.369> lot<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.700> people<00:01:38.970> say<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> weighs<00:01:39.360> more

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
more a lot of people say it weighs more

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
more a lot of people say it weighs more
muscle<00:01:41.520> does<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.119> weigh<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.720> 5<00:01:43.380> pounds<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
muscle does not weigh more 5 pounds of

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.760 
muscle does not weigh more 5 pounds of
fat<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.880> 5<00:01:45.149> pounds<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.630> muscle<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fat and 5 pounds of muscle is going to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
fat and 5 pounds of muscle is going to
weigh<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.280> same<00:01:47.490> amount<00:01:47.570> what<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.049> that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
weigh the same amount what it is is that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.830 
weigh the same amount what it is is that
muscle<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.799> more<00:01:50.070> dense<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.880> when<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:51.600> say

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
muscle is more dense and when they say

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.740 
muscle is more dense and when they say
dense<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.380> means<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.220> tightly

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
dense it means that it's more tightly

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.620 
dense it means that it's more tightly
compacted<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.649> body<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:57.270> very

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
compacted to the body so it's very

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.749 
compacted to the body so it's very
possible<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:59.250> working<00:01:59.460> out

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
possible for you to be working out

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.300 
possible for you to be working out
working<00:01:59.909> out<00:02:00.240> building<00:02:01.020> muscle<00:02:01.439> making<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
working out building muscle making that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.880 
working out building muscle making that
muscle<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.880> dense<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.570> tighter<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.500> firm

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
muscle more dense and tighter and firm

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.070 
muscle more dense and tighter and firm
write<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
write it so it just it

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.820 
write it so it just it
tracks<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.650> itself<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.450> you'll<00:02:09.990> see<00:02:10.410> your

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
tracks into itself and you'll see your

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
tracks into itself and you'll see your
body<00:02:11.070> composition<00:02:11.580> change<00:02:13.760> dramatically<00:02:14.760> but

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
body composition change dramatically but

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.480 
body composition change dramatically but
your<00:02:15.630> weight<00:02:15.900> may<00:02:16.230> stay<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.710> same<00:02:16.950> which<00:02:17.340> is

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
your weight may stay the same which is

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.430 
your weight may stay the same which is
what's<00:02:17.700> been<00:02:17.880> happening<00:02:18.300> with<00:02:18.330> me<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.900> have

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
what's been happening with me I have

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.970 
what's been happening with me I have
been<00:02:19.620> building<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.960> significant<00:02:21.960> amount<00:02:22.770> of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
been building a significant amount of

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.160 
been building a significant amount of
muscle<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.320> you'll<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:28.050> know

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
muscle now so like you'll see you know

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
muscle now so like you'll see you know
there<00:02:28.710> are<00:02:28.830> things<00:02:29.070> happening<00:02:29.310> within<00:02:29.790> my

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
there are things happening within my

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.030 
there are things happening within my
body<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.720> make<00:02:30.960> my<00:02:31.170> body<00:02:31.380> look<00:02:31.530> slimmer<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
body that make my body look slimmer and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.340 
body that make my body look slimmer and
obviously<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.520> little<00:02:32.880> lumpy<00:02:33.180> whatever<00:02:33.990> it's

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
obviously a little lumpy whatever it's

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.910 
obviously a little lumpy whatever it's
gonna<00:02:34.560> change<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.690> you'll<00:02:37.080> see<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.710> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
gonna change but as you'll see with the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.590 
gonna change but as you'll see with the
picture<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.580> I'm<00:02:38.730> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> post<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:39.390> this

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
picture that I'm going to post with this

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.960 
picture that I'm going to post with this
it's<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.500> big<00:02:40.680> difference<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.640> what<00:02:41.850> I've

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
it's a big difference in and what I've

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.790 
it's a big difference in and what I've
been<00:02:42.000> able<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.390> achieve<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.140> last<00:02:43.350> you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you're building muscle don't worry don't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.500 
you're building muscle don't worry don't
worry<00:02:53.040> about<00:02:54.290> how<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.350> look<00:02:56.100> right<00:02:56.820> now<00:02:56.880> it's

worry about how you look right now it's

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.890 
worry about how you look right now it's
gonna<00:02:58.140> change<00:02:58.880> okay<00:02:59.910> don't<00:03:00.209> worry<00:03:00.480> about<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
gonna change okay don't worry about the

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.260 
gonna change okay don't worry about the
scale<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.010> have<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.610> stay<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.030> course

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
scale you just have to stay the course

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.360 
scale you just have to stay the course
and<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.810> had<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.080> keep<00:03:04.260> telling<00:03:04.470> myself<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.130> my

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and I had to keep telling myself that my

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.360 
and I had to keep telling myself that my
body<00:03:05.640> was<00:03:05.910> changing<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:07.140> order<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.010> really

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
body was changing in order to really

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.300 
body was changing in order to really
accept<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.450> fact<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.260> was<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.190> know

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
accept the fact that I was you know

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.720 
accept the fact that I was you know
having<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.880> making<00:03:12.180> progress<00:03:12.450> okay<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.800> when

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
having and making progress okay so when

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.330 
having and making progress okay so when
we<00:03:14.850> say<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.269> muscles<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:15.840> dense<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.920> as<00:03:17.160> your

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
we say the muscles more dense so as your

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.720 
we say the muscles more dense so as your
muscle<00:03:17.820> starts<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.360> get<00:03:18.540> tighter<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:20.280> why

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
muscle starts to get tighter that's why

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.140 
muscle starts to get tighter that's why
you<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:21.269> inches<00:03:21.959> loss<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:23.130> still<00:03:23.850> have<00:03:24.120> a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you see inches loss I still have a

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.240 
you see inches loss I still have a
significant<00:03:25.050> amount<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.440> body<00:03:25.650> fat<00:03:25.800> in

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
significant amount of body fat in

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.100 
significant amount of body fat in
different<00:03:26.610> places<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.180> am<00:03:27.570> working<00:03:27.780> to

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
different places that I am working to

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.650 
different places that I am working to
get<00:03:28.260> rid<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.530> but<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.239> I'm<00:03:30.330> eating

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
get rid of but now that I'm eating

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.990 
get rid of but now that I'm eating
better<00:03:30.900> drinking<00:03:31.530> more<00:03:31.709> water<00:03:31.739> having<00:03:32.700> more

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
better drinking more water having more

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.810 
better drinking more water having more
activity<00:03:33.570> my<00:03:34.380> body<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.830> pulling<00:03:35.280> on<00:03:35.400> my<00:03:35.550> facts

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
activity my body is pulling on my facts

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.220 
activity my body is pulling on my facts
doors<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:37.130> for<00:03:38.130> energy<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:39.660> because<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.050> that

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
doors to for energy and because of that

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.620 
doors to for energy and because of that
I'm<00:03:40.830> building<00:03:41.130> muscle<00:03:41.670> which<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.209> making<00:03:42.450> me

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
I'm building muscle which is making me

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.830 
I'm building muscle which is making me
look<00:03:42.870> smaller<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.820> burning<00:03:45.300> fat<00:03:45.600> which

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
look smaller and I'm burning fat which

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.810 
look smaller and I'm burning fat which
is<00:03:45.989> making<00:03:46.200> me<00:03:46.440> smaller<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.220> fat<00:03:47.400> burn<00:03:47.670> is

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
is making me smaller so the fat burn is

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.880 
is making me smaller so the fat burn is
always<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.120> little<00:03:48.330> bit<00:03:48.540> slower<00:03:48.870> but<00:03:49.230> adding

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
always a little bit slower but adding

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.090 
always a little bit slower but adding
more<00:03:50.010> muscle<00:03:50.430> definitely<00:03:50.850> helps<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.860> when

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
more muscle definitely helps and so when

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.860 
more muscle definitely helps and so when
you<00:03:53.250> see<00:03:53.489> your<00:03:53.640> body<00:03:53.820> changing<00:03:54.450> when<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.720> see

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
you see your body changing when you see

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.160 
you see your body changing when you see
those<00:03:55.050> inches<00:03:55.709> being<00:03:55.980> lost<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:57.209> because<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
those inches being lost it's because the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.470 
those inches being lost it's because the
muscle<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.830> getting<00:03:59.130> tighter<00:03:59.519> which<00:04:00.300> is

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
muscle is getting tighter which is

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.449 
muscle is getting tighter which is
reducing<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.080> surface<00:04:01.470> area<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.950> your<00:04:02.280> body

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
reducing the surface area of your body

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.530 
reducing the surface area of your body
in<00:04:02.959> directions<00:04:04.070> okay<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.910> just<00:04:06.000> wanted<00:04:06.450> to

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
in directions okay so I just wanted to

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.090 
in directions okay so I just wanted to
tell<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.230> muscle<00:04:07.470> doesn't<00:04:07.920> weigh

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
tell you that so muscle doesn't weigh

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.840 
tell you that so muscle doesn't weigh
more<00:04:08.340> than<00:04:08.400> fat

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
more than fat

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.110 
more than fat
it's<00:04:09.269> just<00:04:09.660> tighter<00:04:10.049> packed<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.700> inches

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it's just tighter packed so the inches

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.460 
it's just tighter packed so the inches
that<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.450> see<00:04:12.780> our<00:04:13.170> results<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.920> building

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
that you see our results of building

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.770 
that you see our results of building
muscle<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.490> muscle<00:04:15.520> you<00:04:16.150> know<00:04:16.269> getting

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
muscle and the muscle you know getting

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.509 
muscle and the muscle you know getting
you<00:04:17.019> know<00:04:17.140> tighter<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.620> smaller<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.340> then

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
you know tighter and smaller and then

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.069
