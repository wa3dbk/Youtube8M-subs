do<00:00:08.429> they<00:00:08.580> eat<00:00:08.760> algae<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.210> your<00:00:09.330> tank<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.840> they

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
do they eat algae in your tank do they

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.169 
do they eat algae in your tank do they
not<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.500> course<00:00:10.710> biopsis<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.610> better<00:00:11.790> known<00:00:12.000> as

not of course biopsis is better known as

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.999 
not of course biopsis is better known as
hair<00:00:12.389> algae<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.900> almost<00:00:13.110> impossible<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.889> get

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
hair algae it's almost impossible to get

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.099 
hair algae it's almost impossible to get
rid<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.370> everybody<00:00:15.089> has<00:00:15.150> problems<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.839> it

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
rid of it everybody has problems with it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.029 
rid of it everybody has problems with it
the<00:00:16.440> question<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:17.010> actually<00:00:17.250> works

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.620 

we<00:00:25.039> talked<00:00:25.310> with<00:00:25.460> Kevin<00:00:25.849> Gaines<00:00:26.119> who<00:00:26.390> died

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
we talked with Kevin Gaines who died

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.269 
we talked with Kevin Gaines who died
several<00:00:26.990> times<00:00:27.109> a<00:00:27.439> week<00:00:27.470> off<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:27.919> coast<00:00:28.130> of

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
several times a week off the coast of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.159 
several times a week off the coast of
Florida<00:00:28.699> if<00:00:28.849> lettuce<00:00:29.179> neuter<00:00:29.419> bronze<00:00:29.630> will

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
Florida if lettuce neuter bronze will

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.170 
Florida if lettuce neuter bronze will
really<00:00:30.710> eat<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.099> algae<00:00:31.250> in<00:00:31.579> your<00:00:31.730> tank

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
really eat the algae in your tank

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.689 
really eat the algae in your tank
here's<00:00:32.480> what<00:00:32.629> Kevin<00:00:32.899> had<00:00:33.019> to<00:00:33.140> say<00:00:33.610> what<00:00:34.610> if

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
here's what Kevin had to say what if

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.650 
here's what Kevin had to say what if
what<00:00:34.850> should<00:00:35.030> people<00:00:35.120> know<00:00:35.300> about<00:00:35.510> that

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
what should people know about that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.150 
what should people know about that
before<00:00:36.079> they<00:00:36.170> can<00:00:36.320> consider<00:00:36.710> putting<00:00:36.890> it<00:00:37.070> in

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
before they can consider putting it in

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
before they can consider putting it in
the<00:00:37.220> tank

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the tank

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.430 
the tank
well<00:00:38.399> basically<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:39.660> need<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> food<00:00:40.170> source

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
well basically they need a food source

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280 
well basically they need a food source
for<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> primarily<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.210> macro<00:00:43.079> algae

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
for it and it is primarily a macro algae

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.700 
for it and it is primarily a macro algae
eater<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.970> some<00:00:45.270> algae<00:00:46.110> some

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
eater so if you have some algae some

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.979 
eater so if you have some algae some
sometimes<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.579> eat<00:00:47.730> clear<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.480> mostly

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
sometimes they eat clear but but mostly

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.420 
sometimes they eat clear but but mostly
they<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.440> biopsis<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.610> hair<00:00:51.210> type<00:00:51.510> algae<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
they like biopsis or hair type algae so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.740 
they like biopsis or hair type algae so
lettuce<00:00:53.430> legs<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.850> really<00:00:54.059> good<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:54.510> there's

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
lettuce legs do really good when there's

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.350 
lettuce legs do really good when there's
lettuce<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.040> hair<00:00:56.280> algae<00:00:56.670> or<00:00:56.970> those

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
lettuce you know hair algae or those

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
lettuce you know hair algae or those
kinds<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.780> macro<00:00:58.440> algae<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.220> feed<00:00:59.430> on

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
kinds of macro algae for them to feed on

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.060 
kinds of macro algae for them to feed on
what<00:01:00.390> other<00:01:00.540> water<00:01:00.809> parameters<00:01:01.110> work

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
what other water parameters work

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.399 
what other water parameters work
anything<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.540> like<00:01:03.659> your<00:01:03.870> regular<00:01:04.019> reef

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
anything just like your regular reef

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
anything just like your regular reef
tank<00:01:04.680> parameters<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.640> they're

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
tank parameters they like they're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
tank parameters they like they're
probably<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.630> quite<00:01:06.869> tolerable<00:01:07.350> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
probably you know quite tolerable to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
probably you know quite tolerable to
lower<00:01:08.009> water<00:01:08.340> quality<00:01:08.820> than<00:01:09.000> some<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.300> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
lower water quality than some of the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.609 
lower water quality than some of the
other<00:01:09.509> because<00:01:09.810> they<00:01:09.930> live<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.140> really

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
other because they live in really

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.889 
other because they live in really
inshore<00:01:11.460> environments<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:12.570> kind

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
inshore environments where there's kind

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.630 
inshore environments where there's kind
of<00:01:12.930> extreme<00:01:13.320> temperature<00:01:13.830> changes<00:01:13.860> but

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of extreme temperature changes but

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
of extreme temperature changes but
primarily<00:01:15.300> they're<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:15.869> dependent<00:01:16.289> about

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
primarily they're all dependent about

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.680 
primarily they're all dependent about
food<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.160> don't<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.520> food<00:01:17.690> then

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
food if they don't have food then

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.969 
food if they don't have food then
they're<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> starve<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.500> die<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
they're going to starve and die and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.590 
they're going to starve and die and
that's<00:01:20.130> generally<00:01:20.280> they'll<00:01:20.670> eat<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.300> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that's generally they'll eat all the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
that's generally they'll eat all the
algae<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> tank<00:01:22.440> eventually<00:01:23.039> if<00:01:23.910> it's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
algae and the tank eventually if it's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
algae and the tank eventually if it's
the<00:01:24.240> right<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> algae<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.440> then<00:01:25.649> they'll

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the right kind of algae and then they'll

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.820 
the right kind of algae and then they'll
just<00:01:26.880> disappear<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.289> like<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> lot

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
just disappear but they don't like a lot

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.609 
just disappear but they don't like a lot
of<00:01:28.860> ton<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.429> flow<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:30.869> beneficial<00:01:31.050> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
of ton of flow so it's beneficial to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109 
of ton of flow so it's beneficial to
have<00:01:31.740> them<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.640> tank<00:01:32.880> especially

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
have them you know in a tank especially

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.899 
have them you know in a tank especially
initially<00:01:34.080> with<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.770> pumps<00:01:35.160> turned<00:01:35.369> down<00:01:35.580> so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
initially with the pumps turned down so

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.249 
initially with the pumps turned down so
they<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> establish<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> start

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
they can kind of establish to start

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.419 
they can kind of establish to start
eating<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.039> don't<00:01:38.159> want<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> be

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
eating but if you don't want to be

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.980 
eating but if you don't want to be
blasting<00:01:38.970> water<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.509> does<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.750> blow

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
blasting water at them does this blow

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.330 
blasting water at them does this blow
and<00:01:40.200> go<00:01:40.259> right<00:01:40.440> over<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.740> overflow<00:01:41.190> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and go right over the overflow and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.830 
and go right over the overflow and
you'll<00:01:41.460> never<00:01:41.580> see<00:01:41.849> them<00:01:42.000> again<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.660> big

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you'll never see them again the big
