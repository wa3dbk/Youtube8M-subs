00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello welcome to the arrival channel 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.569
 enrique and today I am going to draw 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.510
 'Charlie Brown' giving away a heart 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.390
 as a special from February 14th day of 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.980
 valentine day of love friendship is 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.080
 a very simple drawing that can 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 give to your loved ones so 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.800
 let's start 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.290
 I start by drawing a circle 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.810
 for the head and then I divide it to the 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.510
 half horizontally and vertically for 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.890
 guide me after I draw a small 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800
 circumference at the top 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.650
 for the nose and then on the line 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.140
 horizontal another small circumference to 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.540
 each side for the ears 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 to finish the face after a broad 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.410
 letter and in the upper half of the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.200
 circumference to make the smile 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.180
 I continue with the heart if you 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.670
 make it difficult or you want to learn how to do 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.350
 one with its basic geometry you can see 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.269
 the video of how to draw a heart 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.430
 I will leave the link in the link 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.290
 video description now drawing three 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 small ellipses on each side of the heart 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.869
 for the fingers of the hands and start to 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.670
 better define the contours the position 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.100
 of the head is like that to emphasize the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.750
 sentiment of delivery apart from that is 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.420
 a characteristic position of 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.600
 charlie brown and snoopy cartoons 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.740
 for the smile use a wavy line 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.140
 also characteristic in some 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.820
 expressions of these characters now 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.190
 back or the sides and the base of a 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.890
 rectangle below the heart for the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.350
 shirt next one more rectangle 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.680
 small below and two small ellipses 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.930
 for the arms 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 drew a wavy strip on the shirt 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.520
 of 'Charlie Brown' and define the trousers 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.700
 adding a small jump in the middle 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.080
 to divide the legs 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.320
 finally drew two ellipses for the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.050
 ready feet we draw charly brown 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.479
 now I draw some hearts around 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.910
 and I highlight everything with a dot marker 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.250
 I thin the hearts I emphasize them with one 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.580
 ultra fine knit and erased the lines to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.410
 pencil at the end added some lines of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.000
 action to give the effect that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.000
 hearts spring from 'charlie brown' 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.489
 I apply color uniformly and left a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.620
 small glitter in hearts ready 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.010
 we finished 'charlie brown' giving away 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.110
 a heart 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.930
