00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
him that we're gonna look at and I just

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.920

there<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.260> androids<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.010> fall<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.119> let's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
there are androids in fall for but let's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
there are androids in fall for but let's
just<00:01:09.510> discuss<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.280> believe

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
just discuss are they in here I believe

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
just discuss are they in here I believe
they<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:11.909> because<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> take<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> close

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
they are because when you take a close

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
they are because when you take a close
look<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> most<00:01:14.700> standout<00:01:15.420> part

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
look at what is the most standout part

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
look at what is the most standout part
of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> mysterious<00:01:16.409> stranger<00:01:16.950> you'll<00:01:17.430> see

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

of the mysterious stranger you'll see
there's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> big<00:01:18.390> difference<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.869> his<00:01:18.960> hands

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
there's a big difference in his hands

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
there's a big difference in his hands
his<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:20.159> hand<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.670> his<00:01:20.909> left<00:01:21.210> hand<00:01:21.360> rather

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
his right hand or his left hand rather

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.960 
his right hand or his left hand rather
our<00:01:21.780> right<00:01:22.259> you'll<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> completely

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
our right you'll see is a completely

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
our right you'll see is a completely
normal<00:01:24.119> hand<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.020> his<00:01:25.140> left<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.680> obviously

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
normal hand but his left is obviously

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.789 
normal hand but his left is obviously
very<00:01:26.479> mechanical<00:01:27.479> looking<00:01:27.810> what's<00:01:28.020> augmented

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
very mechanical looking what's augmented

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
very mechanical looking what's augmented
as<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.070> something<00:01:29.340> fell<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.240> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
as if something fell off and it's just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.590

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
like an Android almost in turmoil so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.169

maybe<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.129> isn't<00:02:08.280> even<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.700> mysterious

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
maybe this isn't even the mysterious

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
maybe this isn't even the mysterious
stranger<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.599> might<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.050> look<00:02:10.770> at

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
stranger this might just be a look at

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.680 
stranger this might just be a look at
the<00:02:11.160> Android<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.610> could<00:02:11.790> explain<00:02:12.150> why<00:02:12.450> he's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the Android this could explain why he's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.470 
the Android this could explain why he's
dressed<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.170> the

and how does dig deeper to really find

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.940 
and how does dig deeper to really find
out<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.750> may<00:02:22.959> be<00:02:23.019> our<00:02:23.140> first<00:02:23.620> look<00:02:23.769> at

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
out this this may be our first look at

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.160 
out this this may be our first look at
the<00:02:24.159> androids<00:02:24.610> now<00:02:25.120> some<00:02:25.420> may<00:02:25.569> counteract<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the androids now some may counteract the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.960 
the androids now some may counteract the
argument<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.709> Maddie<00:02:27.340> androids<00:02:27.849> are

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
argument that Maddie androids are

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.550 
argument that Maddie androids are
designed<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.390> look<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.930> behave<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.500> humans

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
designed to look and behave like humans

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.009 
designed to look and behave like humans
for<00:02:30.220> example<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> most<00:02:31.030> famous<00:02:31.330> Android<00:02:31.870> that

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
for example the most famous Android that

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.869 
for example the most famous Android that
we<00:02:32.110> know<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.290> came<00:02:32.830> from<00:02:32.860> vol.3<00:02:33.489> whose

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
we know of came from vol.3 whose

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.580 
we know of came from vol.3 whose
Hartness<00:02:34.390> as<00:02:34.569> you<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.810> see<00:02:34.959> right<00:02:34.989> here<00:02:35.379> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
Hartness as you can see right here and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.559 
Hartness as you can see right here and
he<00:02:35.799> looks<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.190> damn<00:02:36.459> human<00:02:36.970> because<00:02:37.269> he

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
he looks like a damn human because he

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.410 
he looks like a damn human because he
was<00:02:38.049> designed<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.799> look<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.579> so<00:02:40.090> my

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
was designed to look like one and so my

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.000 
was designed to look like one and so my
response<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.709> feel<00:02:41.950> like

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
response to that is that I feel like

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.550 
response to that is that I feel like
this<00:02:42.370> android<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.150> scollay<00:02:43.420> square<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:44.019> most

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
this android and scollay square is most

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.170 
this android and scollay square is most
likely<00:02:44.769> trying<00:02:45.099> to<00:02:45.159> cover<00:02:45.430> up<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.760> he<00:02:45.940> is<00:02:46.030> an

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
likely trying to cover up that he is an

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.880 
likely trying to cover up that he is an
Android<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.750> for<00:02:47.079> your<00:02:47.200> being<00:02:47.379> captured<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
Android and for your being captured and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.979 
Android and for your being captured and
sent<00:02:48.129> back<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.549> Institute<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.810> it's

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
sent back to the Institute and so it's

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.470 
sent back to the Institute and so it's
very<00:02:50.170> nice<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.470> see<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.910> will<00:02:52.209> be<00:02:52.359> getting

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
very nice to see that we will be getting

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.229 
very nice to see that we will be getting
a<00:02:52.690> look<00:02:52.840> at<00:02:52.900> most<00:02:53.500> likely<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.129> our<00:02:54.579> assumptions

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
a look at most likely if our assumptions

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.729 
a look at most likely if our assumptions
are<00:02:55.450> correct<00:02:55.480> which<00:02:56.079> they<00:02:56.260> seem<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.560> be

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
are correct which they seem to be

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.410 
are correct which they seem to be
considering<00:02:57.400> his<00:02:57.519> hand<00:02:57.790> more<00:02:58.030> than<00:02:58.209> anything

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
considering his hand more than anything

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.449 
considering his hand more than anything
sticks<00:02:58.900> out<00:02:59.109> like<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.290> sore<00:02:59.379> thumb<00:02:59.620> Natalie<00:03:00.280> a
