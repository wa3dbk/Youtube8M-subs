00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
damage it finally a plant decides to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.190 
damage it finally a plant decides to
move<00:01:52.500> away<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:54.619> solve<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.860> crate<00:01:56.869> add<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
move away and solve a crate add the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.290 
move away and solve a crate add the
Rikishi<00:01:59.090> an<00:02:00.090> attack<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.580> gives<00:02:02.789> to

Rikishi an attack and it gives to

damages and throws the Ricky sheet down

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.020 
damages and throws the Ricky sheet down
so<00:02:12.660> now<00:02:12.930> those<00:02:13.410> characters<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.400> used<00:02:14.730> all

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so now those characters have used all

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.390 
so now those characters have used all
the<00:02:15.420> attacks<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.650> round

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the attacks for the round

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.440 
the attacks for the round
now<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.209> ISC<00:02:20.750> turn<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:22.040> may<00:02:22.450> decide

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
now it's the ISC turn and you may decide

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
now it's the ISC turn and you may decide
to<00:02:23.719> go<00:02:23.959> after<00:02:24.079> freedom<00:02:24.879> 12<00:02:27.010> freedom<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.159> weak

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
to go after freedom 12 freedom is weak

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.119 
to go after freedom 12 freedom is weak
but<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.329> little<00:02:29.569> robot<00:02:29.900> can<00:02:30.170> use<00:02:30.439> the<00:02:30.709> actions

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
but the little robot can use the actions

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.830 
but the little robot can use the actions
of<00:02:31.219> Jeannie<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.329> defend<00:02:32.659> itself

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
of Jeannie so it can defend itself

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.059 
of Jeannie so it can defend itself
better<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:34.129> that<00:02:34.370> leaves<00:02:34.670> Jimmy<00:02:35.269> weaker<00:02:36.069> so

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
better but that leaves Jimmy weaker so

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:45.059 
better but that leaves Jimmy weaker so
GU<00:02:37.639> boom<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:39.909> attacks<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:41.299> freedom<00:02:41.810> defense

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:54.630 

but<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.549> will<00:02:46.730> make<00:02:46.849> these<00:02:47.409> two<00:02:48.409> challenges
