00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.769 
to use a select fire for any fully
automatics<00:00:20.369> as<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.150> helps<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> lot<00:00:21.600> when

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
automatics as it just helps a lot when

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
automatics as it just helps a lot when
aim<00:00:21.960> there's<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.400> less<00:00:23.460> recoil<00:00:23.910> for

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
aim there's just a lot less recoil for

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.609 
aim there's just a lot less recoil for
it<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> actually<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> bit<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> lot

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it and you actually get a bit a lot

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.490 
it and you actually get a bit a lot
better<00:00:25.830> aim<00:00:26.070> from<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> distance<00:00:27.380> switches<00:00:28.380> on

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
better aim from a distance switches on

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.109 
better aim from a distance switches on
the<00:00:28.650> map<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.070> courier<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.670> stuff<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.029> might

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the map like courier and stuff it might

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.669 
the map like courier and stuff it might
be<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> bit<00:00:30.480> harder<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:30.900> fully<00:00:31.109> automatic

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
be a bit harder for fully automatic

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.639 
be a bit harder for fully automatic
users<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> use<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> also<00:00:33.930> wear<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> log

users to use them and also wear a log

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.790 
users to use them and also wear a log
sensitivity<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.640> recommended<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
sensitivity is recommended and on the

sensitivity is recommended and on the
light<00:00:37.980> machine<00:00:38.280> gun<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:38.969> much<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
light machine gun is pretty much the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.850 
light machine gun is pretty much the
same<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.899> using<00:00:40.110> their<00:00:40.469> select

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
same you want to be using their select

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
same you want to be using their select
not<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> like<00:00:41.670> fight<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.210> want<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> be

not to like fight it you want to be
using<00:00:42.690> target<00:00:43.230> finder<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.850> also<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> tiger

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
using target finder and also a tiger

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.110 
using target finder and also a tiger
finder<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> assault<00:00:45.989> rifles<00:00:46.410> too<00:00:46.649> and

the two main things you need to use a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.020 
the two main things you need to use a
select<00:00:51.660> five<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.140> automatics<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.520> target

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
select five for automatics and a target

actually<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.579> assault<00:01:50.579> rifle<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:52.070> light

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
actually the assault rifle and light

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.310 
actually the assault rifle and light
machine<00:01:53.250> gun<00:01:53.820> distance<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.659> long<00:01:54.869> shot<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
machine gun distance for a long shot is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.130 
machine gun distance for a long shot is
the<00:01:55.470> same<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.369> 20<00:01:56.790> steps<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.020> can

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the same and it is 20 steps as you can

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.600 
the same and it is 20 steps as you can
see<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> video<00:01:58.500> I've<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.950> measured<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
see in the video I've just measured that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
see in the video I've just measured that
out<00:01:59.670> which<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> 20<00:02:00.450> 20<00:02:01.229> steps<00:02:01.409> from<00:02:01.619> where<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
out which is 20 20 steps from where I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.359 
out which is 20 20 steps from where I
shot<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> guy<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:03.469> that<00:02:04.469> spot<00:02:04.829> was<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.040> main

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
shot the guy and that spot was the main

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.069 
shot the guy and that spot was the main
spot<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.790> Korea<00:02:06.090> where<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:07.049> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
spot on Korea where you want to go for a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.540 
spot on Korea where you want to go for a
long<00:02:07.259> shot<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.069> next<00:02:08.310> one<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.580> Sloan

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
long shot and the next one is Sloan

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.340 
long shot and the next one is Sloan
but<00:02:10.550> if<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.910> are<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> PA<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.750> standard<00:02:12.230> a

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
but if you are a PA the standard a

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.380 
but if you are a PA the standard a
glitch<00:02:12.620> by<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.920> tires<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.520> won't<00:02:13.760> be<00:02:14.000> able<00:02:14.240> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
glitch by the tires you won't be able to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.840 
glitch by the tires you won't be able to
wear<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:15.440> won't<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.710> far<00:02:15.920> enough<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.490> hit<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
wear you won't be far enough to hit the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.790 
wear you won't be far enough to hit the
long<00:02:17.000> shot<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.020> actually<00:02:18.230> want<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.560> stand

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
long shot so you actually want to stand

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.370 
long shot so you actually want to stand
behind<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.250> yellow<00:02:19.490> skip<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.330> it's<00:02:20.990> same<00:02:21.350> for

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
behind the yellow skip and it's same for

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.200 
behind the yellow skip and it's same for
this<00:02:21.770> end<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.250> mat-su<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.880> want<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> be

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
this end of the mat-su you want to be

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.640 
this end of the mat-su you want to be
backed<00:02:23.420> up<00:02:23.540> against<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.020> wall<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.470> be<00:02:24.560> able

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
backed up against this wall to be able

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.880 
backed up against this wall to be able
to<00:02:24.770> hit<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.100> long<00:02:25.250> shot<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.990> next<00:02:27.290> map<00:02:27.440> Plaza

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
to hit the long shot this next map Plaza

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.210 
to hit the long shot this next map Plaza
it<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:29.060> actually<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.600> mid<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.020> map<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.440> both

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
it is actually a mid of map and both

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.570 
it is actually a mid of map and both
sides<00:02:31.520> are<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.760> same<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.710> this<00:02:33.710> end<00:02:33.980> seems<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
sides are the same but this end seems to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.730 
sides are the same but this end seems to
be<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.940> longer<00:02:35.450> distance<00:02:35.600> towards<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> middle

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
be a longer distance towards the middle

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.110 
be a longer distance towards the middle
map<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.220> can<00:02:37.340> actually<00:02:37.700> hit<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.970> long

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
map so you can actually hit the long

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.060 
map so you can actually hit the long
shots<00:02:38.420> better<00:02:38.660> on<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.170> side<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.770> wouldn't

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
shots better on this side so I wouldn't

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.100 
shots better on this side so I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:40.340> going<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.150> opposite<00:02:41.750> side<00:02:42.610> but

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
recommend going on the opposite side but

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.570 
recommend going on the opposite side but
you<00:02:45.110> can<00:02:45.290> hit<00:02:45.500> them<00:02:45.770> on<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:45.950> other<00:02:46.070> side<00:02:46.370> but

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
you can hit them on the other side but

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.430 
you can hit them on the other side but
it's<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:47.180> lot<00:02:47.660> more<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.930> show<00:02:48.050> here<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
it's just a lot more to show here and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.960 
it's just a lot more to show here and
you<00:02:48.560> need<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.830> be<00:02:48.920> like<00:02:49.130> right<00:02:49.550> against<00:02:49.820> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
you need to be like right against the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.960 
you need to be like right against the
wall<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.390> they<00:02:50.630> need<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.990> be<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.520> just<00:02:52.520> as<00:02:52.700> far

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
wall and they need to be I just as far

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.780 
wall and they need to be I just as far
back<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:53.330> possible<00:02:53.390> basically<00:02:54.140> well<00:02:55.130> then<00:02:55.280> we

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
back as possible basically well then we

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.150 
back as possible basically well then we
are<00:02:55.910> now<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.300> hijacked<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.920> was<00:02:58.040> just

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
are now on hijacked and that was just

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.510 
are now on hijacked and that was just
the<00:02:58.400> standard<00:02:59.090> window<00:02:59.480> shot<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.130> now<00:03:01.370> as<00:03:01.459> you

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
the standard window shot and now as you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.410 
the standard window shot and now as you
can<00:03:01.730> see<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.330> mm<00:03:02.959> did<00:03:03.950> not<00:03:04.190> hit<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.430> long<00:03:05.150> shot

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
can see the mm did not hit the long shot

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.240 
can see the mm did not hit the long shot
there<00:03:05.630> but<00:03:06.500> what<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.740> want<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:06.950> do<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.190> you

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
there but what you want to do is you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.310 
there but what you want to do is you
want<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.430> take<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.610> few<00:03:07.880> steps<00:03:07.970> back<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.720> you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
want to take a few steps back and you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.260 
want to take a few steps back and you
will<00:03:09.470> be<00:03:09.590> able<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.920> achieve<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.820> long<00:03:10.970> shot

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
will be able to achieve the long shot

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.250 
will be able to achieve the long shot
from<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.630> distance<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.390> think<00:03:14.630> next<00:03:14.810> yes

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
from that distance and I think next yes

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.640 
from that distance and I think next yes
this<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.830> balcony<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.580> balcony<00:03:17.000> shot<00:03:17.269> and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
this is the balcony to balcony shot and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.850 
this is the balcony to balcony shot and
this<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.950> unachievable<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:20.140> far<00:03:21.140> as<00:03:21.320> I<00:03:21.410> know<00:03:21.470> as

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
this is unachievable as far as I know as

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.910 
this is unachievable as far as I know as
far<00:03:21.920> as<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.310> tried<00:03:22.610> anyway<00:03:23.140> but<00:03:24.140> as<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.739> see

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
far as I tried anyway but as you can see

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.530 
far as I tried anyway but as you can see
there<00:03:25.100> was<00:03:25.190> no<00:03:25.310> long<00:03:25.550> shot<00:03:25.790> from<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.180> window

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
there was no long shot from the window

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.990 
there was no long shot from the window
and<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.200> have<00:03:27.410> backed<00:03:27.680> up<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.580> very<00:03:28.760> back<00:03:28.970> of

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
and I have backed up to the very back of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.870 
and I have backed up to the very back of
the<00:03:29.180> wall<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:30.200> was<00:03:30.920> still<00:03:31.160> not<00:03:31.280> able<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.730> get

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
the wall and I was still not able to get

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.949 
the wall and I was still not able to get
the<00:03:32.000> long<00:03:32.120> shot<00:03:32.360> from<00:03:32.450> there<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:32.690> don't<00:03:32.900> know
