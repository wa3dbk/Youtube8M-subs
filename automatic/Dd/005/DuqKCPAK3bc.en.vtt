00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
idea is you plug it into a USB port

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
idea is you plug it into a USB port
which<00:00:39.750> we'll<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.230> moment<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
which we'll do in a moment you have to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.600 
which we'll do in a moment you have to
log<00:00:42.120> into<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.480> web<00:00:43.140> panel<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.860> order<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> unlock

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
log into a web panel in order to unlock

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.610 
log into a web panel in order to unlock
the<00:00:44.789> USB<00:00:45.149> key<00:00:45.390> 10<00:00:45.660> failed<00:00:45.930> attempt<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the USB key 10 failed attempt and the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
the USB key 10 failed attempt and the
USB<00:00:46.860> key<00:00:47.190> will<00:00:47.340> explode<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.450> quite

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
USB key will explode now it's not quite

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.119 
USB key will explode now it's not quite
as<00:00:48.780> exciting<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.469> sounds<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.950> doesn't

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
as exciting as it sounds it doesn't

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.860 
as exciting as it sounds it doesn't
actually<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.210> actually<00:00:51.719> explode

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
actually you know it actually explode

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020 
actually you know it actually explode
what<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.829> happens<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.280> inside<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> key

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
what really happens is inside the key

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.260 
what really happens is inside the key
here<00:00:54.300> there's<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.170> flash<00:00:55.500> memory<00:00:55.530> is

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
here there's where the flash memory is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.910 
here there's where the flash memory is
there's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.629> powder<00:00:58.230> charge<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.770> there

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
there's a little powder charge in there

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
there's a little powder charge in there
that<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.160> actually<00:00:59.340> render<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> flash

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that will actually render the flash

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.830 
that will actually render the flash
memory<00:01:00.890> inoperable<00:01:01.890> after<00:01:02.370> 10<00:01:02.730> attempts<00:01:03.149> now

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
memory inoperable after 10 attempts now

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
memory inoperable after 10 attempts now
this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> better<00:01:04.229> than<00:01:04.320> doing<00:01:04.739> doing<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
this is better than doing doing a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.850 
this is better than doing doing a
software<00:01:06.570> erase<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> data<00:01:07.680> could

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
software erase because that data could

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
software erase because that data could
potentially<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.520> recovered<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.479> way<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
potentially be recovered this way the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
potentially be recovered this way the
flash<00:01:11.880> chip<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.840> data<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
flash chip that has all your data on it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.070 
flash chip that has all your data on it
is<00:01:13.560> physically<00:01:14.189> destroyed<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:15.689> we'll<00:01:15.930> see

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
is physically destroyed so now we'll see

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
is physically destroyed so now we'll see
in<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.229> moment<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.710> come<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in a moment this will come up it

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
in a moment this will come up it
actually<00:01:17.189> runs<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> CD<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.960> Mac<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
actually runs as a CD it's Mac we have a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.170 
actually runs as a CD it's Mac we have a
Mac<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> studio<00:01:20.130> today<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.490> mac<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.729> pc

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Mac in the studio today it's mac and pc

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.320 
Mac in the studio today it's mac and pc
compatibl<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.369> what<00:01:23.369> happens<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
compatibl and what happens is this

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.630 
compatibl and what happens is this
autorun<00:01:24.840> CD<00:01:25.170> comes<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> acts<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.250> an

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
autorun CD comes up it acts as an

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
autorun CD comes up it acts as an

application that sits on the drawn the
key<00:01:28.680> itself<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.909> actually<00:01:30.270> use<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
key itself and you can actually use the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.660 
key itself and you can actually use the
key<00:01:30.840> without<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:32.040> through<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.310> unlock

process<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.860> mounted<00:01:35.040> you'll

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
process and now that is mounted you'll

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
process and now that is mounted you'll
see<00:01:35.490> what<00:01:35.610> I'm<00:01:35.700> talking<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:36.990> do

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
to open up this application so we can't

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
to open up this application so we can't

for<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> show<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.240> z<00:01:48.570> 8<00:01:48.810> times<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.259> need<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
for the show it's z 8 times you need to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.859 
for the show it's z 8 times you need to
have<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> minimum<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.570> eight<00:01:51.570> characters<00:01:53.869> so

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
have a minimum of eight characters so

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.530 
have a minimum of eight characters so

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
security phrase comes in and we need to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.150 
security phrase comes in and we need to
make<00:02:48.090> sure<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.390> know<00:02:48.510> our<00:02:48.630> password<00:02:49.160> so

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
make sure that we know our password so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.100 
make sure that we know our password so

after 10 failed login attempts we

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.870 
after 10 failed login attempts we
mentioned<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.470> self-destruct<00:02:53.130> feature<00:02:53.340> it's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
mentioned the self-destruct feature it's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520 
mentioned the self-destruct feature it's
not<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.630> say<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:54.960> as<00:02:55.080> quite<00:02:55.440> as

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
not as like I say it's not as quite as

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.020 
not as like I say it's not as quite as
exciting<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.130> sounds<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:56.640> not<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.880> the

exciting as it sounds it's not like the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.490 
exciting as it sounds it's not like the

Impossible<00:02:58.590> or<00:02:59.100> something<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.490> but

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
Impossible or something like that but

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.400 
Impossible or something like that but
what<00:03:00.330> actually<00:03:00.420> happens<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.110> patented

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
what actually happens is the patented

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.830 
what actually happens is the patented
technology<00:03:02.250> called<00:03:02.520> flash<00:03:02.880> trash<00:03:03.270> that

technology called flash trash that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.200 
technology called flash trash that
actually<00:03:04.140> destroys<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.860> storage<00:03:05.670> chip<00:03:06.000> at
