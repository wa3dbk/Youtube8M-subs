00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 it is this same enclosure she wants herself 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.000
 move then I do not tell you more 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.650
 but a little surprise 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.570
 I 'll let you watch these parts that 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 you can see I did not want him 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.110
 but I am again a present of my 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.480
 professional hairdresser friend who 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.580
 name is going to know her 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.530
 so what would be your little ones 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 tips to make yourself beautiful 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.160
 hairstyle to curl and well that's the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.069
 prepare as he already wants very 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:45.469
 far ahead and here is first of all 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:48.440
 first and finally fire households 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.280
 when a good hair preparation 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.629
 on their cheeks your new cover 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.769
 so promised separation no ears 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.299
 especially since we really want 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.609
 big loops we do not want some 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.079
 thing too primed so really 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.120
 something of the hegira 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.120
 but by the way, because I worked 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.180
 and all done well in the gesture in his 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.490
 falls 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.060
 united the clip is actually half a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.039
 turn and then we slide gently 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.750
 back and especially not too long on the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:38.939
 wick to prevent it desensitize so 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:42.509
 is found against look and what I 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.100
 I'm very simple but especially 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.460
 be careful not to give yourself no 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.899
 equipped with non-payment pure second 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.450
 separation point that will take place 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.780
 always big repairs 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.579
 preferably we will go in three 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.579
 steps so three separation 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:19.150
 so it's the fault of me 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.320
 will find one puts the name the same we will 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.480
 go on any assignment 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.390
 it's logical introduction procession 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:33.430
 four sections all the same principles 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.410
 subscribers hole and we drag this recoil 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.820
 finished it does not matter in high schools 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.380
 everything is he now he will go bad 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.640
 we had explained the back we are going 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.710
 pass by jared by the waters 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.020
 so what I propose is that 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.820
 like a little kim kashashian aspect that 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.090
 it really has the gruff side but in 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.120
 the outside and the soul of the blow we will do 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.980
 a technique of a heart tone at each 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.570
 time so naturally there always a 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.340
 meaning we are much more comfortable 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.280
 that she had to go back in the other direction 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.200
 if I take a separation why 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.730
 because if he takes the thread separation 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.310
 we will look very curly 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.570
 we will say interested interact and 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.260
 there we will not really have the rendering of 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.470
 the love we want to have a big 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.100
 wick and inside just like a 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:31.440
 principle a half turn 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.440
 we live quietly welcome lapointe 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.800
 and we leave the care of always the name 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.980
 d'anna you have the gesture very well 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.400
 so you have an artist news at the 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.050
 city 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.850
 so the city will try to do 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.260
 something pretty much okay the 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.850
 first of all things so on that side 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.590
 actually the animal of a territory and can 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.720
 leave and there she even the treatise if I 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.209
 could tell me no who takes the part 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.819
 Bahrain as a manual said look good 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.580
 it's really well wide bombay 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.620
 I'm going to come and watch the straightener 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.050
 inside and actually I'm going to turn 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.720
 so of art outside I always go 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.900
 hold my wick for memory France 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.940
 is fine point of attacked very scared 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.750
 here and there I will remove the do 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.400
 simply 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.010
 you have one as I am a 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.200
 professional and there with my hand I the 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.169
 always lose it in the opposite direction 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.880
 finally had that the unthinkable 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.070
 and that's the loop now up 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.960
 when it's a price that's it 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.000
 bah good so that is what I think 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.460
 really that I managed that side yes 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.350
 finally for me i was continuous nicolas 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.580
 I transmit them separations so 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.650
 with vanina we thought we had 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.530
 it was paris plaster of the coup 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.960
 was waiting for the belly and I continue we 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.280
 find the result was wrong there 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.289
 now that we have been brought back 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.390
 ripples i'll let finish down 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.620
 the placement of the hairstyle by the other 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.810
 expert combat therefore has the fall we did not 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.780
 not at all 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.770
 long hair we just work 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.400
 then we going to do that we will 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.490
 just slightly positive manual is going 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.180
 to make next to it by the heart to heart that 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.160
 hurts 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.370
 that's natural without being too much 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.919
 ready not just face alain lange 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.260
 said here it is here and there it crumpled me 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.090
 slightly hair to give a little 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.100
 of volume if you can do that's 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.940
 put a little bit of lacquer then his 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.490
 palette 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.770
 he then yielded twice more osys more 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.060
 strong fixation but very 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.580
 slightly normal and to do you 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.110

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:48.620
 a heating the ball is now 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.930
