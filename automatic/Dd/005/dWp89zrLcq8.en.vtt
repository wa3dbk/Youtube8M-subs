00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.190 
things and they've never come to
fruition<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.579> guess<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.090> what<00:03:37.660> he's<00:03:37.840> done

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
fruition so I guess that what he's done

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.160 
fruition so I guess that what he's done
with<00:03:38.230> them<00:03:38.650> was<00:03:38.799> just<00:03:39.010> taking<00:03:39.519> them<00:03:39.640> and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
with them was just taking them and

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.000 
with them was just taking them and
pushed<00:03:41.170> them<00:03:41.320> under<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> road<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.280> know<00:03:42.310> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
pushed them under the road you know and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.220 
pushed them under the road you know and
so<00:03:45.010> what<00:03:45.280> I've<00:03:45.430> done<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.850> took<00:03:46.180> all<00:03:46.570> ideas<00:03:47.049> that

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230
