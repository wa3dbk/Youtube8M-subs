video about for the blue so and it's

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.550 
video about for the blue so and it's
probably<00:00:15.630> best<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.870> watched<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.260> first

invert the image itself they go

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.910 
invert the image itself they go
converted<00:00:27.080> this<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:28.529> technique<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
converted this is actually technique the

only<00:00:29.130> worked<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.519> yesterday<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.349> it's<00:00:31.349> quite

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
only worked out yesterday and it's quite

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.020 
only worked out yesterday and it's quite
it<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.830> kind<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.309> bit<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> luck<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it was kind of just a bit of luck that I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.370 
it was kind of just a bit of luck that I
worked<00:00:33.239> out<00:00:33.420> accidentally<00:00:33.930> inverted<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
worked out accidentally inverted the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.900 
worked out accidentally inverted the
image<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> realize<00:00:35.130> how<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.370> glue<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.790> was

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
image and realize how much glue that was

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.600 
image and realize how much glue that was
in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> face<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.649> that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
in the face to what there was in that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.760 
in the face to what there was in that
and<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.840> want<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> literally<00:00:40.410> bring

and you just want to literally bring
them<00:00:41.040> after<00:00:41.250> investing<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
them after investing if you want to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.150

you should do exempt is set up a red

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
you should do exempt is set up a red
tone<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.640> literally<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.119> bringing

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
tone which is literally just bringing

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.069 
tone which is literally just bringing
everything<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:03.990> apart<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:04.770> red<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:06.079> this

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
everything down apart from red and this

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.570 
everything down apart from red and this
will<00:02:07.229> actually<00:02:07.350> remove<00:02:07.619> all<00:02:07.979> other<00:02:08.009> color

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
will actually remove all other color

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.750 
will actually remove all other color
which<00:02:09.080> has<00:02:10.080> accidentally<00:02:10.530> been<00:02:10.739> created<00:02:11.190> or

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
which has accidentally been created or

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.059 
which has accidentally been created or
whatever

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
whatever

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.759 
whatever
and<00:02:14.650> it's<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.709> good<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.670> do<00:02:16.909> that<00:02:17.120> quickly

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
and it's just good to do that quickly

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.569 
and it's just good to do that quickly
because<00:02:18.769> obviously<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.159> this<00:02:19.219> one<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.400> want

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
because obviously in this one you want

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:31.180 
because obviously in this one you want
to<00:02:19.609> get<00:02:19.730> rid<00:02:19.849> of<00:02:19.879> blues<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:22.480> as<00:02:23.480> well

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.760 

okay<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.210> you<00:02:33.140> can<00:02:33.350> save<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.770> preset<00:02:34.190> as

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
okay and you can save that preset as

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.560 
okay and you can save that preset as
read<00:02:37.720> now<00:02:38.720> once<00:02:39.020> you've<00:02:39.170> done<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.380> um<00:02:40.570> you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
read now once you've done that um you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.490 
read now once you've done that um you
can<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.870> go<00:02:41.990> control<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.760> again<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.630> bring

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
can just go control you again and bring

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.950 
can just go control you again and bring
up<00:02:45.620> your<00:02:45.740> hue<00:02:45.890> saturation<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.670> bring<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.810> up

up your hue saturation and bring it up
the<00:02:48.410> vibrancy<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:51.110> because<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.410> do

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
the vibrancy and just because you do

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.440 
the vibrancy and just because you do
lose<00:02:52.040> some<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.460> red<00:02:52.640> where<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.120> play

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
lose some of the red where you play

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.200 
lose some of the red where you play
around<00:02:53.660> with<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.960> color<00:02:54.170> balance<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:55.520> in

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
around with the color balance but in

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.480 
around with the color balance but in
general<00:02:56.630> that<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.560> cut<00:02:57.890> out<00:02:57.920> which<00:02:58.280> would

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
general that is cut out which would

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.580 
general that is cut out which would
almost<00:02:58.820> have<00:02:58.940> been<00:02:59.120> impossible<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.630> do<00:02:59.870> in<00:03:00.170> any

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
almost have been impossible to do in any

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.340 
almost have been impossible to do in any
other<00:03:00.770> fashion<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:02.510> think<00:03:02.930> there<00:03:03.020> is<00:03:03.050> still

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
other fashion and I think there is still

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.690 
other fashion and I think there is still
some<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.620> his<00:03:03.680> face<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.250> might<00:03:04.430> have<00:03:04.460> to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
some in his face that you might have to

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.160 
some in his face that you might have to
obviously<00:03:04.820> go<00:03:05.150> around<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.570> correct<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.960> just

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
obviously go around and correct it just

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.540 
obviously go around and correct it just
that<00:03:06.260> little<00:03:06.440> bit<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.680> general<00:03:09.890> look<00:03:10.430> at

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
that little bit but in general look at

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.440 
that little bit but in general look at
how<00:03:10.640> close<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.150> skin<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:13.150> especially<00:03:14.150> like

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
how close it is skin and especially like

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.110 
how close it is skin and especially like
look<00:03:14.840> look<00:03:15.080> here<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.980> look<00:03:16.130> at<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.370> seamless

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
look look here see look at that seamless

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.570 
look look here see look at that seamless
and<00:03:17.590> as<00:03:18.590> such<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.800> really<00:03:19.100> handy<00:03:19.430> technique

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
and as such a really handy technique

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.390 
and as such a really handy technique
because<00:03:20.060> at<00:03:20.360> i<00:03:20.780> work<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:21.440> photography<00:03:22.040> studio

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
because at i work in photography studio

and i just went out yesterday and it has
already<00:03:25.160> come<00:03:25.460> in<00:03:25.700> handy<00:03:25.910> there<00:03:26.450> have<00:03:26.540> been

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
already come in handy there have been

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.390 
already come in handy there have been
kind<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.900> spots<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.500> we<00:03:27.860> haven't<00:03:28.070> previously

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
kind of spots that we haven't previously

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.380 
kind of spots that we haven't previously
been<00:03:28.790> able<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.120> do<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:29.800> because<00:03:30.800> of<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:32.240> way

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
been able to do and because of the way

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.830 
been able to do and because of the way
that<00:03:32.570> red<00:03:32.780> works<00:03:33.080> works<00:03:33.740> in<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.070> skin<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.840> but

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
that red works works in the skin and but

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.560 
that red works works in the skin and but
doing<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.620> seems<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.220> have<00:03:37.420> solved<00:03:38.420> a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
doing this seems to have solved a

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.320 
doing this seems to have solved a
problem<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:42.070> you<00:03:43.070> could<00:03:43.280> just<00:03:43.310> obviously<00:03:44.150> go

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
problem and you could just obviously go

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.090 
problem and you could just obviously go
around<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.810> just<00:03:45.110> desaturate<00:03:45.800> things

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
around and just desaturate things

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.670 
around and just desaturate things
afterwards<00:03:49.540> see<00:03:50.540> look<00:03:50.660> these<00:03:51.140> separate<00:03:51.530> that

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
afterwards see look these separate that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.440 
afterwards see look these separate that
cuz<00:03:51.890> we<00:03:51.950> don't<00:03:52.070> want<00:03:52.100> that<00:03:52.280> in<00:03:52.340> there<00:03:52.640> but<00:03:53.330> we

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
cuz we don't want that in there but we

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.140 
cuz we don't want that in there but we
won't<00:03:53.660> read<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.280> see<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.880> can<00:03:56.120> really

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
won't read and see like it can really

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.990 
won't read and see like it can really
come<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:56.810> handy<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:58.060> once<00:03:59.060> you've<00:04:00.820> worked<00:04:01.820> out

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
come in handy and once you've worked out

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.640 
come in handy and once you've worked out
how<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:02.510> remove<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.930> color<00:04:03.440> from<00:04:03.620> the
