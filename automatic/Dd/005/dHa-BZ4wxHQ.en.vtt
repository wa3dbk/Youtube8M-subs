deck size from 40 to 60 now of course as
you<00:00:40.539> can<00:00:40.570> imagine<00:00:40.750> quite<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.469> bit<00:00:41.710> of<00:00:41.800> different

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
you can imagine quite a bit of different

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.560 
you can imagine quite a bit of different
duelists<00:00:42.489> have<00:00:42.610> different<00:00:43.030> opinions<00:00:43.450> on

duelists have different opinions on

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.240 
duelists have different opinions on
whether<00:00:43.840> or<00:00:44.020> not<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:44.350> would<00:00:44.500> be<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.680> good<00:00:44.950> or<00:00:45.219> a

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
whether or not this would be a good or a

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.009 
whether or not this would be a good or a
bad<00:00:45.430> thing<00:00:45.610> within<00:00:46.089> the<00:00:46.329> game<00:00:46.539> and<00:00:46.780> some

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
bad thing within the game and some

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.110 
bad thing within the game and some
people<00:00:47.230> brought<00:00:47.409> up<00:00:47.469> how<00:00:47.890> other<00:00:48.219> TCG<00:00:48.879> card

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
people brought up how other TCG card

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.180 
people brought up how other TCG card
games<00:00:49.359> such<00:00:49.480> as<00:00:49.659> Magic<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.649> Gathering<00:00:50.679> for

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
games such as Magic the Gathering for

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.459 
games such as Magic the Gathering for
example<00:00:51.609> do<00:00:52.059> have<00:00:52.239> a<00:00:52.269> minimum<00:00:52.749> deck<00:00:52.960> size<00:00:53.199> of

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
example do have a minimum deck size of

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.950 
example do have a minimum deck size of
60<00:00:53.920> but<00:00:54.399> I<00:00:54.429> would<00:00:54.730> argue<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.480> reason<00:00:55.809> for

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
60 but I would argue that the reason for

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.649 
60 but I would argue that the reason for
that<00:00:56.140> is<00:00:56.530> because<00:00:56.739> those<00:00:57.699> type<00:00:57.969> of<00:00:57.999> games<00:00:58.300> are

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
that is because those type of games are

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.079 
that is because those type of games are
usually<00:00:58.929> resource<00:00:59.739> based<00:01:00.100> meaning<00:01:00.760> if<00:01:00.879> you<00:01:00.999> do

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
usually resource based meaning if you do

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.219 
usually resource based meaning if you do
have<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.329> have<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.479> certain<00:01:01.780> amount<00:01:01.839> of<00:01:01.989> cards

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
have to have a certain amount of cards

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.020 
have to have a certain amount of cards
within<00:01:02.379> your<00:01:02.620> deck<00:01:02.800> devoted<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.429> being<00:01:03.640> just

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
within your deck devoted to being just

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.060 
within your deck devoted to being just
resources<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:05.260> that<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.470> can<00:01:05.590> get<00:01:05.710> your<00:01:05.830> other

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
resources so that you can get your other

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.460 
resources so that you can get your other
cards<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.670> plays<00:01:06.880> ah<00:01:07.120> you<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:08.050> on<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:08.409> other

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
cards and plays ah you you on the other

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.160 
cards and plays ah you you on the other
hand<00:01:08.860> is<00:01:09.100> not<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.729> resource<00:01:10.240> based<00:01:10.600> type<00:01:10.960> of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
hand is not a resource based type of

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.110 
hand is not a resource based type of
game<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.979> don't<00:01:12.159> typically<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.940> have

combination of cards on the field first

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.310

or perform a certain kind of combo or
play<00:01:29.800> or<00:01:29.830> whatever<00:01:30.250> but<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.030> not<00:01:31.210> exactly

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
play or whatever but it's not exactly

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.410 
play or whatever but it's not exactly
the<00:01:31.810> same<00:01:31.870> thing<00:01:32.320> as<00:01:32.560> having<00:01:33.460> land<00:01:33.910> out<00:01:34.120> on<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
the same thing as having land out on the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.450 
the same thing as having land out on the
field<00:01:34.690> in<00:01:34.930> magic<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.710> tapping<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.250> in

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
field in magic and the tapping it in

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.950 
field in magic and the tapping it in
order<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.910> actually<00:01:37.120> summon<00:01:37.720> out<00:01:37.810> your

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
order to actually summon out your

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.750 
order to actually summon out your
monsters<00:01:38.440> or<00:01:38.680> whatever<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.220> think<00:01:39.490> if<00:01:39.550> games

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
monsters or whatever I think if games

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.490 
monsters or whatever I think if games
like<00:01:39.940> Magic<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.480> Gathering<00:01:40.510> had<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.080> forty

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
like Magic the Gathering had a forty

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.290 
like Magic the Gathering had a forty
card<00:01:41.680> minimum<00:01:42.040> deck<00:01:42.250> size<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.090> had<00:01:43.210> to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
card minimum deck size and you had to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.970 
card minimum deck size and you had to
have<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.660> much<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.960> that<00:01:43.990> devoted<00:01:44.650> towards

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
have so much of that devoted towards

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.040 
have so much of that devoted towards
land<00:01:45.280> type<00:01:45.550> resources<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.600> would<00:01:46.750> drastically

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
land type resources it would drastically

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.660 
land type resources it would drastically
change<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.710> way<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.100> game<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.340> actually

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
change the way the game is actually

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.060 
change the way the game is actually
played<00:01:49.120> so<00:01:49.510> because<00:01:49.900> yugioh<00:01:50.410> is<00:01:50.650> considered

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
played so because yugioh is considered

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.400 
played so because yugioh is considered
to<00:01:51.160> be<00:01:51.190> or<00:01:51.520> at<00:01:52.240> least<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.660> consider<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.290> be<00:01:53.320> a

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
to be or at least I consider to be a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.590 
to be or at least I consider to be a
much<00:01:53.620> more<00:01:53.650> fast<00:01:54.160> paced<00:01:54.460> game<00:01:54.550> then<00:01:55.150> Magic<00:01:55.510> the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
much more fast paced game then Magic the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.270 
much more fast paced game then Magic the
Gathering<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:56.440> is<00:01:56.590> why<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.800> can<00:01:56.980> function

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
Gathering that is why it can function

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.890 
Gathering that is why it can function
pretty<00:01:57.550> well<00:01:57.790> with<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> forty<00:01:58.450> card<00:01:58.660> deck

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
pretty well with a forty card deck

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.510 
pretty well with a forty card deck
minimum<00:01:59.440> now<00:01:59.740> I'm<00:01:59.860> not<00:02:00.010> saying<00:02:00.250> I'm

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
minimum now I'm not saying I'm

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.310 
minimum now I'm not saying I'm
completely<00:02:00.970> opposed<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.750> changing<00:02:02.200> the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
completely opposed to changing the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.960 
completely opposed to changing the
minimum<00:02:02.770> deck<00:02:03.010> size<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.550> think<00:02:03.700> would<00:02:03.940> be

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
minimum deck size I think would be

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.520 
minimum deck size I think would be
really<00:02:04.300> interesting<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:04.810> see<00:02:04.840> how<00:02:04.990> much<00:02:05.290> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
really interesting to see how much the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.740 
really interesting to see how much the
game<00:02:05.680> changed<00:02:06.250> if<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.700> deck<00:02:06.850> size<00:02:07.030> minimum

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
game changed if the deck size minimum

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.869 
game changed if the deck size minimum
was<00:02:07.930> switched<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.289> 50<00:02:08.830> cards<00:02:09.069> or<00:02:09.310> even<00:02:09.550> 60

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
was switched to 50 cards or even 60

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.369 
was switched to 50 cards or even 60
cards<00:02:10.269> per<00:02:10.509> day<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.899> think<00:02:11.019> at<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.260> point

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
cards per day I think at that point

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.229 
cards per day I think at that point
archetypes<00:02:12.129> that<00:02:12.220> don't<00:02:12.489> have<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> huge<00:02:13.090> amount

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
archetypes that don't have a huge amount

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.000 
archetypes that don't have a huge amount
of<00:02:13.480> cards<00:02:13.780> within<00:02:13.959> them<00:02:14.379> will<00:02:14.830> really

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
of cards within them will really

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.619 
of cards within them will really
struggle<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.640> order<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.909> make<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.090> playable

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
struggle in order to make a playable

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.360 
struggle in order to make a playable
build<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.200> for<00:02:17.349> example<00:02:17.739> maybe<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.010> deck<00:02:18.340> like

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
build so for example maybe a deck like

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.550 
build so for example maybe a deck like
uae's<00:02:19.030> who<00:02:19.390> don't<00:02:19.599> have<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> whole<00:02:20.260> lot<00:02:20.530> of

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
uae's who don't have a whole lot of

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.590 
uae's who don't have a whole lot of
monsters<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.459> spells<00:02:21.550> at<00:02:21.970> their<00:02:22.150> disposal

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
monsters and spells at their disposal

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.540 
monsters and spells at their disposal
within<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.140> archetype<00:02:23.620> would<00:02:24.190> find<00:02:24.430> it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
within that archetype would find it

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.460 
within that archetype would find it
really<00:02:24.790> hard<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.270> order<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.600> build<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.080> complete

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
really hard in order to build a complete

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.240 
really hard in order to build a complete
deck<00:02:26.830> out<00:02:27.069> of

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
deck out of

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.220 
deck out of
60<00:02:27.610> cards<00:02:27.850> but<00:02:28.360> on<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.570> flip<00:02:28.750> side<00:02:28.780> of<00:02:29.020> things

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
60 cards but on the flip side of things

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.320 
60 cards but on the flip side of things
archetypes<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> huge<00:02:30.730> amount<00:02:31.120> of

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
archetypes that have a huge amount of

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.180 
archetypes that have a huge amount of
monsters<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.140> spells<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.530> traps<00:02:32.620> at<00:02:33.010> their

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
monsters and spells and traps at their

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.400 
monsters and spells and traps at their
disposal<00:02:33.670> will<00:02:33.790> definitely<00:02:34.270> flourish<00:02:34.780> within

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
disposal will definitely flourish within

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.290 
disposal will definitely flourish within
a<00:02:35.500> higher<00:02:35.710> debt<00:02:36.040> count<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:36.670> maybe<00:02:36.880> for<00:02:37.180> example

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
a higher debt count so maybe for example

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.840 
a higher debt count so maybe for example
decks<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:38.080> mermail<00:02:38.710> would<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.370> extremely

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
decks like mermail would do extremely

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.240 
decks like mermail would do extremely
well<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.270> an<00:02:40.810> era<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.140> u<00:02:41.350> yo<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:41.740> required<00:02:42.070> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
well in an era of u yo which required a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.640 
well in an era of u yo which required a
60<00:02:42.610> card<00:02:42.790> minimum<00:02:43.330> type<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.780> deck<00:02:44.020> so<00:02:44.350> in<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
60 card minimum type of deck so in the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.470 
60 card minimum type of deck so in the
comment<00:02:44.950> section<00:02:45.190> below<00:02:45.220> let<00:02:45.580> me<00:02:46.000> know<00:02:46.150> your

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
comment section below let me know your

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.300 
comment section below let me know your
guys's<00:02:46.870> thoughts<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:47.650> subject<00:02:47.890> do<00:02:48.250> you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
guys's thoughts on this subject do you

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.790 
guys's thoughts on this subject do you
think<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.850> yo<00:02:49.090> should<00:02:49.330> stay<00:02:49.570> at<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> 45<00:02:50.380> minimum

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
think you yo should stay at a 45 minimum

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.770 
think you yo should stay at a 45 minimum
or<00:02:50.950> do<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.490> think<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.910> needs<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.270> be<00:02:52.300> up<00:02:52.540> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
or do you think that needs to be up to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.440 
or do you think that needs to be up to
like<00:02:52.930> 50<00:02:53.320> or<00:02:53.530> 60<00:02:54.040> or<00:02:54.070> something<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
like 50 or 60 or something like that and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.180 
like 50 or 60 or something like that and
I<00:02:55.780> guess<00:02:55.959> that's<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.230> for<00:02:56.410> now<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:56.920> black

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
I guess that's it for now this is black

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.459 
I guess that's it for now this is black
