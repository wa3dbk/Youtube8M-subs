00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello friends with you day with semenihin and 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.460
 in this blog we are meeting you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
 weekly to discuss 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.110
 nutrition issues for all 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.150
 people seeking to improve their 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 physical fitness and today I have 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 a couple of interesting news for you first 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.580
 due to the huge number of questions 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.170
 which you set in the comments and on 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.000
 which naturally I do not have physically 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.740
 possible answer yet 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.869
 some questions require an answer 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.029
 especially those questions that are repeated 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.369
 again and again and again today I will answer 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.019
 on 23 of your questions now the second I 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.910
 sure you will like it too 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.100
 related to your comments many of 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.800
 they try to sort you out in such detail 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
 in your daily diet and ask so 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.430
 specific questions that guys me 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.760
 I want to give you feedback and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.340
 disassemble some of your examples 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.969
 ration right here before our eyes like 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.590
 tell all viewers of this blog and 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.000
 thus up to say your opinion about 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.079
 what seems right to me 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.770
 it seems wrong what can 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.710
 correct 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.170
 so I suggest you write 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.350
 short video literally 45 seconds 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.380
 where on the table you put all the original 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.790
 products of your daily diet 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.890
 shoot it all on the phone or on 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.140
 video camera turn the phone on 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 yourself and say your height 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.759
 physical condition we will see i think by 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.939
 picture and your goal which you 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.310
 chase with this diet and this video 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.799
 you send video responses to this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.049
 video for the next release I will choose one 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.540
 two most interesting examples or 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.950
 illustrative examples and give you my 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 shorter assessment 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.470
 what shall we do today what shall we eat 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.920
 friends are on the agenda today 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.100
 delicacy I will not be afraid of this word 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.900
 its very minimal culinary 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.330
 abilities wouldn't even risk 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.370
 cook such a dish but beautiful 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.170
 Victoria Yushkevich which treated me 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.540
 these cutlets that we will today 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:08.970
 do helped me cook the original 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:10.920
 a lot of guys are wonderful female 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.380
 hands cooked this amazing 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 a mixture of my business I just extreme 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650
 simple lay it on warmed up 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.190
 surface 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.980
 it means my task as the centuries say 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.280
 put them as loose as possible 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.720
 I will try because you understand what 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.540
 out of this cutlets means 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.190
 surface temperature we have 210 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.860
 degrees i pre 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:41.410
 already heated i.e. the surface is red hot 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.180
 and this mixture wants dare centuries but 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.150
 when I saw it all stir and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.820
 with your little hands 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.400
 I certainly understood that I didnâ€™t 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.240
 stuck output slush now guys bye 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.530
 it is fried I want another novelty 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.990
 I decided to offer no more 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.820
 theoretical topic try to highlight in 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.770
 each issue in order for you 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.900
 it was more informative and so 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.850
 do you need to understand nutrition 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.490
 learn a few basic concepts one 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.760
 of which is the base exchange this whole 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.260
 set of processes 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.730
 metabolic processes in the human body 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.240
 which is happening 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
 state of rest ie even if you are in 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.560
 some particular day 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.240
 waking up in the morning decided nothing at all 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.340
 don't do and don't get up and you just 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.320
 run and try not to think about anything 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.140
 your body will naturally nest 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.620
 calorie count and this is basic 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.310
 sharing is the most interesting guys what is it 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.050
 the amount of energy is greater than all that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.670
 extra energy 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.500
 which is an ordinary person again we 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.600
 we take but not an ordinary normal person 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.040
 burn for a day at so here on 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.080
 this base exchange affects somewhat 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.680
 most important parameters are methods 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.360
 workout 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.270
 if your training consists only of 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.860
 cardio then base exchange is not accelerated during 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.989
 workout time you burn big 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.760
 amount of energy but in a dream you burn 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.550
 the same amount of energy that you burned 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.769
 if you didn't do cardio if you 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.590
 train in a force way that is, you 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.780
 lift weights by 8 10 12 there is 15-20 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.160
 reps in the approach and these weights 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.800
 enough limit for this 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.540
 the number of times due to this 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.519
 training method base exchange 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.160
 accelerated that is a man who 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.640
 raises glands at night burns more 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.290
 energy than a man who runs 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.940
 understand yes 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.890
 who is the man who runs burns 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.870
 energy in the process but not at night man 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.430
 which raises the glands burns less 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.920
 energy training process but 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.900
 keeps burning and and shorter at night 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.120
 We care about the basic exchange guys always 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.300
 the more energy we burn the better 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.090
 but here while we are here to theorize our 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.400
 the dish is ready and here it is a happy moment 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.120
 here it is a delicacy and so 300 grams 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.940
 chicken fillet 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.310
 it means about 60 grams of protein 4 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.750
 egg whites are 16 more that is 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.580
 seventy six grams of protein 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.050
 almost zero carbs it can 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.440
 take by yourself and 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.480
 it can naturally be eaten now 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.140
 try legs I still have to questions 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.590
 have time to answer 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:16.740
 you have to eat it you need to eat 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.420
 not that I already knew, and so you asked 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.340
 me about salt then you say denis you 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.990
 do not salt anything at all then denis guide 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.690
 you salt a lot give them explain 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.550
 about salt salt as such there is nothing 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.320
 harmful question in its quantity 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.270
 Naturally, this is primarily sodium 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.430
 which is necessary for human 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.900
 the body as an electrolyte potassium and 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.030
 sodium how do u change this vital 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.800
 necessary nutritional components because 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.180
 that allow electrical impulse 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.040
 travel our nerve and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.720
 send signals to the muscles the most 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.130
 the main thing that the body will tell you if 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.630
 salt and not enough first taste 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.670
 sensations that is you will be just 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.470
 pull a little more salt with me 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.330
 there will be periods like you have noticed 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.130
 won that is when you i can nothing 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.690
 do not salt sometimes I just want to 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.310
 this fresh fresh cucumber fucking 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.110
 salt and this this this kayfovo 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.910
 really salt a little delay 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.920
 water guys water retention is not a problem 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.510
 This is the problem of the day. Another important question. 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.760
 when we are with you in the last issue 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.950
 talked about the amount of carbohydrates per day 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.720
 yes I cooked buckwheat I cooked oatmeal 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.950
 drunk talked about squirrels that moment because 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.740
 that it was about carbohydrates 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.200
 naturally on top of these carbohydrates will 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.390
 still added and 200 grams bang my 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.190
 case because i see now this one 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.440
 kilogram now was still interesting 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.390
 question on training days and beyond 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.960
 training days can vary 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:30.420
 and vary human nutrition yes she 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.580
 may be different on days when you are not 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.960
 train you can lower a little 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.790
 protein intake again 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.800
 this is my experience for sure many of you with 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.440
 By this argue I feel that in days 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.080
 I rest I can eat not say no 2 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.700
 grams there 175 that is a place 200 grams with 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.650
 there is one hundred seventy eighty five 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.350
 the body is normally recovering but 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:52.650
 on training days I try to make it 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.420
 this balance at night when the body fails 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.920
 so let's say gains and losses to squirrel 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.200
 there was enough for all 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.190
 damage recovered but here guys 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.170
 I have been too long today for me 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.180
 my your time thank you so much for 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.490
 what are you watching my releases me your prices 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.170
 comments to me the price of your criticism prices 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.700
 your praise is natural so 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.700
 will meet in a week bye
