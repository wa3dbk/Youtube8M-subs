video we're going to go over why we are

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.760 
video we're going to go over why we are
fat<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> things<00:00:37.320> they're<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.649> least

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
fat some of the things they're at least

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.490 
fat some of the things they're at least
the<00:00:38.550> reasons<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> should<00:00:40.200> have<00:00:40.290> probably

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the reasons the I should have probably

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.619 
the reasons the I should have probably
called<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.700> myths<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:43.170> why<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.340> fat

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
called this myths about why we're fat

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.970 
called this myths about why we're fat
because<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.559> some<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> things

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
videos later on but the thyroid can

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
videos later on but the thyroid can
control<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.250> weight

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
control you know a lot of the weight

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
control you know a lot of the weight
loss<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:11.939> weight<00:01:12.330> gain<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.869> people

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
loss and weight gain that people

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
loss and weight gain that people
experience<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> reason<00:01:14.310> why<00:01:14.640> some

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
experience this is the reason why some

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.620 
experience this is the reason why some
people<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.049> able<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.610> eat<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> lot<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.970> food<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
people are able to eat a lot of food and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
people are able to eat a lot of food and
some<00:01:18.840> people<00:01:19.110> seem<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.590> eat<00:01:19.770> much<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
still get to have the weight added to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070 
still get to have the weight added to
them<00:01:23.070> bad<00:01:23.580> genetics<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.450> another<00:01:24.780> thing<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
them bad genetics is another thing that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
them bad genetics is another thing that
a<00:01:25.290> lot<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.560> people<00:01:25.710> bring<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.640> if
