padding<00:00:24.990> around<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.289> heel<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> better<00:00:26.430> fit

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
padding around the heel for a better fit

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.800 
padding around the heel for a better fit
so<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.119> won't<00:00:27.330> slide<00:00:28.140> around<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:30.510> studs

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
so it won't slide around and the studs

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.150 
so it won't slide around and the studs
are<00:00:31.019> different<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:31.920> they

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
are different as you can see there they

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.330 
are different as you can see there they
have<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> different<00:00:32.759> cut<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.649> and<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:35.190> have

the little bump for the my coach the
thing<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.059> found<00:00:39.270> interesting<00:00:39.950> is<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
thing I found interesting is that it

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.040 
thing I found interesting is that it
only<00:00:41.879> goes<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.719> shoe<00:00:47.180> see<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.780> can't

really see that but as you can see there

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
really see that but as you can see there
there's<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.350> cut<00:00:52.620> fret<00:00:52.920> that's<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> left
