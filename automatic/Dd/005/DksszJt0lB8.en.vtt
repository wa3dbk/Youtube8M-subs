or if you just got some string lying
around<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.629> might<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.899> well<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.469> some

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
around you might as well just make some

around you might as well just make some
yourself<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:51.390> simple<00:00:51.690> net

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
yourself this is one very simple net

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.569 
yourself this is one very simple net
which<00:00:52.140> I've<00:00:52.289> created<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.460> myself

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
which I've created right for myself

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.260 
which I've created right for myself
using<00:00:54.120> very<00:00:54.449> basic<00:00:54.510> techniques<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.149> you<00:00:57.149> know

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
using very basic techniques and you know

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.580 
using very basic techniques and you know
it<00:00:57.329> doesn't<00:00:57.480> take<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.899> much<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.469> way

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it doesn't take all that much in a way

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.500 
it doesn't take all that much in a way
of<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.039> intelligence<00:00:59.760> or<00:00:59.879> imagination

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
of you know intelligence or imagination

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
of you know intelligence or imagination
to<00:01:00.629> work<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:01.079> basically<00:01:01.530> how<00:01:01.680> I've<00:01:01.829> done<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
to work out basically how I've done this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.570 
to work out basically how I've done this
you<00:01:02.520> know<00:01:02.550> I've<00:01:03.449> taken<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:03.960> long<00:01:04.229> piece

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
you know I've taken one long piece

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.190 
you know I've taken one long piece
you've<00:01:05.580> got<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> series<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.890> larks<00:01:07.890> head<00:01:07.979> knot

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
you've got a series of larks head knot

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
you've got a series of larks head knot
where<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.380> two<00:01:10.860> bits<00:01:11.130> coming<00:01:11.460> down<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
where with two bits coming down and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
where with two bits coming down and
basically<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.840> start<00:01:13.080> tying<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.590> between

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
basically just start tying them between

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
basically just start tying them between
and<00:01:14.189> barrel<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:15.450> alright

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and barrel and going as you go alright

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.030 
and barrel and going as you go alright
and<00:01:17.180> from<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.470> doesn't<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.560> doesn't<00:01:19.740> take

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and from that doesn't it doesn't take

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
and from that doesn't it doesn't take
all<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.220> much<00:01:20.549> time<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.119> therefore<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> very

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
all that much time and therefore a very

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
all that much time and therefore a very
simple<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.560> basic<00:01:22.619> form<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.670> square<00:01:24.000> net<00:01:24.330> can

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
simple very basic form of square net can

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.260 
simple very basic form of square net can
be<00:01:24.570> created<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.970> was<00:01:27.150> just

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
be created now with this one I was just

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
be created now with this one I was just
looping<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.990> piece<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.220> string<00:01:29.670> over

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
looping a piece of you know string over

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.080 
looping a piece of you know string over
the<00:01:29.970> top<00:01:30.350> put<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.560> locs<00:01:32.100> head<00:01:32.340> knot<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the top put my locs head knot there and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.569 
the top put my locs head knot there and
then<00:01:33.900> hanging<00:01:34.170> them<00:01:34.380> down<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.369> do<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
then hanging them down but you can do it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.429 
then hanging them down but you can do it
another<00:01:35.790> way<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> piece<00:01:37.290> of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
another way you can take a piece of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.109 
another way you can take a piece of
string<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.829> along<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.460> piece<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.909> twine

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
string going along a piece of twine

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.840 
string going along a piece of twine
whatever<00:01:39.479> you've<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.369> do

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
whatever you've got then go up and do

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
whatever you've got then go up and do
your<00:01:42.060> larks<00:01:42.450> head<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.990> make<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> downward

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
your larks head they make a downward

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
your larks head they make a downward
loop<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.549> another<00:01:44.909> larks<00:01:45.360> head

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
loop and then up another larks head

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.899 
loop and then up another larks head
another<00:01:46.350> downward<00:01:46.649> loop<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.340> another<00:01:47.640> locks

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
another downward loop up another locks

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
another downward loop up another locks
it<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.270> carry<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.470> you've<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.920> long

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
it and carry on so you've got one long

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.969 
it and carry on so you've got one long
piece<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:51.149> lots<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.020> shapes<00:01:52.350> underneath

piece with lots of you shapes underneath
and<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> then<00:01:54.799> fasten<00:01:55.799> onto<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.490> use

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and you can then fasten onto the use

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
and you can then fasten onto the use
shapes<00:01:56.909> whatever<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.960> need<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
shapes whatever you need now for that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.679

my<00:03:29.520> flat<00:03:29.760> funnily<00:03:30.120> enough<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.810> very<00:03:31.110> one

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
my flat funnily enough not this very one

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.470 
my flat funnily enough not this very one
NIT<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.860> was<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.370> trial<00:03:33.150> run<00:03:34.130> but<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
NIT that was just a trial run but I

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.700 
NIT that was just a trial run but I
think<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.570> would<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.750> quite<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.020> cheap<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.620> an

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
think it would be quite a cheap and an

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.010 
think it would be quite a cheap and an
easy<00:03:37.950> method<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:38.550> me<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.240> get<00:03:39.420> myself<00:03:39.630> a

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
easy method for me to get myself a

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.660 
easy method for me to get myself a
couple<00:03:40.320> more<00:03:40.470> balls<00:03:40.740> of<00:03:40.950> string<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:42.050> create<00:03:43.050> a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
couple more balls of string I create a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.480 
couple more balls of string I create a
good-sized<00:03:44.670> net<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.770> then<00:03:46.770> string<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.280> up

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
good-sized net and then string that up

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.770 
good-sized net and then string that up
at<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.700> top<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.000> my<00:03:48.090> stairwell

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
at the top of my stairwell

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.950 
at the top of my stairwell
and<00:03:48.870> cover<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.590> with<00:03:50.450> either<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.840> know

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
and cover that with either you know

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.200 
and cover that with either you know
blankets<00:03:52.590> or<00:03:52.890> anything<00:03:53.130> else<00:03:53.550> which<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.030> can

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
blankets or anything else which I can

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.870 
blankets or anything else which I can
then<00:03:54.360> sew<00:03:54.660> onto<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.380> fabric<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.010> net<00:03:56.250> and

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
then sew onto the fabric of the net and

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.400 
then sew onto the fabric of the net and
using<00:03:57.270> that<00:03:57.360> itself<00:03:57.750> as<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.960> means<00:03:58.200> of

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
using that itself as a means of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.200 
using that itself as a means of
supporting<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.160> whole<00:03:59.310> thing<00:03:59.580> without

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
supporting the whole thing without

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.620 
supporting the whole thing without
tearing<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.870> fabric<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:03.180> the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
tearing the fabric of the of the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.800 
tearing the fabric of the of the
blankets<00:04:04.020> themselves<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.800> us<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.780> create<00:04:06.780> a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
blankets themselves and us to create a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.960 
blankets themselves and us to create a
lid<00:04:07.140> basically<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.710> my<00:04:07.770> downstairs<00:04:08.160> area<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:08.910> I

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
lid basically on my downstairs area so I

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.670 
lid basically on my downstairs area so I
can<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.210> heat<00:04:09.390> my<00:04:09.540> downstairs<00:04:09.840> area<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.590> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
can just heat my downstairs area in the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.760 
can just heat my downstairs area in the
winter<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.220> then<00:04:12.209> remove<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.200> netting<00:04:13.620> and

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
winter and then remove the netting and

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.830 
winter and then remove the netting and
blankets<00:04:14.310> assembly<00:04:14.850> on<00:04:14.970> top<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:18.030> allow<00:04:18.330> the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
blankets assembly on top to allow the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.900 
blankets assembly on top to allow the
the<00:04:18.870> warm<00:04:19.530> air<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.890> then<00:04:20.040> go<00:04:20.190> upstairs<00:04:20.640> so

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
the warm air to then go upstairs so

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.760 
the warm air to then go upstairs so
basically<00:04:21.270> grace<00:04:21.540> before<00:04:21.720> ceiling<00:04:22.470> effect

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
basically grace before ceiling effect

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.719 
basically grace before ceiling effect
really<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:24.410> with<00:04:25.410> string<00:04:25.979> rather<00:04:26.310> than<00:04:26.520> just

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
really and with string rather than just

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.710 
really and with string rather than just
taking<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.360> know

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
taking you know

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.500 
taking you know
blankets<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.440> cutting<00:04:29.340> holes<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.700> them<00:04:29.910> would

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
blankets and cutting holes in them would

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.130 
blankets and cutting holes in them would
actually<00:04:30.540> make<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.020> much<00:04:31.290> stronger<00:04:31.680> structure

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
actually make a much stronger structure

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.810 
actually make a much stronger structure
for<00:04:34.140> me<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.380> hang<00:04:34.560> this<00:04:34.710> on<00:04:34.890> especially<00:04:35.580> if<00:04:35.670> I

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
for me to hang this on especially if I

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.730 
for me to hang this on especially if I
want<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.240> last<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.930> long<00:04:37.080> period<00:04:37.470> of<00:04:37.500> time

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
want it to last a long period of time

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.210 
want it to last a long period of time
rather<00:04:38.490> than<00:04:38.700> just<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.090> be<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.240> short-term

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
rather than just to be a short-term

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.090 
rather than just to be a short-term
measure<00:04:41.220> so<00:04:41.760> with<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.750> help<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:43.080> string<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.010> a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
measure so with the help of string and a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.550 
measure so with the help of string and a
pair<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.340> scissors<00:04:45.170> basically<00:04:46.170> you<00:04:46.290> know<00:04:46.440> I'll

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
pair of scissors basically you know I'll

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.740 
pair of scissors basically you know I'll
have<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:46.770> little<00:04:47.010> bit<00:04:47.160> more<00:04:47.400> insulation<00:04:48.060> as<00:04:48.240> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
have a little bit more insulation as the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.420 
have a little bit more insulation as the
winter<00:04:49.260> comes<00:04:49.470> down<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.070> have<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> phones

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
winter comes down so I have a phones

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.240 
winter comes down so I have a phones
ring<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:50.760> sweet<00:04:50.910> usage
