you Mongols even though the Mongols were

you Mongols even though the Mongols were
the<00:03:40.700> exception<00:03:41.300> to<00:03:41.480> many<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.960> major

the exception to many of the major

the exception to many of the major

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
trends in world history in this case

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.120 
trends in world history in this case
they<00:03:44.420> were<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.870> rule<00:03:45.110> using<00:03:45.980> their

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
they were the rule using their

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.890 
they were the rule using their

innovations in warfare and making the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.810 
innovations in warfare and making the
most<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.380> their<00:03:48.500> geography<00:03:49.130> they<00:03:49.310> pillaged

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
most of their geography they pillaged

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:50.890 
most of their geography they pillaged
their<00:03:50.030> way<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.240> becoming<00:03:50.420> one<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> most

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
their way to becoming one of the most

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.260 
their way to becoming one of the most
influential<00:03:51.740> cultures<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.460> Eurasia<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.150> it

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
influential cultures in Eurasia so it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.000 
influential cultures in Eurasia so it
looks<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:53.630> history<00:03:54.170> isn't<00:03:54.500> just<00:03:54.740> a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
looks like history isn't just a

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.620 
looks like history isn't just a
collection<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.520> random<00:03:55.700> events<00:03:56.180> after<00:03:56.450> all

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
collection of random events after all

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.170 
collection of random events after all
there<00:03:57.140> are<00:03:57.350> larger<00:03:57.860> mechanisms<00:03:58.460> at<00:03:58.640> work<00:03:58.670> and

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
there are larger mechanisms at work and

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.340 
there are larger mechanisms at work and
the<00:03:59.420> better<00:03:59.570> we<00:03:59.720> understand<00:04:00.230> these

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
the better we understand these

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.090 
the better we understand these
mechanisms

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
mechanisms

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.040 
mechanisms
maybe<00:04:01.430> we'll<00:04:01.730> be<00:04:01.850> better<00:04:02.060> at<00:04:02.360> shaping<00:04:02.930> our

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
maybe we'll be better at shaping our

maybe we'll be better at shaping our
