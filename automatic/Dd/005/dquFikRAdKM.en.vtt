cave area over here I haven't been down
here<00:03:35.850> in<00:03:36.030> ages<00:03:36.300> what's<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.170> know<00:03:37.680> there's<00:03:37.920> a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
here in ages what's I know there's a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.590 
here in ages what's I know there's a
crafting<00:03:38.400> table<00:03:38.430> here<00:03:38.820> somewhere<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.360> maybe

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
crafting table here somewhere so maybe

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.080 
crafting table here somewhere so maybe
if<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.080> find<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.440> lucky<00:03:40.740> chest<00:03:41.040> we'll<00:03:41.940> be

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
if I can find a lucky chest we'll be

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.360 
if I can find a lucky chest we'll be
able<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.360> get<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:43.020> ingot<00:03:43.620> from<00:03:43.860> somewhere

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
able to get a ingot from somewhere

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
able to get a ingot from somewhere
hopefully<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.570> what<00:03:45.720> I'm<00:03:45.810> hoping<00:03:46.050> for

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
hopefully that is what I'm hoping for

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.560 
hopefully that is what I'm hoping for
come<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.830> where<00:03:47.130> do<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:47.520> this<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.360> place

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
come on where do I go this is this place

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.530 
come on where do I go this is this place
is<00:03:48.720> confusing<00:03:49.410> what<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.740> heck<00:03:50.180> no<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.209> think

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
is confusing what the heck no I think

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.120 
is confusing what the heck no I think
this<00:03:51.750> has<00:03:51.900> already<00:03:52.020> been<00:03:52.200> looted<00:03:52.680> actually

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
this has already been looted actually

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.800 
this has already been looted actually
that's<00:03:53.760> probably<00:03:53.880> why<00:03:54.120> there's<00:03:54.330> nothing<00:03:54.510> in

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
that's probably why there's nothing in

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.130 
that's probably why there's nothing in
these<00:03:54.930> chests<00:03:55.410> where's<00:03:55.650> all<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.070> chests<00:03:56.430> guys

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
these chests where's all the chests guys

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.780 
these chests where's all the chests guys
check<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.350> every<00:03:58.470> corner<00:03:58.980> here's<00:03:59.730> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
check in like every corner here's the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.920 
check in like every corner here's the
room<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.240> was<00:04:00.360> talking<00:04:00.480> about<00:04:00.750> with<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
room that I was talking about with the
