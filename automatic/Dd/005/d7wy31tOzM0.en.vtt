00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the other guy just walks up and picks it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.800 
the other guy just walks up and picks it
up<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> shoot<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> at<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> fairly

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
up now you want to shoot it at a fairly

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
up now you want to shoot it at a fairly
slow<00:01:07.140> rate<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.610> he

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
slow rate as you can see right here he

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.719 
slow rate as you can see right here he
picks<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.540> about<00:01:09.780> two<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> three<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.430> rate

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
picks up about two to three at this rate

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.149 
picks up about two to three at this rate
and<00:01:12.260> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> over<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.860> over<00:01:13.979> again

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and you can do that over and over again

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.520 
and you can do that over and over again
but<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> only<00:01:14.640> problem<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.540> ammo<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
but the only problem is this ammo is so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
but the only problem is this ammo is so
scarce<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.340> might<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.850> switch<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
scarce that you might have to switch to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.630 
scarce that you might have to switch to
the<00:01:19.049> auto<00:01:19.200> effort<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> auto<00:01:20.130> rifle

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the auto effort now with the auto rifle

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.780 
the auto effort now with the auto rifle
you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.130> give<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.490> take

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you know it's you know give or take

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.660 
you know it's you know give or take
sometimes<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> works<00:01:24.750> sometimes<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.259> doesn't

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
but<00:01:26.670> usually<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.750> works<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.770> see

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
but usually it works now as you can see

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.539 
but usually it works now as you can see
we<00:01:29.280> probably<00:01:29.820> copy<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.509> six<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.170> seven<00:01:31.710> auto

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
we probably copy like six or seven auto

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.109 
we probably copy like six or seven auto
rifles<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:34.079> time<00:01:34.350> span<00:01:34.700> now<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> want
