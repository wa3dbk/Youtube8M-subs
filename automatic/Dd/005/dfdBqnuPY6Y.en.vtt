ginger root and you kind of break it a
little<00:02:19.400> bit<00:02:19.519> but<00:02:19.790> squeeze<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.870> between<00:02:21.140> your

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
going to work it along my edge line um

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.780 
going to work it along my edge line um
another<00:02:33.230> way<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.069> actually<00:02:34.280> take

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
another way to do it is to actually take

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.320 
another way to do it is to actually take
a<00:02:35.000> piece<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.780> you've<00:02:35.989> cut<00:02:36.380> off<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.799> just

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
a piece that you've cut off and just

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.910 
a piece that you've cut off and just
gently<00:02:38.330> rub<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.959> into<00:02:39.530> your<00:02:40.400> edges<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.660> your

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
gently rub that into your edges on your

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.150 
gently rub that into your edges on your
scalp<00:02:43.810> now<00:02:44.810> if<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.049> choose<00:02:45.349> this<00:02:45.680> method

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
scalp now if you choose this method

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.039 
scalp now if you choose this method
you'll<00:02:46.760> notice<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.390> might<00:02:47.569> get<00:02:47.780> little

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
you'll notice that you might get little

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.930 
you'll notice that you might get little
pieces<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.769> strings<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.700> root

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
pieces of the strings and the root

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.120 
pieces of the strings and the root
actually<00:02:50.269> in<00:02:50.750> your<00:02:50.930> hair<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.829> can<00:02:51.860> actually

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
actually in your hair you can actually

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.759 
actually in your hair you can actually
brush<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.670> out<00:02:52.790> pretty<00:02:52.970> easily<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.769> would

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
brush it out pretty easily I would

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.430 
brush it out pretty easily I would
recommend<00:02:55.430> maybe<00:02:56.030> doing<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.480> test<00:02:56.810> patch<00:02:57.079> of

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
recommend maybe doing a test patch of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.850 
recommend maybe doing a test patch of
your<00:02:57.799> hair<00:02:58.040> before<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.549> go<00:02:58.910> all<00:02:59.180> crazy<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.110> do

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
your hair before you go all crazy and do

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.610 
your hair before you go all crazy and do
the<00:03:00.980> whole<00:03:01.160> thing<00:03:01.190> because<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:03.110> could<00:03:03.500> be

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
the whole thing because you could be

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.309 
the whole thing because you could be
allergic<00:03:03.829> to<00:03:04.069> it<00:03:04.220> or<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:05.780> could<00:03:05.959> just<00:03:06.019> have<00:03:06.200> a

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
allergic to it or you could just have a

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.589 
allergic to it or you could just have a
negative<00:03:06.560> reaction<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.519> maybe<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:08.060> test<00:03:08.450> a

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
negative reaction so maybe just test a

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.660 
negative reaction so maybe just test a
little<00:03:08.810> area<00:03:09.200> maybe<00:03:09.890> even<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.459> do<00:03:10.579> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
little area maybe even just like do it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.850 
little area maybe even just like do it
on<00:03:10.760> your<00:03:10.849> arm<00:03:11.060> or<00:03:11.269> something<00:03:11.530> before<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.650> put

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
on your arm or something before you put

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.580 
on your arm or something before you put
it<00:03:12.980> all<00:03:13.160> over<00:03:13.190> your<00:03:13.519> scalp<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.200> make<00:03:15.380> sure

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590

that you know your skin will be

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.390 
that you know your skin will be
irritated<00:03:18.769> by<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.750> maybe<00:03:20.750> wait<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:22.220> an

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
irritated by it and maybe wait like an

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.129 
irritated by it and maybe wait like an
hour<00:03:22.579> or<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.329> if<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.630> don't<00:03:23.780> see<00:03:23.959> any

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139

hour or so and if you don't see any
negative<00:03:24.530> side<00:03:25.430> effects<00:03:25.730> then<00:03:25.970> go<00:03:26.389> ahead<00:03:26.569> and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
negative side effects then go ahead and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.370 
negative side effects then go ahead and
use<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:29.120> I'm<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.389> just<00:03:29.540> keep<00:03:29.780> taking
