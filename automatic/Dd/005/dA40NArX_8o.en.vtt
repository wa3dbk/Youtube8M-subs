00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
unset up it's just learning to chain

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.190 
unset up it's just learning to chain
those<00:01:29.950> four<00:01:30.310> capture<00:01:31.030> positions<00:01:31.510> together

those four capture positions together

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.109 
those four capture positions together
that's<00:01:33.010> where<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.220> lot<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.610> effective

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
that's where a lot of the effective

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.969 
that's where a lot of the effective
damage<00:01:34.450> can<00:01:34.659> be<00:01:34.689> done<00:01:34.780> in<00:01:35.080> takedowns<00:01:35.530> because

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
damage can be done in takedowns because

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.859 
damage can be done in takedowns because
if<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.790> can<00:01:36.939> switch<00:01:37.210> from<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.750> another

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
if you can switch from one to another

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.130 
if you can switch from one to another
it's<00:01:38.500> very<00:01:38.619> difficult<00:01:38.860> for<00:01:39.100> your<00:01:39.220> opponent<00:01:39.490> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's very difficult for your opponent to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's very difficult for your opponent to
counteract<00:01:41.140> those<00:01:41.260> fast<00:01:41.650> enough<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.130> fit

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
counteract those fast enough and fit

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.719 
counteract those fast enough and fit
quick<00:01:43.330> enough<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:43.750> defend<00:01:44.020> all<00:01:44.260> of<00:01:44.380> them<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
quick enough to defend all of them the

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.399 
quick enough to defend all of them the
beginning<00:01:46.360> point<00:01:46.570> I'd<00:01:46.720> recommend<00:01:47.020> for<00:01:47.290> this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
beginning point I'd recommend for this

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.420 
beginning point I'd recommend for this
just<00:01:47.560> why<00:01:47.740> you're<00:01:47.860> getting<00:01:47.950> used<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.310> it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
just why you're getting used to it

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.730 
just why you're getting used to it
whether<00:01:48.670> suddenly<00:01:49.180> isn't<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.570> fixed<00:01:50.170> way<00:01:50.560> that

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
whether suddenly isn't a fixed way that

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.990 
whether suddenly isn't a fixed way that
you<00:01:50.799> have<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.040> go<00:01:51.130> through<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.640> with<00:01:51.820> your

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
you have to go through this is with your

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.820 
you have to go through this is with your
double<00:01:52.570> hit<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:53.200> if<00:01:53.259> you're<00:01:53.380> starting<00:01:53.740> in

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
double hit so if you're starting in

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.880 
double hit so if you're starting in
front<00:01:54.100> we're<00:01:54.340> double<00:01:54.759> hit<00:01:54.880> position<00:01:55.060> or<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
front we're double hit position or the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.820 
front we're double hit position or the
is<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.310> from<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.720> big<00:01:58.530> level

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
is going to be from up a big level

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.140 
is going to be from up a big level
changed<00:01:59.190> positions<00:01:59.729> you're<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> be

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
changed positions you're going to be
