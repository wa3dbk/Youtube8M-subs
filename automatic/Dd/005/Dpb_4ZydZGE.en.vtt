00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you can see it's gonna look like a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:11.320 
you can see it's gonna look like a
little<00:01:00.870> curvy<00:01:01.440> lava<00:01:01.800> lamp<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.460> something

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.480 

you're<00:01:11.900> gonna<00:01:12.050> cut<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.650> pattern<00:01:12.980> out<00:01:13.070> twice

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
you're gonna cut the pattern out twice

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.880 
you're gonna cut the pattern out twice
on<00:01:13.790> folded<00:01:14.300> fabric<00:01:14.510> so<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.260> have<00:01:15.470> two

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
on folded fabric so that you have two

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950 
on folded fabric so that you have two
pieces<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:16.640> were<00:01:16.940> cut<00:01:17.150> on<00:01:17.270> fold<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:17.810> they're

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
pieces that were cut on fold so they're

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.130 
pieces that were cut on fold so they're
perfectly<00:01:18.350> symmetrical<00:01:19.510> and<00:01:20.510> then<00:01:20.960> you're

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
perfectly symmetrical and then you're

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.980

done

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.600 

then<00:01:26.990> you're<00:01:27.200> gonna<00:01:27.320> place<00:01:27.560> them<00:01:27.950> right<00:01:28.220> sides

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
then you're gonna place them right sides

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.330 
then you're gonna place them right sides
together<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.360> like<00:01:30.080> sew<00:01:30.470> them<00:01:30.710> down<00:01:30.740> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
together and like sew them down the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.260 
together and like sew them down the
length<00:01:31.550> of<00:01:31.790> them<00:01:33.730> then<00:01:34.730> you're<00:01:34.910> gonna<00:01:35.000> make<00:01:35.240> a

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
length of them then you're gonna make a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.360 
length of them then you're gonna make a
beautiful<00:01:35.510> diagonal<00:01:36.290> line<00:01:36.470> with<00:01:36.710> chalk<00:01:37.070> or

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
to cut that so that I can be asymmetric

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.710 
to cut that so that I can be asymmetric
you<00:01:43.700> don't<00:01:43.850> have<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.120> do<00:01:44.210> this<00:01:44.330> it<00:01:44.510> can<00:01:44.600> be<00:01:44.690> a
