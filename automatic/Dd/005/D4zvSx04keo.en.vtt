00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello everyone here I'm doing a 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.139
 second tutorial video on my little finger 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.759
 I understood that 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.139
 some of you were struggling to 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.299
 do evil watch out by trying to 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.030
 reproduce the zipper decoration so 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.990
 I'm doing a little a little video for 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.990
 show you a bit of that 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.730
 so just start by asking 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.130
 my nail polish then either you put two 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.230
 layers of polish mostly English 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.970
 after you do half of the nail 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.710
 of another color one of the limits with 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.840
 tape if you get by 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.520
 with your brush you get to do 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.989
 half a varnish of one color and 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.700
 the other end a language half of a 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.830
 color and the other half of the angle of 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.170
 the other color is as you want 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.280
 that does not cause any problem for the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.830
 following whatever the method that 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.160
 you chose me I used the 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.780
 revlon silver dollar for a half is 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.650
 of ultra violet colorama then me 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.150
 ask why they are called 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.550
 ultra violet because it is pink but 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.659
 finally it's like that a word or nothing they 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.820
 always have trouble choosing names 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.760
 for wehrli a multi services game of 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.080
 these two varnish lagarde and keep them 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.909
 has available because you go in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.850
 need for the next 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.409
 events so I have my two nail 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.630
 colors like that so good I I them 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.760
 do in half vertical but you 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.100
 can do the shapes you want 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.930
 huh there is no problem so I 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.290
 take my nail polish that I used so 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.119
 here here the rose I drop a drop on 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 a palette me it's my palette was 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.479
 usually it's a piece of paper 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.520
 and I take one of outines toul 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.020
 if possible roughly like that you'll have 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.469
 fewer points to make and it will be more 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.840
 easy 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.350
 I tremble of hosts into the 2-1 and I 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.659
 do the weights on the gray side and I 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.899
 spaces enough to have room for 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.930
 put the weights of the other color there 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.910
 and there 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.630
 here I am managing to make sure 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.100
 that peas touch the line of the other 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.470
 side 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.650
 here it is all I clean my back 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.830
 tindall and now I'm doing the same 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:15.120
 with the dream of their choice I put a drop 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.510
 on my sheet of paper I dip everything 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.310
 simply mundo timpul in and there I 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:27.530
 am going to make peas if you follow well 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.530
 on the pink side touching 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.819
 the line if possible the delimitation 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:43.480
 between the two of you here and the last one 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:46.549
 here is so see it's pretty easy 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.219
 it's done then here we still see the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.840
 that I did it guess what I did 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.790
 weights but once the top coat 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.680
 will be put that will melt the different 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.939
 thicknesses of two colors 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.969
 a trail if ever she only trick in 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.419
 done it 's spaced every weight here 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.699
 the two pink peas are spaced apart 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.680
 the size of the future gray pea because 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:12.469
 if you spaces and - tomorrow it will be 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.389
 it will work it will just do a little more 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.219
 shapes more convoluted but if you 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.989
 the past is passed by donation 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.370
 more like it's like with the last 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.139
 point that I voluntarily did more 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.480
 the shadow see it makes a little 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.510
 setback at this level there nothing good 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.840
 naughty you pick up your ball from the back 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.909
 team toul and you fall back crawling into the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.620
 polish to enlarge the shape but good 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.349
 if you want something regular 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.349
 it's better to space them roughly 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.819
 make sure that at the empty space 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.209
 between the two represent the thickness 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.489
 of the future balls of the other color 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.709
 that's just a loan you're left 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.609
 more than put your top coat and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.189
 It's in the bag 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.259
 here is I hope this little tutorial 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.909
 you will have more than that will help you and 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:02.500
 then well I told you perhaps soon 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.500
 for a future goodbye tutorial
