been<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> little<00:03:08.299> kid<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.810> watching<00:03:09.140> my

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
been a little kid and just watching my

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.259 
been a little kid and just watching my
dad<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.950> know<00:03:09.980> draw<00:03:10.250> these<00:03:10.430> figures<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.090> just
