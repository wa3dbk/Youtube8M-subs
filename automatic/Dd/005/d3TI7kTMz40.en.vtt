00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
to start em as opposed to starting at

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.450 
to start em as opposed to starting at
the<00:00:12.420> beginning<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> video<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.530> there<00:00:14.280> is

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
a way to do that actually when you embed

gives<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.800> embed<00:00:20.250> code<00:00:20.279> into<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.060> looks

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
gives you this embed code into it looks

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.620 
gives you this embed code into it looks
like<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.769> you've<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.939> an<00:00:24.090> iframe

back<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.570> code<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.110> I'll<00:01:31.290> add

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
back here to this code and I'll add

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
back here to this code and I'll add
another<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.479> another

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
code called autoplay and then I'm going

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.980 
code called autoplay and then I'm going
to<00:01:36.479> set<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> 1<00:01:37.409> which<00:01:37.860> means<00:01:38.100> turn<00:01:38.670> on

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
to set this to 1 which means turn on

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.130 
to set this to 1 which means turn on
autoplay<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.490> start<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> video<00:01:41.729> 20<00:01:42.689> seconds
