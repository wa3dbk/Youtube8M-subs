00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.310 
amount of disability so Oh in the same a
lot<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.590> frame<00:02:19.890> range<00:02:20.100> cuz<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.610> think<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:22.200> would

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
lot of frame range cuz I think you would

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.479 
lot of frame range cuz I think you would
think<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.709> game<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.100> straight<00:02:23.400> up

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
think in the game like the straight up

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.470 
think in the game like the straight up
it's<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.670> different<00:02:24.510> wow<00:02:25.520> wow<00:02:26.520> that's<00:02:27.270> like
