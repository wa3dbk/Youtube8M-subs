00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.770
 the main causes of 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.350
 are fungi and nematodes 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.020
 in this video we will show how it should be 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.050
 management of diseases caused by 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.430
 fungi that cause a lot of damage to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.430
 coffee trees in rondônia 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.290
 among the diseases that have been causing 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.280
 great concern with the producer 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.829
 rural 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.030
 the coffee iron is certainly the most 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.280
 important 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.590
 this disease can cause 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.040
 ranging from 20 to 40 percent of 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.100
 final productivity is if it is not 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.739
 duly controlled by the producer 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.960
 the typical symptoms of this disease are 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.150
 appearance of orange spots on the 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.629
 the bottom of the separate sheet 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.379
 that spread throughout the 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.210
 especially on the base of part 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.549
 the lower third or with the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.799
 rural producer as he says on the 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.229
 rain and wind are the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.619
 main disseminators of the disease in the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.560
 and it attacks mainly between 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.720
 the months from November to June the control 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.680
 usually done can be made of 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.320
 two ways 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.150
 using resistant varieties 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.110
 mainly the variety of the group 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.850
 robots as well or the use of chemical control 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.469
 only we know that there is today the 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.450
 great concern about the use of control 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.070
 kim of environmental contamination of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.920
 pollution of the environment 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.619
 what is recommended for the producer himself 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.740
 financial aspect is that it does the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.450
 monitoring the crop before making 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.799
 the application make call the application 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.119
 preventive 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.570
 how do you do this in a way 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.740
 it is enough that the producer 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.310
 selects an area of ​​about 1 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.319
 hectare within that area and path 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.249
 random zig-zag shape and go 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.049
 collecting between 20 and 30 college plants 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.999
 of each plant ten leaves 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.540
 he will put these sheets together in a 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:14.080
 and will tell you how many 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.830
 leaves show symptoms of rust 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.590
 if the number of sheets he found 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.890
 let's imagine that 200 sheets and 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.230
 collect 200 sheets if two sheets 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.370
 present in these 200 symptom of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:35.030
 iron the product must enter the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.370
 chemical control using copper is oxy 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.970
 and copper apparel 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.980
 poor or other fixed cobras that are 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.030
 recommended for culture 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.220
 if the number of sheets or more than 2 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.019
 he has to immediately enter with 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 fungicides system 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.879
 in the case of triazoles for control 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.489
 eradication of the disease in the 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.569
 because from five sick leaves 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.060
 in 200 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.190
 it already begins to exceed the limit of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.680
 economic damage and will consequently 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.680
 to have damage within the crop 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.709
 the curious sercos or spot of brown oil 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.220
 can occur in both adult plants 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.740
 how and with more rigor in nurseries 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.470
 and may cause a complete choice of 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.490
 changes that become critical and do not 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.260
 they develop 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.420
 the producer must be careful with the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.700
 live this by asking for changes coming 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.480
 of suitable vinícius and certified seedlings 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.180
 with quality assurance then it is 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.030
 when it occurs in the field it causes 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.580
 lesions and reduces the quality of the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.100
 drink of the future reduce the quality of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.459
 production and may cause fruit 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.209
 it is more common to occur in the field in the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.010
 period from September to March and within 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.890
 living may occur at any time in the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.080
 year once there you have shading 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.720
 and has constant irrigation 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.030
 The most typical symptom on the leaves is 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.880
 the appearance of circular lesions 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.790
 with color variation that goes 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.170
 from light birth to dark brown 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.510
 in the fruits 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.359
 the attack occurs close to the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.359
 maturation on exposed parts of the sun
