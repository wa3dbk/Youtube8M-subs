00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.860
 and hello to all dear friends and viewers 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.320
 my swami channel again i am force 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.939
 is such to the real long gone 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.550
 tutorials here and in this part of the total 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.610
 we build with you tv he will 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.680
 so simple is that you can 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.059
 use it even on the server where you 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.980
 still here 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.489
 but for this you will need quite 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.480
 many resources and how they are there 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.809
 redstone scheme to have it all 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.970
 automatically done here but i will show in 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.850
 solitary measure in creativity so you 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.640
 understand how something is done so put 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.480
 here is such a construction 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.550
 here here so here and here we put 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.489
 so there are no two beads though like this 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.690
 let's do so let's say that's what comes next 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:02.110
 guys we put insert paste 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.390
 we insert first what let's put 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.899
 such a single block and then let's go 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.259
 alternate sand with gravel as 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:15.249
 ex over chess order y so there 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.289
 so here you can here so here 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:20.259
 I don't know now probably very loudly 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:24.159
 let me do a little quieter like that 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:28.119
 here so here then here so here then 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:31.149
 so here and how much you want so much 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.329
 blocks, and you put the more 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.630
 so better blocks you 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.649
 turn can leave the TV and the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.799
 TV will be like give on that nato 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:47.850
 till the channel any work till go 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.399
 such interferences hiss can be here and on 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.549
 such interference will be like this one 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.189
 TV this effect is not serious 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.409

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.239

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.290
