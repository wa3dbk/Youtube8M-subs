 the line of Cevennes again threatened 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.590
 linking Clermont Ferrand to Nîmes and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 marseille 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.369
 it is served almost daily 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 by two regional express trains in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.890
 each sense between clermont and nîmes then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.040
 by the mythical very tall worthy the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.150
 Cevenol in place for decades 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.010
 connecting clermont ferrand to marseille 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.170
 every summer the tourist train of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.760
 gorges of the allier allowed also to everyone 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.160
 to discover the remarkable landscapes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.160
 a unique and unusual route 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.649
 but for the Cevennes things seem 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.380
 once again drive him to the 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.009
 exit or relegation a course 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.009
 regional 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.560
 indeed the last Cévenol clermont 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.840
 marseille should circulate the 2 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.530
 next September in indifference 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.530
 the most total 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.359
 this trains of balanced territory is going 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.640
 because of work on the line being 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.219
 replaced by a bus service between 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.950
 clermont ferrand and nimes from 3 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.689
 September and until the change of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.689
 winter service is December 8 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.619
 but seven times 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.229
 he should be cut off from the service 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.850
 between Nimes and Marseille to do 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.979
 than the same route as the trains 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.640
 regional express is clermont ferrand 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.640
 in nimes 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.959
 this situation is dramatic for this 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.209
 long line train which ensures the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.819
 connections to Clermont, among others 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.650
 to the capital and thus allows for 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.890
 to cross France by conventional train 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.739
 by irrigating territories away 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.380

 it's a new blow for these 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.170
 crossed and irrigated by this
