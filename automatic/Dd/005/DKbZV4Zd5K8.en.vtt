put the pictures in 1080p using the hdmi

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.020 
put the pictures in 1080p using the hdmi
port<00:00:44.879> down<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.770> but<00:00:46.770> basically<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
port down here but basically that is the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.490 
port down here but basically that is the
main<00:00:48.210> draw<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.719> tablet<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
main draw of this tablet right this is

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
main draw of this tablet right this is
of<00:00:49.739> course<00:00:49.770> android<00:00:50.550> 3.0<00:00:50.940> honeycomb<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of course android 3.0 honeycomb and you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.880 
of course android 3.0 honeycomb and you
can<00:00:51.690> tell<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.899> by<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.170> holographic<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.860> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
can tell that by the holographic you I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
can tell that by the holographic you I
you<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:55.070> holographic<00:00:56.149> screens<00:00:57.149> kind

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you can see the holographic screens kind

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.060 
you can see the holographic screens kind
of<00:00:58.079> scrolling<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.620> there<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> blue

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
of scrolling right there the blue

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
of scrolling right there the blue
outlines<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> holographic<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.590> graphic

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
outlines are the holographic a graphic

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.759 
outlines are the holographic a graphic
feature<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> 3d<00:01:03.619> with<00:01:04.619> them

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
feature and with with the 3d with them

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.440 
feature and with with the 3d with them
falling<00:01:04.949> off<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> screen<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.760> 3d<00:01:06.060> fashion

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
falling off the screen in a 3d fashion

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
falling off the screen in a 3d fashion
that's<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.500> takes<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> lot<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.979> tweaking<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that's that takes a lot of tweaking and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.420 
that's that takes a lot of tweaking and
hardware<00:01:09.170> hardware<00:01:10.170> processing<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
hardware hardware processing and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.890 
hardware hardware processing and
speaking<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.450> actually<00:01:12.720> running

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
speaking of which it's actually running

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.130 
speaking of which it's actually running

the nvidia tegra 2 dual core processor

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
the nvidia tegra 2 dual core processor
it's<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.619> fast<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.100> gigabyte<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.610> ram

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it's so really fast one gigabyte of ram

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.940 
it's so really fast one gigabyte of ram
not<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.110> multitasking<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> you'll

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
not a lot for multitasking and you'll

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
not a lot for multitasking and you'll
notice<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> honeycomb<00:01:21.509> 3-point

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
sim card stuck right in there and you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.250 
sim card stuck right in there and you
just<00:03:36.700> get<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.090> with<00:03:37.600> this<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.080> there's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
just get to it with this and there's

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.560 
just get to it with this and there's
also<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.530> microSD<00:03:38.980> card<00:03:39.940> slot<00:03:40.000> which<00:03:40.209> allows

unfortunately I pop the sim card out so

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.140 
unfortunately I pop the sim card out so
tell<00:03:56.469> me<00:03:56.500> goodbye<00:03:56.859> and<00:03:57.310> with<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.700> that's<00:03:58.060> a
