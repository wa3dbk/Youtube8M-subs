00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
and then you should be to feel the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.250 
and then you should be to feel the
rubber<00:01:18.500> skirt<00:01:19.180> overlapping<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.479> metal<00:01:20.780> pedal

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
rubber skirt overlapping the metal pedal

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.430 
rubber skirt overlapping the metal pedal
all<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.920> way<00:01:22.250> around<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.240> that's<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:24.170> one

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
all the way around so that's that one

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.610 
all the way around so that's that one
fitted<00:01:25.090> okay<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.780> then<00:01:26.990> let's<00:01:27.260> do<00:01:27.440> this

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
fitted okay and then let's do this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.500 
fitted okay and then let's do this
second<00:01:28.100> one<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:28.970> looks<00:01:29.120> like<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:29.420> gonna

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
second one so it looks like it's gonna

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.000 
second one so it looks like it's gonna
be<00:01:29.690> easier<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.110> slot<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.409> bottom<00:01:30.860> in<00:01:30.979> first

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
be easier to slot the bottom in first

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.969 
be easier to slot the bottom in first
and<00:01:31.670> then<00:01:32.330> get<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:32.720> top<00:01:33.140> lip<00:01:33.470> over<00:01:33.830> because

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
and then get that top lip over because

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.300 
and then get that top lip over because
it<00:01:34.100> looks<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.369> little<00:01:34.490> smaller<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.750> if<00:01:35.869> I<00:01:36.310> spread

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
it looks a little smaller so if I spread

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.060 
it looks a little smaller so if I spread
the<00:01:37.520> sides<00:01:37.790> can<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.299> see<00:01:38.510> that<00:01:38.690> yeah<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.830> then

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the sides can you see that yeah and then

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.640 
the sides can you see that yeah and then
push<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:41.000> up<00:01:41.060> get<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:42.110> one<00:01:42.320> side<00:01:42.680> over<00:01:44.650> and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
push that up get that one side over and

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.070 
push that up get that one side over and
get<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.610> other<00:01:46.670> side<00:01:47.030> over<00:01:47.240> up<00:01:47.510> to<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.780> top

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
get the other side over up to the top

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.000 
get the other side over up to the top
and<00:01:48.890> that's<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.490> feel<00:01:49.790> it<00:01:50.000> click<00:01:50.840> back<00:01:51.200> and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
and that's it you feel it click back and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.620 
and that's it you feel it click back and
there<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.090> go<00:01:53.299> sports<00:01:54.020> alloy<00:01:54.740> pedals<00:01:54.979> on<00:01:55.430> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
there you go sports alloy pedals on the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.340 
there you go sports alloy pedals on the
Range<00:01:56.630> Rover<00:01:56.900> Evoque<00:01:57.140> good<00:01:58.010> luck<00:01:58.159> with<00:01:58.310> that
