detailed sound is coming from just three
microphones<00:00:42.800> one<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> reasons<00:00:44.340> why

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
microphones one of the reasons why

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
microphones one of the reasons why
earthworks<00:00:46.230> was<00:00:46.350> able<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.820> achieve<00:00:47.820> this

earthworks was able to achieve this
level<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.899> detail<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> look<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
level of detail is if you look at the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.639 
level of detail is if you look at the
capsules<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> these<00:00:51.989> microphones<00:00:52.440> they're

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
capsules of these microphones they're

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.130 
capsules of these microphones they're
absolutely<00:00:53.039> tiny<00:00:53.480> they're<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.809> just

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
absolutely tiny they're you know just

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.470 
absolutely tiny they're you know just
just<00:00:55.379> smaller<00:00:56.370> than<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:56.699> pinky<00:00:57.090> nail<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
just smaller than my pinky nail and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.139 
just smaller than my pinky nail and
because<00:00:58.079> there's<00:00:58.410> there's<00:00:58.829> such<00:00:59.160> there's<00:00:59.940> not

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
because there's there's such there's not

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
because there's there's such there's not
that<00:01:00.359> much<00:01:00.539> material<00:01:00.859> in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.280> physical

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that much material in the physical

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.910 
that much material in the physical
capsule<00:01:03.000> itself<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.570> able<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.870> reach<00:01:04.199> its

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
capsule itself it's able to reach its

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
capsule itself it's able to reach its
recovery<00:01:05.489> point<00:01:05.700> once<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> sound<00:01:06.240> wave<00:01:06.479> hits

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
recovery point once the sound wave hits

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
recovery point once the sound wave hits
it<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> response<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.040> bounces<00:01:08.430> back

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it kind of response to it bounces back

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.060 
it kind of response to it bounces back
and<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.020> responds<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:10.830> quickly

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and it's it just responds very quickly

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.090 
and it's it just responds very quickly
and<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.290> small<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and because it's so small because of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.590 
and because it's so small because of
that<00:01:14.189> quick<00:01:14.490> recovery<00:01:14.790> time<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.479> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that quick recovery time you get that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.940 
that quick recovery time you get that
added<00:01:15.810> detail<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> added

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
added detail you get to added

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
added detail you get to added
articulation<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> hear<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:18.630> those

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
articulation you can hear all those

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
articulation you can hear all those
ghost<00:01:19.350> notes<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> snare<00:01:20.700> drum<00:01:20.939> even

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
ghost notes on the snare drum even

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.230 
ghost notes on the snare drum even
though<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.900> microphone<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.970> yeah<00:01:23.970> well

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
though the microphone is just yeah well

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.570 
though the microphone is just yeah well
it's<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.110> couple<00:01:25.530> feet<00:01:25.680> away<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's it's a couple feet away it's you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.310 
it's it's a couple feet away it's you
know<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.450> provides<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.900> level<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
know it's it provides that level of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
know it's it provides that level of
detail<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.829> articulation<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
detail in that articulation that you

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.920 
detail in that articulation that you
would<00:01:29.850> expect<00:01:30.150> from<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:31.340> pencil<00:01:32.340> mic<00:01:32.759> place<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
would expect from a pencil mic place you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
would expect from a pencil mic place you
know<00:01:34.020> inches<00:01:34.439> away<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.220> center<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
know inches away from the center of the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:02:55.970 
know inches away from the center of the
snare<00:01:35.939> drum

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.160 

one<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.130> really<00:02:57.490> cool<00:02:57.790> features<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.900> just

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
one of the really cool features are just

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.710 
one of the really cool features are just
overall<00:02:59.830> aesthetics<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.520> these<00:03:00.670> mics<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.180> how

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
overall aesthetics of these mics is how

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.770 
overall aesthetics of these mics is how
clean<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.440> how<00:03:02.770> natural<00:03:03.250> they<00:03:03.370> are<00:03:03.780> which

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
specific production style it's a really

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.690 
specific production style it's a really
fantastic<00:03:19.270> set<00:03:19.930> for<00:03:20.400> someone<00:03:21.400> who's<00:03:21.520> looking

but it's not looking to sacrifice at all
and<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.770> quality

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.520 

so<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.180> really<00:03:54.810> think<00:03:54.989> our<00:03:55.079> earth<00:03:55.140> works<00:03:55.349> did<00:03:55.470> a

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
so I really think our earth works did a

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.170 
so I really think our earth works did a
fantastic<00:03:55.680> job<00:03:56.129> with<00:03:56.370> these<00:03:56.489> mic<00:03:56.760> sets

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
fantastic job with these mic sets

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.259 
fantastic job with these mic sets
did<00:03:58.019> they<00:03:58.349> just<00:03:58.560> offer<00:03:59.220> an<00:03:59.609> unprecedent

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
did they just offer an unprecedent

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.259 
did they just offer an unprecedent
amount<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.599> detail<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.230> clarity<00:04:01.670> with<00:04:02.670> just<00:04:03.180> a

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
amount of detail and clarity with just a
