00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.930

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.789
 that was released for super nintendo in 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.130
 1994 and how not to remember that fuck game 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.320
 and sensational had a beautiful art one 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.869
 very striking soundtrack was a game 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.640
 beautiful and devil because you 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.350
 arrived in the second phase and you will never 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.719
 more able to get through it because of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.280
 of those damn monkeys but leaving 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.170
 All this aside the game got 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.359
 sell a little more than a million and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.670
 seven hundred and ninety thousand cartridges and he 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.590
 tenth position and if you 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.299
 still has your expected and did not put 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.539
 fire after the anger that went with the 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.159
 second phase starts below in the ninth 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.049
 position we have one of the games that made a 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.750
 a resounding success around the world 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.640
 brazil also that it was mortal kombat 2 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.829
 this game was a revolution here and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.840
 thanks to him many game magazines 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.210
 got leverage in sales because 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.859
 they put the codes of fatalities and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.600
 at that time who had all these 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.640
 codes in a magazine was the king of 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.380
 neighborhood and I'm connected there that had 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.879
 Why do not you go out on a date? 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.700
 magazines or borrowed 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.220
 to photocopy not in 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.590
 claim deadly kombat 2 sold out about 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.590
 one million nine hundred and thirty thousand and that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.150
 only in super nintendo 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.430
 Already died in eighth position we have a 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.209
 rpg of the gods a masterpiece of 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.380
 video games 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.120
 a game that had a team of 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.090
 development that no other game 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.190
 had the dream team and yes I am 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.989
 talking about chrono trigger a game that already 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.180
 I even did a specific video of it for 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.010
 talk about their mysteries curiosities and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.989
 story this game until today is 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.970
 considered the best RPG of all 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.880
 and initially the game was released 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.739
 for super nintendo in 1995 and 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.069
 managed to sell more than two million 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.410
 310,000 units worldwide 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.209
 now we also have another game that was 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.299
 revolutionary in super nintendo 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.239
 great star fox that was released in 1993 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.400
 and the game was a huge success for the fact 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.769
 to be all in 3d and this was something 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.450
 different for the consoles until then and 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.880
 I did not want to play a game where you 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.670
 had a fox a frog a rabbit and the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.380
 hawk to help explore space 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.160
 madness but at last star fox managed 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.870
 sell more than 4 million cartridges in the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.940
 sixth place we have the legend of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.680
 zelda beyond the depeche that until little 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.569
 have launched a continuation of this 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.700
 3d game for 3ds 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.889
 but at last the legend of zelda came 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.510
 doing great success in the little 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.120
 in super nintendo this was not different 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.980
 this game he is considered by many to be 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.410
 best zelda because he has an entire 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.600
 the charm of a beautiful art the giant map 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.530
 for you to explore and a host of other 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.560
 things 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.810
 the game released in 1991 managed to sell 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.079
 more than four million six hundred and ten 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.000
 thousands of cartridges all over the world now 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.859
 getting those games that was to be 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.700
 wait the one that we have here donkey 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.739
 kong country 2 that was released in 1995 and 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.389
 at that time than impressed the 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.549
 gamers with almost gameplay sir 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.010
 what a perfect soundtrack that is 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.750
 to date this continuation of the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.630
 franchise managed to sell a little more 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.789
 that 5 million 150 thousand units 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.739
 as you would expect street fighter 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.450
 will not be off this list because 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.520
 he was the fourth best selling game in the 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.070
 super nintendo and to be more exact was 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.930
 street fighter 2 the world we have arrived 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.120
 to be released in 1990 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.100
 and 1 this was also one of the games that 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.350
 they were more fun in the rental companies here 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.570
 In Brazil, until the final championship. 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.910
 week had and street fighter is 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.440
 funny that has millions of versions 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.400
 But only the one here alone managed to 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.289
 sell more than 6 million units in 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.419
 third place we have the first game of 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.280
 Mario's 100 super mario kart racing 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.590
 this game that has become a franchise 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.419
 very important for nintendo and 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.430
 Real this game is phenomenal 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.900
 It was great to join the characters from a 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.610
 franchise that was already known and 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.620
 turn into a super race game 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.199
 Fun The First Game Of The Franchise 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.349
 kart to sell just over 8 million 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.780
 760,000 cartridges worldwide 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.580
 second place was the first of the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.990
 king kong for the super nintendo that went 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.030
 the beginning of one of the deductibles 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.310
 can be as good as Mario in the 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.289
 platform game criterion and for me 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.360
 this first king kong is the best of 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.949
 all of the trilogy not only for being the 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.990
 first but also by having a trail 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.180
 beautiful sonora and a difficulty that 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.590
 It leaves you pissed but at the same time it makes you 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.630
 want to play again to get to the 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.789
 phase and show that you are good at this 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.280
 has sold more than 9 million 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.139
 cartridges 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.760
 in the first place is already so obvious and 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.500
 I have also spoken several videos in 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.300
 way of curiosity that the super mario 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.760
 world has sold more than 20 million 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.280
 units and with reason why the game already 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.960
 there were completely all the consoles and 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.979
 from the start of the launch of the 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.080
 Super Nintendo 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.909
 but who would guess that the console already 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.159
 I came with one of the best games of the 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.960
 videogame and let's face it 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.419
 even if it was not the game that would come 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.580
 with the videogame he would surely be 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.110
 among the top three best-selling games 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.110
 Seriously, this game is too good. 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.440
 anyway guys this list is coming to 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.210
 end and I need to remind them that I do not 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.520
 I forgot some game for example as 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.550
 top ghia famous for caramba in brazil 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.570
 final fantasy and mario rpg aladdin or 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.479
 any other extremely 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.280
 the truth is that there are many 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.590
 games that sold about one million 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.810
 copies and in the video made a list 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.550
 a top 10 of the best selling games 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.130
 so I have not forgotten these other games 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.990
 beauty but whatever it is I hope 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.029

 people who sent me the video's print
