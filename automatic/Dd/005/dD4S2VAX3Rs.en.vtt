00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.310
 the gate 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.770
 m 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.309
 sometimes the color photograph is obtained 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.780
 not at all what I would like 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.929
 see 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.709
 and you have to edit them 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.429
 the picture was taken when lighting lamps 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.289
 daylight 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.500
 without adjustment 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.339
 white balance 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.359
 will open the second copy of the picture 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.949
 on which we will experiment 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.689
 then all the changes we can compare with 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.110
 source image 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.380
 make that new collection 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.380
 To do this, open the panel level 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.890
 there is a program that shows that 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 color level and brightness of parts 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.350
 Images 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.360
 insufficient 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.340
 overall tonality of the image 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.400
 dark tones prevail 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.060
 exploring every color channel 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.900
 and hold the election 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.770
 new collection 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.810
 red channel 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.760
 in the whole range of brightness we have 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.190
 any values 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.210
 green channel 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 the situation is similar 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.450
 blue channel 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.170
 here is more interesting 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.240
 almost half the brightness range 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.870
 is empty 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.520
 redefining the range of colors and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.600
 shadow blue canada 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.230
 moved the white triangle to the left 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.060
 yes first present 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.200
 brightness value 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.590
 these actions causes a redistribution 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.040
 actual brightness range 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.660
 our school 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.930
 due to the fact that the scale formed 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.820
 regular spaces 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.610
 but in general the range is expanding 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.230
 if these spaces are not too large 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.910
 then they will not worsen the perception 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.170
 Images 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.930
 if now the sphere is a triangle 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.789
 take a bit of a limit 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.940
 towards the great importance of the bones 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.760
 still add images of puppies 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.530
 tones 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.070
 the picture began to look more 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.279
 stiskin 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.899
 back to the combined channels 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.059
 and with the help of Shcherbakov's call 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.059
 let's add the general brightness 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.599
 in principle, this can be stopped 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.659
 but experiment with 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.029
 red channel 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:29.229
 the point is to locate the sulfur 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.639
 triangle under the central peak 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.899
 brightness 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.589
 what can be done with Lyon 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:37.609
 channels 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.159
 the main thing is not to overdo it 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.609
 on the other hand, each in its own way 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.400
 determines the quality of the received 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.480
 Images 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.200
 if you are satisfied 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.039
 stop 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.089
 close the panel saving 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.539
 result 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:54.899
 you can still use 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.609
 one way to change tones 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.739
 all that already level palettes 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.120
 for these experiments 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.120
 use the third sample of the picture 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.299
 call the palette again 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.719
 only now we will act under these 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.739
 droppers year 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.030
 black friday 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.360
 point to the darkest area 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.119
 Images 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.029
 white 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.969
 on the brightest 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.389
 in this way 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.399
 we set extreme 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.469
 the values ​​of light and shadow, that is, we determine 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.299
 new range as such 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.989
 this way you can call 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.989
 setting white and black dots 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.579
 the fabric he makes Lipetsk and nato is 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.679
 areas of the wall which are like us 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.319
 suspect should be white by most 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.069
 bright 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.809
 black pipette 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.529
 point out this darkest kenya's darkest 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.179
 places 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.469
 Of course, we asked the border then new 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.979
 range 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.579
 now gray whale rare and gray tones 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.679
 point to the wall 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:10.449
 and adjust a bit 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.749
 total brightness 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:14.869
 the result was even better than 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.269
 second image 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.650
 however, this is not always the case. 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.389
 this way is only good as 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.810
 preliminary stage determination then new 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.379
 rock stream 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.919
 and the fact that it is only a mistake with imedi 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:27.680
 kopecks 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.129
 and no one will be in women 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:31.830
 however now 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.110
 we just tried to work with the palette 100 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.879
 Noah correction levels and further on 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.830
 independent environments its capabilities 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.479
 you can do your best 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.210
 viewpoint result
