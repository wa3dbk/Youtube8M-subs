doesn't actually have a CPU cutout so
what<00:02:44.520> do<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.700> think<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.210> D<00:02:45.360> frame<00:02:45.600> mini<00:02:45.810> well

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
what do I think of the D frame mini well

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.870 
what do I think of the D frame mini well
at<00:02:46.590> first<00:02:46.650> glance<00:02:46.920> it's<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.370> super<00:02:47.730> cool

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
at first glance it's a super cool

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.730 
at first glance it's a super cool
looking<00:02:48.240> open-air<00:02:48.660> chassis<00:02:49.170> there's<00:02:49.560> no

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
looking open-air chassis there's no

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.920 
looking open-air chassis there's no
denying<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.220> from<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> trellis<00:02:51.420> frame<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
denying that from the trellis frame to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.600 
denying that from the trellis frame to
the<00:02:52.020> glass<00:02:52.200> side<00:02:52.410> panels<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.070> great<00:02:53.340> case

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the glass side panels it's a great case

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.270 
the glass side panels it's a great case
to<00:02:53.640> show<00:02:53.820> off<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.300> friends<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:56.130> not

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
to show off to friends but I would not

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.070 
to show off to friends but I would not
buy<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.610> for<00:02:56.970> my<00:02:57.120> personal<00:02:57.540> rig<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:58.050> a

buy this for my personal rig for a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.030 
buy this for my personal rig for a
couple<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.470> reasons

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
couple of reasons

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.550 
couple of reasons
first<00:02:59.580> off<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.030> open<00:03:00.330> air<00:03:00.480> design<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.170> really

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
first off the open air design is really

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.830 
first off the open air design is really
not<00:03:01.710> for<00:03:01.920> me<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.280> would<00:03:02.550> much<00:03:02.700> prefer<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:03.420> closed

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
not for me I would much prefer a closed

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.200 
not for me I would much prefer a closed
environment<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:05.400> overall<00:03:05.790> building

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
environment the overall building

experience<00:03:06.690> was<00:03:06.870> my<00:03:07.050> second<00:03:07.470> problem<00:03:07.620> with

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
experience was my second problem with

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.040 
experience was my second problem with
the<00:03:07.980> case<00:03:08.240> specifically<00:03:09.240> with<00:03:09.480> cable

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
the case specifically with cable

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.350 
the case specifically with cable
management<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.130> holes<00:03:11.370> included<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.150> the

management the holes included on the
chassis<00:03:12.780> were<00:03:12.960> just<00:03:13.200> not<00:03:13.350> big<00:03:13.620> enough<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.250> get

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
chassis were just not big enough to get

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.030 
chassis were just not big enough to get
all<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.670> cables<00:03:15.210> super<00:03:15.750> tidy<00:03:15.960> and<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.860> P

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
all the cables super tidy and the P

all the cables super tidy and the P
clamps<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.550> are<00:03:17.670> provided<00:03:18.150> well<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:18.720> can

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
clamps that are provided well you can

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.930 
clamps that are provided well you can
only<00:03:18.930> use<00:03:19.290> those<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.800> for<00:03:20.130> pre-existing

only use those in for pre-existing
threaded<00:03:21.450> holes<00:03:21.830> it's<00:03:22.830> not<00:03:23.010> much<00:03:23.160> choice

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
threaded holes it's not much choice

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.220 
threaded holes it's not much choice
there<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.000> remember<00:03:24.390> earlier<00:03:24.750> when<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:24.989> said

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
there and remember earlier when I said

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.960 
there and remember earlier when I said
in<00:03:25.440> win'<00:03:25.590> claims<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.280> can<00:03:26.430> place<00:03:26.670> this

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
in win' claims that you can place this

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.720 
in win' claims that you can place this
case<00:03:27.330> on<00:03:27.570> all<00:03:27.600> six<00:03:28.080> of<00:03:28.200> its<00:03:28.350> sides<00:03:28.650> well<00:03:29.459> it's

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
case on all six of its sides well it's

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.760 
case on all six of its sides well it's
actually<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.390> many<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.410> more<00:03:31.650> like

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
actually not that many it's more like

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.370 
actually not that many it's more like
three<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.790> can't<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.450> top<00:03:33.690> or<00:03:33.930> front

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
three you can't have the top or front

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.199 
three you can't have the top or front
facing<00:03:34.800> down<00:03:35.040> because<00:03:35.489> how<00:03:35.730> will<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.030> get

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
facing down because how will you get

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.570 
facing down because how will you get
access<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.630> all<00:03:36.870> your<00:03:36.900> ports<00:03:37.350> what<00:03:38.040> happens<00:03:38.400> if

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
access to all your ports what happens if

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.880

encountered with test benches people use

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.850 
encountered with test benches people use
them<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.090> often<00:04:12.360> changing<00:04:13.140> parts<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.560> whatnot

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
chance to settle in so that's my

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.520 
chance to settle in so that's my
conclusion<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.299> D<00:04:18.450> frame<00:04:18.660> mini<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.080> great

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
conclusion the D frame mini is a great
