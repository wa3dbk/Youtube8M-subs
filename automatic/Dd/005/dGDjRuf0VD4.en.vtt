00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
question right now is such an

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460 
question right now is such an
undercurrent<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.150> what<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.420> 150<00:00:25.320> yard

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
are you keeping track of how much closer

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.849 
are you keeping track of how much closer
he's<00:00:29.519> getting<00:00:29.760> yeah<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:31.050> inevitable<00:00:31.679> now

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
he's getting yeah it's inevitable now

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
he's getting yeah it's inevitable now
that<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.090> Sachin<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> such<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.200> great

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that you know Sachin is such a great

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350 
that you know Sachin is such a great
player<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.399> he's<00:00:35.520> gonna<00:00:35.700> walk<00:00:35.910> past<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
player you know he's gonna walk past it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.940 
player you know he's gonna walk past it
at<00:00:36.480> some<00:00:36.660> point<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.050> time<00:00:37.079> he's<00:00:37.590> still<00:00:37.800> very

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
at some point in time he's still very

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
at some point in time he's still very
young<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:38.700> he<00:00:38.790> still<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.420> few

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
young and I think he still got a few

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
young and I think he still got a few
more<00:00:40.079> years<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> game<00:00:40.680> there's<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> bad

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
more years in the game there's not a bad

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
more years in the game there's not a bad
thing<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.360> he<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> couple<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.680> hold<00:00:44.010> on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
thing if he has a couple and I hold on

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
thing if he has a couple and I hold on
to<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.430> couple<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> girls<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.020> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to a couple of girls so you know you can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220 
to a couple of girls so you know you can
go<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:47.129> tandem<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.820> enjoy<00:00:48.480> every<00:00:48.780> time<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
go in tandem and enjoy every time and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
go in tandem and enjoy every time and
when<00:00:49.350> he<00:00:49.469> does<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.579> mean<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> highest<00:00:51.090> test

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
when he does so I mean the highest test

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.000 
when he does so I mean the highest test
run<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> could<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> certainly<00:00:52.739> going

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
run I could get is certainly going

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.560 
run I could get is certainly going
because<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.610> said<00:00:53.789> he's<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> hundred<00:00:54.449> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
because like I said he's a hundred and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
because like I said he's a hundred and
fifty<00:00:54.870> runs<00:00:55.050> odd<00:00:55.350> away<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.699> which

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
fifty runs odd away from that but which

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
fifty runs odd away from that but which
one<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> hold<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.140> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
one would you really like to hold on to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.799 
one would you really like to hold on to
I<00:00:58.379> mean<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> 501<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.550> probably<00:01:00.300> gonna<00:01:00.510> stay

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I mean the 501 is probably gonna stay

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
I mean the 501 is probably gonna stay
for<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.350> long<00:01:01.469> time<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.520> reckon

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
for a really long time just you reckon

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.250 
for a really long time just you reckon
that<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.690> stays<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:03.989> long

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that would be the one that stays in long

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.940 
that would be the one that stays in long
list<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> 400

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.770

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
broken and you know the fact that you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660 
broken and you know the fact that you
know<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> first<00:01:13.170> person<00:01:13.350> score<00:01:13.770> 400<00:01:14.280> once<00:01:14.490> in

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
the IPL I personally feel of the agendas

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.390 
the IPL I personally feel of the agendas
are<00:04:53.420> different<00:04:54.050> then<00:04:54.590> both<00:04:54.830> people<00:04:55.160> could

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
are different then both people could

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.340 
are different then both people could
live<00:04:55.790> in<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.030> same<00:04:56.270> world<00:04:56.300> if<00:04:56.930> they<00:04:57.230> are

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
live in the same world if they are

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.600 
live in the same world if they are
conflicting<00:04:57.980> then<00:04:58.130> there's<00:04:58.310> going<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.550> be

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
conflicting then there's going to be

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.180 
conflicting then there's going to be
problems<00:04:58.880> but<00:04:59.270> again<00:04:59.780> I'm<00:04:59.930> just<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.800> player<00:05:00.980> so

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
problems but again I'm just a player so

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.330 
problems but again I'm just a player so
I<00:05:01.250> didn't<00:05:01.430> know<00:05:01.490> exactly<00:05:01.700> what's<00:05:02.000> going<00:05:02.150> on
