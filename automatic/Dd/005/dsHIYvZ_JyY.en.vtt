filming studio we have the antec 902 and
it<00:01:19.320> probably<00:01:19.500> doesn't<00:01:19.710> look<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.040> any<00:01:20.189> 902

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.589 
protruding fan up at the top that in my
opinion<00:02:33.769> makes<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.519> look<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> little<00:02:35.000> bit<00:02:35.239> ugly

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599
