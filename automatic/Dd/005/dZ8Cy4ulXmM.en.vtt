00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.370 

so<00:00:03.400> now<00:00:03.550> we're<00:00:03.760> going<00:00:03.880> to<00:00:03.940> go<00:00:04.120> through<00:00:04.420> and<00:00:04.750> do

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:05.380 
so now we're going to go through and do

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.840 
so now we're going to go through and do
just<00:00:05.680> the<00:00:05.830> basic<00:00:06.220> triads<00:00:06.700> 4<00:00:07.120> 1<00:00:07.630> 2<00:00:08.109> 5<00:00:08.710> &amp;<00:00:09.070> 6<00:00:09.309> in<00:00:09.670> the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.850 
just the basic triads 4 1 2 5 &amp; 6 in the

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.669 
just the basic triads 4 1 2 5 &amp; 6 in the
key<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.059> F<00:00:10.299> so<00:00:11.080> you<00:00:11.139> got<00:00:11.410> what<00:00:12.340> a<00:00:12.370> try<00:00:12.670> it<00:00:12.730> is<00:00:12.969> is

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
key of F so you got what a try it is is

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.220 
key of F so you got what a try it is is
1<00:00:14.679> 3<00:00:14.889> &amp;<00:00:15.099> 5<00:00:15.280> of<00:00:15.519> each<00:00:15.670> scale<00:00:16.150> so<00:00:16.480> you<00:00:16.540> have<00:00:16.869> the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
1 3 &amp; 5 of each scale so you have the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.810 
1 3 &amp; 5 of each scale so you have the
root<00:00:17.439> third<00:00:17.860> in<00:00:18.009> the<00:00:18.099> fifth<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.930> an<00:00:20.230> F<00:00:20.470> its<00:00:21.660> f<00:00:22.660> AC

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
root third in the fifth so an F its f AC

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.099 
root third in the fifth so an F its f AC
G<00:00:24.820> minor<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:26.109> got<00:00:26.230> G<00:00:26.560> B<00:00:26.859> flat<00:00:26.890> D<00:00:27.869> C<00:00:28.869> I'm<00:00:28.960> just

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
G minor you got G B flat D C I'm just

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.450 
G minor you got G B flat D C I'm just
going<00:00:29.289> up<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:32.019> see<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:34.300> FC<00:00:34.690> Angie<00:00:35.559> and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
going up to then see the FC Angie and

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.280 
going up to then see the FC Angie and
then<00:00:36.940> your<00:00:37.360> D<00:00:37.930> minor<00:00:38.290> D<00:00:38.710> up<00:00:39.070> in<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.520> all<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:41.260> of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
then your D minor D up in it all out of

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.020 
then your D minor D up in it all out of
the<00:00:41.469> scale<00:00:41.739> so<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.040> can<00:00:42.129> go<00:00:42.399> through<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:42.969> just

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
the scale so you can go through and just

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.440 
the scale so you can go through and just
play<00:00:43.390> your<00:00:44.079> triads<00:00:47.940> fun<00:00:48.940> thing<00:00:49.149> is<00:00:49.239> do<00:00:49.420> like

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
play your triads fun thing is do like

00:00:49.450 --> 00:01:03.119 
play your triads fun thing is do like
dewlap<00:00:50.110> thing<00:00:50.379> like

you<00:01:18.320> get<00:01:18.440> those<00:01:18.590> triads<00:01:18.950> under<00:01:19.340> your<00:01:19.430> fingers

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
you get those triads under your fingers

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.480 
you get those triads under your fingers
maybe<00:01:21.320> just<00:01:21.500> move<00:01:21.770> up<00:01:22.010> and<00:01:22.220> down<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:25.460> can

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
maybe just move up and down you can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.730 
maybe just move up and down you can
invert<00:01:25.940> them<00:01:26.120> too

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
invert them too

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.040 
invert them too
you<00:01:27.740> take<00:01:27.950> 1<00:01:28.190> 3<00:01:28.430> &amp;<00:01:28.580> 5<00:01:28.610> put<00:01:29.150> 5<00:01:29.360> on<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.660> bottom

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.810 

which<00:01:33.050> basically<00:01:33.350> gives<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.830> fourth<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.670> a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
which basically gives you a fourth and a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.490 
which basically gives you a fourth and a
third<00:01:35.180> for<00:01:35.509> intervals<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.830> 4<00:01:37.790> notes<00:01:38.030> in<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
third for intervals so 4 notes in the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.380 
third for intervals so 4 notes in the
scale<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.250> 3<00:01:40.880> notes<00:01:41.060> in<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.270> scale

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
scale and the 3 notes in the scale

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.210 
scale and the 3 notes in the scale
skipping<00:01:44.140> or<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.290> can<00:01:45.380> put<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.619> 4th<00:01:45.890> on<00:01:46.100> the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
skipping or you can put the 4th on the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.200 
skipping or you can put the 4th on the
top<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.670> here<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.390> F<00:01:50.780> major<00:01:51.229> triad<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.310> I

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
top so here I have a F major triad and I

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.790 
top so here I have a F major triad and I
take<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.600> top<00:01:53.840> 2<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.380> put<00:01:54.500> them<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.710> the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
take the top 2 and put them on the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:04.880 
take the top 2 and put them on the
bottom

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.880 

so<00:02:05.890> have<00:02:06.130> fun<00:02:06.159> utilizing<00:02:06.939> your<00:02:07.030> triads<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
so have fun utilizing your triads and

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.030 
so have fun utilizing your triads and
get<00:02:09.099> that<00:02:09.280> scale<00:02:09.580> under<00:02:09.610> your<00:02:09.910> fingers
