00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
hey guy say hi to the camera yeah say

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.940 
hey guy say hi to the camera yeah say
hello<00:00:05.040> hi<00:00:07.340> cool<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.730> backup<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.179> me<00:00:09.830> there<00:00:10.830> we

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
hello hi cool the backup of me there we

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.709 
hello hi cool the backup of me there we
go<00:00:11.099> good<00:00:11.820> boy<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:13.880> this<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.360> my<00:00:15.389> first

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
go good boy so this this is my first

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.529 
go good boy so this this is my first
robot<00:00:16.310> and<00:00:17.310> what<00:00:17.430> I've<00:00:17.550> done<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.970> I've<00:00:18.150> hacked

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
robot and what I've done is I've hacked

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.970 
robot and what I've done is I've hacked
the<00:00:18.900> wii<00:00:19.050> mote<00:00:19.910> to<00:00:20.910> control<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.720> robot<00:00:21.980> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the wii mote to control the robot the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740 
the wii mote to control the robot the
wiimote<00:00:23.310> has<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.820> accelerometer<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
wiimote has a little accelerometer in it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.349 
wiimote has a little accelerometer in it
that<00:00:25.650> measures<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.400> direction<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.180> gravity

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that measures the direction of gravity

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.700 
that measures the direction of gravity
and<00:00:28.099> depending<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.599> which<00:00:30.599> direction<00:00:30.630> i<00:00:31.320> turn

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and depending on which direction i turn

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.780 
and depending on which direction i turn
the<00:00:31.890> wiimote<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.870> send<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> signal<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
the wiimote it will send a signal to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
the wiimote it will send a signal to
this<00:00:35.790> microcontroller<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.750> which

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this microcontroller here which

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.080 
this microcontroller here which
interprets<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.680> signal<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.700> sends<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
interprets a signal and then sends a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
interprets a signal and then sends a
message<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> servos<00:00:40.020> telling<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
message to the servos telling it how to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
message to the servos telling it how to
move<00:00:46.700> do<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.940> life<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:50.690> little<00:00:51.690> bit

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
move do you like life a little bit

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.459 
move do you like life a little bit
