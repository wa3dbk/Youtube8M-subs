00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.630 
out all the stops and fujitora through
and<00:04:12.049> through<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.530> seemed<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.400> he<00:04:13.610> was

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
and through it seemed like he was

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.449 
and through it seemed like he was
holding<00:04:14.150> back<00:04:14.350> immensely<00:04:15.350> because<00:04:15.799> he's

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
holding back immensely because he's

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.880 
holding back immensely because he's
planning<00:04:16.760> something<00:04:17.260> he<00:04:18.260> mentioned

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
planning something he mentioned

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.540 
planning something he mentioned
something<00:04:19.640> about<00:04:19.790> dice<00:04:20.359> where<00:04:21.400> when<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:22.520> have

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
something about dice where when you have

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.850 
something about dice where when you have
a<00:04:22.700> dice<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.479> good<00:04:23.840> roll<00:04:24.850> you're<00:04:25.850> playing<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.479> game

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
a dice a good roll you're playing a game

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.550 
a dice a good roll you're playing a game
but<00:04:27.860> if<00:04:27.979> you<00:04:28.040> have<00:04:28.130> no<00:04:28.280> dice<00:04:28.630> then<00:04:29.630> there's<00:04:30.380> no

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
but if you have no dice then there's no

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.290 
but if you have no dice then there's no
game<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.890> be<00:04:30.979> played<00:04:31.220> something<00:04:31.790> like<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.120> I

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
game to be played something like that I

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.150 
game to be played something like that I
don't<00:04:32.330> know<00:04:32.600> his<00:04:32.960> exact<00:04:33.410> court<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:33.770> skating

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
don't know his exact court of skating

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.830 
don't know his exact court of skating
but<00:04:34.280> either<00:04:34.430> way<00:04:34.610> there's<00:04:35.210> some<00:04:35.599> that<00:04:35.750> he's

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
but either way there's some that he's

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.290 
but either way there's some that he's
plotting<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.620> he's<00:04:36.770> planning<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.910> we<00:04:38.090> do

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
plotting that he's planning and we do

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.740 
plotting that he's planning and we do
know

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
know

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.790 
know
fujitora<00:04:39.230> wants<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.860> completely<00:04:40.340> abolish<00:04:40.970> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
fujitora wants to completely abolish the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.760 
fujitora wants to completely abolish the
Chichibu<00:04:42.800> chi<00:04:42.980> system<00:04:43.640> he<00:04:43.760> is<00:04:43.880> blind<00:04:44.270> justice

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
Chichibu chi system he is blind justice

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.760 
Chichibu chi system he is blind justice
so<00:04:45.770> what<00:04:46.610> he<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:46.940> plotting<00:04:47.540> may<00:04:48.200> involve

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
so what he is plotting may involve

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.700 
so what he is plotting may involve
flamingos<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:50.000> his<00:04:50.540> boys<00:04:50.810> we're<00:04:51.410> not<00:04:51.530> too

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
flamingos and his boys we're not too

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.690 
flamingos and his boys we're not too
sure<00:04:51.950> exactly<00:04:52.460> but<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:54.050> thing<00:04:54.290> year<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.890> when

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
sure exactly but the thing year is when

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.090 
sure exactly but the thing year is when
fujitora<00:04:56.270> starts<00:04:56.810> actually<00:04:56.990> putting<00:04:57.830> some

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
fujitora starts actually putting some

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.220 
fujitora starts actually putting some
more<00:04:58.220> effort<00:04:58.640> into<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.120> battle<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.600> him<00:04:59.750> Sabo

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
more effort into the battle to him Sabo

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.520 
more effort into the battle to him Sabo
it's<00:05:00.970> clearly<00:05:01.970> shown<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.840> gravity<00:05:03.290> blade

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
it's clearly shown the gravity blade

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.070 
it's clearly shown the gravity blade
touches<00:05:04.100> the<00:05:04.400> ground<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:05.240> date<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.870> the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
touches the ground the date the the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.880 
touches the ground the date the the
ground<00:05:06.320> like<00:05:06.710> cum<00:05:07.250> gets<00:05:08.030> crushed<00:05:08.450> as<00:05:08.870> him<00:05:09.710> like

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
ground like cum gets crushed as him like

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.500 
ground like cum gets crushed as him like
it's<00:05:10.130> arcing<00:05:10.490> like<00:05:10.610> collapse<00:05:11.030> under<00:05:11.420> the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
it's arcing like collapse under the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.940 
it's arcing like collapse under the
gravity<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:13.720> then<00:05:14.720> he<00:05:14.840> does<00:05:15.020> this<00:05:15.140> horizontal

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
gravity and then he does this horizontal

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.820 
gravity and then he does this horizontal
gravity<00:05:16.370> cut<00:05:16.670> that<00:05:17.540> was<00:05:17.720> nice<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.530> was<00:05:18.650> very

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
gravity cut that was nice that was very

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.120 
gravity cut that was nice that was very
nice<00:05:19.100> man<00:05:19.430> yeah<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.960> already<00:05:21.350> called<00:05:21.710> it<00:05:21.890> in<00:05:21.980> the

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
nice man yeah I already called it in the

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.090 
nice man yeah I already called it in the
anime<00:05:22.550> but<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.090> manga<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:23.780> anime<00:05:24.560> had

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
anime but the manga and anime had

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.770 
anime but the manga and anime had
different<00:05:25.430> names<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:25.850> think<00:05:26.150> for<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.480> actual

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
different names I think for the actual

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.350 
different names I think for the actual
attack<00:05:27.020> either<00:05:27.530> way<00:05:27.830> it's<00:05:28.370> a<00:05:28.550> gravity<00:05:29.120> wave

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
attack either way it's a gravity wave

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.110 
attack either way it's a gravity wave
slash<00:05:30.170> and<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.920> was<00:05:31.040> pretty<00:05:31.250> cool<00:05:31.520> too<00:05:31.790> cuz<00:05:32.030> you

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
slash and it was pretty cool too cuz you

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.160 
slash and it was pretty cool too cuz you
got<00:05:32.240> these<00:05:32.360> buildings<00:05:32.840> in<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:32.990> background

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
got these buildings in the background

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.400 
got these buildings in the background
and<00:05:33.910> you<00:05:34.910> have<00:05:35.090> like<00:05:35.300> three<00:05:35.630> stories<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:36.320> are

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
and you have like three stories that are

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.220 
and you have like three stories that are
on<00:05:36.500> top<00:05:36.770> that<00:05:37.580> are<00:05:37.730> pretty<00:05:37.970> much<00:05:38.210> fine<00:05:38.870> and

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
on top that are pretty much fine and

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.960 
on top that are pretty much fine and
then<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.830> bottom<00:05:40.130> three<00:05:40.280> stories<00:05:40.640> are<00:05:40.820> just

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
then the bottom three stories are just

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.730 
then the bottom three stories are just
being<00:05:41.300> like<00:05:41.480> concave<00:05:42.290> then<00:05:42.470> like<00:05:42.590> they're

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
being like concave then like they're

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.240 
being like concave then like they're
being<00:05:43.070> blasted<00:05:43.520> in<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.680> Sabo<00:05:45.680> he's<00:05:45.920> like<00:05:46.100> what

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
being blasted in and Sabo he's like what

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.580 
being blasted in and Sabo he's like what
staying<00:05:46.490> that<00:05:46.670> stuff<00:05:47.000> and<00:05:47.270> what<00:05:47.990> subtle<00:05:48.230> does

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
staying that stuff and what subtle does

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.640 
staying that stuff and what subtle does
is<00:05:49.060> that<00:05:50.060> he<00:05:50.180> becomes<00:05:50.450> a<00:05:50.600> wisp<00:05:50.900> of<00:05:51.050> fire<00:05:51.260> like<00:05:51.590> a

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
is that he becomes a wisp of fire like a

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.330 
is that he becomes a wisp of fire like a
fire<00:05:52.010> snake<00:05:52.970> in<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.240> air<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:53.770> I'm<00:05:54.770> not<00:05:55.130> too

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
fire snake in the air and I'm not too

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.160 
fire snake in the air and I'm not too
sure<00:05:55.580> if<00:05:55.610> it's<00:05:55.910> actually<00:05:56.120> could<00:05:56.570> do<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.930> I

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
sure if it's actually could do that I

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.730 
sure if it's actually could do that I
don't<00:05:57.590> know<00:05:57.740> but<00:05:58.100> regardless<00:05:59.350> sob<00:06:00.350> becomes

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
don't know but regardless sob becomes

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.830 
don't know but regardless sob becomes
that<00:06:00.950> wisp<00:06:01.160> of<00:06:01.280> fire<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:02.150> he<00:06:02.270> starts<00:06:02.570> to<00:06:02.660> just

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
that wisp of fire and he starts to just

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.380 
that wisp of fire and he starts to just
trim<00:06:03.080> stuff<00:06:03.350> in<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.500> air<00:06:03.650> and<00:06:04.010> he<00:06:04.970> kicks

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
trim stuff in the air and he kicks

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.430 
trim stuff in the air and he kicks
fujitora

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
fujitora

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.490 
fujitora
they<00:06:07.040> clash<00:06:07.460> because<00:06:07.790> he<00:06:08.210> has<00:06:08.330> his<00:06:08.510> blade<00:06:09.080> as<00:06:09.230> a

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
they clash because he has his blade as a

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.300 
they clash because he has his blade as a
defense<00:06:09.920> and<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:11.630> explosion<00:06:12.290> was<00:06:12.440> huge<00:06:12.860> and

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
defense and the explosion was huge and

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.670 
defense and the explosion was huge and
it<00:06:13.790> was<00:06:13.850> intense<00:06:14.390> and<00:06:14.630> the<00:06:14.810> way<00:06:14.930> was<00:06:15.080> animated

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
it was intense and the way was animated

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.630 
it was intense and the way was animated
it<00:06:15.860> was<00:06:16.300> it<00:06:17.300> was<00:06:17.510> very<00:06:17.960> animated<00:06:18.350> very<00:06:19.190> will

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
it was it was very animated very will

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.760 
it was it was very animated very will
aim<00:06:19.790> it<00:06:19.970> at<00:06:20.150> some<00:06:20.570> point<00:06:20.600> there<00:06:21.320> was<00:06:21.440> a<00:06:21.500> sky

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
aim it at some point there was a sky

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.430 
aim it at some point there was a sky
shot<00:06:22.100> where<00:06:22.610> almost<00:06:23.540> as<00:06:23.660> if<00:06:23.780> like<00:06:23.840> there<00:06:24.290> was<00:06:24.410> a

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
shot where almost as if like there was a

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.010 
shot where almost as if like there was a
helicopter<00:06:24.740> like<00:06:25.700> watch<00:06:25.940> from<00:06:26.150> above<00:06:26.270> where

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
helicopter like watch from above where

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.350 
helicopter like watch from above where
like<00:06:27.230> their<00:06:27.590> sky<00:06:27.860> shooting<00:06:28.310> and<00:06:28.460> like<00:06:28.610> they're

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
like their sky shooting and like they're

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.900 
like their sky shooting and like they're
moving<00:06:29.810> to<00:06:30.650> like<00:06:30.770> a<00:06:30.800> certain<00:06:31.250> angle<00:06:31.580> to<00:06:31.700> get<00:06:31.820> to

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
moving to like a certain angle to get to

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.160 
moving to like a certain angle to get to
get<00:06:32.000> like<00:06:32.090> a<00:06:32.150> better<00:06:32.330> image<00:06:32.510> of<00:06:32.720> the<00:06:32.840> actual

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
get like a better image of the actual

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.500 
get like a better image of the actual
explosion<00:06:33.410> I<00:06:33.770> was<00:06:33.950> nice<00:06:34.480> so<00:06:35.920> overall<00:06:37.420> when<00:06:38.420> it

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
explosion I was nice so overall when it

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.390 
explosion I was nice so overall when it
comes<00:06:38.660> to<00:06:38.750> those<00:06:38.870> scenes<00:06:39.140> specifically<00:06:39.740> the

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
comes to those scenes specifically the

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.310 
comes to those scenes specifically the
animation<00:06:40.940> was<00:06:41.210> pretty<00:06:41.540> damn<00:06:41.660> good<00:06:41.960> and<00:06:42.110> I

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
animation was pretty damn good and I

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.770 
animation was pretty damn good and I
really<00:06:42.830> do<00:06:43.010> wish<00:06:43.250> that<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:44.240> animation<00:06:44.690> was

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
really do wish that the animation was

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.240 
really do wish that the animation was
like<00:06:44.990> that<00:06:45.200> on<00:06:45.380> a<00:06:45.410> regular<00:06:45.560> basis<00:06:46.070> because

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
like that on a regular basis because

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.280 
like that on a regular basis because
even<00:06:46.820> though<00:06:46.910> the<00:06:46.970> pacing<00:06:47.390> is<00:06:47.510> atrocious<00:06:47.930> and

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
even though the pacing is atrocious and

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.770 
even though the pacing is atrocious and
slow<00:06:48.500> for<00:06:49.220> obvious<00:06:49.580> reasons<00:06:49.970> if<00:06:50.180> the

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
slow for obvious reasons if the

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.600 
slow for obvious reasons if the
animation<00:06:51.140> was<00:06:51.560> high-quality<00:06:52.370> on

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
animation was high-quality on

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.850 
animation was high-quality on
regular<00:06:52.849> basis<00:06:53.300> it<00:06:53.689> would<00:06:53.870> make<00:06:54.199> the<00:06:54.409> pacing

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
regular basis it would make the pacing

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.209 
regular basis it would make the pacing
more<00:06:55.039> bearable<00:06:55.370> and<00:06:56.349> I'm<00:06:57.349> pretty<00:06:57.590> sure<00:06:57.830> most

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
more bearable and I'm pretty sure most

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.830 
more bearable and I'm pretty sure most
of<00:06:58.370> you<00:06:58.460> guys<00:06:58.580> are<00:06:58.639> guys<00:06:58.909> would<00:06:59.330> agree<00:06:59.599> with<00:06:59.689> me
