 manage but greet the girlfriends that makes 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.490
 pleasure to see gilbert again in sweat 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.260
 ice dance 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.060

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.580
 i did not understand jacquot silva he is there 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.199
 Downstairs there is the World Cup but it is 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.369
 suspended for what they play not the 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.630
 match qu in austria with paris 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.310
 saint-germain other green and gray art 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.079
 damn but if it goes to ball 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.499
 completely this club in any case what 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.570
 match 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.370
 he feels not good he feels not good because 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.720
 that there is a traitor in the team of 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.620
 brazil you know that you know when 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.039
 even that there is a traitor in the team 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.690
 from Brazil 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.730
 a trade that is completely acquired at 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.629
 the cause of the Germans who is that 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 that she was waiting for brazil rice is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:01:04.510
 who the chelsea midfielder 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:01:06.610
 stubb listened to your skin this bastard 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 of ramires had commented on the attacked but 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.280
 who leaves him in the team ramirez 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.240
 chatting the dirty left gestapo 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.470
 attention all this is humor I 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.500
 say it for the idiots who listen to us 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.229
 they are numerous and not true gilbert has 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.520
 was positive then he put himself yes 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.250
 I would still come back to the fact 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.990
 that it's better his image I heard 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.070
 that it was better going off bar and 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.119
 it's true that it's a bit fashionable 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.860
 it's a bit like it's better without 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.720
 ribery it would have been better without ronaldo 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 maybe it'll be better his image that 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.540
 free the others it's true that without 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
 neymar you have a point in less taxes 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.140
 least for the opposing defense already and the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.729
 dude you see if you know he is and he 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.649
 was there he was in free verse 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.329
 it's not enough they were aimed at 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.350
 dribbling and imaging people flexed 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.490
 everyone has retreated but we have 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.600
 said bill of which you shoot the balloon 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.710
 course very quickly and you will make strong years 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.090
 thalie what are you bothering us 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.009
 late at the silly shoulder you watched 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.570
 late machin a worthy name augustin the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.469
 bust to your breasts it's not a 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.579
 invitation the lambada 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.750
 then the other one but what are they 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.369
 were doing well here he was starting to 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.630
 the gap of the group technically so 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.280
 somewhere it's not worse than they 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.869
 not there is a relief for 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.579
 the people and I want to say thank you this is 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.439
 like ribery you see if he had been there 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.130
 you imagine we would not have seen 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.170
 glans 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.520
 day griezmann griezmann who turned in 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.050
 jerked all the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.640
 German defense we remember it here 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.580
 there again shivers alain defense 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.819
 antoine griezmann they do not sleep 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.930
 night 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.040
 there is but it's terrible what is 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.290
 the Germans they have after having 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
 wintered the guy knows who managed these 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 people the guy that's not good it's true 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.970
 with robben it's 80% 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.410
 of the germany team in his soul 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.209
 in his club but also tell you that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.060
 do not care it's up to philipp lahm him 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.700
 says ah ah ah it's good ah it's my ccc 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.709
 ccc ccc ribéry who will come and our steps 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.950
 it was griezmann that unfortunately 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.390
 for him the supporters will judge them 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.830
 neymar supporters so I saw also 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.810
 that the Argentinean fans he was showing 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.040
 a spine tables shasta view 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.360
 on the good taste he had a fake 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.980
 spine that waved because 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.690
 that he hurt his back I mean 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.920
 also tying inflatable dolls with 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.910
 the average but if I can quote had 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.200
 luckily he does not have a pubalgie 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.599
 is that I mean because they 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.329
 would have shown the guys it's a little 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.040
 scary what then neymar these last 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.299
 it's good because neymar it settles the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.220
 problem is neymar what is this 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.000
 name is not a name on his excuse me 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.130
 but neymar 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.390
 I discussed it with the etc the setting 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.190
 as elsewhere the director of the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.359
 kingston boarding school at 2 in the county 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.829
 from Yorkshire who still say yesterday to 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.750
 tea time she did not understand 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.609
 the intrusion of this evil touches into the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.220
 campus then pass when she does 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.780
 the call is bernard mialhe fredj aux 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.430
 oscars you will miss the beginning of 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.600
 cricket match not that that's it 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.959
 England when we do not know 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.720
 neymar six cycles in brazil puts him to the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.389
 What door there's nothing to kill arrival 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.680
 cedantes of ordon laura 18 pages is 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.970
 so I was trying to educate myself I do not 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.620
 did not know then I got 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.290
 informed a little about him then a priori 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.079
 he is a Tuscan poet of the end of the thirteenth century 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.299
 early fourteenth century because he does not care 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.579
 there then so I read like what 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.630
 it was a poet so excuse me I 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.980
 have seen them play it's not really a 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.600
 poet the day before the good obviously it's 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.700
 is a but one thing that works is that 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.139
 it seems he started in hell he 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.350
 summer author must be burg at war he has 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.819
 finished in paradise so I tell myself that 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.500
 maybe maybe there is something 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.819
 days before I finish I would still have 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.170
 to speak about the rally of saint denis I 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.120
 posais saw an 800m runner who 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.500
 is called ambrosian stone bros wii which has 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.459
 ran with the team's jersey 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.450
 France so it's original 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.799
 well, it's not tomorrow because it's 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.239
 has already seen since I remind you 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.170
 that at one time had said course of 1500 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.300
 m who was wearing the stadium jersey 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.850
 rennais and he's downright reading 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.060
 play the whole season anyway y'a 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.139
 not what to tell and I want 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.910
 to tell you tonight 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.990
 will you be for brazil where 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.580
 will you be for germany 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.380
 it depends what depends on what but it 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.970
 depends if you prefer the cachaça where the 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.760
 duff beer if they prefer the feijoada 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.419
 the offender it must do the amazon where 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.820
 The Black Forest 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.990
 and then it depends if you prefer packed 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.990
 this summer on that 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:57.260
 or on that it depends on the 1500 you want 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.820
 safer but where exactly everything from 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.250

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:08.510
