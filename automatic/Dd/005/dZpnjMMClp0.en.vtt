00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:06.570
 hello today i want to show more 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.209
 you are a sonic earphone alone 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:14.369
 the model hangs thousands which sounds like 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:17.940
 more expensive r01 in my opinion 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:21.700
 Headphones are sold in such a package 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.340
 there are different nozzles of different 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:31.780
 size types there 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.899
 Velor case clothespin which is here 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.449
 very well and actually 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.420
 headphones 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:44.129
 headphone housing is also the most 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.179
 miniature like the older model 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.359
 only painted in such a crimson color 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:56.019
 that not everyone will like to 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.440
 Unlike the older model there are no removable 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:04.360
 filters and how did this 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:09.189
 the plastic part is somewhat already 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.299
 similar but the same ones used 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.880
 drivers ie top model 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.140
 ship cleaning the same sound when 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.899
 give away a lower price only me 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.020
 personally it seemed high frequencies here 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:29.619
 a little softer this is mine 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.250
 prejudices and in comparison with 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.790
 dynamic headphones 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.780
 the same firm jer 07 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.140
 bass addiction version then you have it hanging 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.140
 1000 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.310
 clearly smaller base 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.369
 but its enough and it is a clear textural 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.030
 much better than non dynamic models 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.049
 spiderman still kinda in comparison with 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.740
 data 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.330
 mimic headphones here are average 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.140
 frequency seemed a little 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.930
 lowered something softer 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.970
 sound 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.370
 Well, fittings still like fittings 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.030
 still more detailed hear at the sound 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.940
 flaws in records on dynamic then not 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.959
 so noticeably no armature anymore 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.950
 I like it generally recommend to anyone 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.459
 do not confuse crimson color of the case 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.610
 many chinese brand origins 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:43.060
 headphone data price is 120 dollars 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:47.380
 the sound of this model is like that of a top jer 01 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.380
 thanks everyone for watching goodbye
