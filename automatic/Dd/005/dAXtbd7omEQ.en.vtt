display and we can once again put it in
many<00:02:53.190> different<00:02:53.280> applications<00:02:54.240> it's<00:02:54.720> not

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
many different applications it's not

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.040 
many different applications it's not
just<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.230> single<00:02:55.410> application<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.450> looking

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
just a single application so looking

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.480 
just a single application so looking
again<00:02:58.290> what<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:58.650> here<00:02:59.040> which<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.190> nice
