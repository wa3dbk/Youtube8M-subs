time around this time around we're kind

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.100 
time around this time around we're kind
of<00:02:11.500> concentrating<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.810> including<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.840> new

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
of concentrating on including the new

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.870 
of concentrating on including the new
one<00:02:14.260> that's<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.560> out<00:02:14.710> yet<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.070> last<00:02:15.550> three

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
one that's not out yet the last three

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.110 
one that's not out yet the last three
records<00:02:16.270> so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
records so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.570 
records so
so<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.379> little<00:02:19.620> more<00:02:19.769> difficult<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.370> get<00:02:20.519> a

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
so it's a little more difficult to get a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.479 
so it's a little more difficult to get a
setlist<00:02:21.000> because<00:02:21.450> our<00:02:22.230> last<00:02:22.560> three<00:02:23.129> records

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
setlist because our last three records

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.509 
setlist because our last three records
have<00:02:23.760> no<00:02:24.269> song<00:02:24.569> less<00:02:24.900> than<00:02:25.200> six<00:02:25.980> minutes<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.489> it

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
have no song less than six minutes on it

so<00:02:26.879> we<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.810> 35<00:02:28.290> minutes<00:02:28.319> you're<00:02:28.800> really

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
so we have 35 minutes you're really

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.790 
so we have 35 minutes you're really
pushing<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.269> know<00:02:30.420> so

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.860 

yeah<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:34.700> we're<00:02:34.850> doing<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.480> playing<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
yeah so we're doing that and playing a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.320 
yeah so we're doing that and playing a
new<00:02:36.020> song<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:37.100> going<00:02:37.310> over<00:02:37.460> really<00:02:38.150> good

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
new song and it's going over really good

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.920 
new song and it's going over really good
guess<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.110> only<00:02:39.320> difference<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.800> that

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
guess the only difference is that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.780 
guess the only difference is that
kind<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.380> swapping<00:02:41.590> out<00:02:41.830> beyond<00:02:42.220> mainstage
