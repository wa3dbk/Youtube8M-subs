00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.469
 at 5.5 my guest of the day jonathan 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.599
 massed from the bill bill thomas jonathan 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 montjean filimon people at all were doing 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.250
 all this friday direction vincennes 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 with the price of those vanak a test 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.630
 for mares 6 7 and 8 years old on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.269
 2700 meters from the big track 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.130
 the summary will begin the issue by 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.960
 the quinté + 5.5 analysis will follow the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.079
 pronoun of our consultant without forgetting 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 the game board I remind you that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.559
 if you are not yet customer turf 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 a welcome bonus of 200 euros I 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.559
 not talking to you about jackpot that needs to be 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 currently a little over 12000 euros 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.820
 so it's interesting we're just 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.039
 after the holidays you have to enjoy 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.600
 those who are late for gifts hurry 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.890
 you play you win you it's simple 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 precisely to win we will do 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.660
 trust jonathan with a favorite 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.910
 all indicated the number 15 nefertiti del 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.899
 rio she just won at this level 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.699
 whose price amboise 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.450
 she is again deferré of the four 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.100
 his mentor is confident logic everything to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.110
 done at the very very little commitment 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
 it's an Italian mare comes from 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.370
 take off the Amboise price 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.159
 fashion easily bring back on a 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.109
 platter by his boxing companion 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.479
 that's life that will be shod in this 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.399
 opportunity there is nothing against this 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.229
 that she doubled the bet in this quinté 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.969
 which appears a little less noticeable 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.789
 only last, so we can 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.899
 trust 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.069
 we will follow you we will even do 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.409
 trust and we will trust him 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.270
 she opposes her dauphine 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.700
 it has indeed come to rank 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.020
 second of the same price of amboise the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.490
 number 10 tiva of the fret 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 it's training the white is the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.920
 irreproachable form we can not 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.810
 dismiss 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.119
 she tirelessly repeats her value 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.780
 returning from trotting 13 twice 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.119
 on the course 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.049
 she has already trotted 12.9 on a course 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.270
 but it was déferré of the previous ones 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.250
 will leave one that make breaks 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.590
 like last time with franck nivard 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.939
 have to go on then by leaving and then 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.950
 after we will certainly find her 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.450
 very quickly at the head of the event and at 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.979
 try to go as far as possible and 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.590
 she deserves to win a test 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.299
 like this one so oppose what she 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.500
 repeat okay it's trust and the 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.019
 pro even reverse the trend and 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.150
 may have been ahead of hockey in 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.160
 third position trinity number 3 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.260
 jiel beautiful last race 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.220
 mistrust it's the devil jos verbeeck at 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.450
 sulky 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.889
 training was enough confidence 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.920
 it makes sense for the station since then 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.359
 five there was unlucky last 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 place several times before 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.930
 draw a remarkable end of the race 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.620
 so I do not hesitate to place it in 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.650
 third position prognosis 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.389
 it was gone then puts to 4 small to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.530
 him and standing a little bit 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.209
 closer in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.800
 avoiding traffic worries must 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.720
 logically traced a superb end of 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.760
 race and rank at in the three 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.290
 first of his straight ok ok listen and 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.480
 yeah I am personally I am 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.220
 convinced in fourth position the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.350
 number 9 global insight 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.520
 so we announce that this is his last 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.620
 race since it should pass 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.510
 same mares she owns 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.489
 incontestable ways it smells a little 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.870
 the aim is not for the 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.030
 wins but on the teeth the 5 c is 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.590
 also logical for his first attempt at 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.380
 Vincennes has proven to be the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.900
 painting of Parisian quintés putting 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.640
 French wrong half way straight and rai 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.370
 was well restarted to finish third 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.280
 the lot is once again in his 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.420
 ropes 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.730
 normally it makes sense to have it 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.860
 repeated at the end of a good course and 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.260
 then leveque stone are all good with 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.060
 and it's one of the finer and its lows 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.220
 clumsy of an ample of the torre and 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.170
 it's clear so we trust him 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.230
 a poker shot in fifth position 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.890
 with the number 11 brasse palema then that 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.680
 starts in France 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.140
 now it's free of four jmb 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.000
 the sulky must be wary what everything to 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.620
 done after the only small restriction 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.180
 it's the fact that it starts in France 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.160
 told me that often the first is the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.870
 good after that goals especially on 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.670
 the distance but it will be deferrée 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.900
 four feet to the original 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.120
 American 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.790
 we will see but she has already beaten in her 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.320
 global country midnight and at the lines 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.760
 with tam lasser bars that are 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.280
 references in europe 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.810
 so this is a test shot but it 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.420
 could be a master shot 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.250
 entrance so 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.890
 I advise you to beware of her 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.109
 especially with these jmb devils agree 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.329
 ok i 'm waiting for it i was asking you a the 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.660
 reminder of your selection is worth 8 so the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:27.370
 15 nov craft rio the say tiva of the 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.910
 fret the 3 trinity jiel the new which 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.530
 will be global midnight on May 10th at 11 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:38.169
 breaststroke palema the finishes ademe the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.510
 two princess photos and to finish the 12 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.910
 sarine so agree with all these 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.560
 horses there we went on a 5/5 field 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.970
 reduced by 3 horses three bases which at 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.610
 paper you'll understand seems pretty 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.820
 logic the 15 says it the 3 behind we have 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.810
 added on 2 the 9 the 11 the 12 the 14 the 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.940
 16 and 17 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.650
 a game that will cost 21 euros one can 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.210
 play at 50% you can play at 10% 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.979
 I remind you there is a jackpot of 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.870
 more than 12000 euros we do not hesitate 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.530
 dark 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.720
 I wait everything is said or almost 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.130
 almost at the pike played there is more than 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.120
 to play there is more than touched hoping 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.800
 Proceed to checkout 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.790
