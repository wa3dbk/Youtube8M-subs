00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.030 

here's<00:00:01.089> an<00:00:01.240> old<00:00:01.420> wine<00:00:01.960> press<00:00:02.260> I<00:00:02.440> built<00:00:02.710> several

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.040 
here's an old wine press I built several

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.180 
here's an old wine press I built several
years<00:00:03.400> ago<00:00:04.440> take<00:00:05.440> just<00:00:05.740> took<00:00:05.830> it<00:00:05.980> out<00:00:06.069> of

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.190 
years ago take just took it out of

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.009 
years ago take just took it out of
storage<00:00:06.430> it's<00:00:06.819> due<00:00:07.240> for<00:00:07.509> a<00:00:07.569> really<00:00:07.839> good

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.019 
storage it's due for a really good

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.829 
storage it's due for a really good
cleaning<00:00:08.320> but<00:00:08.829> basically<00:00:09.759> the<00:00:10.059> framework<00:00:10.539> is

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839 
cleaning but basically the framework is

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.279 
cleaning but basically the framework is
made<00:00:11.259> like<00:00:11.579> kind<00:00:12.579> of<00:00:12.610> like<00:00:12.669> a<00:00:12.820> guillotine<00:00:13.289> the

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:14.289 
made like kind of like a guillotine the

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.750 
made like kind of like a guillotine the
top<00:00:14.559> plate<00:00:15.059> gets<00:00:16.059> pressed<00:00:16.510> down<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:18.460> use<00:00:18.730> a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760 
top plate gets pressed down and I use a

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.720 
top plate gets pressed down and I use a
scissor<00:00:19.090> jack<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.750> do<00:00:19.960> that<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:20.730> basically

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
scissor jack to do that and basically

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.910 
scissor jack to do that and basically
it's<00:00:22.270> kind<00:00:22.660> of<00:00:22.690> like<00:00:22.810> solid<00:00:23.440> because<00:00:23.560> I<00:00:23.650> put

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
it's kind of like solid because I put

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.190 
it's kind of like solid because I put
stuff<00:00:24.190> in<00:00:24.400> just<00:00:24.670> to<00:00:24.790> demonstrate<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.930> where

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
stuff in just to demonstrate so where

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.560 
stuff in just to demonstrate so where
you<00:00:26.320> see<00:00:26.590> between<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.250> plates<00:00:27.520> there<00:00:27.910> would

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
you see between the plates there would

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.639 
you see between the plates there would
normally<00:00:29.050> be<00:00:29.260> your<00:00:29.530> bag<00:00:29.830> of<00:00:30.160> mash<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.379> use

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
normally be your bag of mash what I use

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.209 
normally be your bag of mash what I use
for<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.280> bag<00:00:33.519> is<00:00:33.789> that<00:00:34.499> you<00:00:35.499> can<00:00:35.679> use<00:00:35.829> any<00:00:36.039> kind

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
for the bag is that you can use any kind

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.139 
for the bag is that you can use any kind
of<00:00:36.370> nylon<00:00:36.960> anything<00:00:37.960> strong<00:00:38.289> enough<00:00:38.319> to<00:00:38.800> hold

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
of nylon anything strong enough to hold

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.319 
of nylon anything strong enough to hold
fruit<00:00:40.149> and<00:00:40.420> it<00:00:40.989> can<00:00:41.170> be<00:00:41.199> crushed<00:00:41.620> without

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
fruit and it can be crushed without

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.750 
fruit and it can be crushed without
without<00:00:43.329> wrecking<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.899> bag<00:00:44.109> so<00:00:44.499> some<00:00:45.460> people

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
without wrecking the bag so some people

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.469 
without wrecking the bag so some people
use<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.379> washed<00:00:47.379> nylons<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.519> double<00:00:49.269> them<00:00:49.359> up

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
use a washed nylons and double them up

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.809 
use a washed nylons and double them up
and<00:00:50.140> then<00:00:50.260> tie<00:00:50.440> them<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.339> if<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.579> put<00:00:51.760> your

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:51.819 
and then tie them so if you put your

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.540 
and then tie them so if you put your
fruit<00:00:52.809> in<00:00:53.050> between<00:00:53.469> there<00:00:53.710> these<00:00:54.339> are

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
fruit in between there these are

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.689 
fruit in between there these are
hardwood<00:00:54.969> plates<00:00:55.359> so<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.460> they're<00:00:57.460> really

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
hardwood plates so that they're really

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.079 
hardwood plates so that they're really
easy<00:00:57.819> to<00:00:58.179> clean<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.449> disinfect<00:00:59.729> this<00:01:00.729> is<00:01:00.909> all

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
easy to clean and disinfect this is all

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.430 
easy to clean and disinfect this is all
hard<00:01:01.420> wood<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:02.159> stainless<00:01:03.159> screws<00:01:04.440> now

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
hard wood and stainless screws now

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.580 
hard wood and stainless screws now
anything<00:01:06.130> here<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.640> touches<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.320> food<00:01:08.320> is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
anything here that touches the food is

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.100 
anything here that touches the food is
all<00:01:09.010> cleanable<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:10.150> course<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.660> has<00:01:10.840> been<00:01:10.960> in

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
all cleanable of course this has been in

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.290 
all cleanable of course this has been in
storage<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:11.710> it's<00:01:11.860> it<00:01:12.760> really<00:01:13.030> needs<00:01:13.240> a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
storage so it's it really needs a

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.040 
storage so it's it really needs a
cleaning<00:01:13.980> now<00:01:14.980> on<00:01:15.280> this<00:01:15.520> bottom<00:01:16.050> catchment

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
cleaning now on this bottom catchment

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.460 
cleaning now on this bottom catchment
plate<00:01:17.590> there's<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.610> hole<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.450> it's<00:01:19.780> slightly

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
plate there's a hole and it's slightly

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.320 
plate there's a hole and it's slightly
out<00:01:20.830> of<00:01:20.860> level<00:01:21.310> on<00:01:21.430> purpose<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.090> it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
out of level on purpose so that it

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.720
