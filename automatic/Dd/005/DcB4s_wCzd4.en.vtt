all right

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.700 
all right
I<00:01:19.880> guess<00:01:20.510> that's<00:01:20.750> how<00:01:20.870> he<00:01:20.930> keeps<00:01:21.290> his<00:01:23.710> horn

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
I guess that's how he keeps his horn

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.020 
I guess that's how he keeps his horn
sharp<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.810> think

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.230 

hopefully<00:01:30.720> he<00:01:30.810> won't<00:01:30.900> poke<00:01:31.110> his<00:01:31.229> eye<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.560> but

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
hopefully he won't poke his eye out but

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:49.249 
hopefully he won't poke his eye out but
because<00:01:33.240> he<00:01:33.390> knows<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:33.659> he's<00:01:33.750> doing

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.970 

we<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.740> sit<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.219> observe
