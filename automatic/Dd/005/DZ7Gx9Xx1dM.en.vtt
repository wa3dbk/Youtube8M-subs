finally I peel away the tape covering

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.479 
finally I peel away the tape covering
the<00:03:21.010> pinhole<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.519> let<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.060> light<00:03:22.239> through<00:03:23.489> 12

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
the pinhole and let the light through 12

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.460 
the pinhole and let the light through 12
it's<00:03:25.239> important<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.959> hold<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.260> camera
