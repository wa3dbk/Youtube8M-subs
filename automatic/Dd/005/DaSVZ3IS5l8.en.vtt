tools<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.210> very<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.079> club<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
tools so I'm very very in this club and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.100 
tools so I'm very very in this club and
it's<00:00:40.829> used<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> detect<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:42.270> different<00:00:42.629> finger

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it's used to detect my different finger

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
it's used to detect my different finger
gestures<00:00:43.469> used<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.340> different<00:00:44.520> operations

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
gestures used for different operations

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.630 
gestures used for different operations
in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> body<00:00:46.079> after<00:00:46.230> system<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.579> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
in the body after system so for this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.420 
in the body after system so for this
particular<00:00:47.820> glove<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:49.440> attach<00:00:49.739> several<00:00:50.160> piece

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
particular glove we attach several piece

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.240 
particular glove we attach several piece
of<00:00:50.579> conductive<00:00:51.090> cloth<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> clubs<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
of conductive cloth on the clubs so as I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639 
of conductive cloth on the clubs so as I
I'm<00:00:54.239> doing<00:00:54.629> certain<00:00:54.899> gestures<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I'm doing certain gestures the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.170 
I'm doing certain gestures the
electrodes<00:00:56.219> will<00:00:56.430> touch<00:00:56.579> each<00:00:56.699> other<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
electrodes will touch each other and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
electrodes will touch each other and
actually<00:00:57.390> generate<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.109> most<00:00:58.440> events<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.309> is

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
actually generate a most events which is

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.420 
actually generate a most events which is
sent<00:01:00.059> wirelessly<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> PC<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
sent wirelessly to the PC so this is

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
sent wirelessly to the PC so this is
more<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> kind<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.359> short<00:01:03.600> term<00:01:03.780> solution<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
more a kind of short term solution to

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
more a kind of short term solution to
enable<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.909> colleagues

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
enable that and then we have colleagues

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
enable that and then we have colleagues
also<00:01:06.750> from<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.200> cell<00:01:07.380> research<00:01:07.680> working<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
also from my cell research working on

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
also from my cell research working on
using<00:01:08.610> Kinect<00:01:09.060> cameras<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.439> it's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
using Kinect cameras of it have it's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
using Kinect cameras of it have it's
gonna<00:01:10.770> finger<00:01:11.159> gesture<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> future<00:01:12.420> we

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
gonna finger gesture in the future we

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
gonna finger gesture in the future we
hope<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> combine<00:01:13.350> those<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.680> technologies

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
hope to combine those two technologies

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.289 
hope to combine those two technologies
to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.580> able<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> same<00:01:15.240> kind

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to be able to do the same kind

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
to be able to do the same kind
operations<00:01:15.990> using<00:01:16.320> bare<00:01:16.470> hands<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.670> know

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
operations using bare hands as you know

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
operations using bare hands as you know
today<00:01:18.119> when<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.390> play<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> keno<00:01:18.990> game<00:01:19.200> you'll

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
today when you play a keno game you'll

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
today when you play a keno game you'll
be<00:01:19.590> using<00:01:19.860> virtual<00:01:20.520> characters<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.180> avatars

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
be using virtual characters or avatars

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.200 
be using virtual characters or avatars
to<00:01:22.110> represent<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> game<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.090> if

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
to represent you in the game but what if

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
to represent you in the game but what if
you<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> create<00:01:24.810> something<00:01:25.020> completely

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you want to create something completely

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
you want to create something completely
out<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.580> own<00:01:26.700> imagination<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.450> unique

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
out of your own imagination more unique

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.440 
out of your own imagination more unique
for<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.490> example<00:01:29.640> I'll<00:01:29.909> show<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.180> is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
for you so one example I'll show you is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.399 
for you so one example I'll show you is
it's<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> butterfly

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's a butterfly

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.480 
it's a butterfly
so<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:32.909> start<00:01:33.090> by<00:01:33.860> post<00:01:34.860> posing<00:01:35.400> any

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
so I can just start by post posing any

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
so I can just start by post posing any
posture<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.229> initial<00:01:37.590> shape

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
posture as I like as the initial shape

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.580 
posture as I like as the initial shape
of<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.430> avatar<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.930> case<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> very

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
of my avatar so in this case a very

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
of my avatar so in this case a very
simple<00:01:40.920> example<00:01:40.979> at<00:01:41.790> standing<00:01:42.299> posture<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
simple example at standing posture and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.760 
simple example at standing posture and
now<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.399> become<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> main<00:01:45.030> body<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.509> my

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
now this it become the main body of my

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.700 
now this it become the main body of my
avatar<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> anything<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:47.729> from<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.119> point

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
avatar and anything I do from this point

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.260 
avatar and anything I do from this point
to<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:49.829> body<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> effect<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
to my body will have the effect the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020
