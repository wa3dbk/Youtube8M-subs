the back it's very comfortable and

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.170 
the back it's very comfortable and
there's<00:02:23.260> nothing<00:02:23.740> impeding<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.850> if<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
there's nothing impeding that if you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.070 
there's nothing impeding that if you
fell<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.560> has<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.740> very<00:02:27.180> soft<00:02:28.180> pat<00:02:28.570> on<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.810> back

fell it has a very soft pat on the back

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.870 
fell it has a very soft pat on the back
so<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.440> distributes<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.130> force<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:30.700> there's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
so it distributes the force so there's

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.270 
so it distributes the force so there's
nothing<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.900> bruise<00:02:32.800> or<00:02:32.860> hurt

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.740 
nothing that's going to bruise or hurt
you<00:02:33.430> if<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.730> fall<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.210> so<00:02:34.450> it's<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.720> very
