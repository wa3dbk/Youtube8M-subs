here at three counties echo on hospital
and<00:00:15.770> we're<00:00:15.920> in<00:00:16.130> the<00:00:16.540> radiography<00:00:17.540> suite<00:00:17.930> which

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
and we're in the radiography suite which

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.160 
and we're in the radiography suite which
is<00:00:18.530> the<00:00:19.070> x-ray<00:00:19.610> suite<00:00:19.939> where<00:00:20.210> horses<00:00:20.990> are

x-ray<00:00:46.550> again<00:00:46.820> it's<00:00:47.120> conducted<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.170> room

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
x-ray again it's conducted in this room

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.189 
x-ray again it's conducted in this room
using<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:49.789> machine<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.899> machine

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
using this machine this machine

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.040 
using this machine this machine
generates<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.190> x-rays<00:00:52.609> that<00:00:53.300> are<00:00:53.510> emitted

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
generates the x-rays that are emitted

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.150 
generates the x-rays that are emitted
from<00:00:54.609> this<00:00:55.609> head<00:00:55.910> here<00:00:56.359> and<00:00:56.859> they're<00:00:57.859> picked

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
from this head here and they're picked

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.529 
from this head here and they're picked
up<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.699> plate<00:00:59.469> this<00:01:00.469> is<00:01:00.620> an<00:01:01.010> x-ray<00:01:01.370> plate<00:01:01.640> and

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
up on a plate this is an x-ray plate and

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.620 
up on a plate this is an x-ray plate and
an<00:01:03.320> image<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.829> generated<00:01:04.460> in<00:01:04.580> there<00:01:04.850> on<00:01:05.180> the

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
an image is generated in there on the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.620 
an image is generated in there on the
plate<00:01:05.900> which<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.410> computer<00:01:07.120> processes<00:01:08.120> into

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
plate which the computer processes into

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.149 
plate which the computer processes into
the<00:01:08.750> image<00:01:08.930> on<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.140> screen<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:09.650> we<00:01:09.770> can<00:01:09.950> see

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
the image on the screen that we can see

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.640 
the image on the screen that we can see
so<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:10.850> all<00:01:10.940> done<00:01:11.150> digitally<00:01:11.390> there<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:12.500> no

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
so it's all done digitally there is no

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.910 
so it's all done digitally there is no
no<00:01:13.250> film<00:01:13.670> in<00:01:13.940> as<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.960> used<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.470> be<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.710> old

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
no film in as the used to be in the old

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.060 
no film in as the used to be in the old
days<00:01:16.540> this<00:01:17.540> machine<00:01:17.960> can<00:01:18.200> be<00:01:18.680> moved<00:01:18.890> around

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
days this machine can be moved around

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.900 
days this machine can be moved around
quite<00:01:19.750> easily<00:01:20.750> up<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.920> down<00:01:22.100> side<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.490> side

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
quite easily up and down side to side

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.690 
quite easily up and down side to side
and<00:01:23.210> twisted<00:01:23.660> our<00:01:24.500> patient<00:01:24.980> or<00:01:25.070> standing<00:01:25.520> here

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
and twisted our patient or standing here

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.970 
and twisted our patient or standing here
sedated<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.900> we<00:01:27.410> can<00:01:27.590> move<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.860> machine

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
sedated and we can move the machine

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.280 
sedated and we can move the machine
around<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:28.670> take<00:01:29.240> as<00:01:29.420> many<00:01:29.540> x-rays<00:01:29.990> as<00:01:30.170> we

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
around and take as many x-rays as we

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.100 
around and take as many x-rays as we

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
investigate a horse's problems that it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.130 
investigate a horse's problems that it
may<00:01:39.080> be<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.350> an<00:01:39.740> animals<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> bone<00:01:40.700> scam

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
may be that an animals have a bone scam

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.100 
may be that an animals have a bone scam
where<00:01:42.220> problems<00:01:43.220> are<00:01:43.460> detected<00:01:43.870> within<00:01:44.870> the

where problems are detected within the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.770 
where problems are detected within the
bones<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:46.190> can<00:01:46.490> discuss<00:01:46.910> that<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.630> another

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
bones we can discuss that in another

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.460 
bones we can discuss that in another
area<00:01:48.470> but<00:01:49.040> as<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.760> result<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.180> that<00:01:50.270> we<00:01:51.020> may<00:01:51.170> end

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
area but as a result of that we may end

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.200 
area but as a result of that we may end
up<00:01:51.650> in<00:01:51.800> here<00:01:52.070> taking<00:01:52.580> some<00:01:52.850> x-rays

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
up in here taking some x-rays

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.480 
up in here taking some x-rays
alternatively<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.620> may<00:01:54.680> be<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.040> horse<00:01:55.280> that's

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
alternatively it may be a horse that's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.250 
alternatively it may be a horse that's
been<00:01:55.700> lame<00:01:56.000> it's<00:01:56.330> has<00:01:56.540> some<00:01:56.750> nerve<00:01:56.930> blocks

been lame it's has some nerve blocks

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.040 
been lame it's has some nerve blocks
done<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.800> an<00:01:58.610> area<00:01:59.120> of<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.300> horse's<00:01:59.660> leg<00:01:59.870> has

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
done and an area of the horse's leg has

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.680 
done and an area of the horse's leg has
been<00:02:00.640> isolated<00:02:01.640> as<00:02:01.760> being<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.150> painful<00:02:02.570> area

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
been isolated as being the painful area

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.150 
been isolated as being the painful area
and<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.530> first<00:02:03.770> place<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.250> go<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.880> usually

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
and the first place to go to is usually
