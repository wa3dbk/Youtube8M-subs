lot<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.690> salt<00:00:10.110> we're<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.190> need<00:00:11.340> soap<00:00:11.670> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
lot of salt we're going to need soap and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.870 
lot of salt we're going to need soap and
a<00:00:12.269> third<00:00:12.540> glass<00:00:12.840> just<00:00:13.380> half<00:00:13.740> full<00:00:14.250> glass<00:00:14.670> of

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
a third glass just half full glass of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880 
a third glass just half full glass of
water<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.450> want<00:00:15.750> some<00:00:16.020> extra<00:00:16.500> water<00:00:16.710> in

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
water and you want some extra water in

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.439 
water and you want some extra water in
the<00:00:17.070> bottom<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.730> then<00:00:17.940> we're<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> need

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the bottom and then we're going to need

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.660 
the bottom and then we're going to need
tea<00:00:18.750> eggs<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.680> spoon<00:00:20.039> let's<00:00:20.369> check<00:00:20.520> out

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
tea eggs and a spoon let's check out

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
tea eggs and a spoon let's check out
what<00:00:20.880> we're<00:00:21.029> gonna<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> be

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
what we're gonna do this is going to be

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.830 
what we're gonna do this is going to be
water<00:00:22.650> density<00:00:23.029> experiment<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.510> we've<00:00:24.689> got

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
water density experiment so we've got

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259 
water density experiment so we've got
regular<00:00:25.080> water<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.369> stop<00:00:26.609> water<00:00:26.880> gonna

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
regular water here just stop water gonna

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.830 
regular water here just stop water gonna
drop<00:00:27.570> an<00:00:27.750> egg<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.140> we'll<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.590> what<00:00:28.769> happens

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
drop an egg and we'll see what happens

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.799 
drop an egg and we'll see what happens
you<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.740> sound<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.360> know<00:00:33.510> any

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you see it's sound like you know any

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
you see it's sound like you know any
normal<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.500> would<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.250> probably<00:00:35.460> will<00:00:35.880> sink

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
normal it would do it probably will sink

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
normal it would do it probably will sink
in<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> water<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> really

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
in the water but this is like a really

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.869 
in the water but this is like a really
salty<00:00:38.910> water<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.420> put<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> salt<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> then

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
salty water I put a lot of salt and then

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.700 
salty water I put a lot of salt and then
let's<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.690> we're<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> drop<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.530> egg

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
let's see we're going to drop an egg

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.229 
let's see we're going to drop an egg
carefully<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.539> floats<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:47.219> salty<00:00:47.670> water

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
carefully and it floats in a salty water

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630 
carefully and it floats in a salty water
because<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.899> density<00:00:49.500> right<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
because it density right and we got the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.810 
because it density right and we got the
third<00:00:50.969> glass<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.140> water<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.579> then

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
third glass of water right here and then

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
third glass of water right here and then
I<00:00:53.850> put<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> lot<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.570> salt<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.949> how

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I put a lot of salt in there you see how

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.420 
I put a lot of salt in there you see how
much<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:59.030> mix<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:01.399> make<00:01:02.399> sure

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
much so that would mix it up make sure

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.700 
much so that would mix it up make sure
it<00:01:02.730> makes<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.149> good<00:01:03.390> let's<00:01:03.960> put<00:01:04.290> some<00:01:04.530> more

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it makes it good let's put some more

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.460 
it makes it good let's put some more
salt<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:06.320> we're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.590> put<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:09.470> egg

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
salt in now we're going to put this egg

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
salt in now we're going to put this egg
in<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.040> let's<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.670> floats<00:01:12.060> as

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in there and let's see if it's floats as

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.249 
in there and let's see if it's floats as
you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.830> egg<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.310> flow<00:01:14.670> tonight

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
you can see that egg is flow tonight

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.810 
you can see that egg is flow tonight
alright<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> put<00:01:17.310> our<00:01:17.549> goal

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
alright now we're going to put our goal

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.719 
alright now we're going to put our goal
of<00:01:17.939> water<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.479> top<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> egg<00:01:20.159> like

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
of water on top of the egg like

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.210 
of water on top of the egg like
carefully<00:01:21.479> you're<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> mean<00:01:25.040> see<00:01:26.040> what

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
carefully you're not I mean see what

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.609 
carefully you're not I mean see what
happens

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.609 

the<00:01:33.159> egg<00:01:33.430> actually<00:01:34.180> stays<00:01:35.049> in<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.619> middle<00:01:37.619> why

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
the egg actually stays in the middle why

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.300 
the egg actually stays in the middle why
is<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:40.030> funny<00:01:40.470> check<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.590> out<00:01:41.740> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
is that is that funny check it out the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.080 
is that is that funny check it out the
non<00:01:42.549> salty<00:01:43.210> water<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:44.229> egg<00:01:44.500> sinks<00:01:45.250> salty

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
non salty water the egg sinks salty

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.740 
non salty water the egg sinks salty
water<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.899> egg<00:01:47.289> floats<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.310> why<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.179> this<00:01:49.479> egg

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
water the egg floats and why is this egg

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.320 
water the egg floats and why is this egg
floating<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.710> middle<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.310> tell<00:01:52.060> me<00:01:52.210> how
