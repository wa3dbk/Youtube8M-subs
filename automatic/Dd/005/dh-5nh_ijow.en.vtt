the<00:01:37.770> sequence<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.130> play<00:01:38.310> there's<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> be

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that is the end of the movement phase

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
that is the end of the movement phase
next<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> declare<00:01:48.090> our<00:01:48.240> comments<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
next we have to declare our comments and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
next we have to declare our comments and
a<00:01:48.930> pretty<00:01:49.170> self-explanatory<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:50.579> there's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a pretty self-explanatory here there's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.510 
a pretty self-explanatory here there's
nothing<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.890> say<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
nothing really really say it's going to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.270 
nothing really really say it's going to
be<00:01:53.670> him<00:01:54.210> against<00:01:54.570> these<00:01:54.750> two<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.829> forth<00:01:56.130> up

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
be him against these two and so forth up

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.959 
be him against these two and so forth up
the<00:01:56.399> line<00:01:56.579> we'll<00:01:56.880> go<00:01:57.030> ahead<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> start<00:01:57.600> here

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
the line we'll go ahead and start here

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.310 
the line we'll go ahead and start here
since<00:01:59.969> French<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.329> lower<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.659> morale<00:02:01.049> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
since French are lower and morale it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.160 
since French are lower and morale it
might<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.619> worthwhile<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.420> spend<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:03.960> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
might be worthwhile to spend one here to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.630 
might be worthwhile to spend one here to
see<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.500> couldn't<00:02:04.740> route<00:02:04.979> both<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.549> these

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
see if we couldn't route both of these

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.540 
see if we couldn't route both of these
guys<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.540> an<00:02:06.659> early<00:02:07.020> lead<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.340> French

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
guys and get an early lead so the French

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.949 
guys and get an early lead so the French
are<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.209> or<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.629> others<00:02:09.840> are

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
are actually going to or the others are

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.530 
are actually going to or the others are
rather<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> spend<00:02:10.950> them<00:02:11.039> around

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
rather going to spend them around

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.170 
rather going to spend them around
they're<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> roll<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> die

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
they're going to roll a die

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.929 
they're going to roll a die
and<00:02:14.299> crap<00:02:14.750> they<00:02:14.959> roll<00:02:15.109> the<00:02:15.200> one<00:02:15.379> Wow<00:02:16.010> so

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
and crap they roll the one Wow so

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.339 
and crap they roll the one Wow so
looking<00:02:17.599> at<00:02:17.719> the<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.290> table<00:02:18.680> had<00:02:20.230> had<00:02:21.230> they

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
looking at the the table had had they

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.110 
looking at the the table had had they
not<00:02:21.530> spent<00:02:21.950> them<00:02:22.069> around<00:02:22.219> point<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
not spent them around point the the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.030 
not spent them around point the the
Prussian<00:02:23.870> unit<00:02:24.079> would<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:24.230> rounded<00:02:24.590> instead

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
Prussian unit would have rounded instead

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
Prussian unit would have rounded instead
it's<00:02:25.159> going<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.790> plus<00:02:26.209> one<00:02:26.540> column<00:02:27.319> and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
it's going to be a plus one column and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.940 
it's going to be a plus one column and
add<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.099> role<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.400> one<00:02:28.609> is<00:02:28.819> attacker<00:02:29.299> withdraws

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
add I role of one is attacker withdraws

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.789 
add I role of one is attacker withdraws
so<00:02:30.950> he's<00:02:31.129> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.370> fall<00:02:31.579> back<00:02:31.819> one<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.799> the

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
so he's going to fall back one and the

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.399 
so he's going to fall back one and the
attack<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.310> defender<00:02:34.700> must<00:02:35.120> advance<00:02:35.629> since

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
attack the defender must advance since

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.839 
attack the defender must advance since
one<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.709> them<00:02:36.829> is<00:02:36.920> covering<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.549> them<00:02:37.670> must

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
one of them is covering one of them must

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.929 
one of them is covering one of them must
advance<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.659> it<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.319> probably<00:02:40.219> a<00:02:40.639> good<00:02:40.879> idea

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
advance and it is probably a good idea

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.539 
advance and it is probably a good idea
to<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.659> ahead<00:02:41.689> and<00:02:42.109> advance<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:43.069> one<00:02:43.310> here

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
to go ahead and advance this one here

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.129 
to go ahead and advance this one here
that<00:02:44.150> allows<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.689> one<00:02:44.930> some

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
that allows this one some

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.780 
that allows this one some
maneuverability<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.129> flank<00:02:46.989> up<00:02:47.989> here

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
maneuverability on the flank up here

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.740 
maneuverability on the flank up here
whoops<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.090> know<00:02:50.209> what<00:02:50.359> let's<00:02:50.540> backtrack

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
whoops you know what let's backtrack

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.750 
whoops you know what let's backtrack
this<00:02:51.230> because<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.680> forgot<00:02:52.810> do<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.310> reaction

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
this because I forgot do the reaction

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.300 
this because I forgot do the reaction
face<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.209> have<00:02:56.329> cavalry<00:02:56.870> engaged<00:02:57.200> oh<00:02:57.470> uh<00:02:57.620> hello

okay when cavalry are engaged with

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.530 
okay when cavalry are engaged with
somebody<00:03:00.859> there's<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.099> reaction<00:03:01.669> phase<00:03:02.150> as<00:03:02.389> we

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
somebody there's a reaction phase as we

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.420 
somebody there's a reaction phase as we
saw<00:03:02.719> on<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.079> sequence<00:03:03.439> of<00:03:03.530> play<00:03:03.739> see<00:03:04.280> right

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
saw on the sequence of play see right

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.770 
saw on the sequence of play see right
here<00:03:04.549> after<00:03:04.849> movement<00:03:05.239> there's<00:03:05.419> enemy

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
here after movement there's enemy

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.449 
here after movement there's enemy
reaction<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.859> we're<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.040> going<00:03:07.219> to<00:03:07.250> forget

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
reaction and we're just going to forget

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.899 
reaction and we're just going to forget
what<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:07.939> combat<00:03:08.659> result<00:03:09.019> was<00:03:09.200> earlier

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
what that combat result was earlier

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.119 
what that combat result was earlier
here's<00:03:10.909> what<00:03:11.150> can<00:03:11.239> happen<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.680> first<00:03:12.889> Corps

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
here's what can happen the first Corps

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.569 
here's what can happen the first Corps
could<00:03:13.489> simply<00:03:14.060> back<00:03:14.719> up<00:03:14.959> one<00:03:15.290> hex<00:03:15.530> or<00:03:15.829> if<00:03:16.459> he

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
could simply back up one hex or if he

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.309 
could simply back up one hex or if he
was<00:03:16.700> aggressive<00:03:16.969> he<00:03:17.419> could<00:03:17.569> counter<00:03:17.989> charge

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
was aggressive he could counter charge

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.759 
was aggressive he could counter charge
counter<00:03:19.129> charging<00:03:19.549> might<00:03:19.760> not<00:03:19.940> be<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.180> bad<00:03:20.269> idea

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
counter charging might not be a bad idea

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.460 
counter charging might not be a bad idea
when<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.859> counter<00:03:22.250> charge<00:03:22.549> though<00:03:23.470> what'll

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
when you counter charge though what'll

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.949 
when you counter charge though what'll
happen<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.549> attacks<00:03:25.909> drink<00:03:26.239> is<00:03:26.389> doubled

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
happen is the attacks drink is doubled

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.530 
happen is the attacks drink is doubled
now<00:03:27.620> in<00:03:27.769> this<00:03:27.889> case<00:03:28.159> he'd<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.579> two<00:03:28.879> versus

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
now in this case he'd be a two versus

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.289 
now in this case he'd be a two versus
three<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:31.489> would<00:03:31.579> put<00:03:31.699> him<00:03:31.819> on<00:03:31.909> the<00:03:31.939> minus

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
three that would put him on the minus

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.259 
three that would put him on the minus
one<00:03:32.510> column<00:03:32.870> probably<00:03:33.680> not<00:03:33.889> a<00:03:33.919> good<00:03:34.220> idea<00:03:34.280> so

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
one column probably not a good idea so

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.509 
one column probably not a good idea so
if<00:03:35.689> he<00:03:36.169> was<00:03:36.290> really<00:03:36.650> aggressive<00:03:36.859> he<00:03:37.280> could

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
if he was really aggressive he could

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.640 
if he was really aggressive he could
counter<00:03:37.909> charge<00:03:38.180> otherwise<00:03:38.900> he<00:03:39.139> could<00:03:39.260> simply

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
counter charge otherwise he could simply

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.979 
counter charge otherwise he could simply
retreat<00:03:40.099> one<00:03:40.310> hacks<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:40.819> when<00:03:41.449> he<00:03:41.540> retreats

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
retreat one hacks and when he retreats

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.189 
retreat one hacks and when he retreats
the<00:03:42.530> attacker<00:03:42.859> cannot<00:03:43.370> advance<00:03:43.759> so<00:03:44.389> basically

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
the attacker cannot advance so basically

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.960 
the attacker cannot advance so basically
first<00:03:45.799> Corps<00:03:46.009> is<00:03:46.129> left<00:03:46.340> standing<00:03:46.669> there

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
first Corps is left standing there

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.080 
first Corps is left standing there
looking<00:03:47.209> silly<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:49.519> we'll<00:03:49.699> go<00:03:49.849> ahead<00:03:49.939> and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
looking silly and so we'll go ahead and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.569 
looking silly and so we'll go ahead and
now<00:03:50.359> implement<00:03:51.229> the<00:03:51.349> comment<00:03:52.159> result<00:03:52.459> from

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
now implement the comment result from

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.899 
now implement the comment result from
earlier<00:03:52.970> in<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.150> sequence<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.680> that's<00:03:55.639> the

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
earlier in the sequence so that's the

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.629 
earlier in the sequence so that's the
situation<00:03:56.709> lastly<00:03:57.709> we'll<00:03:57.979> do<00:03:58.099> first<00:03:58.310> Corps

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
situation lastly we'll do first Corps

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.309 
situation lastly we'll do first Corps
here<00:03:58.909> against<00:03:59.120> first<00:03:59.419> Corps<00:03:59.720> and<00:03:59.959> it's<00:04:00.199> going
