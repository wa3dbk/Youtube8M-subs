then take a section and run my fingers
through<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.320> section<00:00:56.270> okay<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.629> we'll<00:00:58.170> wrap

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
through that section okay and we'll wrap

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.900 
through that section okay and we'll wrap
it<00:00:58.410> around<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.949> outside<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> curling

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it around the outside of the curling

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.049 
it around the outside of the curling
iron<00:01:00.000> just<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.660> did<00:01:01.039> and<00:01:02.039> we'll<00:01:02.670> hold<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
iron just like you did and we'll hold it

iron just like you did and we'll hold it
for<00:01:03.390> four<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.110> five<00:01:04.140> seconds<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
for four or five seconds just like you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.969 
for four or five seconds just like you
did<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> let<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.860> either

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
did and when we let it go you can either

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.870 
did and when we let it go you can either
re<00:01:11.580> wrap<00:01:12.830> or<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.280> something<00:01:14.580> even

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
re wrap or you can do something even

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.260 
re wrap or you can do something even
simpler<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:15.659> I'll<00:01:15.840> show<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.320> second

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
simpler which I'll show you in a second

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.200 
simpler which I'll show you in a second
this<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> trick<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> clip<00:01:20.520> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
this is the trick you want to clip that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.380 
this is the trick you want to clip that
hair<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.470> curled<00:01:22.970> while<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
hair that you just curled while it's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.730 
hair that you just curled while it's
still<00:01:24.720> hot<00:01:25.220> because<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> minute<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.850> drop<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
still hot because the minute you drop it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
still hot because the minute you drop it
while<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:29.009> hot<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:30.090> loses<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.710> 60%<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:33.540> its

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
while it's hot it loses up to 60% of its

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.399 
while it's hot it loses up to 60% of its
of<00:01:34.530> its<00:01:34.680> curl<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> give<00:01:36.869> yourself<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of its curl so you give yourself a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.090 
of its curl so you give yourself a
couple<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:37.890> pumps<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> sculpting<00:01:39.329> spray

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
couple more pumps of the sculpting spray

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.230 
couple more pumps of the sculpting spray
we<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.490> bigger<00:01:41.670> size<00:01:43.369> iron<00:01:44.369> wrap<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
we use the bigger size iron wrap it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.280 
we use the bigger size iron wrap it
around<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.570> outside<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.799> did

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
around the outside just like you did

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
around the outside just like you did
you're<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.710> very<00:01:49.740> good<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.610> got<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you're you're very good you got it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.240 
you're you're very good you got it
really<00:01:51.210> close<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:51.899> fingers<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.470> hold<00:01:53.070> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
really close to your fingers and hold it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.090 
really close to your fingers and hold it
for<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.729> five<00:01:54.000> seconds<00:01:54.619> let<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.740> go

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.070 

you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.340> bunch<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.930> I

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
you can bunch it up if you want like I

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.630 
you can bunch it up if you want like I
was<00:02:01.229> saying<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.189> rewrap

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
was saying you know you have to rewrap

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.820 
was saying you know you have to rewrap
it<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.320> let<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.640> let<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.670> cool<00:02:06.270> around<00:02:07.170> that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
it and let it let it cool around that

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:21.890 
it and let it let it cool around that
newly<00:02:08.130> formed<00:02:08.700> shape<00:02:19.940> okay<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.000> I'm<00:02:21.690> going<00:02:21.840> to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
newly formed shape okay so I'm going to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.940 
newly formed shape okay so I'm going to
add<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.049> little<00:02:22.380> spray<00:02:24.110> just<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.350> very<00:02:25.650> little
