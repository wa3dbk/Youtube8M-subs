00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.549
 the monstrous range because two has 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.500
 two versions of motorization one that 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.110
 works with diesel and another with benzine 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.300
 both about maximum technology pointing 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.400
 to always be efficient units and to 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.839
 moment of needing an answer are 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.839
 agile and very powerful 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.580
 the oil engine works with a turbo 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.740
 intercooler and camera technology what 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.720
 means that a turbine increases the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.939
 air pressure and the motor enters the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.180
 intercooler cools the air to make it 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.570
 more efficient mix and rain truck 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.760
 is a system that significantly improves the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.070
 efficiency of injection the model with 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.800
 bencinero engine has 3.5 liters 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.220
 multi valve technology and a power 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.170
 that with its 186 hp will deliver all the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.299
 agility that your driving could 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.710
 need to be considered that the 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.170
 diesel engine performance is 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.729
 different to the bencinero engine will not feel 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.890
 a clear increase in power when the 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.949
 turbo system make your contribution last to 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.659
 1,800 rpm for your safety the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.970
 hood opening lever and 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.420
 fuel are located on 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.420
 the pedals 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.960
 in monteros because two has two 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.060
 transmission versions a manual 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 five speeds and an automatic 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.070
 Four-speed automatic option 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
 has the characteristic is port bou this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.880
 consists of the possibility of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.040
 select the march that one wants 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.890
 drive to give you more sportsmanship 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.960
 agility of overtaking and greater 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.150
 security in descents for greater 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.950
 safety on complicated roads or 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.030
 get where few can is that the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.950
 four-wheel drive system 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.410
 have different options for each 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.840
 situation of the sport motor axis 2 that is 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.240
 equipped with a super box is it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.940
 difference of 4x4 vehicles 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 conventional has four positions 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.110
 2h for an urban use means that the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.470
 energy will be transmitted to the ground 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 using the two rear wheels 4h for 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.119
 use of highways delivering the power 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.500
 four- wheel intelligently 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.660
 can be used dry pavement 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.520
 sliding is to say on roads of 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.140
 Wide lands and on the road loosen 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.080
 where you can maintain a speed 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.600
 higher this delivers greater security 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.220
 controlling in electronic form the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.050
 power distribution 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.600
 can be operated without need 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.730
 stop trying to do it online 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.060
 straight and up to a speed that does not 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.580
 exceed 100 kilometers per hour 24 hours 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.800
 lc this mode can be used in 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.900
 land in poor condition as it delivers the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.250
 power to the four wheels is not 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.890
 recommended for the use of roads 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.290
 dry or very closed curves this 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.520
 attraction can also be operated without 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.930
 need to stop 4l the end 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.940
 for this attraction is necessary 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.730
 stop putting the gear lever 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.070
 non-neutral exposure and then move the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.610
 Traction lever to position 4 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.080
 l 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.690
 lc sinking in motion 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.490
 this position corresponds to the traction 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.190
 on all four wheels with reduction of 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.540
 relationship this refers to changing the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.950
 ratio of the box reducing 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.890
 considerably the speed of 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.870
 vehicle but in turn delivering a 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.450
 considerable difference in what is 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.520
 force refers this option is 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.860
 recommended to travel on slopes 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.080
 very pronounced or when necessary 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.810
 tow or software land that has 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.540
 a high demand for road cases 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.910
 defective ground or slippery by 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.140
 water and the snow logo the system 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.500
 limited slip differential 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.190
 hybrid will be triggered automatically 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.690
 the lcd response is excellent 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.640
 controlling the position of the 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.250
 vehicle simply with the pressure of the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.500
 accelerator all this and more is what 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.450
 means montero sport g2 of mix widget 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.640
 years of development in search of 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.170
 deliver all the support reliability and 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.510
 versatility that the current world 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.400
 need we want to accompany you all 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.200
 the moments that require it but its 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.220
 office until the farthest you can 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.220
 arrive 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.220
 Y
