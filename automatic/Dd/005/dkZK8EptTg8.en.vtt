00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
greenhouse that you guys have built

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.100 
greenhouse that you guys have built
about<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:41.850> acre<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> half<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.809> correct

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
about an acre and a half that's correct

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.790 
about an acre and a half that's correct
you<00:00:43.260> said<00:00:43.500> why<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.670> darn<00:00:44.879> low<00:00:45.140> well<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you said why is it so darn low well in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.170 
you said why is it so darn low well in
the<00:00:46.950> wintertime<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.550> Texas<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.149> have

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the wintertime in Texas we have

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
the wintertime in Texas we have
situations<00:00:49.020> where<00:00:49.079> obviously<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.649> want<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
situations where obviously we want to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.049 
situations where obviously we want to
keep<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> greenhouses<00:00:50.579> pushpan<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:53.059> for

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
keep the greenhouses pushpan and for

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
keep the greenhouses pushpan and for
most<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> best<00:00:54.570> efficiency<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.410> on

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
most of the best efficiency we get is on

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
most of the best efficiency we get is on
a<00:00:55.559> low<00:00:56.250> house<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.059> also<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.840> able

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
a low house and also we want to be able

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.330 
a low house and also we want to be able
to<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> heat<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.949> quickly<00:00:59.160> as

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to get the heat out as quickly as

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.599 
to get the heat out as quickly as
possible<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.649> well<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.980> don't<00:01:02.340> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> have

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
possible so well we don't want to have

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.979 
possible so well we don't want to have
to<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.789> an<00:01:02.910> energy<00:01:03.030> layers<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> keep<00:01:03.780> thing

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to use an energy layers to keep thing

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.620 
to use an energy layers to keep thing
trying<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.290> save<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:04.650> time<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.270> most

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
trying to save some time so most

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.149 
trying to save some time so most
greenhouses<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.650> high<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.070> they

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
greenhouses now they go high but they

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
greenhouses now they go high but they
put<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.430> an<00:01:08.520> energy<00:01:08.880> curtain<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.720> didn't

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
put in an energy curtain if you didn't

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
put in an energy curtain if you didn't
want<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.290> now<00:01:10.770> who<00:01:10.920> didn't<00:01:11.159> want<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
want to do that now who didn't want to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
want to do that now who didn't want to
do<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.790> want<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.030> house<00:01:12.570> though<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:13.110> we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
do that we want a house though all we

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.570 
do that we want a house though all we
have<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.710> summertime<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.430> off

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
have to do into summertime is take off

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.090 
have to do into summertime is take off
the<00:01:14.729> polygon<00:01:15.180> top<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:16.259> gets<00:01:16.409> really<00:01:16.710> hot<00:01:16.860> here

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the polygon top it gets really hot here

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.820 
the polygon top it gets really hot here
in<00:01:17.189> summer<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.420> ventilation<00:01:19.049> isn't<00:01:19.560> isn't

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
in summer so the ventilation isn't isn't

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.530 
in summer so the ventilation isn't isn't
enough<00:01:20.159> usually<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> drop-down<00:01:21.180> man

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
enough usually just use a drop-down man

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.460 
enough usually just use a drop-down man
so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
so

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.810 
so
basically<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.490> entirely

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
basically this is an entirely

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.550 
basically this is an entirely
convertible<00:01:24.420> house<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.870> summertime<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> take

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
convertible house and summertime to take

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
convertible house and summertime to take
all<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> Poli<00:01:26.100> off<00:01:26.280> instead<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.240> energy

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
all the Poli off instead of an energy

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.980 
all the Poli off instead of an energy
where<00:01:27.690> we<00:01:27.810> do<00:01:28.050> use<00:01:28.290> double<00:01:28.590> poly<00:01:29.840> let's<00:01:30.840> come

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
where we do use double poly let's come

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.290 
where we do use double poly let's come
on<00:01:31.080> inside<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.830> can<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
on inside so you can see it's a it's a

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.630 
on inside so you can see it's a it's a
sawtooth<00:01:36.660> design<00:01:38.510> but<00:01:39.510> it<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.690> only<00:01:40.160> maybe<00:01:41.160> 11

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
sawtooth design but it is only maybe 11

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
sawtooth design but it is only maybe 11
feet<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> very<00:01:42.900> key<00:01:43.050> for<00:01:43.229> 10<00:01:43.440> something

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
feet to the very key for 10 something

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.940 
feet to the very key for 10 something
like<00:01:44.190> that<00:01:44.400> but<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.300> I<00:01:45.330> think<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.900> not<00:01:46.740> too

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
like that but the I think is not too

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.999 
like that but the I think is not too
much<00:01:47.869> volunteer<00:01:48.869> time<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.500> also<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
much volunteer time and also in the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
much volunteer time and also in the
summer<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.910> class<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.990> house<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.410> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
summer time the class of my house in the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.130 
summer time the class of my house in the
summer<00:01:52.619> time<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> help

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
summer time is to help

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.410 
summer time is to help
avoiding<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.460> taking<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.030> ability

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
avoiding that I just taking the ability

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330 
avoiding that I just taking the ability
to<00:01:57.450> take<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> poly<00:01:57.960> off<00:01:58.140> entirely<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.190> lot

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
to take the poly off entirely and a lot

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.860 
to take the poly off entirely and a lot
of<00:01:59.370> our<00:01:59.550> houses<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.300> tolerances

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
of our houses that we have tolerances

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.800 
of our houses that we have tolerances
six<00:02:01.110> different<00:02:01.290> houses<00:02:01.620> but<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:03.479> enough
