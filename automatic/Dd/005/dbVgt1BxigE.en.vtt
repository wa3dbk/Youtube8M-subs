00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.280
 here we have the avocados 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.520
 they are cut in half to get the 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.520
 bone and ever get the bone 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.250
 the pulp is this 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.329
 so here I am going to put it 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 in this container 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.670
 that I already have pre previously 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.560
 we remove them with a spoon nothing more 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.730
 from now on this will be hanging from 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.980
 how many accounts how much guacamole does he want 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.840
 do because this is the recipe of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.370
 guacamole I have three avocados here 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 those three of mouth I'm going to do it 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.700
 because it grinds more or less like for some 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.240
 six people depending on 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 how hungry our 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 It depends on how much you like it to be 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 this is what we do to botanize 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 us or to complete to complete 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.229
 some saucer as a garnish that already 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.590
 this is already the shells here what 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590
 we remove 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 now look here I have already cut 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.670
 chile serrano 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.180
 and chopped onion chopped finally here 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.480
 are the two pieces 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.150
 it is cut the onion is thrown 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.510
 the chile 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.840
 depending on what this palate 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.840
 have one to put the spicy 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.800
 was to add a little more onion 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.049
 then I put the tomato also 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:22.959
 had previously chopped pieces 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.959
 chopped guys he gets 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.849
 it is empty then we throw the cilantro 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.239
 of the sil andrÃ©s is like that is she until the 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.200
 last and it is itched so that it does not rust 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.200
 itching the moment 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.140
 freshly ground pepper 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.140
 Crushed 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.060
 to be 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.960
 now 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.960
 with this I am going to crush it 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.660
 to stir it well 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.550
 let it stir to mix all the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.880
 avocado with the vegetables be the 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.880
 tomato 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.480
 the onion the chili 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.770
 and the cilantro 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.560
 in the pockets of cilantro which is the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.520
 what he gives him 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.520
 the touch 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.080
 we already have it here 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.770
 this is 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.880
 the guacamole 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.880
 salt removal more 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.690
 Yes now 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.320
 that this is very easy 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.320
 very comfortable 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.020
 and sure everything 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.539
 Quick 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.580
 clear if you do not understand you as 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:32.310
 spicy you do not put chili 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.380
 chile serrano is the true guacamole 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.050
 but if you want to save still 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.910
 this so you do not get black that 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.020
 have to put some lemon some 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.780
 drops of lemon or a little milk 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.810
 according to what you want, we will 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.270
 let's put lemon so it's not there 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.270
 It gets oxidized and does not oxidize then 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.509
 we are going to empty it like this 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.410
 then let's decorate 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.360
 with totopos 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.310
 the two bulls are tortillas tortillas 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.440
 refried cut fried in oil once 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.450
 is it so 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.840
 always try not to take too much 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.050
 fat this is the guacamole much much 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.410
 people put cheese but that score to 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:35.820
 sometimes times as a snack as a snack 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:39.260
 Does this put cheese on it as an ornament 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.260
 as a complement 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.240
 now if that is the guacamole for snack 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.830
 Y
