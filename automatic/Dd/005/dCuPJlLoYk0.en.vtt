Dutchman's graveyard so I looked up on

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.320 
Dutchman's graveyard so I looked up on
the<00:00:09.929> internet<00:00:10.290> how<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.559> do<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.639> part<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.120> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
the internet how to do this part and I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.240 
the internet how to do this part and I
figured<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.719> out<00:00:12.809> an<00:00:12.929> app<00:00:13.049> back<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> actually

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
figured it out an app back and actually

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.460 
figured it out an app back and actually
a<00:00:14.400> lot<00:00:14.460> easier<00:00:14.580> than<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.940> thought<00:00:14.969> it'd<00:00:15.179> be

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
a lot easier than I thought it'd be

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
because you have to do this this time ok

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000 
because you have to do this this time ok
I<00:01:02.030> think<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.540> I<00:01:02.570> should<00:01:02.750> get<00:01:02.810> that<00:01:03.020> a<00:01:03.800> little

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
I think and I should get that a little

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.880 
I think and I should get that a little
later<00:01:04.420> basically<00:01:05.420> right<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.780> do<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.800> a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
later basically right now you do and a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.030 
later basically right now you do and a
fly<00:01:07.100> across<00:01:07.310> w<00:01:08.090> button<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:11.830> this<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:12.920> how<00:01:13.010> I

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
fly across w button and this is how I

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.680 
fly across w button and this is how I
get<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.340> next<00:01:13.490> cannon<00:01:14.060> there<00:01:14.300> came<00:01:14.510> in

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
back here on this thing and I think what

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.410 
back here on this thing and I think what
you<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:44.990> next<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.530> you're<00:01:46.039> supposed<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:47.259> like<00:01:48.259> a

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
you do next is you're supposed to like a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.460 
you do next is you're supposed to like a
hit<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.539> button<00:01:50.690> over<00:01:50.990> there<00:01:51.020> probably

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
hit that button over there probably

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.760 
hit that button over there probably
that's<00:01:52.369> what<00:01:52.460> I'm<00:01:52.550> guess<00:01:52.700> I'm

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.249 

and<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> other<00:01:57.240> cans<00:01:57.539> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and that's one of the other cans and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.709 
and that's one of the other cans and
then<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> last<00:01:58.679> cannon<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.369> um<00:01:59.729> well<00:02:00.689> I

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
then the last cannon is um well I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.940 
then the last cannon is um well I
haven't<00:02:01.020> tried<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.350> sell<00:02:01.500> yet<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.890> looks
