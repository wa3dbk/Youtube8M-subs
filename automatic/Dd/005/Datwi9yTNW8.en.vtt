takes from his mom's side when it comes
to<00:01:59.130> height<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.579> he's<00:02:00.119> almost<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.570> tall<00:02:00.600> as<00:02:00.899> me

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.660 
to height so he's almost as tall as me
which<00:02:01.500> isn't<00:02:01.740> really<00:02:01.770> saying<00:02:02.100> much<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.460> still

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
which isn't really saying much but still

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.709 
which isn't really saying much but still
for<00:02:02.820> an<00:02:02.880> eleven-year-old<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.509> pretty

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
for an eleven-year-old that's pretty

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.929 
for an eleven-year-old that's pretty
tall<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.170> he's<00:02:04.979> pretty<00:02:05.130> big<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.549> supposedly

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
tall and he's pretty big and supposedly

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.260 
tall and he's pretty big and supposedly
the<00:02:06.149> kid<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:07.340> smaller<00:02:08.340> than<00:02:08.580> him<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:08.970> he<00:02:09.090> has<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the kid is smaller than him but he has a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.119 
the kid is smaller than him but he has a
lot<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.509> older<00:02:09.929> friends<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.530> 7th<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.039> 8th

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
lot of older friends like 7th and 8th

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.890 
lot of older friends like 7th and 8th
grade<00:02:11.370> friends<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.300> guess<00:02:12.569> my<00:02:12.690> brother

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
grade friends so I guess my brother

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.180 
grade friends so I guess my brother
never

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
never

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.230 
never
really<00:02:13.370> had<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> chance<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.880> defend<00:02:14.120> himself

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
really had a chance to defend himself

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240 
really had a chance to defend himself
because<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.290> kid<00:02:15.410> was<00:02:15.560> always<00:02:15.800> surrounded<00:02:15.950> by

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
because the kid was always surrounded by

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.030 
because the kid was always surrounded by
people<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.670> were<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> lot<00:02:17.150> bigger<00:02:17.330> than<00:02:17.600> him

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
people that were a lot bigger than him

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.910 
people that were a lot bigger than him
but<00:02:19.040> anyways<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.080> my<00:02:21.080> brother<00:02:21.260> was<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.830> the
