00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.680 
bigger and bigger and I was like this is
dumb<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.910> thought<00:03:01.180> did<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.360> little<00:03:01.510> research

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
dumb so I thought did a little research

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.110 
dumb so I thought did a little research
on<00:03:02.020> how<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.200> get<00:03:02.350> static<00:03:02.860> out<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.310> your<00:03:03.520> hair<00:03:03.760> I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
found out that it's I guess because of

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.620 
found out that it's I guess because of
the<00:03:06.280> cold<00:03:06.520> weather<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.030> there's<00:03:07.180> no<00:03:07.360> moisture

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
