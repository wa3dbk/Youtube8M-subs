00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
performing on it so I'm running this

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:24.679 
performing on it so I'm running this
game<00:00:09.809> with<00:00:10.080> ultra<00:00:10.410> high<00:00:10.559> graphics<00:00:23.689> to

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
game with ultra high graphics to

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:40.120 
game with ultra high graphics to
graphics<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.410> looking<00:00:26.189> excellent

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:01:29.280 

Oh

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.930 

so<00:01:30.290> guys<00:01:30.440> external<00:01:31.070> speaker<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.490> this<00:01:31.670> device

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
so guys external speaker of this device

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.899 
so guys external speaker of this device
is<00:01:32.210> not<00:01:32.390> too<00:01:32.630> impressive<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.370> think<00:01:34.729> this

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
is not too impressive and I think this

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.640 
is not too impressive and I think this
device<00:01:35.210> has<00:01:35.450> not<00:01:35.690> got<00:01:35.960> any<00:01:36.200> heating<00:01:36.530> issue

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
device has not got any heating issue

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.469 
device has not got any heating issue
because<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.100> have<00:01:37.369> played<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:40.670> device<00:01:43.479> with

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
because I have played this device with

00:01:44.479 --> 00:02:03.400 
because I have played this device with
several<00:01:44.900> games<00:02:01.690> seems<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.810> me<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> little<00:02:03.140> bit

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
several games seems to me a little bit

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.340 
several games seems to me a little bit
leggy<00:02:03.649> while<00:02:04.039> playing<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.520> game<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:06.200> I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
leggy while playing this game and I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.350 
leggy while playing this game and I
think<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:07.160> problem<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:07.729> not<00:02:07.880> associated

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
think this problem is not associated

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.240 
think this problem is not associated
with<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.929> Nexus<00:02:09.380> 5<00:02:09.880> it's<00:02:10.880> all<00:02:11.150> because<00:02:11.810> of

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
with the Nexus 5 it's all because of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.350 
with the Nexus 5 it's all because of
optimization<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.370> maybe<00:02:13.610> these<00:02:13.850> games<00:02:14.180> are

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
optimization and maybe these games are

00:02:14.360 --> 00:03:11.520 
optimization and maybe these games are
not<00:02:14.570> optimized<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.580> android<00:02:16.580> 4.4

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.840 

distraction<00:03:12.530> with<00:03:12.680> gunfire<00:03:12.890> I'll<00:03:13.430> wait<00:03:13.640> for

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
distraction with gunfire I'll wait for

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:36.940 
distraction with gunfire I'll wait for
you<00:03:13.940> near<00:03:14.060> my<00:03:14.209> car<00:03:25.660> what<00:03:26.660> do<00:03:26.870> we<00:03:27.020> have<00:03:27.200> here<00:03:35.950> you

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
you near my car what do we have here you

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:54.190 
you near my car what do we have here you
will<00:03:37.130> not<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.580> anything<00:03:39.220> except<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.870> visa<00:03:53.200> it

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
will not have anything except in visa it

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.720 
will not have anything except in visa it
seems<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.680> me<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.220> game<00:03:55.459> is<00:03:55.489> running

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
seems to me that this game is running

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.240 
seems to me that this game is running
under<00:03:56.120> 30<00:03:56.360> frames<00:03:56.690> per<00:03:56.780> second<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.890> Nexus

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
under 30 frames per second on and Nexus

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.380 
under 30 frames per second on and Nexus
5<00:03:58.489> and<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:01.010> is<00:04:01.220> maybe<00:04:01.550> because<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.000> bad

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
5 and this is maybe because of bad

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.229 
5 and this is maybe because of bad
optimization<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.380> this<00:04:03.590> device<00:04:03.920> with<00:04:04.730> Adreno

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
optimization in this device with Adreno

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.080 
optimization in this device with Adreno
330<00:04:05.870> GPU<00:04:06.110> or<00:04:06.739> else<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.950> problem<00:04:10.280> of<00:04:10.700> and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
330 GPU or else this is a problem of and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.759 
330 GPU or else this is a problem of and
write<00:04:11.269> cosine<00:04:11.570> full<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:14.410> developers<00:04:15.410> have<00:04:15.620> to

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
write cosine full and developers have to

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.590 
write cosine full and developers have to
come<00:04:15.980> up<00:04:16.010> with<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:17.299> fix<00:04:18.459> after<00:04:19.459> updating<00:04:20.359> the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
come up with the fix after updating the

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:42.890 
come up with the fix after updating the
device

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:53.390 

the<00:04:43.900> car

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.710 

so<00:04:54.400> as<00:04:54.550> these<00:04:54.730> are<00:04:54.910> they<00:04:55.030> giving<00:04:55.240> your<00:04:55.390> fix<00:04:55.600> of
