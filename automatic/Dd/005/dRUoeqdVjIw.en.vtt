00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.070 

I<00:00:07.970> started<00:00:08.970> climbing<00:00:09.179> from<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> end<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
I started climbing from the end of the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.810 
I started climbing from the end of the
porch<00:00:10.349> with<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> roller<00:00:10.980> attached<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.700> an

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
porch with a roller attached to an

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:38.480 
porch with a roller attached to an
extension<00:00:12.179> pole

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.690 

I<00:00:39.380> continued<00:00:40.380> using<00:00:40.590> long<00:00:40.980> even<00:00:41.550> strokes

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
I continued using long even strokes

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.850 
I continued using long even strokes
until<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.840> entire<00:00:43.170> surface<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.800> covered

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
until the entire surface is covered

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.230 
until the entire surface is covered
including<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> steps<00:00:49.460> next<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.700> brushed<00:00:51.060> the

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
including the steps next I brushed the

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.060 
including the steps next I brushed the
first<00:00:51.450> coat<00:00:51.720> of<00:00:51.840> paint<00:00:52.020> along<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.650> edges<00:00:53.040> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
first coat of paint along the edges of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.580 
first coat of paint along the edges of
the<00:00:53.220> porch<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:54.300> rolled<00:00:54.660> paint<00:00:55.110> over<00:00:55.470> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the porch then rolled paint over the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
the porch then rolled paint over the
rest<00:00:55.830> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> surface<00:00:56.580> starting<00:00:57.150> from<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
rest of the surface starting from the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:15.050 
rest of the surface starting from the
far<00:00:57.870> corner

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.569 

I<00:01:16.909> then<00:01:17.909> measured<00:01:18.390> each<00:01:18.600> square<00:01:19.140> precisely<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
I then measured each square precisely to

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.850 
I then measured each square precisely to
ensure<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.420> were<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.990> sizes<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
ensure that they were the same sizes and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:41.639 
ensure that they were the same sizes and
distance<00:01:23.399> from<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> back<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.240> porch

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.219 

next<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:42.799> applied<00:01:43.219> taped<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.939> outside<00:01:44.479> edge<00:01:44.840> of

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
next I applied taped the outside edge of

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.859 
next I applied taped the outside edge of
each<00:01:45.799> square<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.549> applied<00:01:46.939> pressure<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
each square that applied pressure to the

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.620 
each square that applied pressure to the
entire<00:01:48.320> taped<00:01:48.740> area<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.789> ensure<00:01:50.000> that<00:01:50.240> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
entire taped area to ensure that the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.260 
entire taped area to ensure that the
edges<00:01:51.109> were<00:01:51.590> sealed<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.609> paint<00:01:52.880> didn't

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
edges were sealed so the paint didn't

00:01:53.270 --> 00:03:03.850 
edges were sealed so the paint didn't
leak<00:01:53.569> underneath<00:01:54.289> during<00:01:55.159> painting

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.470 

the<00:03:04.860> second<00:03:05.250> coat<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.430> paint<00:03:05.550> was<00:03:06.030> applied

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the second coat of paint was applied

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.470 
the second coat of paint was applied
within<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.260> taped<00:03:07.650> off<00:03:07.890> squares<00:03:14.480> decorative

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
within the taped off squares decorative

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.960 
within the taped off squares decorative
flakes<00:03:15.840> were<00:03:16.140> sprinkled<00:03:16.590> onto<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.580> painted

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
flakes were sprinkled onto the painted

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.630 
flakes were sprinkled onto the painted
surface<00:03:18.450> while<00:03:18.720> still<00:03:19.080> wet<00:03:19.350> until<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.280> entire

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
surface while still wet until the entire

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.560 
surface while still wet until the entire
area<00:03:20.910> was<00:03:21.240> covered<00:03:22.730> afterward<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
area was covered afterward all of the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.170 
area was covered afterward all of the
tape<00:03:24.810> was<00:03:25.290> removed<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.580> area<00:03:26.760> was

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
