00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:15.990
 unfortunately here returning from injury is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:37.829
 the personal cell phone fell inside the private 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:49.739

 problem then that's how you'll talk 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.650

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.560
 your mobile phone brand on your mobile 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:32.790
 it's the right attitude 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:57.689
 the mobile is a brand known one to 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:02:01.939
 something like that he just paid the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.939
 third will do 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.460
 and is 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.380

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.970

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.860

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.780
 if you did not like it and think that only one 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.120
 channel in portunhol 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.770
 but since this can happen a lot 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:17.510
 I'll give you a hint serves to 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:19.370
 Alex if this happens you guys 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.680
 keep calm you have a chance to 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:34.450
 Your cell phone has not lost for the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:34.450
 or cell battery takes it 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.650
 take out all the cards with chips cards 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.650

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:58.250
 time passed and sealed the china where 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.690
 part of the microphone that part of a 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:09.530
 charger efe 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:17.450

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:18.620
 I only hours after you 're back 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.260
 working 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.490
 It's one thing for you to steal your phone with 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.669
 drums 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:34.010
 if you will win and phone is very 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.070
 because you dry all the 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.650
 electronic components before connecting the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.979
 chance of a short circuit something 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.690

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:51.890
