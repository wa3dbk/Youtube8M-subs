deviants<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.030> born<00:03:00.540> out<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:00.990> a<00:03:01.290> very<00:03:01.620> very

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
deviants you born out of a very very

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.050 
deviants you born out of a very very
simple<00:03:02.490> idea<00:03:03.800> imagine<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.950> piece<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.550> cloth

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
simple idea imagine a piece of cloth

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.160 
simple idea imagine a piece of cloth
that's<00:03:06.720> stretched<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:09.300> place<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> ball<00:03:10.140> on

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
that's stretched and you place a ball on

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.690 
that's stretched and you place a ball on
it<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.780> then<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:13.400> don't<00:03:14.400> like<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.670> use

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
it and then you just don't like to use

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.080 
it and then you just don't like to use
the<00:03:14.790> phrase<00:03:15.150> touching<00:03:15.810> cloth<00:03:16.080> but<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:17.760> works

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
the phrase touching cloth but it works

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.020 
the phrase touching cloth but it works
so<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.870> sort<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.440> poke<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.920> cloth<00:03:20.190> underneath

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
so you sort of poke the cloth underneath

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.840 
so you sort of poke the cloth underneath
and<00:03:21.690> make<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> hill<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:23.340> ball<00:03:23.520> rolls

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and make a hill and the ball rolls

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.720 
and make a hill and the ball rolls
around

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.009 

we<00:03:28.360> started<00:03:29.019> off<00:03:29.140> with<00:03:29.170> levels<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.220> required

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
we started off with levels that required

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.979 
we started off with levels that required
quite<00:03:32.019> precise<00:03:33.150> movement<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.599> what<00:03:34.629> we

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
quite precise movement and what we

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.320 
quite precise movement and what we
realized<00:03:35.470> after<00:03:36.340> using<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.879> rear<00:03:37.030> touch

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
realized after using the rear touch

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.020 
realized after using the rear touch
panel<00:03:37.810> for<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.049> while<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.159> that<00:03:39.700> wasn't

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
panel for a while is that that wasn't

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.289 
panel for a while is that that wasn't
the<00:03:40.360> ideal<00:03:40.930> way<00:03:41.409> of<00:03:42.390> using<00:03:43.390> Ritter<00:03:43.810> from<00:03:45.299> once

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
the ideal way of using Ritter from once

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.110 
the ideal way of using Ritter from once
it<00:03:46.540> still<00:03:46.840> work<00:03:47.370> not<00:03:48.370> everyone<00:03:48.910> can

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
it still work not everyone can

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.089 
it still work not everyone can
completely<00:03:49.629> get<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.019> grips<00:03:50.260> with<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.980> we

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
completely get to grips with it so we

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.759 
completely get to grips with it so we
felt<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.780> making<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.870> whole<00:03:53.110> game<00:03:53.440> based

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
felt that making a whole game based

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.339 
felt that making a whole game based
around<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.400> mechanic<00:03:55.060> was<00:03:55.599> probably<00:03:56.170> the

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
around that mechanic was probably the

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.640 
around that mechanic was probably the
wrong<00:03:56.500> direction<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:57.310> go<00:03:57.489> in<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:59.200> we<00:03:59.319> had<00:03:59.409> a<00:03:59.440> big

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
wrong direction to go in so we had a big

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.729 
wrong direction to go in so we had a big
sit-down<00:04:00.099> with<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.640> team<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
sit-down with the team and one of the

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.729 
sit-down with the team and one of the
proposals<00:04:02.920> was<00:04:03.700> okay<00:04:04.480> well<00:04:05.019> we<00:04:05.140> use<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.530> front

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
proposals was okay well we use the front

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.339 
proposals was okay well we use the front
touchpad<00:04:06.220> as<00:04:06.400> well<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:06.879> the<00:04:07.390> microphone<00:04:07.959> and

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
touchpad as well and the microphone and

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.880 
touchpad as well and the microphone and
the<00:04:08.410> motion<00:04:08.829> sensors<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:10.299> cameras<00:04:10.890> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
the motion sensors and the cameras and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.559 
the motion sensors and the cameras and
we'll<00:04:12.129> go<00:04:12.250> down<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.609> route<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.970> making<00:04:13.420> this

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
we'll go down the route of making this

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:23.379 
we'll go down the route of making this
again<00:04:13.950> advanced<00:04:16.560> experiencing<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.709> visa
