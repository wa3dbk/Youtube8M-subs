00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello now i will write for you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.730
 regular parcel video with aliexpress 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.580
 who got here today 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.070
 looks like a package wrapper 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.840
 package wrapped with me fully packed 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.810
 we didnâ€™t open us 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.119
 damaged in this parcel must be 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 grips for the bike if it's already 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.599
 the second ones that I order first 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.630
 light ordered put on my bike 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.469
 author linden ordered my friend 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.469
 and so let's see what we have inside 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:27.320
 cycling grips by the way is very good 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.680
 alternative to replace standard standard 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.680
 circle 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:42.649
 why a very cool substitute because 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.979
 family because already somewhere near somewhere 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.869
 probably 45 months myself I go to them than 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.159
 they are better than ordinary round textures 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.159
 when you rely on the role hold for 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.140
 the flues then you have this part of the palm 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.619
 not failing that is like in a circle 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.509
 relies matt it's better for here this 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.300
 parts of the hand that is not so much not 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.050
 straining a circle from the corners and there 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.330
 now if you hold your hand like this 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.550
 if you would n't be just round then so 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.980
 That would be a hand that is the form of tension 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.129
 there was more when you keep like that 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.819
 us brush more smoothly and in 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:34.760
 In principle, they are more conveniently made by us. 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:38.450
 from here this part we have tires it we 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.599
 plastics in the body itself as a principle to 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.590
 nothing she does not interfere as if at all and 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.599
 accordingly with as for regulated here 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.209
 these are the crumbs on which you can 7 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.280
 adjust if you go far somewhere 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.840
 out of town it can be time for 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.610
 them here so the operation because it 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.340
 also a little 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.150
 weakens helps to drive more 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.610
 more convenient 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.920
 of which delivery and tigress what can 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.500
 say for your period the first benefit 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.690
 what are they by the way have with white pens 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.420
 nothing 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.610
 Well, these are these 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.840
 with time to fight back because when 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.300
 you will send the bike 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.610
 some in the wall or anything else that 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.920
 here we will be chipped scratches 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.470
 so on but in principle it is to influence 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.180
 just for beauty let's say but for 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.069
 the speed of the bike as it were for convenience 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.620
 their use is absolutely not affected 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.379
 Well, as with a little bit of time in 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.510
 wash in the ear rezinochki but principle it 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.629
 how normal normal wear is 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.660
 quite normal because any cast 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.720
 wear out as if but considering that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.489
 it very much that I go principle 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.049
 okay the person who bought these 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.209
 clips maybe 10 less 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.069
 I think that they will serve but rather 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.840
 long on the principle of a moment about it too long 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.480
 serve because it is given for two years exactly 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.890
 not from drive normally and they are worth 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.200
 absolutely not expensive I mean now 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.310
 I do not remember exactly what rain 10 12 dollars 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.470
 a reference where I bought them then I will lay out under 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.299
 video 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.819
 Here are such a principle cool grips 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.489
 really they are great and I already ride them 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.459
 I tried therefore they can say so 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.660
