00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.990
 the importance of collector heating 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.990
 of admission 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.180
 first what is an intake manifold 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.430
 are the tubes responsible for 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.110
 mix of air and fuel inside 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.950
 of the engine 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.870
 so the intake manifold name 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.280
 there is also the exhaust manifold where the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.379
 where it extracts the flue gases 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.000
 the position of the intake manifold raise 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.430
 the mix and click on create a 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.809
 turbulence in order to optimize the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.809
 explosion inside cylinder 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.250
 now let's explain why there is a 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.700
 heating system in the collector since 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.710
 many Mexicans who withdraw this 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.360
 we know that the colder the admitted 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.890
 better for the engine 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.250
 then because it has a system of 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.830
 heating in the collector let's answer 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.840
 this question now we take the system of 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.220
 and we did some 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.960
 and we won the car and left 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.189
 reach normal working temperature 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.070
 i.e. about 85 to 90 degrees 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.789
 I put a thermometer in the collector and see the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.619
 temperature that is and continues to fall 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:44.600
 in other tests the temperature reached 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:49.090
 beat in 24 Â° remembering that the temperature 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.090
 environment is around 35 degrees 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.760
 this is due to the air passing with 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.000
 inside the manifold making 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.120
 metal 6 create gets so cold that 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.700
 begins to condense the air this interferes 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.470
 in the mixture and is not homogeneous and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.149
 begins to run down the walls of the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 collector causing an irregular burning 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.800
 when it starts to lower by 33 degrees 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.060
 the slow starts to roll until the car 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.340
 dies and after the temperature dies 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.010
 collector starts to climb because with the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.959
 engine warmth and no chilling gusts 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.959
 eternally the collector it goes 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.580
 heating up 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.260
 after a few moments the temperature 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.530
 of the broker goes up a lot with the car 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530
 off 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.010
 after a few minutes the collector is 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.410
 warm even with the heating off 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.450
 the old car again and repair 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.690
 as the collector temperature starts to 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.690
 fall 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.940
 this process will follow until you reach 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.130
 a very low temperature where it mixes 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.190
 affected and the car is slow and 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.190
 irregular 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.300
 slow it gets bad that the car dies with 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.970
 conforms to a specified temperature 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.430
 because the fuel does not 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.100
 sprays and begins to seep through 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.490
 walls of the collector getting up who 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.830
 irregular 40 bad on adjame drinking 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.600
 a lot and revealing a bit because the 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.600
 fuel arrives in the cylinder 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.010
 after switched on heating system 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.350
 the car changes 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.300
 I continue with the thermometer in the collector 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.560
 brand garbage at much higher temperature 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.560
 even with the car off 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.180
 i 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.390
 the hoses are connected in the circulation 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.390
 hot water radiator 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.599
 I turn on the car and keep an eye on the temperature. 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.090
 notice that it even fits better 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.550
 higher than previously 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.930
 besides the car is smooth without a few 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.960
 or images 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.759
 so think twice 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.759
 lately the broker will warm up
