00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello girls how are you today I bring you 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.730
 some very refreshing ideas for the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.830
 summer are very good and easy 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.280
 anyone can do it so the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.350
 challenge to do it 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.350
 and let's start 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.439
 let's use lemons yogurt from 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.470
 Any brand that they want I like 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.900
 a lot this brand and I love this flavor 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.059
 of strawberry fascinates me too we are going to 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.280
 use this which is a set of 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.830
 strawberries raspberries and other berries 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.050
 also and we will use this container 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.079
 that already comes as already in the form of 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.150
 pallets that we're going to use this that 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.940
 used to make ice and I do not know how to 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.480
 call also let's use this is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 a door 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.630
 spoon to beat 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.110
 a package like this that the witch has 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.930
 so to make it easier to empty the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.440
 liquid 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.980
 sugar too and a paper like this one 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.980
 wrap 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 But what are we going to do? 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.869
 hole or a roll with a knife 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
 enter that part that I do not know what it's called 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.220
 and if you do not have this, you could use one 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.460
 of those sticks that are used to make 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.610
 skewers in the spaghetti and you take it to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 the fridge once well well frozen 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.750
 I removed the paper 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.830
 as you can see me here I dropped in 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.730
 the west side I put it back and what 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.550
 wings out with everything and the yogurt already 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.420
 has died a rich pgje ice cream and you 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.420
 it would be like that 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.470
 for this we are going to use the fruit that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.160
 you want and we're going to cut it in cubes 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.370
 well and then you're going to put it inside 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.590
 every point and you can also add 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 any other fruit than plantation 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.360
 I also decided to put the berries and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.530
 raspberries 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.530
 and plant them 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.010
 with water 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.750
 and then you cover everything with the paper 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.110
 be transparent 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.170
 and you take it to the fridge until it's 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.220
 all right 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.430
 well frozen 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.430
 once well well well frozen what 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.450
 you can put in a glass you fill it 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.650
 you put everything in the glass 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.319
 these ice cubes are rich alone 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.769
 well well rich they give it as a texture 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.310
 and ice cubes taste different 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.250
 of ice are delicious delicious solos without 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.769
 nothing like that you can eat it too or 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.630
 you can also add water and it's fine 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.480
 refreshing like that because they have nothing of 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.410
 sugar and you can eat the fruits already 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.410
 when you eat 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.920
 for this we're going to use lemons myself 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.700
 use 5 lemons and cut them in half 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.060
 then I started squeezing the one by 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.060
 one 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.540
 once you have the lemon juice 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.340
 you are going to add the same amount of water 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.390
 like lemon tongue you have double 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.520
 the lemon juice I hope you understand me 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.860
 and you stay and I add a little 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.040
 more that depends on how sour you want 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.230
 your lemon juice after you add it 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.120
 Sugar, I like it very sweet, that's why 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.120
 they saw there that monsieur enough sugar 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.510
 and then with this lemon like that and you peel it 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.310
 well first and cut it in cubes like that 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:37.970
 and you put it in the container of the pallets 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.950
 you add the lemon juice I also did 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.230
 of strawberries and raspberries and blackberries and 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.200
 everything that comes and throws it in the 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.300
 pallet containers also mix it 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.990
 with the lemon eyes that he had made 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.990
 milk and suddenly a few lemon 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.780
 and here I have a lemon lemon lemon and 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.100
 raspberry and the other raspberries 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.100
 only with lemon juice 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.490
 you put it in the fridge look at you 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.060
 Japanese in the freezer and leave it 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.060
 freeze well 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.699
 and so they are well frozen but the 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.250
 little stick like I do not hold well when 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.289
 they needed then I had to get it out like this 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.320
 first and then put the stick for 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:42.350
 back a little bit hard but I 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.830
 It works in evenings I could eat well if 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.830
 it's reguer 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.419
