00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.430
 a beautiful day my name is Connor AKW and we are busy 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.430
 today, so to speak, with the theme were Red 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.669
 and although war still showed consequences 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.660
 and if you have the AUTEV increased then that will be rainy for you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.859
 a lot easier 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.039
 Preetz himself 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.550
 and we look at each other for a while, thinking more freely on all fours 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 Wildlife will look like 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.749
 and that way 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.540
 and percent 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.250
 that's class so the index finger 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.580
 is laid over several fires 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.660
 So the guy picks to show the the embattled bunch of the strong side 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 fifth down 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.930
 "The b-side in the fifth fret 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.930
 and the quiet side 51 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.520
 and it will be pretty problematic for a lot of people 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.910
 and SMI he caught it again and again because students have complained 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.100
 yes I Cribari Akon people not normal for Sissoko too long or 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 not strong enough or whatever 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.170
 that was the basis for ours and Bari actually was that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.170
 the chord itself 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.210
 But this is where Baierbrunn thrives 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.260
 then you can get the percent 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.670
 the PS builds 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.230
 Parzival 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.230
 BMW and the side 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.300
 if you do not really care which one but it's damned 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.050
 Hardly will reha-kur access 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.050
 Although they are different but relatively often go wrong 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.980
 You do not often see people putting their fingers and their feet down 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.290
 the add-on so complete Rieder 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.480
 Wrote in the wrist so skilfully 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
 France takes it open 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.790
 Well the whole show was incredibly cramped 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.259
 Denver Manderson have since tried to improve, then nothing works 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.420
 So absolutely not if that's the way from the top to 6 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.040
 Summer is the last page 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.040
 and that is the Finn the contract of Rome and has so 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.609
 nice curved shape 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.639
 that means I can now here again, of course, the index finger 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.069
 stuck through 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.069
 what do you think about the work of children stuck 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.669
 already killed 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:32.659
 look around that the fingers are on me and those coming from Aschwege Kiesow 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.629
 or so 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.809
 but bridge screen to squad here is an anatomy allowed 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.119
 such 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.069
 and J 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.939
 and you can control the whole thing because that was the measure of us 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.689
 So far I just now the Accord Verso s 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.949
 on side the sides fifth fret 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.849
 Do with the Sun but the mother has been attested 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.849
 then the head of Siegmund 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.389
 the page seven colorful 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.389
 where and how the page the sixth and 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.650
 not so that what we three now and the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.769
 b like the police of the game anyway who is not 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:27.109
 that Mike Hanke is pretty well and secondly so groups should be like that often 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.049
 Finger bloody cut-off sets 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.809
 I want this in it 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.739
 me and I can come now and and too late or not enough of Rome or 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.669
 Coincidence or whatever 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.869
 then the two of them would be here the two sides stand so b &amp; b would have 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.299
 then sounds like she can be sure that somehow weird circle Namco 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.939
 up to Rome 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.939
 and so on 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.729
 BÃ¶nen circle Unna the view you look good 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.290
 To put it quite differently, they are in different ben and chic 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.969
 I well 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.349
 So I'll do everything myself to be read left 2 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.349
 Bender set to the left 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.269
 very melancholic 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.269
 I also succeeded in winning the alliance 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.180
 I mean Bund LÃ¼nen 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.610
 or 7 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 mm 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.590
 yes and then the whole thing works really well then you can go directly 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.139
 on to the Turkish at the rally and what about nine 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.999
 good foundation 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.900
 she was composing commenting what should not be forgotten 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.910
 and Facebook visit page under full load record set up and I will 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.610
 actively request quickly 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.610
 and that to his guests 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:01.260
 Euro 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.050
 meet again
