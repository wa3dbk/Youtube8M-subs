00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
in a cage and I'm actually go it's a

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.910 
in a cage and I'm actually go it's a
pretty<00:01:06.360> decent<00:01:06.900> sign<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.440> in<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.650> kid

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
pretty decent sign here in this kid

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
pretty decent sign here in this kid
because<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.550> quite<00:01:08.850> central<00:01:09.300> it's<00:01:09.930> not

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
because it's quite central it's not

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.350 
because it's quite central it's not
under<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.470> balcony<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.550> but<00:01:11.760> it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
under a balcony or something but it's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.820 
under a balcony or something but it's
still<00:01:12.630> no<00:01:12.810> substitute<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.409> actually<00:01:13.800> getting

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
still no substitute for actually getting

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.070 
still no substitute for actually getting
out<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:15.150> where<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> audience<00:01:15.510> are<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
out to where the audience are going to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.340 
out to where the audience are going to
be<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.409> let's<00:01:16.620> take<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> ripe<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.880> light<00:01:18.120> and<00:01:18.360> have

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
be so let's take a ripe a light and have

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.170 
be so let's take a ripe a light and have
a<00:01:19.409> look<00:01:19.530> around<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:24.150> pretty

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
a look around so it's actually a pretty

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
a look around so it's actually a pretty
decent<00:01:24.479> signed<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.650> don't<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:25.979> do

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
decent signed in you so we don't then do

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.210 
decent signed in you so we don't then do
too<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.170> just<00:01:28.170> got<00:01:28.380> some<00:01:28.650> stuff

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
too much do it I just got some stuff

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
too much do it I just got some stuff
running<00:01:29.460> off<00:01:29.640> capture<00:01:30.120> at<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.300> background<00:01:30.780> so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
running off capture at the background so

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.539 
running off capture at the background so
I<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.440> a<00:01:31.500> demo<00:01:32.009> track<00:01:32.310> here

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I just got like a demo track here

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.569 
I just got like a demo track here
running<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.570> i<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.920> i'll<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.159> turn<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.340> my

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
running so i can i'll just turn up my

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.080 
running so i can i'll just turn up my
masters<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.299> here

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.910 

so<00:01:43.689> this<00:01:43.810> makes<00:01:44.109> it<00:01:44.259> easy<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.500> me<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.710> walk

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
so this makes it easy to me to walk

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.529 
so this makes it easy to me to walk
around<00:01:45.100> where<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.700> audience<00:01:45.850> are<00:01:46.270> going<00:01:46.450> to

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
around where the audience are going to

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.510 
around where the audience are going to
be<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:46.960> actually<00:01:47.049> hear<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.649> from<00:01:48.070> front<00:01:48.399> of

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
be and I actually hear it from front of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.029 
be and I actually hear it from front of
from<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.060> real<00:01:49.240> from<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.689> face<00:01:49.869> not<00:01:50.649> from<00:01:50.829> our

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
from the real from the face not from our

00:01:51.039 --> 00:02:07.150 
from the real from the face not from our
backup<00:01:51.520> forces<00:01:51.759> at<00:01:52.090> work

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.590 

so<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> knew<00:02:08.430> in<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> venue<00:02:08.940> from<00:02:09.149> before

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
so I knew in this venue from before

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.170 
so I knew in this venue from before
there's<00:02:09.960> some<00:02:10.170> problems<00:02:10.590> rounded<00:02:10.920> by<00:02:11.180> 300

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
there's some problems rounded by 300

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.120 
there's some problems rounded by 300
Hertz<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.720> there's<00:02:13.230> some<00:02:13.410> problems<00:02:13.770> rounded

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
Hertz and there's some problems rounded

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.150 
Hertz and there's some problems rounded
by<00:02:14.300> 3k<00:02:15.300> as<00:02:15.480> well<00:02:15.630> man<00:02:15.870> from<00:02:16.230> 100<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.620> 300<00:02:16.860> Hertz

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
by 3k as well man from 100 to 300 Hertz

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.190 
by 3k as well man from 100 to 300 Hertz
I<00:02:17.400> run<00:02:17.790> about<00:02:18.030> two-and-a-half<00:02:18.540> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I run about two-and-a-half to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200 
I run about two-and-a-half to
three-and-a-half<00:02:19.650> k<00:02:20.190> there's<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.970> few<00:02:21.180> little

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
three-and-a-half k there's a few little

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.120 
three-and-a-half k there's a few little
problems<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.900> front<00:02:22.140> end<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.530> I'll<00:02:22.950> have

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
problems in the front end so I'll have

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.040 
problems in the front end so I'll have
to<00:02:23.160> take<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.550> down<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:23.970> bit<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.480> so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
to take it down a little bit there so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.500 
to take it down a little bit there so
let's<00:02:25.740> use<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.070> graphic<00:02:26.460> EQ<00:02:26.850> that's<00:02:27.240> built

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
let's use the graphic EQ that's built

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
let's use the graphic EQ that's built
into<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> studio<00:02:28.170> live<00:02:28.470> back<00:02:28.770> there<00:02:28.800> but

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
into the studio live back there but

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.010 
into the studio live back there but
let's<00:02:29.880> control<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.390> from<00:02:30.420> actually<00:02:30.840> from

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
let's control it from actually from

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.260 
let's control it from actually from
right<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.740> turn<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.370> up<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.790> play

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
right here so turn this up and play

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:56.979 
right here so turn this up and play
around<00:02:33.390> with<00:02:33.630> it

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.910 

okay<00:02:57.989> that's<00:02:58.170> good<00:02:58.349> enough<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.590> rock<00:02:58.890> and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
okay that's good enough for rock and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.470 
okay that's good enough for rock and
roll<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.250> think<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.790> gets<00:02:59.970> us<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.299> ballpark

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
roll I think it gets us in the ballpark

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.720 
roll I think it gets us in the ballpark
anyway<00:03:01.250> obviously<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.370> going<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.549> sound<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
anyway obviously it's going to sound a

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
anyway obviously it's going to sound a
little<00:03:02.849> bit<00:03:03.000> different<00:03:03.330> when<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.599> audience

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
little bit different when the audience

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.050 
little bit different when the audience
actually<00:03:04.170> get<00:03:04.560> here<00:03:04.799> later<00:03:05.040> but<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.849> great

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
actually get here later but the great

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.119 
actually get here later but the great
thing<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.299> even<00:03:06.750> when<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.989> audience<00:03:07.110> are<00:03:07.709> here

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.270 
thing is even when the audience are here

desk<00:05:04.729> that's<00:05:05.599> over<00:05:06.080> there<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:07.610> let's<00:05:08.330> turn

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:08.899 
desk that's over there so let's turn

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.429 
desk that's over there so let's turn
this<00:05:09.050> channel<00:05:09.580> 12<00:05:10.580> 12<00:05:11.239> there<00:05:11.659> we<00:05:11.749> go<00:05:11.899> and<00:05:12.289> we've

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
this channel 12 12 there we go and we've

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.279 
this channel 12 12 there we go and we've
got<00:05:12.589> the<00:05:12.679> channel<00:05:13.009> so<00:05:13.669> on<00:05:14.599> this<00:05:14.809> channel<00:05:15.080> of

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
got the channel so on this channel of

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.429 
got the channel so on this channel of
course<00:05:15.529> I've<00:05:15.769> got<00:05:16.119> a<00:05:17.119> full<00:05:17.689> set<00:05:17.899> of<00:05:17.989> effects

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:18.439 
course I've got a full set of effects

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:20.799 
course I've got a full set of effects
I've<00:05:18.589> got<00:05:18.769> compression<00:05:19.159> I've<00:05:19.399> got<00:05:19.550> eq<00:05:20.029> i<00:05:20.300> can

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:20.809 
I've got compression I've got eq i can

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.779 
I've got compression I've got eq i can
actually<00:05:20.929> eq<00:05:21.409> the<00:05:21.529> marver<00:05:21.949> directly<00:05:22.459> here

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
actually eq the marver directly here

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.269 
actually eq the marver directly here
just<00:05:23.569> with<00:05:23.719> my<00:05:23.869> parametric<00:05:24.619> so<00:05:24.979> I've<00:05:25.069> got<00:05:25.249> a

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.279 
just with my parametric so I've got a

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.869 
just with my parametric so I've got a
4-band<00:05:26.089> parametric<00:05:26.149> equalizer<00:05:27.080> on<00:05:27.729> every<00:05:28.729> one

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
4-band parametric equalizer on every one

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.879 
4-band parametric equalizer on every one
of<00:05:28.999> these<00:05:29.089> Mars<00:05:29.389> as<00:05:29.839> well<00:05:30.169> as<00:05:30.319> every<00:05:30.589> channel

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
of these Mars as well as every channel

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.799 
of these Mars as well as every channel
but<00:05:31.699> of<00:05:31.819> course<00:05:31.849> what's<00:05:32.239> even<00:05:32.479> better<00:05:32.509> than

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:32.809 
but of course what's even better than

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:37.749 
but of course what's even better than
using<00:05:32.989> the<00:05:33.110> parametric<00:05:35.139> sister<00:05:36.189> is<00:05:37.189> I've<00:05:37.610> also

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
using the parametric sister is I've also

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.100 
using the parametric sister is I've also
got<00:05:37.969> graphic<00:05:38.300> EQ<00:05:38.659> so<00:05:39.439> I've<00:05:40.039> got<00:05:40.189> it<00:05:40.749> graphic<00:05:41.749> EQ

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
got graphic EQ so I've got it graphic EQ

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.419 
got graphic EQ so I've got it graphic EQ
and<00:05:42.409> that's<00:05:42.919> just<00:05:43.129> a<00:05:43.249> saying<00:05:43.550> I've<00:05:44.539> assigned<00:05:44.929> a

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:45.429 
and that's just a saying I've assigned a

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:48.850 
and that's just a saying I've assigned a
graphics<00:05:46.429> one<00:05:46.579> and<00:05:46.729> two<00:05:46.879> to<00:05:47.269> the<00:05:47.300> zero<00:05:48.079> sounds

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
graphics one and two to the zero sounds

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.279 
graphics one and two to the zero sounds
wanted<00:05:49.279> to<00:05:49.459> hear<00:05:49.819> so<00:05:50.539> now<00:05:50.659> we're<00:05:50.839> on<00:05:50.929> auxiliary

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
wanted to hear so now we're on auxiliary

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.239 
wanted to hear so now we're on auxiliary
Sam<00:05:51.589> one<00:05:51.800> and<00:05:51.949> two<00:05:52.629> let's<00:05:53.629> turn<00:05:54.289> on<00:05:54.469> graphic<00:05:54.889> EQ

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:55.249 
Sam one and two let's turn on graphic EQ

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.139 
Sam one and two let's turn on graphic EQ
to<00:05:55.579> you<00:05:55.729> but<00:05:56.300> now<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.569> can<00:05:57.069> be<00:05:58.069> very<00:05:58.099> carefully<00:05:58.939> I

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
to you but now I can be very carefully I

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.859 
to you but now I can be very carefully I
can<00:05:59.869> actually<00:06:00.219> eq<00:06:01.219> that<00:06:01.519> monitor<00:06:02.059> directly

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:02.869 
can actually eq that monitor directly

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.769 
can actually eq that monitor directly
here<00:06:03.349> so<00:06:04.189> this<00:06:04.639> is<00:06:04.819> really<00:06:04.969> handy<00:06:05.360> for<00:06:05.539> ringing

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
here so this is really handy for ringing

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.309 
here so this is really handy for ringing
my<00:06:06.050> Mars<00:06:06.289> because<00:06:06.919> uh<00:06:06.949> I<00:06:07.519> can<00:06:08.449> just<00:06:08.869> pump<00:06:09.110> those

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
my Mars because uh I can just pump those

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:10.929 
my Mars because uh I can just pump those
up<00:06:09.499> and<00:06:09.709> find<00:06:09.919> out<00:06:10.069> what<00:06:10.279> frequencies<00:06:10.819> are

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
up and find out what frequencies are

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:13.839 
up and find out what frequencies are
really<00:06:11.119> causing<00:06:11.449> problems<00:06:11.899> so<00:06:12.769> if<00:06:12.979> I<00:06:13.129> turn

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
really causing problems so if I turn

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.509 
really causing problems so if I turn
that<00:06:13.999> one<00:06:14.149> up<00:06:14.269> a<00:06:14.389> little<00:06:14.419> bit<00:06:14.779> there<00:06:15.519> let's

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:16.519 
that one up a little bit there let's

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:19.540 
that one up a little bit there let's
just<00:06:16.699> turn<00:06:16.879> this<00:06:17.029> way<00:06:17.240> okay<00:06:18.139> now<00:06:18.319> we<00:06:19.219> can<00:06:19.369> hear

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
just turn this way okay now we can hear

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.109 
just turn this way okay now we can hear
it<00:06:19.669> starting<00:06:19.939> to<00:06:20.029> rain<00:06:20.119> their<00:06:20.679> own<00:06:21.679> okay<00:06:22.519> and

00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:23.119 
it starting to rain their own okay and

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:25.329 
it starting to rain their own okay and
now<00:06:23.479> I<00:06:23.509> can<00:06:23.839> just<00:06:24.079> isolate<00:06:24.259> that<00:06:24.589> in<00:06:25.069> my

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:25.339 
now I can just isolate that in my

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.210 
now I can just isolate that in my
graphic

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.930 

just<00:06:29.220> pull<00:06:29.490> one<00:06:29.520> down<00:06:29.700> one<00:06:30.150> better<00:06:30.800> still<00:06:31.800> can

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.400 

uh-huh<00:06:35.940> we<00:06:36.600> can<00:06:36.830> won't<00:06:37.830> show<00:06:38.190> you<00:06:38.220> one<00:06:38.550> say<00:06:39.410> you

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
uh-huh we can won't show you one say you

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.600 
uh-huh we can won't show you one say you
just<00:06:40.440> get<00:06:40.830> back<00:06:41.010> over<00:06:41.190> there<00:06:42.890> one<00:06:43.890> two<00:06:44.310> is

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
just get back over there one two is

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.020 
just get back over there one two is
three<00:06:44.700> four<00:06:45.210> five<00:06:45.540> six<00:06:45.600> seven<00:06:46.910> and<00:06:47.910> of<00:06:48.000> course

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
three four five six seven and of course

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.150 
three four five six seven and of course
I<00:06:48.300> can<00:06:48.450> also<00:06:48.570> if<00:06:49.140> I'm<00:06:49.350> working<00:06:49.920> on<00:06:50.010> one

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
I can also if I'm working on one

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.880 
I can also if I'm working on one
particular<00:06:50.340> frequency<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.300> can<00:06:51.990> zoom<00:06:52.350> in<00:06:52.590> on

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
particular frequency I can zoom in on

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.040 
particular frequency I can zoom in on
the<00:06:53.100> graphic<00:06:53.460> EQ<00:06:53.850> just<00:06:54.210> make<00:06:54.360> the<00:06:54.450> feel<00:06:54.630> of<00:06:54.900> the

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
the graphic EQ just make the feel of the

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.350 
the graphic EQ just make the feel of the
figure<00:06:55.350> around<00:06:55.470> that<00:06:55.890> so<00:06:56.610> if<00:06:56.760> we<00:06:56.790> got<00:06:57.090> really

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
figure around that so if we got really

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.540 
figure around that so if we got really
big<00:06:57.840> fingers<00:06:58.290> I<00:06:58.560> might<00:06:58.770> still<00:06:59.190> get<00:06:59.370> in<00:06:59.430> zero

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
big fingers I might still get in zero

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.060 
big fingers I might still get in zero
and<00:07:00.060> what's<00:07:00.270> happening<00:07:00.630> so<00:07:01.500> let's<00:07:01.680> see<00:07:01.890> what

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
and what's happening so let's see what

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:08.240 
and what's happening so let's see what
we<00:07:02.190> got<00:07:02.430> there<00:07:03.170> that's<00:07:04.170> a<00:07:04.580> confounding<00:07:07.250> we

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
we got there that's a confounding we

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.390 
we got there that's a confounding we
should<00:07:08.460> be<00:07:08.610> configured<00:07:09.120> so<00:07:10.050> now<00:07:10.260> we've<00:07:11.160> got

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
should be configured so now we've got

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.340 
should be configured so now we've got
how<00:07:11.790> much<00:07:11.940> better<00:07:12.210> side<00:07:12.450> and<00:07:13.020> I've<00:07:13.170> been<00:07:13.290> able

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.350 
how much better side and I've been able

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.320 
how much better side and I've been able
to<00:07:13.590> ring<00:07:13.800> that<00:07:13.980> monitor<00:07:14.490> get<00:07:15.150> those

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
to ring that monitor get those

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.650 
to ring that monitor get those
frequencies<00:07:15.690> or<00:07:15.990> divide<00:07:17.270> right<00:07:18.270> here<00:07:18.450> on<00:07:18.570> the

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
frequencies or divide right here on the

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.510 
frequencies or divide right here on the
stage<00:07:18.840> I<00:07:19.080> don't<00:07:19.320> need<00:07:19.470> a<00:07:19.500> stage<00:07:19.800> box<00:07:20.040> aidonia

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
stage I don't need a stage box aidonia

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.150 
stage I don't need a stage box aidonia
stage<00:07:20.880> to<00:07:21.060> ask<00:07:21.560> everything's<00:07:22.560> right<00:07:22.770> here<00:07:22.980> on

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 
stage to ask everything's right here on
