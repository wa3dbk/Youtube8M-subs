00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello everyone, today I am here to talk to you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.250
 of my readings of the months of July 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.069
 I haven't read this month actually 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.719
 a lot a little because I was overloaded 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.160
 I have had so many things to work with 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.049
 I have been to Rimini and not COMIX 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.300
 I felt particularly inspired I must 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.859
 to be honest I started many books 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.039
 that then I abandoned the first pages 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.890
 because I just didn't feel in the mood 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.619
 let's say we read this anyway 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.539
 month I read the bad of sally green eros 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.820
 super resisted reading this 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.989
 book because on the other but it inspired me 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.190
 so much 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.719
 remain in prohibited in a modern one 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.430
 England where people can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.079
 be equipped with magical powers 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.820
 this was born I divided it into charms 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.489
 whites or people who use i 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.700
 own magical powers for good works e 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.129
 black charms instead of evil people the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.960
 our protagonist nathan is neither one 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.539
 white singing nor a black spell is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.219
 in fact meta 1 and me among other things his 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.500
 life is not at all easy because 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.449
 however the society in which they live 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.370
 black charms are seen as true 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.650
 and their own criminals to hunt down 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.810
 you liked the story at first 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 very much because I was very curious about 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.180
 see precisely what they did 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.939
 white charms if in the end it was discovered 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.710
 something more about black charms like 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.610
 something would also be born 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.189
 would have done 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.560
 however there were some pieces 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.439
 little bit slow in my opinion a little too much 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.009
 boring in my opinion is something that has me 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.049
 much violence is so annoyed 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.900
 excessive abuse and torture 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.259
 towards nathan I found one 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.869
 something really too excessive at least 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.170
 for me, I'm an ordinary person 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.329
 so it was the book a little bit though 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 I am very curious to read later 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.820
 because in any case the story is the outline 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.680
 I think it is well structured it could 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.049
 come out of it something really 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.329
 interesting so I'm curious about 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.700
 Then read later continued 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.159
 marylou's legend trilogy by reading 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.299
 prodigy example the last book of the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.870
 saga 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.510
 what to say about these 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.030
 I'm sure I can't tell you the plot 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.150
 nothing because I would risk spoiling you 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.860
 the first volume or legend, however, I have 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.560
 seen to recommend reading this 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.830
 trilogy really if you like i 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.750
 dystopic books young adult tipo hunger 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:29.740
 games or divergent legend and in my opinion 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.400
 super wow is almost better than hunger 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.280
 games 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.040
 I liked it almost the most it caught me 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.500
 really a lot on one side there is 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.140
 precisely this new dystopian world with 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.510
 new technologies 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.230
 the new various military political system 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.120
 strategies that we are fascinated by 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.310
 there are so many on the other side 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.100
 two protagonists that I know according to me 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.290
 are among the best ever for 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.920
 regarding my experience of 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.140
 reading 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.570
 she's joona i really liked her 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.330
 so I became super fond of them 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.340
 also blues which for me is very strange 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.160
 because usually the protagonists of 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.739
 I hate books with all of myself while 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.750
 john I liked it so much I saw myself again 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.230
 in her for some things so she got me 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.959
 It did so much tenderness is kind of super 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.380
 wow there is one of my protagonists 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.600
 Absolutely favorite masculine really 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.140
 I had so much care about their fate 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.410
 when they suffered I also suffered with 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.370
 them because they couldn't happen 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.630
 bad things 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.090
 regarding the sentimental side 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.190
 my feelings were taken 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.830
 crumpled balled up and 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.989
 squashed against a finished wall of 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.840
 be champion in a sea of ​​tears 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.080
 I really was really desperate 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.660
 desperate even if I think the ending 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.940
 could not be different from what 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.160
 actually even though I hoped 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.830
 until the last things came into 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.690
 differently but I felt it was already 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.180
 for a little while I felt that 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.370
 it would have ended up this way 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.530
 I think it's the right conclusion for 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.240
 regarding latrine 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.910
 so he saw all the things that are 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.489
 could not end in a manner 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.740
 different for oh wow 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.680
 I was really very, very long 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.380
 impressed by this saga 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.150
 I really have no words 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.340
 absolutely read it if you like 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.100
 this kind because it surprised me 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.260
 so much and hell why I didn't find out 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.540
 first if it really is if you didn't 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.960
 discovered just by chance not 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.140
 I would have never read one of the trilogies anymore 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.419
 beautiful I've ever read then 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.790
 recommended last book read by 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.490
 this immense book that contains the 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.660
 first trilogy of shadowhunters city ​​of 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.970
 ash or even almost finished in reality 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.700
 city ​​of glass and I must say that it is 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.650
 liking so much after city ​​of bones 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.160
 I had set it aside for a while shadowhunters 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.890
 because the beginning of ash city does not 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.050
 I was enjoying it so much and sometimes 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.440
 however I still struggle because I don't 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.900
 I tolerate cleri is stronger than me does not know 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.270
 I can not not stand it I would like 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.960
 really slap her 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.160
 sometimes it strikes me how much 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.410
 person 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.990
 however for the rest however the story vi 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.970
 is so intriguing especially now 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.150
 that I'm finishing reading cities of 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.010
 glass really is super- impallinato e 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.050
 I can't wait to continue this 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.770
 serious because it promises me so much 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.140
 so well 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.440
 now passing briefly to comics 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.440
 this month I read several asterixes between 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.360
 which asterix the Britons really very much 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.220
 cute and I also saw the cartoon a little 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.510
 long ago so I liked it 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.810
 so my always honors by asterix 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:04.020
 the asterix odyssey and the last coletto 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.030
 and asterix and the galaxy of obelix also of 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.180
 this I had seen a kind of cardboard 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.550
 so what is history, however, it is anyway 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.770
 very very nice I read then to a 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.080
 place yourself the number 12 that is me 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.880
 really loved it if 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.010
 history began to be a bit like that 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.710
 so as far as I'm concerned this 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.480
 volume has really raised the fortunes 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.520
 I loved the comic book 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.350
 and in my opinion it is one of my favorites in 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.240
 absolute with regards to a step from 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.550
 earth or in the after the second volume of a 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.860
 silent voices of this comic I have you 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.660
 talked very well in a video 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.930
 part of which I leave the link below 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.780
 and super recommended as a comic book 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.940
 really found some themes 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.540
 quite strong though at the same time 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.620
 it's pretty nice and tender we say to 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.780
 his own way 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.150
 I then read second ion volume of 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.850
 angela vianello this comic is me 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.340
 really liked the noise so much 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.470
 the story was little or no view 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.930
 the length because it is the goal anyway 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.570
 of the first volume and instead I liked it 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.030
 I liked it a lot more we say 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:13.250
 the part in terrestrial quotation marks if 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:15.720
 you read you will not understand well e 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.110
 I'm quite puzzled by how much 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.530
 it's about the part we say about aliens 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:24.090
 but I think it could develop 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.640
 the story in the future is very good 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.530
 really very very confident if not 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.350
 have you ever read I stress you between 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:35.040
 advice because the designs and colors 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:37.080
 I am something absurd I like them 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.920
 a lot of these soft colors 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.590
 pastel 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.560
 she then draws in a divine way 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:46.080
 ios really love these designs 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.030
 beautiful and also the story in my opinion 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.210
 it's very pretty in the first volume 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.010
 let's say a kind of nature business 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.950
 general on what will then be 

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.570
 according to the next volumes and this I have 

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.210
 I appreciated very much liked 

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.040
 really so much advised e 

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.840
 so yes we have come to the end of 

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.760
 this video because these were all 

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.740
 the readings I made this month 

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.240
 let me know below what 

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.490
 think if you have something from 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.520
 advise me or what you thought of it 

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.940
 instead smoked coletto bar books this 

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.470
 month 

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.420
 so I hope you enjoyed the videos
