 died okay and foxes, and today we 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.349
 there will be such a small informational 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.340
 video i just want to tell you about 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.379
 one of my favorite plants 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.720
 now is the end of May and we have blossomed 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.060
 white acacia 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 it is a very healing plant from it 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.689
 very tasty tea is obtained and in general 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.060
 every year i prepare myself for the winter 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.130
 I will tell a little acacia now how I am 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.860
 do and then tell you how her 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.559
 use later for medicinal purposes or 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.710
 just for fun and so here's my 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.379
 acacia 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.160
 she looks like this and her 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.559
 leaves 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 I think everyone knows acacia all 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.700
 know very well how wonderful she is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.160
 it smells 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.020
 I collect it in the morning and preferably her 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 collect in the period when she only 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.780
 blossomed even if the floor is uncool 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 flowers here like this nothing 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.430
 scary everything is good for drying and and 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.740
 just laid out on a piece of paper 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.340
 before that it is not necessary to wash we will 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.509
 wash it later when it is dry and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 immediately before use 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.850
 can all these flowers be separately 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.490
 tear and lay like this but 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.720
 it's not so convenient much more comfortable when 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.680
 she is already dry these leaves and flowers 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.850
 pick and put in a jar or whatever it is 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.180
 will keep like this my 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.909
 Acacia will dry for several days 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.909
 only you must be aware that she 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.840
 not lying in the sun should in the shade 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.710
 dry 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 and I have washed two twigs already and made from 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.590
 them tea is now warm water for me 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.219
 locations in his tea we need water on 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.670
 stage boiling so-called white key 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.170
 This is when the water has not had time to boil but 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.010
 and bottom wall has the ware 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.099
 actively bubble up and its temperature into it 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.840
 time is about 8590 degrees 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.060
 I place our sprigs of acacia teapot to them 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:29.739
 I will fill 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:32.440
 here and if you fill 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.110
 dry flowers location then you are a little bit 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.660
 fill with hot water first and through 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.810
 couple of seconds drain this water this way 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.730
 you wash your location and then 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.470
 pour boiling water and leave 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.660
 tune in for 10 minutes may 15 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.420
 ok, now I will talk about 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.989
 the beneficial properties of acacia first 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.299
 turn 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.040
 Acacia is the only tree that 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.569
 doesn't rot in the water all thanks to his 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.840
 antibacterial properties very strongly 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.600
 like trees on such flowers and leaves of bark 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.290
 Here is the substance that kill 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.170
 bacteria that's why acacia is helpful 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.359
 for any inflammatory 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:21.549
 diseases you can drink tea with honey when 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:24.040
 cold of course is very good acacia 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.600
 helps with urolithiasis and 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.260
 kidney disease as well as acacia 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.870
 this is a very female tree back in the long-standing 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.940
 times young girls who are just 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.890
 got married 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.630
 went to the acacia ask let's say 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:46.510
 blessing on having children and it is not 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.320
 just because thanks to acacia you can 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.470
 cure many female diseases 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.400
 that is, female genital diseases 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.370
 such as cervical erosion 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.609
 so how do we take one 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.400
 a tablespoon of acacia flowers can be 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:09.910
 dry can be fresh what we are you 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.200
 will be poured with one glass of boiling water and 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.330
 reserve at 100 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.600
 given somewhere one step but this 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:20.130
 infusion filter and takes three times 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.250
 per day 1 tablespoon before meals 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:28.720
 so you need to do about a month and 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.540
 parallel do another infusion to the floor 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.520
 liters of boiling water also take one dining room 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.270
 a spoonful of flowers of acacia fill and leave 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.180
 insist 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.760
 when the water is already pleasantly lukewarm 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.950
 used for douching here's how 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.760
 once a half liter is enough for one 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.419
 procedure 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.139
 do 10 douching procedures each 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.860
 day and over the course of the month we drink three 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.280
 times a day here this infusion and erosion 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.729
 cervix can thus be cured 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.650
 Acacia also helps with infertility, even 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.720
 I have not really calculated in 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.750
 There are many cases on the Internet when people 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.150
 praise really helped them precisely 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.479
 we drink a woman as tea we take a dining room 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.470
 a spoonful of fresh acacia flowers or dry 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.840
 fill 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:29.320
 such white key as i showed and 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.720
 drink tea before meals for two months 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.350
 this tea then two months doing 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.080
 break 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.050
 then drink two months again and two again 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.330
 months break and drink such cycles 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:46.870
 Acacia until I get pregnant 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:50.380
 here or another option you can do 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.120
 infusion of acacia flowers is well 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.889
 suitable for those who use 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.900
 alcohol for medicinal purposes so here we take 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.099
 1 tablespoon of flowers 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:07.840
 again dry or fresh and pour 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:11.669
 300 grams of vodka insist it all 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.610
 two weeks in a warm dark place 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.520
 probably in the bank to fill and cover 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.349
 lid occasionally need 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.819
 shake this infusion to 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:26.909
 mixed then it needs to be filtered and 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:30.090
 take three times a day for one 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:33.180
 tablespoon of water and drip 20 drops 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.580
 this tincture before meals accept a spoon 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.330

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.129
 if you accept tincture then one month 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.490
