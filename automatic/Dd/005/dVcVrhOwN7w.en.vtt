glory and double jeopardy and I'm going

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
glory and double jeopardy and I'm going
to<00:00:23.400> explain<00:00:23.760> why<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.779> endless<00:00:25.109> verdict<00:00:25.650> is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to explain why at endless verdict is

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
to explain why at endless verdict is
more<00:00:26.519> or<00:00:26.670> less<00:00:26.699> self<00:00:27.510> explanatory<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:30.529> do

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
more or less self explanatory if you do

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.740 
more or less self explanatory if you do
with<00:00:31.740> them<00:00:31.920> las<00:00:32.130> verdict<00:00:32.640> then<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.120> take<00:00:33.360> ten

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
with them las verdict then you take ten

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
with them las verdict then you take ten
percent<00:00:34.200> less<00:00:34.410> damage<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.640> very

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
percent less damage which is very very

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
percent less damage which is very very
good<00:00:35.969> especially<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.840> threes<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.320> twos<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
good especially in threes in twos you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.930 
good especially in threes in twos you
feel<00:00:37.920> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> more<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:40.430> it's<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.670> still

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
feel kind of more so it's it's still

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
feel kind of more so it's it's still
good<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.390> still<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> best

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
good it's still I think it's the best

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.590 
good it's still I think it's the best
glyph<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:45.360> yeah<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> keep<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:47.450> what<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
glyph we have so yeah I keep it what the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.709 
glyph we have so yeah I keep it what the
glories<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:50.280> cast<00:00:50.640> heels<00:00:51.030> pretty

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
glories because you do cast heels pretty

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.939 
glories because you do cast heels pretty
often<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:54.410> actually<00:00:55.410> let<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.879> SPECT<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.949> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
often and actually let me SPECT this you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
do cuss heels pretty often and it's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.770 
do cuss heels pretty often and it's
basically<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.620> cause<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.219> three<00:01:02.940> holy

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
basically if you cause the three holy

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
basically if you cause the three holy
power<00:01:04.140> word<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> glory<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.430> nine<00:01:05.640> percent

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
power word of glory you get nine percent

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
power word of glory you get nine percent
extra<00:01:06.780> damage<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.320> six<00:01:07.590> seconds<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
extra damage for six seconds so if you

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.270 
extra damage for six seconds so if you
have<00:01:08.580> wings<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> stuff<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.409> hammer<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
have wings and stuff up it's a hammer of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.289 
have wings and stuff up it's a hammer of
judgment<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:13.110> exorcism<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.970> are

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
judgment and then exorcism if you are

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.350 
judgment and then exorcism if you are
far<00:01:15.630> away<00:01:15.750> from<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.140> target<00:01:16.560> also<00:01:16.799> uh<00:01:17.360> holy

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
far away from a target also uh holy

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
far away from a target also uh holy
prism<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.020> that's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.380> good<00:01:19.979> extra<00:01:20.310> damage<00:01:20.490> nine

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
prism so that's a good extra damage nine

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.460 
prism so that's a good extra damage nine
percent<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> lot<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> think<00:01:22.200> about<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
percent is a lot if you think about it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.240 
percent is a lot if you think about it
with<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.920> cool<00:01:23.189> ends<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.759> adds<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
with all cool ends up it adds up and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.060 
with all cool ends up it adds up and
becomes<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.330> good<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
becomes really really good and then you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.730 
becomes really really good and then you
have<00:01:29.250> double<00:01:29.970> jeopardy<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.380> basically

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
have double jeopardy which is basically

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
have double jeopardy which is basically
when<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> switch<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> target<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.110> know

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
when you switch a target and you know

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
when you switch a target and you know
judge<00:01:34.920> someone<00:01:35.610> else<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.090> your<00:01:36.210> previous

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
judge someone else on your previous

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810 
judge someone else on your previous
target<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.590> twenty<00:01:38.280> percent<00:01:38.520> extra

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
target you do twenty percent extra

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
target you do twenty percent extra
damage<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.329> very<00:01:39.720> good<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:39.990> switches

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
damage that's very good for switches

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.429 
damage that's very good for switches
especially<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.430> three<00:01:41.640> versus<00:01:41.939> three<00:01:42.439> two

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
especially in three versus three two

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
especially in three versus three two
words<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.909> don't<00:01:45.149> really

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
words to I don't know you don't really

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.080 
words to I don't know you don't really
switch<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.110> much<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.950> freezes<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.759> flash

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
switch that much but freezes like flash

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.819 
switch that much but freezes like flash
nukes<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> stuff<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
nukes and stuff like that you do that a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.420 
nukes and stuff like that you do that a
lot<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.290> want<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> pop<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.890> cooldowns

let's say a warrior shadow priest or a
warrior<00:02:43.459> mage<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:44.090> would<00:02:44.510> keep<00:02:45.109> the<00:02:46.000> default

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
warrior mage I would keep the default

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.520 
warrior mage I would keep the default
one<00:02:47.530> because<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.690> more<00:02:50.690> or<00:02:50.750> less<00:02:51.170> stop<00:02:51.500> a

warrior but the mage damage or the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.729 
warrior but the mage damage or the
shadow<00:02:55.730> peace<00:02:55.970> damage<00:02:56.359> is<00:02:56.599> like<00:02:57.109> it's<00:02:57.470> going
