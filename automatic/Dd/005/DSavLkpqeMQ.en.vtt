00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 how come sx games opinion if someone 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.700
 citizen today it goes around the time 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.470
 since then is a classic isolation 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.670
 she books and yet often wrong 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.670
 accomplished 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.590
 the first error I like it then such 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.170
 First of all, sitting is that the poor too much 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.050
 be bent, that is a movement 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.029
 that looks like this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.070
 that's wrong what we want 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.289
 we want to make the long arm 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.730
 we do not want the arm too much 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.380
 but also do not angle by stretching 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.380
 slightly bent arms of the ground 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 Second, we do not want the somehow 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 but we have shoulder blades in front 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.359
 want to take shoulder back 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.000
 Now if you move your arm up 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.140
 many do this movement that they do 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.519
 instead of moving the elbow upwards 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.710
 move your hand upwards that you 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:00.180
 then quite the same or many 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.039
 make is too high 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.750
 In principle, they move the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.000
 elbow up and now comes 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.000
 somehow something like that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.320
 you only go up to a height of 90 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.500
 grad so if this zero position 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.570
 then this is 90 degrees 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.000
 Everything about this angle is here 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.610
 Going high is guilty of injury 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 and raps so we go with easy 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.020
 Angled arms are the highest position 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.330
 which is here and what we are 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.420
 want to make is not that you look 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.350
 tried the hand to get up to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.009
 why so the elbow yes so the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.440
 Elbow is always higher than that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.950
 Wrist does not hand is higher than 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.080
 it is the 90 Â° highest point of the elbow 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.210
 album offers the highest position 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.070
 important now is we want to do it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.920
 Lift time for which muscle percentage 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.009
 right for the middle delta for the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.979
 with middle shoulder head so 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.930
 we try to turn the dumbbell off 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.369
 when we exercise which you are from here 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.110
 lead and want the front welter 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.670
 which actually does not need and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.160
 we have the weather at all 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.440
 Press the movements in it while pressing 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.420
 The schoolboy presses it with it 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.250
 always primary or we always have 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.080
 very much blame the shapes front 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.170
 shoulder head in that means we want 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.360
 Do not run since as well because now 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.790
 I demand delta but I want 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.769
 the lateral side data who 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.200
 Gives us that wide look this 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.060
 Bodybuilding praises this then give us 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.720
 This shoulder head is our shoulder 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.220
 widening so that means we are 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.030
 turn the dumbbell out like a dumbbell 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.230
 Water bottle if that's you if we 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.950
 now as a glass pour me 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.750
 would 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.959
 Turn the dumbbell outwards 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.790
 straight and with increasing with increasing 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.860
 We turn off the dumbbell 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.519
 Now we have the full job 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.989
 he asks the middle data front 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.940
 data forum lateral delta okay that 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.100
 At the moment it was you too 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.150
 I liked it then and you the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.150
 channel soon
