00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.259
 all right 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.410
 old lady give us a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.539
 boot frankly very much sold to the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.570
 vertix stores is from the people of salt eva 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.180
 it's called rapace is a boot with a big 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.279
 put semiautomatic is a boot that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.860
 It also incorporates how it could not be 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.399
 another way a rubber vibrate the part 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.399
 frontal 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.470
 they would say that they eliminate the taco 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.379
 and they make us an area that they call 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.050
 climbing zone the idea is basically that 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.690
 have a lot of tact that is a very 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.550
 adherent and that in small 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.730
 outstanding stone as that is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.280
 easy to support the boot and take the step is 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.430
 a boot made in nubu that is a 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.400
 18 millimeter notebook in what it is 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.659
 a tremendously oily skin 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.940
 tremendously waterproof therefore 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.610
 but the impermeability is not given 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.470
 for this leather is given by its 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.270
 Goretex membrane like it could not be 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.000
 another way is a boot completely 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.910
 we can put waterproof or us 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.280
 We could put in a puddle with 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.940
 water until here the time that we did and 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.619
 would not enter water system 3 efe is a 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.600
 stability system developed by 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.850
 the people of saliva that what they do is 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 grab us at different points our 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.590
 stand up and avoid the ankle sprain 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.289
 I have to say it's a boot that I've 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.210
 I could try and test in depth I 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.180
 been with them in himalayas was in 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.090
 concrete in the area of the annapurnas and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.370
 many days through the area of the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.910
 annapurnas and Mustang area and 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:52.360
 stepped stone trodden snow and salt or mud 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:56.330
 treading water gave him an important tute 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.400
 observations this sideband made 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.460
 in rubber protects it in a magnificent way 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.560
 it's a boot that is not especially 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.619
 hot but that putting us a 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.660
 Adequate sock is ideal for trekking 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.340
 in height not recommended for the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.230
 panism and bernal 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.590
 In any case, the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.360
 things more details is a boot that in your 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.190
 interior part 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:28.910
 We can customize the thickness of the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.410
 template and that's fantastic and I make a 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.600
 double template that we can separate and you 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.160
 we can remove approximately half 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.530
 number to our foot so that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.930
 we hold a very high foot or we have a 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.300
 wider foot or the sock that we wear 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.150
 is tremendously thick we can eliminate 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.860
 a part of the template and 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.580
 customize them so we would say almost 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.660
 almost perfect the size of the boot to 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.600
 our durable comfortable foot and a 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.090
 small appreciation is a boot that stops 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.560
 people to my way of understanding that 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.570
 have a very important weight 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.180
 we would talk about people who could 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.760
 be around 90 kilos with a 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.010
 backpack of 10-15 kilos to the back is 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.810
 a boot that maybe is a bit soft 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.790
 agree therefore for you 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.040
 for the greatest people equal should 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.950
 go find boots a little stiffer 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.970
 for everyone else you are a clear 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.640
 most an excellent boot in agreement 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.580
 raptor boot of the people of that law goes 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.580
 that's why a little gem is
