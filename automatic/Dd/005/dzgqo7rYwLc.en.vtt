00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.210 

okay<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:37.460> you<00:05:37.700> can<00:05:37.820> see<00:05:37.970> I've<00:05:38.060> got<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.450> scales

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
okay so you can see I've got the scales

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.520 
okay so you can see I've got the scales
sit<00:05:40.220> up<00:05:40.340> and<00:05:40.700> tear<00:05:41.120> there<00:05:41.390> now<00:05:42.200> I'm<00:05:42.290> going<00:05:42.440> to

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
sit up and tear there now I'm going to

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.490 
sit up and tear there now I'm going to
make<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.710> little<00:05:42.980> bit<00:05:43.190> of<00:05:43.280> an<00:05:43.400> adjustment<00:05:44.350> to<00:05:45.350> my

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
make a little bit of an adjustment to my

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.110 
make a little bit of an adjustment to my
machine<00:05:45.680> just<00:05:46.490> get<00:05:46.640> a<00:05:46.670> little<00:05:46.820> bit<00:05:47.000> of<00:05:47.060> a

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
machine just get a little bit of a

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.840 
machine just get a little bit of a
platform<00:05:47.330> just<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.170> UM<00:05:48.380> suit<00:05:48.680> this<00:05:48.860> a<00:05:49.100> little

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
platform just to UM suit this a little

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.130 
platform just to UM suit this a little
bit<00:05:50.030> better<00:05:50.180> because<00:05:50.450> of<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.750> moment<00:05:51.080> of

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
bit better because of the moment of

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.560 
bit better because of the moment of
hanging<00:05:51.560> out<00:05:51.970> over<00:05:52.970> the<00:05:53.060> edge<00:05:53.300> and<00:05:54.970> it's<00:05:55.970> it's

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
hanging out over the edge and it's it's

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.570 
hanging out over the edge and it's it's
accurate<00:05:56.780> but<00:05:57.290> I<00:05:57.320> think<00:05:58.100> it<00:05:58.190> could<00:05:58.310> be<00:05:58.340> more

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
accurate but I think it could be more

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.140 
accurate but I think it could be more
accurate<00:05:59.090> if<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.840> was<00:05:59.960> a<00:05:59.990> completely<00:06:00.950> level<00:06:01.160> so

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
accurate if it was a completely level so

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.310 
accurate if it was a completely level so
that's<00:06:02.450> something<00:06:02.690> I'm<00:06:02.810> going<00:06:02.930> to<00:06:02.990> work<00:06:03.110> on

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
that's something I'm going to work on

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:11.530 
that's something I'm going to work on
but<00:06:03.590> um<00:06:03.740> that's<00:06:04.460> why<00:06:04.670> there's<00:06:04.880> espresso<00:06:10.540> so

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
but um that's why there's espresso so

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:19.950 
but um that's why there's espresso so
going<00:06:11.780> for<00:06:11.930> 35<00:06:12.320> grams

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.290 

so<00:06:20.960> this<00:06:21.260> is<00:06:21.410> way<00:06:21.650> this<00:06:21.889> espresso<00:06:22.550> or<00:06:22.970> as<00:06:23.150> much

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
so this is way this espresso or as much

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.690 
so this is way this espresso or as much
as<00:06:23.360> we<00:06:23.720> can<00:06:23.930> into<00:06:24.590> a<00:06:24.740> cup<00:06:24.950> just<00:06:24.980> to<00:06:25.250> see<00:06:25.490> how

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
as we can into a cup just to see how

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:41.020 
as we can into a cup just to see how
accurate<00:06:26.000> was<00:06:36.940> as<00:06:37.940> you<00:06:38.090> can<00:06:38.240> see<00:06:38.389> there<00:06:38.600> and<00:06:40.030> if

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
accurate was as you can see there and if

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.430 
accurate was as you can see there and if
you<00:06:41.120> look<00:06:41.270> at<00:06:41.389> what's<00:06:41.540> left<00:06:41.600> in<00:06:41.870> this<00:06:41.930> cup<00:06:42.169> here

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
you look at what's left in this cup here

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.280 
you look at what's left in this cup here
you<00:06:43.340> can<00:06:43.460> see<00:06:43.580> here<00:06:43.760> and<00:06:43.940> even<00:06:44.870> though<00:06:44.990> it<00:06:45.139> was

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
you can see here and even though it was

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.920 
you can see here and even though it was
not<00:06:45.440> was<00:06:45.800> that<00:06:45.830> sitting<00:06:46.550> out<00:06:47.180> of<00:06:47.419> the<00:06:47.510> edge<00:06:47.720> of

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
not was that sitting out of the edge of

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.630 
not was that sitting out of the edge of

00:06:51.640 --> 00:07:12.120
