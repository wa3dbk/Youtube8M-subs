00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 Thank you. 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:13.599
 Now, the principle of living in c is to make the most of what nature gives 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:19.860
 That will not do custard Le Natural 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.860
 So the gift of nature that is obtained is more valuable and precious here 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:31.020
 4 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.020
 Oh , it looks like I'll cook with fresh pumpkin I've harvested before . 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.650
 Tell me. 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:49.739
 Nowadays, Huh Gak have too much iron I 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.739
 This is what I want to do in the winter after I have dried up this kind of crab. 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.230
 The gifts of nature make the country a great place to live. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.519
 It does not appear in the sun 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.540
 I put a pumpkin in a machine that looks like a refrigerator . 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.540
 What is this machine? 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.100
 Recycled abandoned refrigerator, now the right cigar made by the right technology products Sunlight 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.980
 It is a dryer. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.940
 The structure of the sticky sun is simple 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:28.590
 It is divided into a g * plate and a dry box that collect solar heat 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:32.600
 Take the sunlight and warm the air inside the solar panel . 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.600
 Sending water causes dry farm 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.900
 On sunny days , you can get dry food if you smoke . 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.940
 U 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.820
 You can use it as a substitute for food 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:55.680
 If one desires about our deudi 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.680
 What things to eat it dry and bright enough to track all year round 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.330
 Now in the midst of work 10:00 Now we make a device that uses solar heat 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330
 There is 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:18.030
 It looks like something's going to come out of the complexity of the production process. 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.060
 What are you making now? 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.290
 I made a solar panel . 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:31.049
 I love my waist when it 's finished. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:37.140
 I did not pick it up while I was walking in the street. 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:38.909
 In June the number of cucumbers that are listed in writing so drunk at home made the host 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.019
 The ingredients 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:48.090
 I can go down to Yongcheon. 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:55.470
 Compared to cities, in fact the energy cost is very cheap or ice city cheap 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:01.280
 Now while contemplating coming Eojeol Oh, let's use the most religious Solar 4 Artemisia making 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:06.269
 Oh, let's make things like this Tint Taut appropriate technology We can write 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.650
 TOEIC is a walking retina that can be used literally using proper technology. 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.650
 I started thinking about it . 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.750
 Proper technology to reduce heating costs The completed water heater is switched on when the sun rises in the morning 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:24.389
 Even if you do not turn it on, 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:27.510
 The structure looks complicated, but if you study the principle, you can easily make it 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:31.739
 Now that the poet says 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.760
 Peppy's eyes are used in the winter because of the device that uses the artery 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:39.040
 There is 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:44.790
 Open while passing through the warmed antifreeze in the pipes in the canteen on the panels 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.790
 It will be discharged by the cold water in the storage tank 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.650
 Now there's a sunshine blower in the house. 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.980
 Since the solar moon efficiency received by the collectors is more than 80% 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:04.330
 It is a good and appropriate technology product as alternative energy 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.330
 The warm air is at the core of the convective speaker moving up in the air . 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:13.709
 What you see here is a hot air fan a cold wind gets in and gets warm 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:19.109
 This space is a naturally circulating system 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:22.960
 And out of the country over to the south that is completely dependent intermission in his five Him 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:27.550
 Do not do it because it is small 3 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:33.040
 It is also possible to use in the summertime 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:39.370
 I like that when you do not hit any more. I like Southern pilgu outside 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:44.290
 It is a kind of ventilator which discharges the air inside out when it is opened. 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.830
 And the Takesen meat of the summer 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:54.370
 4 mackerel car 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:58.090
 You can do it. In the summer, you can block the top hole to create a warm air of trust. 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:03.070
 It serves as a ventilator to pull it out. 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:06.600
 In winter, the air release opening the bottom of the hole been opposed to the solar 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.600
 Makes you feel good about the province 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:19.139
 Start gwicheon life and I then appropriate technology to solve energy problems themselves 

00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:19.139
 10:00 am now soaked in study 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.759
 There are many changes in the attitude of life naturally as applying appropriate technology to real life. 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.759
 It is said to be. 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:37.610
 Bo is letting you live in an apartment, for example, quite simply what 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:43.279
 I have everything I need to do . 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:47.599
 Coming down to the countryside to live in because there are a lot of things that I saw services 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:52.729
 I'll have to be in his hands, rattling Then think than there are hours 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:54.289
 There are a lot of hiding, but the fact is that we do not 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.539
 It's not consumed. 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:02.439
 It is the beginning of the moment when a person begins to lead his life with his own hands 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.439
 I think. 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:13.590
 The City's workshop is busy today. 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:18.659
 For people who are planning to get rid of or who have earned 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:23.150
 Byeongguk b is a appropriate technical workshop organized by the East Division 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.150
 Mr. Izen has been the instructor of this workshop. 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:33.690
 He's going to open this way and the wind will come in. 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:37.400
 Teach One is going into the candy of meat in the house is in the house 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.400
 We rewrite the outside herd with the notice .
