shown that there are differences in the
way<00:07:02.849> that<00:07:03.270> individuals<00:07:03.899> absorb<00:07:04.499> process<00:07:05.039> and

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:05.249 
way that individuals absorb process and

way that individuals absorb process and
respond<00:07:05.789> to<00:07:06.119> different<00:07:06.449> foods<00:07:06.839> and<00:07:07.110> my<00:07:07.740> hope

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
respond to different foods and my hope

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.309 
respond to different foods and my hope
is<00:07:08.189> that<00:07:08.219> someday<00:07:08.659> doctors<00:07:09.659> will<00:07:09.899> write<00:07:10.050> food

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 
is that someday doctors will write food

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.559 
is that someday doctors will write food
prescriptions<00:07:10.949> just<00:07:11.249> like<00:07:11.399> my<00:07:11.999> prescriptions

00:07:12.559 --> 00:07:12.569 
prescriptions just like my prescriptions

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.179 
prescriptions just like my prescriptions
for<00:07:12.689> different<00:07:13.020> doses<00:07:13.349> of<00:07:13.379> pharmaceuticals

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:14.189 
for different doses of pharmaceuticals

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:16.459 
for different doses of pharmaceuticals
now<00:07:15.119> of<00:07:15.179> course<00:07:15.389> this<00:07:15.899> is<00:07:16.080> not<00:07:16.229> going<00:07:16.409> to

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:16.469 
now of course this is not going to

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.379 
now of course this is not going to
change<00:07:16.679> overnight<00:07:16.979> but<00:07:17.399> change<00:07:17.939> starts<00:07:18.330> with

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
change overnight but change starts with

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.079
