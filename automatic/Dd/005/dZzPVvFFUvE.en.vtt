so<00:00:00.299> in<00:00:00.450> that<00:00:00.539> case<00:00:00.870> we<00:00:01.589> break<00:00:01.860> it<00:00:02.010> down<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.340> a

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so in that case we break it down to a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.150 
so in that case we break it down to a

source or it's a hard light what is it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.730 
source or it's a hard light what is it
about<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.070> lighting<00:01:51.380> shadow<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.590> about

about that lighting shadow what about

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.399 
about that lighting shadow what about
the<00:01:52.829> shadow<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:54.360> edge<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> shadow<00:01:55.079> not

the shadow the edge of the shadow not

the shadow the edge of the shadow not
the<00:01:55.590> density<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.250> there's<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> density

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the density because there's the density

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.480 
the density because there's the density

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
in the edge is it not so if we wish to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.569 
in the edge is it not so if we wish to
make<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.790> edge<00:02:00.619> transfer<00:02:01.619> over<00:02:02.040> large<00:02:02.340> area

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
make this edge transfer over large area

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.160 
make this edge transfer over large area
you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.850> either<00:02:03.030> increase<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.600> size<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
you can either increase the size of the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.700 
you can either increase the size of the
source<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:05.270> move<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> closer<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.990 
source or move it closer and as the
source<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.160> bigger<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.580> bring<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.819> closer

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
source get bigger as you bring it closer

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.620 
source get bigger as you bring it closer
and<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:10.289> rate<00:02:10.470> does<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.830> bigger

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and what rate does it get bigger

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.690 
and what rate does it get bigger
by<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.440> law<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.830> universe<00:02:13.950> by<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.430> square

to<00:02:17.790> two<00:02:17.940> feet<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.540> source<00:02:18.780> gets<00:02:18.990> twice<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.290> big

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
to two feet the source gets twice as big

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.140 
to two feet the source gets twice as big
vertically<00:02:19.800> twice<00:02:20.250> big<00:02:20.460> horizontally<00:02:20.970> it

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
vertically twice big horizontally it

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.360 
vertically twice big horizontally it
becomes<00:02:21.360> four<00:02:21.570> times<00:02:21.780> larger<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.440> diminish<00:02:23.220> the

becomes four times larger I diminish the
distance<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.730> half<00:02:25.460> okay<00:02:26.460> we<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.180> call<00:02:27.360> that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
distance in half okay we can call that

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.740 
distance in half okay we can call that
pretty<00:02:27.750> light<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.770> call<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:28.950> soft<00:02:29.430> light

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
pretty light we can call that soft light

diffuse the diffuse of the shadow the
diffuse<00:05:12.159> of<00:05:12.279> the<00:05:12.369> shadow<00:05:12.580> but<00:05:12.879> then<00:05:13.029> they're

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:13.149 
diffuse of the shadow but then they're

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:14.129 
diffuse of the shadow but then they're
gonna<00:05:13.240> deal<00:05:13.479> with<00:05:13.539> in<00:05:13.719> a<00:05:13.779> whole<00:05:13.959> different

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
gonna deal with in a whole different

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.540 
gonna deal with in a whole different

photography<00:05:17.589> it<00:05:17.919> is<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.639> diffuse<00:05:19.029> to<00:05:19.389> the

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
photography it is the diffuse to the

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.820 
photography it is the diffuse to the
specular<00:05:21.129> okay<00:05:22.089> when<00:05:22.749> that<00:05:22.869> when<00:05:23.289> when<00:05:23.649> you

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
specular okay when that when when you

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.799 
specular okay when that when when you
have<00:05:24.069> no<00:05:24.339> information<00:05:24.939> to<00:05:24.969> shadow<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.599> is

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:25.809 
have no information to shadow it is

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.069 
have no information to shadow it is
reliant<00:05:26.409> upon<00:05:26.499> it<00:05:26.860> as<00:05:27.009> you<00:05:27.639> can<00:05:27.759> see<00:05:27.819> here<00:05:28.389> but

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:29.079 
reliant upon it as you can see here but

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.449 
reliant upon it as you can see here but
before<00:05:29.199> we<00:05:29.469> start<00:05:29.559> breaking<00:05:29.829> this<00:05:30.129> one<00:05:30.279> into

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:30.459 
before we start breaking this one into

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:31.709 
before we start breaking this one into
its<00:05:30.610> components<00:05:31.149> and<00:05:31.269> talk<00:05:31.389> about<00:05:31.629> the

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
its components and talk about the

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.719 
its components and talk about the
relative<00:05:32.079> brightness<00:05:32.199> of<00:05:32.619> the<00:05:33.279> diffuse<00:05:33.579> to

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
relative brightness of the diffuse to

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:34.979 
relative brightness of the diffuse to
the<00:05:33.819> specular<00:05:34.209> and<00:05:34.239> how<00:05:34.419> this<00:05:34.629> image<00:05:34.869> is

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:34.989 
the specular and how this image is

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:36.689 
the specular and how this image is
predominantly<00:05:35.649> diffuse<00:05:35.979> and<00:05:36.129> specular<00:05:36.369> range

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
predominantly diffuse and specular range

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.749 
predominantly diffuse and specular range
we<00:05:37.449> do<00:05:37.599> now<00:05:37.749> have<00:05:37.989> to<00:05:38.139> take<00:05:38.289> a<00:05:38.319> true<00:05:38.589> break<00:05:38.860> okay

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
we do now have to take a true break okay

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.100 
we do now have to take a true break okay
and<00:05:39.969> get<00:05:40.089> back<00:05:40.209> on<00:05:40.389> this<00:05:40.509> in<00:05:40.659> about<00:05:40.869> ten

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
and get back on this in about ten

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.659 
and get back on this in about ten
minutes<00:05:41.139> okay<00:05:41.589> and<00:05:42.009> then<00:05:42.279> we'll<00:05:42.399> get<00:05:42.490> it<00:05:42.610> to

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
minutes okay and then we'll get it to

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.029 
minutes okay and then we'll get it to
this<00:05:42.759> section
