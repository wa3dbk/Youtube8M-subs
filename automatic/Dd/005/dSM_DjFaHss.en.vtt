quick video on what i believe to be a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.560 
quick video on what i believe to be a
bug<00:00:07.620> I'm<00:00:08.160> gonna<00:00:08.340> call<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.760> bug<00:00:08.940> maybe<00:00:09.360> it's

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
bug I'm gonna call the bug maybe it's

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.320 
bug I'm gonna call the bug maybe it's
not<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.750> bug<00:00:10.160> but<00:00:11.160> if<00:00:11.429> it's<00:00:11.610> not<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.120> feature

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
not a bug but if it's not it's a feature

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.970 
not a bug but if it's not it's a feature
I<00:00:12.450> think<00:00:12.809> should<00:00:13.139> not<00:00:13.200> be<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.650> game<00:00:13.799> which

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
I think should not be in the game which

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.950 
I think should not be in the game which
doesn't<00:00:14.280> make<00:00:14.370> sense<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.719> pretty

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
doesn't make sense and it's pretty

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.420 
doesn't make sense and it's pretty
significant<00:00:16.500> because<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:16.980> game<00:00:17.070> it

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
significant because in this game it

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.109 
significant because in this game it
turns<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.789> from<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.000> pretty<00:00:18.330> easy<00:00:18.600> win<00:00:20.090> into<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
turns it from a pretty easy win into a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.090 
turns it from a pretty easy win into a
loss<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.500> can't<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> major

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
loss so it can they can't have a major

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.670 
loss so it can they can't have a major
effect<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:24.000> situation<00:00:24.750> right<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.289> I'm<00:00:25.500> on

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the Zerg is actually only on three base

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
the Zerg is actually only on three base
right<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.379> he's<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.640> dedicated

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
right now so he's you know dedicated

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.310 
right now so he's you know dedicated
really<00:00:45.360> hard<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.079> pretty<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.670> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
really hard to going pretty all in and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.900 
really hard to going pretty all in and
I'm<00:00:49.320> actually<00:00:49.500> about<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> take<00:00:50.219> my<00:00:50.340> fourth<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
I'm actually about to take my fourth and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.520 
I'm actually about to take my fourth and
I've<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.840> four<00:00:52.020> positions

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
I've if I get this four positions

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.139 
I've if I get this four positions
basically<00:00:52.739> over<00:00:53.190> once<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> base<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
basically over once I get a base is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.810 
basically over once I get a base is
really<00:00:54.300> close<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.660> serve<00:00:55.079> basis<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.820> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
really close to serve basis it's a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.290 
really close to serve basis it's a
really<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.149> spot<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.390> me<00:00:59.270> anyways<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> he

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
really good spot for me anyways so he

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
really good spot for me anyways so he
comes<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.870> guess<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.650> miss<00:01:04.860> rally<00:01:05.070> maybe

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
comes I guess like miss rally maybe

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.590 
comes I guess like miss rally maybe
didn't<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.519> about<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> space<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.360> he<00:01:06.450> comes

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
didn't know about the space but he comes

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000 
didn't know about the space but he comes
running<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.140> through<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.590> pissed<00:01:07.830> me<00:01:07.979> off

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
running right through and pissed me off

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.649 
running right through and pissed me off
at<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.580> close<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> whole<00:01:09.180> bunches<00:01:09.479> they're

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
at like close a whole bunches they're

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.090 
at like close a whole bunches they're
going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> coming<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.470> what's<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:10.920> base

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
going to coming just what's on my base

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.480 
going to coming just what's on my base

that the secret missiles are going to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.660 
that the secret missiles are going to
hit<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:52.350> he'd<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.830> run<00:01:52.979> south<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.550> out

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
hit is he'd have to run south to get out

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
hit is he'd have to run south to get out
of<00:01:53.759> range<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.899> way<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> secret<00:01:58.380> missile

Splash Damage works it does a hundred
damage<00:02:00.720> like<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.530> does<00:02:01.770> 50<00:02:02.250> damage<00:02:02.280> like

damage like this it does 50 damage like
that<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:03.930> 25<00:02:04.440> damage<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.270> and

that and then 25 damage like this and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
that and then 25 damage like this and
since<00:02:06.450> palings<00:02:06.840> only<00:02:07.050> have<00:02:07.170> 35<00:02:07.649> hit<00:02:07.920> points

you<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> first<00:02:09.000> two<00:02:09.179> layers<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.539> splash

you know the first two layers of splash

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.170 
you know the first two layers of splash
kills<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.530> bailing<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.039> then<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> wide

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
kills the bailing and then the wide

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.960 
kills the bailing and then the wide
splash<00:02:12.989> area<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.769> know<00:02:13.860> he's<00:02:14.070> had<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.640> get<00:02:14.760> hit

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
splash area you know he's had to get hit

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.820 
splash area you know he's had to get hit
by<00:02:15.120> two<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.450> those<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.840> die<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> would

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
by two of those and die so I would

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.460 
by two of those and die so I would
expect<00:02:16.950> from<00:02:17.310> these<00:02:17.459> seekers<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.000> fire<00:02:18.269> off<00:02:18.480> but

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
expect from these seekers I fire off but

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
expect from these seekers I fire off but
maybe<00:02:19.620> five<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:19.980> these<00:02:20.220> mailings<00:02:20.459> will

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
maybe five of these mailings will

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940 
maybe five of these mailings will
survive<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.959> then<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> PF<00:02:22.500> will<00:02:22.650> probably

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
survive and then the PF will probably

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.440 
survive and then the PF will probably
pop<00:02:23.100> off<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.459> those<00:02:23.670> families<00:02:23.970> before<00:02:24.269> they<00:02:24.360> get

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
pop off I those families before they get

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.350 
pop off I those families before they get
in<00:02:24.540> range<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.140> been<00:02:25.260> hitting<00:02:25.500> anything<00:02:26.360> so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
in range of you been hitting anything so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.789 
in range of you been hitting anything so
this<00:02:27.480> should<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.840> curb<00:02:28.079> stomp<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.560> every

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
this should be a curb stomp in every

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.940 
this should be a curb stomp in every
single<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.250> from<00:02:29.489> what<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.670> expect<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:31.290> it's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
single way from what I expect but it's

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.580 
single way from what I expect but it's
not<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:34.040> will<00:02:35.040> display<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.459> out

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
not going to be will display it out

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.240 
not going to be will display it out
there<00:02:37.590> goes<00:02:37.739> all<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.890> seekers

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.930 

right<00:02:42.280> huh<00:02:42.580> check<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.840> one<00:02:43.959> more<00:02:44.110> time

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
right huh check that out one more time

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.510 
right huh check that out one more time
so<00:02:45.940> i<00:02:46.000> targeted<00:02:46.750> baling<00:02:47.260> eggs<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:48.190> then<00:02:48.370> when

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
so i targeted baling eggs and then when

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.880 
so i targeted baling eggs and then when
the<00:02:48.640> baling<00:02:49.120> turned<00:02:49.540> into<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:50.020> failing<00:02:50.680> egg

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the baling turned into a failing egg

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.890 
the baling turned into a failing egg
turn<00:02:51.100> into<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.370> bailing<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.209> Seekers<00:02:52.600> lost

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
turn into a bailing the Seekers lost

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.110 
turn into a bailing the Seekers lost
their<00:02:53.080> target<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.620> are<00:02:53.770> still<00:02:54.010> targeted<00:02:54.550> you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
their target and are still targeted you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.720 
their target and are still targeted you
can<00:02:55.209> see<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.510> dots<00:02:55.720> right<00:02:55.990> here<00:02:56.170> 1<00:02:56.470> 2<00:02:56.709> 3<00:02:56.740> 4

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.010 

still<00:03:00.730> targeted<00:03:01.209> where<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.510> bailing<00:03:01.810> eggs

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
still targeted where the bailing eggs

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.960 
still targeted where the bailing eggs
were<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.770> can<00:03:02.920> see<00:03:03.070> if<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.459> Biff<00:03:03.760> these

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
were and you can see if the Biff these

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.280 
were and you can see if the Biff these
and<00:03:04.150> seekers<00:03:04.450> are<00:03:04.570> actually<00:03:04.780> launching<00:03:05.170> out

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
and seekers are actually launching out

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.630 
and seekers are actually launching out
the<00:03:05.440> palings<00:03:05.770> right<00:03:05.890> now<00:03:06.040> like<00:03:06.250> look<00:03:06.430> how<00:03:06.580> it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the palings right now like look how it

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.949 
the palings right now like look how it
calmed<00:03:06.910> up<00:03:07.060> these<00:03:07.180> mailings<00:03:07.420> are<00:03:07.630> they're<00:03:07.840> all

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
calmed up these mailings are they're all

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.630 
calmed up these mailings are they're all
going<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.230> be<00:03:08.290> dead<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.770> this<00:03:11.980> mechanic<00:03:12.400> kind

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
going to be dead so this mechanic kind

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.140 
going to be dead so this mechanic kind
of<00:03:12.730> works<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.209> different<00:03:13.300> ways<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:15.150> skip

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
of works in different ways you can skip

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.680 
of works in different ways you can skip
out<00:03:16.300> on<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:18.820> can<00:03:18.880> screw<00:03:19.150> up<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.330> targeting

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
out on a you can screw up the targeting

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.199 
out on a you can screw up the targeting
of<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.870> seeker<00:03:20.170> missile<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:21.060> currently<00:03:22.060> it's

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
of a seeker missile but currently it's

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.570 
of a seeker missile but currently it's
only<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.540> ways<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:23.080> make<00:03:23.620> sense<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:24.400> take

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
only in ways that make sense and take

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.570 
only in ways that make sense and take
micro<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.989> launch<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:27.040> seeker<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.430> had

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
micro like if you launch a seeker I had

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.360 
micro like if you launch a seeker I had
a<00:03:27.610> stalker<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.420> soccer<00:03:28.660> blinks<00:03:29.230> then<00:03:29.830> the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
a stalker and the soccer blinks then the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.729 
a stalker and the soccer blinks then the
seeker<00:03:30.700> loses<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.180> target<00:03:31.600> or<00:03:34.620> if<00:03:35.620> you

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
seeker loses this target or if you

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.920 
seeker loses this target or if you
launch<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.070> seeker<00:03:36.459> at<00:03:36.670> like<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.000> siege<00:03:37.330> tank<00:03:37.660> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
launch a seeker at like a siege tank and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.150 
launch a seeker at like a siege tank and
then<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.170> pick<00:03:38.380> up<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.590> siege<00:03:38.739> tank<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.100> a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
then you pick up the siege tank in a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.040 
then you pick up the siege tank in a
medevac<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.550> fly<00:03:39.910> away<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.420> secret<00:03:40.750> loses

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
medevac and fly away the secret loses

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.540 
medevac and fly away the secret loses
its<00:03:41.230> target<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.680> just<00:03:41.830> remembers<00:03:42.100> where<00:03:42.459> the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
its target it just remembers where the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.340 
its target it just remembers where the
siege<00:03:42.730> tank<00:03:42.940> last<00:03:43.120> was<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.870> think<00:03:44.049> those

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
siege tank last was so I think those

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.660 
siege tank last was so I think those
kind<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.739> makes<00:03:44.920> sense<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.310> doesn't<00:03:45.579> make

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
kind of makes sense this doesn't make

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.330 
kind of makes sense this doesn't make
sense<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.060> me<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.329> think<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.110> zergling<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.829> the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
sense to me I think is zergling and the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.069 
sense to me I think is zergling and the
bailing<00:03:48.730> egg<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.030> turns<00:03:49.209> into<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.870> then<00:03:49.959> the

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
bailing egg it turns into and then the

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.960 
bailing egg it turns into and then the
bailing<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.739> bailing<00:03:51.340> egg<00:03:51.489> turns<00:03:51.790> into

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
bailing that the bailing egg turns into

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.759 
bailing that the bailing egg turns into
it's<00:03:52.329> all<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.660> same<00:03:52.810> unit<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.530> should

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
it's all the same unit and that should

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.670 
it's all the same unit and that should
not<00:03:53.799> actually<00:03:54.370> screw<00:03:54.640> up<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.850> a<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.480> a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
not actually screw up the a I have a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.350 
not actually screw up the a I have a
secret<00:03:56.680> missile<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.250> where<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.030> maybe<00:03:58.150> be

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
secret missile and where it maybe be

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.360 
secret missile and where it maybe be
situational<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.440> game<00:03:59.590> like<00:03:59.709> this<00:03:59.769> you<00:04:00.280> know

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
situational in a game like this you know

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.000 
situational in a game like this you know
it<00:04:00.610> went<00:04:00.820> from<00:04:00.970> like<00:04:01.739> I'd<00:04:02.739> have<00:04:02.890> an

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
it went from like I'd have an

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.000 
it went from like I'd have an
unbelievable<00:04:03.640> lead<00:04:04.620> basically<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.709> game<00:04:05.860> be

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
unbelievable lead basically the game be

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.280 
unbelievable lead basically the game be
over<00:04:06.310> because<00:04:06.549> mass<00:04:06.730> Ravens<00:04:07.090> are<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.329> mean<00:04:07.510> if

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
over because mass Ravens are I mean if

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.509 
over because mass Ravens are I mean if
you<00:04:08.380> don't<00:04:08.560> know<00:04:08.680> they're<00:04:08.950> unbelievably

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
you don't know they're unbelievably

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.970 
you don't know they're unbelievably
cost-efficient<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:11.530> know<00:04:11.620> once<00:04:11.829> all

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
cost-efficient and you know once all

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.410 
cost-efficient and you know once all
these<00:04:12.070> buildings<00:04:12.489> pop<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:13.120> means<00:04:13.329> he

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
these buildings pop that means he

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.550 
these buildings pop that means he
definitely<00:04:13.750> won't<00:04:13.810> tell<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.140> army<00:04:14.320> to
