now I'm gonna give you a support

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.330 
now I'm gonna give you a support
politoed<00:05:32.880> now<00:05:33.330> this<00:05:33.539> is<00:05:33.750> this<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.800> support

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
politoed now this is this is a support

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.610 
politoed now this is this is a support
politoed<00:05:35.880> build<00:05:36.210> I'm<00:05:36.570> running<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.110> wide<00:05:37.259> lens

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
politoed build I'm running the wide lens

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.089 
politoed build I'm running the wide lens
so<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.580> can<00:05:38.849> get<00:05:38.970> that<00:05:39.380> ten<00:05:40.380> percent<00:05:40.530> extra

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
so I can get that ten percent extra

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.430 
so I can get that ten percent extra
accuracy<00:05:41.550> boost<00:05:42.000> well<00:05:42.780> actually<00:05:43.050> at<00:05:43.320> one

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
accuracy boost well actually at one

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.610 
accuracy boost well actually at one
point<00:05:43.590> one<00:05:44.630> times<00:05:45.630> actually<00:05:46.080> boost<00:05:46.320> which<00:05:46.500> is

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
point one times actually boost which is

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.529 
point one times actually boost which is
actually<00:05:46.919> ten<00:05:47.130> percent<00:05:47.460> so<00:05:47.520> for<00:05:48.120> example<00:05:48.479> like

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
actually ten percent so for example like

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.390 
actually ten percent so for example like
hydro<00:05:48.900> pump<00:05:49.139> is<00:05:49.320> eighty<00:05:49.740> percent<00:05:50.130> accuracy

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
hydro pump is eighty percent accuracy

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.850 
hydro pump is eighty percent accuracy
now<00:05:50.729> it's<00:05:50.880> a<00:05:50.940> ninety<00:05:51.180> percent<00:05:51.360> accuracy<00:05:51.870> so<00:05:52.560> it

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
now it's a ninety percent accuracy so it

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.890 
now it's a ninety percent accuracy so it
makes<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.580> move<00:05:53.759> more<00:05:54.060> efficient<00:05:54.659> on

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
makes the move more efficient on

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.700 
makes the move more efficient on
politoed<00:05:55.860> i'm<00:05:56.219> running<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.639> same<00:05:56.789> spread<00:05:57.710> but
