00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:11.070
 jojo people new video theme corn and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:14.519
 Although I send youtube diet dear 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.440
 corn and before the question arises 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.230
 that is healthy then that is good for the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.970
 you usually do not have diet 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 I read a lot and the genius 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.150
 Anybody is writing on the internet 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.390
 what he can blossom out about it so the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.320
 enroll has a high one 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.360
 According to insulin levels , that is to say 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.090
 by the sugar content one sets very much 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.890
 So much insulin is released as very 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.670
 counterproductive for the next 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.440
 write no knows has a low 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 glycemic index that means no 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.200
 blood sugar fluctuations then it has times 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.520
 again many minerals magnesium potassium 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.760
 then it has again no minerals 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 very little so every picture of it what 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.829
 he just heard that somewhere 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.870
 interesting now mainly for the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.110
 people because first project is corn 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.729
 healthy no matter what you read the big one 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.310
 Problem is usually one actually 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.299
 the cereals is actually no 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.460
 vegetables and cereals are rather unhealthy 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.640
 and there are many people 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.390
 we have problems in the crop 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950
 contained protein namely the gluten 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.920
 have to metabolize optimally so 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.439
 a gluten intolerance and there 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
 blood almost affects him like an opioid 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.210
 really means the senses fogged 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.549
 it leads to a damaged one 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.259
 Gastrointestinal gastric acid deficiency and it 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.490
 is definitely not a staple food 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.320
 that's why I generally recommend in the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.009
 diet roll omit noodles omit 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.930
 omit circle 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.549
 the interesting thing is there is the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.820
 possibility and now it usually comes to 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:04.229
 So switch from wheat to mail instead of mail 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.380
 wheat or corn millet corn mail so 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.060
 like the old mayas have a lot 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.129
 worked with the water and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.859
 food 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:18.480
 and instead of bread made from wheat or from 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:21.120
 answer would recommend corn bread full factory 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.810
 or millet whole bread or cheap 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.530
 bread or buckwheat the castle held 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.280
 Hard wheat pasta is usually pasta 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.739
 or buckwheat so let's solve the problem 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.260
 that you feed with cereals 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.389
 these symptoms experience the I 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.530
 called the beginning of this whole story 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.829
 that's the interesting thing 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.230
 the opium in wheat they always gluten 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.700
 bleeding is difficult to digest often is it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.189
 not completely in single 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.310
 amino acids celia because of the protein 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.500
 chain is it remains incomplete 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.599
 digested gluten fragments back and 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.400
 These protein fragments are called 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.150
 peptides therefore make a connection 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.609
 amino acids 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.010
 now comes depending on the state of 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.019
 intestinal mucosa they can 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.870
 mucous membrane happen and get in 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:17.069
 The brown flood peptides can now 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.220
 endogenous substances endorphins mimic 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.290
 which have important functions and 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.669
 on pain or happiness or 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.870
 also a control of the hunger feeling 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.840
 involved 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.319
 So you call the gluten peptides too 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.810
 opioid peptides the word hope you is from 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.449
 it starts from opium and has one 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.120
 invigorating effect of these peptides 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:41.609
 that means, of all things , last 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.650
 Cereals break away from their rice noodles 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.560
 Potatoes Everything From Millet Everything 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.799
 Wheat everything from durum wheat leave that off 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.979
 and picks on cornmeal stuff yes 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:56.639
 at that time always known 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:58.590
 white red with always taken to school 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.049
 slim though we never ate a little 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.229
 got it right and it will 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.930
 just definitely more nutritious from 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.120
 Body usually metabolizes 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.270
 thumbs up 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.920
 wheat 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:19.140
 barley oatmeal but block eyes 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.140
 must press down
