00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.540
 or 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.240
 hit me horrible is super fun 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.419
 do so many reviews in a few days 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.029
 from today it is de l'orÃ©al paris 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:19.480
 the bid hydrated curls with which not 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.369
 shampoo hidra definition good first 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.670
 let's start with this, this is not 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.080
 This is my hair the texture normal 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.170
 of my hair my hair is a side 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 I do not consider the fringe or anything the day of 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.320
 today to give you an idea of how 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 is my hair normally my hair is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.620
 very very very thin but I have a lot 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.989
 hair then that's why you see it looks 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.150
 like there's a lot of hair I have hair 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.680
 thinnest of a lot of hair my hair 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.540
 it tends to be quite dry very dry in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.940
 general that is the texture 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.920
 which usually has then always 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.860
 what I look for in a shampoo and 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.239
 conditioner more than anything is that it helps 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.590
 to moisturize the hair and that helps 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.380
 seal that hydration 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.100
 that's basically what what 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.780
 I look for any conditioner shampoo 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.530
 treatment for hair and so on 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.120
 etc 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.120
 I feel that as my diet has 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 gone 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.810
 I feel that a great influence on me 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.420
 hair has been my feeding on 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.600
 everything in the last months since February 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.819
 more or less I started with a wave of eating 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.429
 as organic and so then I stopped 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:40.060
 eat a lot of things I stopped eating breads 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:43.479
 of the box stop drinking milk completely 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.420
 I stopped taking all soft drinks juices 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.250
 things that have artificial sugars 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.380
 I do not put sugar 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.910
 nothing you take is not many things in 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.410
 I'm generally trying to eat more 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.750
 organic and I think that that really has 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.090
 seen in my hair my hair looks more 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.000
 Shiny and with more life in the past 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.149
 months and I attribute it to that in addition 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.399
 that as fewer things of that kind as 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.590
 more vegetables like many more vegetables 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.990
 greens and green fruits that are what 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.990
 they help to oxygenate it all the 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.450
 body then the hair finally is 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.860
 It is also part of this whole process 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.020
 economic favorite is this in general my 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 Favorite economic brand is the bid 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.300
 I think the bid has very good 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.489
 quality in terms of shampoo has as 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.920
 those standard things that are good do not 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.290
 that has a good price handles more or 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.360
 less good formulas and I do not throw the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.420
 hair because for example pantene the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.280
 after using it a couple of a couple of 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.900
 weeks I realized that my hair was 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.790
 began to fall a lot and generally 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.010
 I do not have hair loss at all 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.860
 and many people have told me what happens to him 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.830
 the same with that brand 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.470
 then that does not happen to me and this 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.540
 presentation especially curls 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.430
 hydrated I use it because my hair 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.710
 It is wavy and I like it to be 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.450
 wavy a lot of people do not like their 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.030
 natural hair I love my hair 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.550
 natural fascinates me is wavy me what 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.140
 ironed I fix it differently 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.700
 to see me a little different but in 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.780
 overall I love my hair so 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.530
 How is it 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.690
 and I think I always leave more as 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.220
 the presentations for curly hair 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.110
 because I feel that they are the ones 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.480
 they usually bring collagen or bring 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.560
 proteins that help hydrate the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.560
 hair while 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.060
 if I feel that the more I use this type 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.459
 of more hydrated formulas looks like 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.769
 that helps my hair to undulate 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.450
 more and I like that a lot because there 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.599
 times where the year in which I have left 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.040
 as very straight I would be noticed as a straight 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.980
 You are here and here it starts 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.109
 undulate and there are days that dawns everything very 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.480
 wavy and is that it appears as more straight 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.220
 then when he used these shampoos as 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.590
 that ripples more and I like that a lot 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.909
 they do not leave my hair heavy and I think 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.890
 that for me that's something very, very 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.519
 important in general people who 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.379
 we have liver hair and any 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.060
 product leaves it very heavy and I use 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.730
 many products more than anything for 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.250
 avoid getting entangled because for the same reason 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.769
 that the hair is very straight but very 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.130
 lazio very thin pardon and how is it not 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.800
 straight as it is more wavy tangles like this 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.260
 at any time of the day under any 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.840
 circumstance and that is terrible this 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.490
 presentation especially I feel that I 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.250
 That helps a lot to like you more 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.930
 definition to me to my wavy that much 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.720
 I like to keep it hydrated 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.919
 and I also feel that it helps me stay 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.490
 Special lightweight of 750 milliliters each 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:50.120
 each one and I took it cost me in 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.639
 set as 100 110 pesos that is to say that 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.310
 they must undulate between 50 and 55 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.410
 weights each bag almost always when 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.259
 find the largest package the 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.479
 750 milliliters is much cheaper 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.780
 than buying the 250 milliliter that you 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.090
 it costs like 35 pesos but here you have 3 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.560
 times more then product in 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.300
 I generally recommend them if they are not 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.940
 still very safe try the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.949
 presentation of 250 milliliters but if 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.840
 his hair is more style mine this 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:22.669
 is going to serve a lot then that's the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.139
 price I think the price is very very 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.990
 good and it's a very good shampoo 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.550
 quality here says in hydrated curls 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.469
 collagen hydra shampoo definition 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.599
 hydration 24 hours and I feel that the one 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.449
 keeps my hair hydrated much more 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:42.499
 that other shampoos the same the same 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.689
 mark the bid has has the shampoo and 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:47.240
 the whole line of royal jelly and I like 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.800
 a lot of royal jelly and I feel that if 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.169
 gives you also have the version of 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.879
 repair 5 in one something like that are 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.550
 similar but the idea is pretty much 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:57.080
 keep hair healthy and all this and 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.089
 if I feel that it hydrates the hair but 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.129
 I feel that this presentation especially 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:03.499
 it hydrates it much more by much more 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.749
 time I wash my hair one day yes and a 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:07.430
 day not and still the second day that no 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:10.369
 I washed my hair like for example in 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:15.439
 a wash my hair is still very manageable 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:18.110
 very very light and very soft not touching it 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.449
 I really like is anti frizz division if 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.409
 gives more definition and I achieve this type 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:27.349
 of wavy when you used this shampoo or in 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.270
 special and also anti frizz I do not feel 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.020
 I have a lot of frizz I have 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.629
 a lot of frizz 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.580
 or if it happens to me that here next to 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:38.129
 they can see I have as little children 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.759
 small in this hair that never 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:42.419
 they grow and if you help me a bit with the 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.400
 frizz 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.740
 when I iron my hair when I do not 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.449
 dry it with a dryer and the rest is when 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.009
 it is more noticeable that my body is very hydrated 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.990
 hair because even though I have 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.919
 ironed much more this last month that 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:58.680
 that normally I have not been dehydrated 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.810
 for nothing and I feel that it looks very very very 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.400
 nice and that I untangled it in the 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.020
 shower because I do not have it that 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.090
 untangling in the shower but not 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.479
 unravels but unraveled in the shower 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.479
 with a comb with wide beaks and the rest 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.400
 of the day I left soft smooth soft very 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.050
 nice very defined and I feel that help 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.120
 a lot with that, I do not get so entangled 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.650
 when I use narrows and have this 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.330
 hair type I think you will like 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.849
 If you have tried it, tell me how 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.069
 it worked for them and if they have not tried it 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:27.750
 try it and tell us how it goes like this 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.210
 leave it in the comments I see them in the 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.610
 next video and we still have left 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:36.139
 Quite a few bids, so keep watching the channel 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.139
 and many kisses bye
