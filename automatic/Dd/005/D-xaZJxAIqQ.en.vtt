00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:09.195
As I look around I see

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:13.075
This wonderful world round me,

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.867
A rainbow many colours bright

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:20.711
For all to see

00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:24.253
Treasures so warm and gold

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:27.833
And wonders for all to hold

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.751
Surrounded by the afterglow

00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:55.909
Would you come with me

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.433
We'll swim the deep blue sea

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.160
How'd you like to come and play in my garden

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:06.037
(And swim in) coral caves in the sea

00:02:06.037 --> 00:02:11.130
Periwinkles, starfish, splashing and dancing

00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:15.910
So won't you come on down here with me,

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:21.900
We can build sand castles,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.820
Finding pearls and swim with turtles

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:32.017
Would you like to come and play in my garden

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:34.930
So come on down and play with me

00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:37.330
Just swim around and stay with me

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:41.740
And share that ocean magic with me
