you switch this right here and it

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.200 
you switch this right here and it
tightens<00:00:07.799> up<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.040> oscillation<00:00:08.700> for<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.970> finer

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210

this<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:13.920> specifically<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:15.119> put<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
this one for specifically we put this to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.410 
this one for specifically we put this to
the<00:01:15.659> test<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> solid<00:01:17.369> three-inch<00:01:17.939> hard

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the test on a solid three-inch hard

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
the test on a solid three-inch hard
maple<00:01:18.689> table<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.320> glued<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.710> some<00:01:19.920> planks<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
maple table we glued up some planks and

maple table we glued up some planks and
then<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.390> sand<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> surface

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
then it was time to sand the surface

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.070 
then it was time to sand the surface
smooth<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:24.090> came<00:01:24.299> into<00:01:24.509> play<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.930> in

how would you usually do it what tool
would<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> use<00:01:27.810> we'd<00:01:28.320> start<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.650> with<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> belt

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
would you use we'd start out with a belt

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.219 
would you use we'd start out with a belt
sander<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.610> about<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:29.939> 80<00:01:30.150> grit<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.840> worked

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
sander with about an 80 grit and worked

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
sander with about an 80 grit and worked
down<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> 120<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.520> then<00:01:32.640> we'd<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> an

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
down to a 120 and then we'd go to an

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.390 
down to a 120 and then we'd go to an
orbital<00:01:33.659> sander<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.170> finish<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> okay<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.100> no

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
orbital sander to finish it okay so no

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.999 
orbital sander to finish it okay so no
belt<00:01:36.270> sander<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.689> time<00:01:36.869> no<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.590> went<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
belt sander this time no I went right to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.539 
belt sander this time no I went right to
the<00:01:38.250> coarse<00:01:38.520> disc<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.090> came<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the coarse disc that came with it and I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.749 
the coarse disc that came with it and I
hog<00:01:41.909> off<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.750> heavy<00:01:43.259> stuff<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.070> then<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
hog off all the heavy stuff and then I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.660 
hog off all the heavy stuff and then I
this<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.299> velcro's<00:01:45.810> comes<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.860> off<00:01:46.890> yeah

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
this just velcro's comes right off yeah

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.899 
this just velcro's comes right off yeah
step<00:01:48.299> down<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> 120<00:01:49.680> grit<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.430> went<00:01:50.759> right

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
step down to the 120 grit and went right

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.210 
step down to the 120 grit and went right
to<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.920> brought<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> right<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to that and and brought it right to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.969 
to that and and brought it right to
finished<00:01:54.180> grade<00:01:54.390> wood<00:01:54.570> yeah<00:01:54.960> okay<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.409> did

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
finished grade wood yeah okay so did

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.350 
finished grade wood yeah okay so did
that<00:01:56.130> kind<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.369> surprised<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.939> mean<00:01:57.090> had

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that kind of surprised you I mean had

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
that kind of surprised you I mean had
you<00:01:57.479> done<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.990> orbit<00:01:58.350> Sanders<00:01:58.710> before

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
you done that with orbit Sanders before

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.209 
you done that with orbit Sanders before
I<00:01:59.310> think<00:02:00.090> no<00:02:00.240> no<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:01.110> wouldn't<00:02:01.469> even<00:02:01.649> try<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I think no no I wouldn't even try it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.039 
I think no no I wouldn't even try it
it<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:02.820> waste<00:02:03.030> too<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.240> time<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.899> where

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it would waste too much time and where

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.840 
it would waste too much time and where
the<00:02:04.229> sander<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.710> that's<00:02:05.159> cool<00:02:05.340> well<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.790> know

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the sander out that's cool well you know

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.550 
the sander out that's cool well you know
that's<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.329> value<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> being<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.020> tool<00:02:07.170> tester

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that's the value of being a tool tester

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.809 
that's the value of being a tool tester
you<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.860> experiment<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.580> things<00:02:08.759> right

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
you get to experiment with things right

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.050 
you get to experiment with things right
yeah<00:02:09.420> okay<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:11.550> about<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
yeah okay and so then what about on the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.729 
yeah okay and so then what about on the
eccentric<00:02:12.720> side

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
eccentric side

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.229 
eccentric side
when<00:02:13.980> you're<00:02:14.099> doing<00:02:14.280> fine<00:02:14.519> sanding<00:02:15.000> did<00:02:15.150> it

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
when you're doing fine sanding did it

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.099 
when you're doing fine sanding did it
leave<00:02:15.390> any<00:02:15.540> marks<00:02:16.219> no<00:02:17.219> not<00:02:17.489> bad<00:02:17.640> at<00:02:17.849> all<00:02:17.969> I<00:02:18.599> went

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
leave any marks no not bad at all I went

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.869 
leave any marks no not bad at all I went
down<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.409> 120<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.489> imagine<00:02:20.790> you

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
down to 120 with this I imagine you

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.330 
down to 120 with this I imagine you
could<00:02:21.060> go<00:02:21.150> all<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.390> way<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.540> 240<00:02:22.170> or<00:02:22.250> 400<00:02:23.250> if

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
could go all the way to 240 or 400 if

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.119 
could go all the way to 240 or 400 if
you<00:02:23.370> wanted<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.879> but<00:02:24.439> hard<00:02:25.439> maple<00:02:25.620> doesn't

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
you wanted to but hard maple doesn't

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.880 
you wanted to but hard maple doesn't
scratch<00:02:26.370> very<00:02:26.730> very<00:02:27.569> badly<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.260> sure<00:02:28.560> worked

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
scratch very very badly so sure worked

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.830 
scratch very very badly so sure worked
well<00:02:29.069> okay<00:02:29.579> we<00:02:29.790> started<00:02:30.120> out<00:02:30.269> with<00:02:30.389> the<00:02:30.540> coarse

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
well okay we started out with the coarse

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.250 
well okay we started out with the coarse
disc<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.879> abrasive<00:02:32.879> mode<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.540> then<00:02:34.079> when

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
disc in the abrasive mode and then when

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
disc in the abrasive mode and then when
I<00:02:34.290> switch<00:02:34.650> down<00:02:34.859> to<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.159> fine<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.790> switched

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
I switch down to the fine I switched

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.509 
I switch down to the fine I switched
this<00:02:36.719> right<00:02:36.989> here<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.829> it<00:02:37.980> tightens<00:02:38.189> up<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
this right here and it tightens up the

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.490 
this right here and it tightens up the
oscillation<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.450> finer<00:02:39.750> sanding<00:02:40.260> well

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
oscillation for finer sanding well

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.220 
oscillation for finer sanding well
that's<00:02:40.680> cool<00:02:40.889> okay<00:02:41.189> and<00:02:41.400> could<00:02:42.389> you<00:02:42.510> polish

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
that's cool okay and could you polish

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.390 
that's cool okay and could you polish
with<00:02:43.409> this<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.799> think<00:02:44.069> oh<00:02:44.129> absolutely

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
with this do you think oh absolutely

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.759 
with this do you think oh absolutely
this<00:02:44.909> would<00:02:45.030> make<00:02:45.180> an<00:02:45.299> awesome<00:02:45.450> polisher<00:02:46.349> it

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
this would make an awesome polisher it

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.490 
this would make an awesome polisher it
doesn't<00:02:47.099> come<00:02:47.310> with<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.519> polishing<00:02:48.120> pad<00:02:48.599> but

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
doesn't come with the polishing pad but

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.379 
doesn't come with the polishing pad but
you<00:02:49.919> could<00:02:50.069> buy<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.400> separately<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.060> and

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
you could buy that separately and and

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.030 
you could buy that separately and and
it'd<00:02:51.540> make<00:02:51.689> a<00:02:51.750> great<00:02:51.930> automotive<00:02:52.349> polisher

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
it'd make a great automotive polisher

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.979 
it'd make a great automotive polisher
okay<00:02:53.280> let's<00:02:53.459> flip<00:02:53.639> it<00:02:53.730> around<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.239> talk<00:02:54.720> about

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
okay let's flip it around and talk about

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.470 
okay let's flip it around and talk about
dust<00:02:55.859> collection<00:02:56.189> as<00:02:57.030> far<00:02:57.209> as<00:02:57.329> performance

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
dust collection as far as performance

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.050 
dust collection as far as performance
there<00:02:58.049> did<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.379> work<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.799> very<00:02:59.519> well<00:02:59.819> I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
there did that work for you very well I

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.140 
there did that work for you very well I
I<00:03:00.689> couldn't<00:03:01.079> believe<00:03:01.260> how<00:03:01.620> almost<00:03:02.280> dust<00:03:02.849> free

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
I couldn't believe how almost dust free

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.349 
I couldn't believe how almost dust free
this<00:03:03.389> thing<00:03:03.629> was<00:03:04.189> you<00:03:05.189> plug<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.579> Festool

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
this thing was you plug the Festool

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.300 
this thing was you plug the Festool
vacuum<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.019> comes<00:03:07.260> with<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.709> they<00:03:07.950> they

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
vacuum that comes with this they they

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.770 
vacuum that comes with this they they
brought<00:03:08.489> me<00:03:08.609> that<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:08.909> well<00:03:09.090> yeah<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.689> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
brought me that as well yeah so it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.059 
brought me that as well yeah so it
doesn't<00:03:10.079> that<00:03:10.290> doesn't<00:03:10.650> come<00:03:10.769> with<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
doesn't that doesn't come with the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.649 
doesn't that doesn't come with the
Festool<00:03:11.430> vacuum<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:11.969> got<00:03:12.120> lucky<00:03:12.299> enough<00:03:12.540> to

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
Festool vacuum you got lucky enough to

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.690 
Festool vacuum you got lucky enough to
get<00:03:12.780> them<00:03:12.870> both<00:03:13.019> right<00:03:13.560> right<00:03:13.950> yeah<00:03:14.370> for

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
get them both right right yeah for

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.179 
get them both right right yeah for
testing<00:03:15.060> yeah<00:03:15.989> set<00:03:16.319> up<00:03:16.439> to<00:03:16.620> work<00:03:16.739> with<00:03:16.950> this

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
testing yeah set up to work with this

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.710 
testing yeah set up to work with this
it's<00:03:17.400> got<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> little<00:03:17.699> rubber<00:03:17.970> sleeve<00:03:18.479> that

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
it's got a little rubber sleeve that
