there<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> real<00:01:45.149> short<00:01:45.420> stroke

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
there now we have a real short stroke

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.289 
there now we have a real short stroke
and<00:01:46.020> should<00:01:46.290> lift<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.590> high<00:01:46.710> enough<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> flush

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
and should lift it high enough to flush

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.359
