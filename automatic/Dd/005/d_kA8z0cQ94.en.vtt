00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 of parents 'and guardians' schools 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.830
 fidel schools and they group around 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.290
 of 850 colleagues that amount mix 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 the page is not attending to the same 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.060
 what Mrs. Erika said recently that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 the page is not so much I'm going to raise 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.599
 a concern in a very respectful way 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.770
 because I think it's important that when 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.630
 we are talking about transparent 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.609
 information is the most 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.780
 objective possible also and in that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.129
 meaning to me a long time ago I came up 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.650
 the concern about whom 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.140
 they represented the conce for I went to the 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.839
 website I found no statutes nor 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.979
 portals of transparency however if 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.040
 there was a list of adherents very 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.479
 important in about 563 many colleges 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.699
 schools practically everything I do not 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.350
 I know I looked for mine and mine appears 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.479
 my school in particular subsidized 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.129
 linares I called my school to communicate 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.589
 with the parents center and my school not 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.089
 adhere to the cun know once it happened 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.470
 that can be an obvious exception 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.970
 I understand with many schools someone 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 can go wrong putting me colleges 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 etcetera I called more schools are 563 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.900
 colleges is not a very fast exercise 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.100
 that anyone can do 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.480
 Even people can get in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.740
 concept points the adherents 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.640
 your school is probably 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.619
 about 50 schools we call 4 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 they are in the preserve many of the 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.119
 remaining that are not in the confech 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.100
 not only some do not know what is the confe 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.380
 for but what I find more serious 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.460
 and what I would like if we can 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.770
 explain 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.320
 there are cases for example the school 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.700
 lucila godoy de linares the margin 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.799
 ordinary in particular because I started 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.710
 around there the school luis lake de linares 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.170
 the conserve site there is an area to make a 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.000
 talk the same lady erika attended the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.560
 school where they were asked for the data 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.659
 to the attorneys where they were told that 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 if they supported the confe for they were going to 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.039
 receive and have were going to receive 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.890
 information constantly about the reform 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.810
 however those parents that the lady 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.100
 erika talked with a lot like 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.149
 interpreting the very well that they are 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.590
 worried the reform is very 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.240
 worried also because they never 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.489
 they carry the information if they have arrived 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.130
 emails inviting him to the marches another 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.989
 school for example of linares the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.330
 san miguel school I also spoke with 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.430
 center from father to father and thus end 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.220
 the wagons seeing I understand but by 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.500
 something still 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.360
 that not only goes through a parent center 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.400
 but also there are schools where to me 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.260
 I think stripe and responsible 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.900
 as a school a and teacher that has 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.490
 an attorney who has a professor who 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.010
 he has a student and he has no idea 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.540
 who has no idea how they perform 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.330
 the evaluations or who represents 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.380
 is the ancoa reservoir school of 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.380
 linaria a rural area 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.640
 less 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.030
 what happens is that we have so 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.340
 Transparency information because 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.680
 would be to hide it the proxies 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.200
 they are registering there is a link where 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.629
 can send data from schools 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.769
 directly to the page and they go 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.019
 but that's why I'm giving you the answer 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.580
 so another answer is do you want 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.620
 be of us through the invoice 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.680
 I talked to him with the moderate bucks that in 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.180
 We were actually as team 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.620
 I think that this respect for the program 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:26.060
 attended meetings that this 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:27.470
 same system that we have the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.120
 bases through a lack of respect 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.680
 also that they appear representing 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.790
 schools that are said not to be under pressure 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.769
 for you but what I think 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.170
 rare is that those same colleges 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.000
 do not claim that they are and do it today 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.739
 day publicly if what not if they know 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.530
 if the schools know they are 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.880
 already associated with the co-payment 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.440
 they could watch the selection 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.010
 with you and in fact this point the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.560
 colleges are going to find the way of a 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.730
 pseudo co-payment through some kind of 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.530
 fees and charge for example the center 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.610
 of parents could with let's say made the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.379
 law made the trap appear suddenly 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.640
 a formula of this type let's say has 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.640
 looked is also that reality
