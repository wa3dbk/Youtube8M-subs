touch<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.159> puppy<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.700> their<00:02:00.030> ears<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
touch with your puppy is their ears and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.459 
touch with your puppy is their ears and
face<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.430> puppy's<00:02:03.229> generally<00:02:04.229> don't

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
face so your puppy's generally don't

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
face so your puppy's generally don't
like<00:02:04.680> their<00:02:04.920> ear<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.130> face<00:02:05.520> being<00:02:05.850> touched

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
like their ear and face being touched

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.910 
like their ear and face being touched
and<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> reason<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:07.500> they

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and the reason for this is because they

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.120 
and the reason for this is because they
think<00:02:07.950> you're<00:02:08.310> playing<00:02:08.550> with

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
think you're playing with

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.480 
think you're playing with
and<00:02:09.250> instead<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.060> would<00:02:10.180> like<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:11.250> bite<00:02:12.250> your

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
and instead they would like to bite your

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.000 
and instead they would like to bite your
hands<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.900> what<00:02:14.080> we<00:02:14.230> need<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.680> when<00:02:14.890> we're

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
hands so what we need to do when we're

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.830 
hands so what we need to do when we're
calm<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.520> just<00:02:15.850> get<00:02:16.030> them<00:02:16.210> used<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.540> having

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
calm is just get them used to having

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.230 
calm is just get them used to having
their<00:02:16.990> ears<00:02:17.260> touched<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.010> if<00:02:18.100> possible<00:02:18.340> just

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
their ears touched and if possible just

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.060 
their ears touched and if possible just
bringing<00:02:19.660> back<00:02:19.690> all<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.470> hair<00:02:20.770> so<00:02:21.010> you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
bringing back all of that hair so you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.210 
bringing back all of that hair so you
can<00:02:21.370> actually<00:02:21.610> see<00:02:22.060> inside<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.810> ear<00:02:23.050> now<00:02:23.950> why

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
can actually see inside the ear now why

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.910 
can actually see inside the ear now why
this<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.610> important<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.750> because<00:02:25.810> if<00:02:26.680> your

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
this is important is because if your

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.100 
this is important is because if your
puppy<00:02:27.190> or<00:02:27.580> your<00:02:27.790> dog<00:02:28.060> does<00:02:28.570> on<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.930> off<00:02:29.080> chance

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
puppy or your dog does on the off chance

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.580 
puppy or your dog does on the off chance
need<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.190> have<00:02:30.400> their<00:02:31.090> ears<00:02:31.510> cleaned<00:02:32.020> out<00:02:32.230> or

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
need to have their ears cleaned out or

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.550 
need to have their ears cleaned out or
if<00:02:33.250> they<00:02:33.580> get<00:02:33.730> an<00:02:33.880> ear<00:02:34.120> infection<00:02:34.350> we<00:02:35.350> will

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
if they get an ear infection we will

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.830 
if they get an ear infection we will
need<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.980> put<00:02:36.280> open't<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.970> ear<00:02:37.240> cleaner<00:02:37.510> down

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
need to put open't and ear cleaner down

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.990 
need to put open't and ear cleaner down
that<00:02:38.050> ear<00:02:38.290> canal<00:02:38.620> now<00:02:39.280> if<00:02:39.430> your<00:02:39.580> puppy<00:02:39.850> is

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
that ear canal now if your puppy is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.940 
that ear canal now if your puppy is
happy<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.870> do<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.260> when<00:02:41.530> there<00:02:41.710> is<00:02:41.920> a

happy for you to do this when there is a

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.430 
happy for you to do this when there is a

healthy and pain-free you have a much

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.110 
healthy and pain-free you have a much
better<00:02:44.650> chance<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.190> doing<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.610> when<00:02:45.820> there<00:02:46.000> is

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
better chance of doing it when there is

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.730 
better chance of doing it when there is
an<00:02:46.270> infection<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:46.990> there<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> bit<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.530> pain

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
in there as well the next step is to

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.650 
in there as well the next step is to
touch<00:02:50.950> me<00:02:51.280> their<00:02:51.460> eyes<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.210> near<00:02:52.480> their

to do is to start to touch just up over

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.150 
to do is to start to touch just up over
the<00:03:03.610> bridge<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:03.970> their<00:03:04.150> nose<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:05.650> we<00:03:05.830> start

very slowly touching up over that bridge
of<00:03:08.980> their<00:03:09.130> nose<00:03:09.160> your<00:03:10.150> puppy<00:03:10.420> gets<00:03:10.630> used<00:03:10.930> to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080

hands down towards the mouth now once

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.630 
hands down towards the mouth now once
you're<00:03:19.660> down<00:03:19.930> near<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.200> mouth<00:03:20.620> area<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.400> can

you're down near that mouth area you can

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.400

actually lift their lip up and have a
look<00:03:23.650> at<00:03:23.800> their<00:03:23.980> teeth<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:25.300> little<00:03:25.630> moose<00:03:25.780> here

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
look at their teeth so little moose here

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.560 
look at their teeth so little moose here

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
is only 16 weeks old so he still got all

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.430 
is only 16 weeks old so he still got all
of<00:03:28.750> his<00:03:28.870> baby<00:03:29.140> teeth<00:03:29.530> there<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:31.050> why<00:03:32.050> that's

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
of his baby teeth there so why that's

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.410 
of his baby teeth there so why that's
important<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.400> on<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.790> off<00:03:33.940> chance<00:03:33.970> that

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
important is on the off chance that

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.670 
important is on the off chance that
you'll<00:03:34.630> probably<00:03:34.780> gets<00:03:35.140> something<00:03:35.380> in<00:03:35.620> his

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
you'll probably gets something in his

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.430 
you'll probably gets something in his
mouth<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.340> not<00:03:36.580> supposed<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.390> get<00:03:37.570> you

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
mouth that is not supposed to get you

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.180 
mouth that is not supposed to get you
can<00:03:38.800> very<00:03:39.010> easily<00:03:39.070> lift<00:03:39.820> up<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.300> loop<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:41.530> his

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
can very easily lift up that loop of his

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.860 
can very easily lift up that loop of his
mouth<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.700> just<00:03:42.910> get<00:03:43.120> whatever<00:03:43.300> you<00:03:43.480> need<00:03:43.840> to

mouth and just get whatever you need to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.970 
mouth and just get whatever you need to
out<00:03:44.320> now<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.370> other<00:03:45.640> reason<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.560> if<00:03:47.560> your
