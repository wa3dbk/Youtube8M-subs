00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and that's a semi-auto sniper not really

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.249 
and that's a semi-auto sniper not really
important<00:01:29.329> here's<00:01:30.329> something<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.840> kind<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
important here's something that kind of

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.789 
important here's something that kind of
caught<00:01:31.409> my<00:01:31.590> eye<00:01:32.689> must<00:01:33.689> earnestly<00:01:34.049> tweeted<00:01:34.680> out

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
caught my eye must earnestly tweeted out

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.890 
caught my eye must earnestly tweeted out
they<00:01:35.369> did<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.640> try<00:01:36.060> any<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.750> other

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
they did not try any of the other

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.170 
they did not try any of the other
snipers<00:01:37.500> other<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> ballista<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.670> dsr

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
snipers other than the ballista and dsr

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.140 
snipers other than the ballista and dsr
because<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.259> semi<00:01:40.619> autos<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.220> they

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
because they are semi autos and they

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.020 
because they are semi autos and they
suck<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.100> means<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.520> there's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
suck so what this means is there's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.130 
suck so what this means is there's
probably<00:01:45.450> only<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.079> for

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
probably only going to be like for

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.530 
probably only going to be like for
snipers<00:01:46.799> unless<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.240> haven't

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
snipers unless you know we just haven't

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
snipers unless you know we just haven't
seen<00:01:48.750> another<00:01:49.079> bolt<00:01:49.380> action<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:50.040> another<00:01:50.640> good
