00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.840
 hello and welcome today with 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.280
 a very special topic and indeed 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.960
 I want you the sprouts 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.790
 Vegetable sprouts are a bit 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.119
 certainly not a invention of the modern 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:36.489
 kitchen but have eg an asian 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.350
 kitchen over 5000 years of tradition 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.570
 It is a trend that is actually 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.730
 more common and there are now 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.070
 not only in organic stores but one 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.460
 also finds the supermarket the advantage 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.630
 it is extremely extreme 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.030
 qualitative characteristics 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.899
 essential amino acids several times 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.670
 unsaturated fatty acids all sorts 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.200
 vitamins enzymes fiber 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.239
 trace elements 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.250
 It really is a great lead in that 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.040
 to give an example of salary 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:17.810
 Vitamin B2 rises during germination 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:21.350
 by 65% of vitamin e even to 116 the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.460
 vitamins b1 and ten take with it 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:30.220
 no duration continuously around 111 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.060
 percent to even listen carefully 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.060
 463 percent 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 You can sprossen also by hand 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.470
 to prepare that means one gives it 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.229
 either in a glass or there is this 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.020
 stretch for me personally was the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.380
 simply too cumbersome and time consuming 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.420
 that sprouts three times a day 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 So what now you have to look that it 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.939
 not too moist you will get accomplished 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.560
 pusher and so on 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.750
 for me the only possibility is yourself 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.269
 researched and then I'm on him 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.720
 He became aware as green is now 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.190
 really an all-in-one 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.349
 fully automated i needed him 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.290
 speaking that is I just live 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.500
 the things purely there is then one 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.849
 automatic humidification with one 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.489
 regulator the water flows automatically 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.480
 starting with the easy go micro drive need 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.500
 nothing would be the seed level rhine lives 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.560
 she was in the micro 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.840
 and yes, wait three days talk 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 come to word 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.340
 before light and the whole allowed me 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440
 at the same time that I really do now 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.720
 once more sprouts can eat 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.660
 I actually have virtually no 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.700
 time investment the braid two 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.190
 minutes the whole machine 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.329
 could also be washed automatically 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.910
 not be better 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.079
 I have with all different 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.000
 sprossenarten then has different 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.160
 colors different tastes than 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.299
 but medium now we show you times 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.299
 how the machine works 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.280
 I sprout to others 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:27.469
 now here that closes that yes 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.480
 whole computer science that I say 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:35.389
 I can not imagine that 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.510
 that was how it works now 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.769
 as we have here the field of mobility 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.469
 sprouts go in 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.930
 the whole thing will be closed 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:48.280
 side door and the right one is whole 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.810
 just agree as black here 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.470
 areas fall equally but also 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.970
 the possibility that you run away 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:10.900
 to let that mean you can not be in 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:10.900
 water then stops
