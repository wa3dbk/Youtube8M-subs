00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
isn't a particularly interesting choice

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.140 
isn't a particularly interesting choice
for<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.109> figure<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.279> certainly<00:00:26.550> wasn't<00:00:26.849> one

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
for a figure and it certainly wasn't one

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.240 
for a figure and it certainly wasn't one
that<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> was<00:00:28.019> incredibly<00:00:28.590> excited<00:00:29.099> about

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that I was incredibly excited about

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.700 
that I was incredibly excited about
picking<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> but<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.230> own<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.590> I'm

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
picking up and but now that I own it I'm

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.950 
picking up and but now that I own it I'm
fairly<00:00:32.279> impressed<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.719> anything

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
fairly impressed with it and if anything

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.330 
fairly impressed with it and if anything
else<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.530> makes<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.760> nice<00:00:36.300> display<00:00:36.540> piece

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
else it makes for a nice display piece

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
but first we're going to take a look at

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.400 
but first we're going to take a look at
the<00:00:44.280> packaging<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.700> she<00:00:44.910> comes<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.410> once
