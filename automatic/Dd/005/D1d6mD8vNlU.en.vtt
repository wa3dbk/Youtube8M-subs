00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
easily with this machine so we've just

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.180 
easily with this machine so we've just
got<00:00:12.090> some<00:00:12.120> flour<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.290> got<00:00:13.440> some<00:00:13.620> yeast

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
got some flour and it's got some yeast

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.500 
got some flour and it's got some yeast
for<00:00:14.580> Edina<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.570> pulse<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.080> combine<00:00:16.260> ER

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
for Edina just pulse it to combine ER

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.060 
for Edina just pulse it to combine ER
and<00:00:18.510> then<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.320> start<00:00:19.529> pouring<00:00:19.770> in

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
and then you can just start pouring in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.300 
and then you can just start pouring in
water<00:00:20.960> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.109> without<00:00:22.199> dough<00:00:22.529> blade<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
water this is without dough blade and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.620 
water this is without dough blade and
what<00:00:23.430> will<00:00:23.519> happen<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> ingredients<00:00:24.510> will

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
what will happen is the ingredients will

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.540 
what will happen is the ingredients will
slowly<00:00:24.869> combine<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> pulls<00:00:25.949> together<00:00:26.130> into

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
slowly combine as it pulls together into

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.849 
slowly combine as it pulls together into
a<00:00:26.580> ball<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> acid<00:00:28.410> test<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
a ball really this is the acid test of a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
a ball really this is the acid test of a
food<00:00:29.039> processor<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.449> stability<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
food processor because the stability of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.959 
food processor because the stability of
the<00:00:31.230> unit<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.650> really<00:00:31.679> important<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> forces

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the unit is really important the forces

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.400 
the unit is really important the forces
of<00:00:33.210> actually<00:00:33.540> pulling<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.960> dough<00:00:34.170> ball

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
of actually pulling this dough ball

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.319 
of actually pulling this dough ball
around<00:00:34.739> inside<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> bowl<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.120> huge

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
around inside the bowl are really huge

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.569 
around inside the bowl are really huge
and<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.469> plastic<00:00:37.950> blade<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and this way it is a plastic blade so it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
and this way it is a plastic blade so it
doesn't<00:00:38.850> cut<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.030> dough<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.540> stretches<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.110> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
doesn't cut the dough it stretches up so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.810 
doesn't cut the dough it stretches up so
that's<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.100> minute<00:00:41.250> thirty<00:00:43.399> things<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> just

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
that's one minute thirty things is just

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
that's one minute thirty things is just
a<00:00:44.879> beautiful<00:00:45.329> big<00:00:45.480> dough<00:00:46.289> ball<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.649> very

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
a beautiful big dough ball is very

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.830 
a beautiful big dough ball is very
stretchy<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> need<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.719> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
stretchy so all you need to do is just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
stretchy so all you need to do is just
tuck<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> under<00:00:49.440> sit<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> bowl<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
tuck it under sit that in a bowl and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.160 
tuck it under sit that in a bowl and
that<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:50.850> double<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.180> size<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> next

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that will double in size over the next

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.470 
that will double in size over the next
hour<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.250> quad<00:00:53.460> blades<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.360> at

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
hour the quad blades really good at

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
hour the quad blades really good at
combining<00:00:54.960> fresh<00:00:55.230> ingredients<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
combining fresh ingredients and it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
combining fresh ingredients and it
allows<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.879> things<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> normally

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
allows you to do things that normally

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
allows you to do things that normally
might<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.899> too<00:00:58.020> labor-intensive<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.890> home<00:00:59.039> so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
might be too labor-intensive at home so

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.979 
might be too labor-intensive at home so
this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.420> quick

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
but never attempted at home so let's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
but never attempted at home so let's
just<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:09.510> chilies<00:01:10.200> lemongrass<00:01:10.680> garlic

just put some chilies lemongrass garlic

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
just put some chilies lemongrass garlic
in<00:01:12.110> some<00:01:13.110> lime<00:01:13.409> leaves<00:01:13.670> parsley<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:15.450> call<00:01:15.659> ours

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
in some lime leaves parsley we call ours

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.390 
in some lime leaves parsley we call ours
a<00:01:15.869> quad<00:01:16.080> blade<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.710> got<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.189> four

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
a quad blade because it's got the four

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.070 
a quad blade because it's got the four
blades<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.840> when<00:01:18.930> you're

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
blades and this is so that when you're

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.600 
blades and this is so that when you're
processing<00:01:19.290> instead<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.159> moving<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
processing instead of just moving the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
processing instead of just moving the
ingredients<00:01:21.060> down<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> bottom<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> leaving

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
ingredients down the bottom and leaving

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
ingredients down the bottom and leaving
a<00:01:22.259> layer<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.650> unprocessed<00:01:23.100> ingredients<00:01:23.790> at

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
a layer of unprocessed ingredients at

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.609 
a layer of unprocessed ingredients at
the<00:01:23.970> top<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.330> process<00:01:24.750> both<00:01:25.140> layers<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the top we process both layers at the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
the top we process both layers at the
same<00:01:25.860> time<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> beautiful<00:01:27.270> color<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
same time you get a beautiful color and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
same time you get a beautiful color and
then<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.159> put<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> fish<00:01:29.759> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
then all you do is just put the fish in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
then all you do is just put the fish in
it<00:01:30.530> put<00:01:31.530> an<00:01:31.650> egg<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.430> some

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it put an egg in and that's got some

done<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.630> that's<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.909> beautifully<00:01:45.909> combined

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
done and that's a beautifully combined

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.820 
done and that's a beautifully combined
set<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.900> fresh<00:01:47.110> ingredients<00:01:47.260> that<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:47.799> can

set of fresh ingredients that you can

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.380 
set of fresh ingredients that you can
then<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.250> put<00:01:48.460> into<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.700> little<00:01:48.970> patty<00:01:49.150> and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
then just put into a little patty and

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.719 
then just put into a little patty and
fry<00:01:49.990> off<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.470> you've<00:01:50.710> got<00:01:50.890> tight<00:01:51.340> fish<00:01:51.520> cakes

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
fry off and you've got tight fish cakes

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.670 
fry off and you've got tight fish cakes
because<00:01:52.360> we've<00:01:52.659> got<00:01:52.810> all<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:53.049> strength<00:01:53.440> in

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
because we've got all this strength in

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.820 
because we've got all this strength in
our<00:01:53.799> system<00:01:54.159> we<00:01:54.340> can<00:01:54.580> do<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:55.180> large<00:01:56.140> potato<00:01:56.530> and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
our system we can do a large potato and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.620 
our system we can do a large potato and
chip<00:01:57.009> large<00:01:57.250> potatoes<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.850> lot<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.390> food

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
chip large potatoes a lot of food

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810 
chip large potatoes a lot of food
processors<00:01:59.020> we<00:01:59.140> tested<00:01:59.560> can't<00:02:00.009> do<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.460> one

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
processors we tested can't do this one

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.550 
processors we tested can't do this one
of<00:02:00.850> them<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.180> particular<00:02:01.300> we<00:02:01.630> tested<00:02:01.960> they're

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
of them in particular we tested they're

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.969 
of them in particular we tested they're
just<00:02:02.740> right<00:02:03.250> just<00:02:03.490> load<00:02:04.060> your<00:02:04.090> potato<00:02:04.540> in

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
just right just load your potato in

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.100 
just right just load your potato in
start<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.040> up<00:02:06.130> done<00:02:07.030> now<00:02:07.630> we've<00:02:07.780> also<00:02:07.930> do

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
start it up done now we've also do

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.710 
start it up done now we've also do
another<00:02:08.200> one

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
another one

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.090 
another one
always<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.929> would<00:02:10.989> use<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.410> large<00:02:11.590> feed<00:02:11.860> chip

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
always I would use the large feed chip

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.370 
always I would use the large feed chip
if<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.310> was<00:02:12.430> chipping<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:13.080> get<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> biggest

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
if I was chipping and get the biggest

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.770 
if I was chipping and get the biggest
potatoes<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:14.950> can<00:02:15.070> find<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:16.330> other<00:02:16.510> disk

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
potatoes you can find the other disk

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.780 
potatoes you can find the other disk
that's<00:02:16.959> really<00:02:17.320> nice<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.980> fine<00:02:18.340> julienne

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that's really nice is the fine julienne

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.690 
that's really nice is the fine julienne
and<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.989> like<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> kind<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.100> knife<00:02:21.310> skill

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and this is like a kind of a knife skill

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.430 
and this is like a kind of a knife skill
julienning<00:02:22.239> that<00:02:22.510> takes<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.870> lot<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.019> practice

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
julienning that takes a lot of practice

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.660 
julienning that takes a lot of practice
particularly<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:24.010> you're<00:02:24.130> getting<00:02:24.220> into<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
particularly as you're getting into the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.250 
particularly as you're getting into the
last<00:02:24.880> parts<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.450> food<00:02:25.780> if<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.050> want<00:02:26.080> to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
last parts of the food if you want to

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.840 
last parts of the food if you want to
keep<00:02:26.380> your<00:02:26.500> fingers<00:02:28.769> but<00:02:29.769> defy<00:02:30.100> anyone<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.610> do

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
that with a knife we've got the double

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.460 
that with a knife we've got the double
salad<00:02:33.580> shredding<00:02:33.940> disc<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:35.140> has<00:02:35.319> got

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
salad shredding disc and this has got

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.720 
salad shredding disc and this has got
coarse<00:02:35.769> or<00:02:36.010> fine<00:02:36.069> shredding<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.489> really

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
coarse or fine shredding this is really

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.130 
coarse or fine shredding this is really
good<00:02:39.880> for<00:02:40.030> kids<00:02:40.209> school<00:02:40.450> lunches<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.840> things

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
good for kids school lunches and things

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.990 
good for kids school lunches and things
like<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.319> we<00:02:41.890> also<00:02:42.130> provide<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.610> mini<00:02:42.819> bowl

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
like that we also provide a mini bowl

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.610 
like that we also provide a mini bowl
and<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.480> has<00:02:43.630> got<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.870> same<00:02:44.050> design<00:02:44.230> logic

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and this has got the same design logic

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.050 
and this has got the same design logic
as<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.010> main<00:02:45.370> bowl<00:02:45.579> it's<00:02:45.730> got<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.880> vertical

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
as the main bowl it's got a vertical

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.850 
as the main bowl it's got a vertical
sides<00:02:46.420> which<00:02:46.900> is<00:02:47.019> actually<00:02:47.320> unique<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.769> it

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
sides which is actually unique and it

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.100 
sides which is actually unique and it
then<00:02:48.130> flares<00:02:48.459> out<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.269> main<00:02:49.420> feed<00:02:49.690> tube<00:02:49.930> so

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
then flares out the main feed tube so

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.270 
then flares out the main feed tube so
you<00:02:50.140> can<00:02:50.350> still<00:02:50.530> put<00:02:50.709> things<00:02:50.890> in<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.130> feed

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you can still put things in the feed

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.400 
you can still put things in the feed
tube<00:02:51.489> using<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.570> meatball<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> mini

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
tube using the meatball but the mini

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.319 
tube using the meatball but the mini
blade<00:02:53.739> here<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.220> drops<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.940> stills

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
blade here that drops in it stills

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.030 
blade here that drops in it stills
against<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.019> lid<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.320> bulb<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:56.860> that

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
against the the lid of the bulb so that

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.920 
against the the lid of the bulb so that
when<00:02:57.549> you're<00:02:57.730> using<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.420> don't<00:02:58.720> get<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
when you're using this you don't get the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.960 
when you're using this you don't get the
main<00:02:59.049> bowl<00:02:59.230> dirty<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.160> I'll<00:03:00.250> do<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> quick<00:03:00.459> ARMA

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
main bowl dirty so I'll do a quick ARMA

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.990 
main bowl dirty so I'll do a quick ARMA
meal<00:03:01.260> I've<00:03:02.260> processed<00:03:02.620> this<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.220> 30<00:03:03.579> seconds

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.850 
I've got just quite a nice fine
consistency<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.260> can<00:03:08.530> see<00:03:08.650> there's<00:03:08.829> a
