00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
system and there's a there's a saying

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.459 
system and there's a there's a saying
which<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.629> encompasses<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.870> holistic

medicine<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.969> goes<00:01:03.120> something<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
medicine and it goes something like this

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.690 
medicine and it goes something like this
same<00:01:05.129> disease<00:01:05.960> different<00:01:06.960> treatment

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
same disease different treatment

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
same disease different treatment
different<00:01:08.700> disease<00:01:09.000> same<00:01:09.540> treatment<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.799> what

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
different disease same treatment so what

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
different disease same treatment so what
it<00:01:11.250> basically<00:01:11.280> means<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.240> may<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.689> two

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
it basically means is you may have two

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
it basically means is you may have two
people<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:13.950> disease<00:01:14.460> pattern<00:01:14.970> but

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
people with the same disease pattern but

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
people with the same disease pattern but
they<00:01:15.720> will<00:01:15.900> receive<00:01:16.229> different<00:01:16.590> underlying

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
they will receive different underlying

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460 
they will receive different underlying
treatments<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:18.090> different<00:01:18.960> underlying

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
treatments because different underlying

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.710 
treatments because different underlying
causative<00:01:20.130> factors<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> sounds<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
causative factors so it sounds like the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.210 
causative factors so it sounds like the
Chinese<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:22.259> approach<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
Chinese would approach it in a way of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.010 
Chinese would approach it in a way of
it's<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.430> internal<00:01:23.790> issue<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.509> happened<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it's an internal issue what happened to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.719 
it's an internal issue what happened to
get<00:01:25.170> them<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.560> sure<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.340> Western

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
get them there sure as the Western

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.039 
get them there sure as the Western
approach<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.420> more<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.960> an

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
approach would be more so it's an

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.020 
approach would be more so it's an
external<00:01:28.470> yes<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.220> external<00:01:29.640> event<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
external yes or external event that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.910 
external yes or external event that
happened<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> Chinese<00:01:30.869> always<00:01:31.079> say<00:01:31.350> seek<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
happened the Chinese always say seek the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
happened the Chinese always say seek the
roots<00:01:32.130> seek<00:01:32.670> their<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.030> order<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.479> cure<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
roots seek their in order to cure the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
roots seek their in order to cure the
problem<00:01:34.259> let's<00:01:34.500> talk<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.070> route<00:01:35.310> let's

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
berry all times higher yeah so so if you

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.860 
berry all times higher yeah so so if you

and<00:04:19.919> are<00:04:20.039> they<00:04:20.159> using<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.729> cosmetic

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
and are they using this in cosmetic

more
so<00:04:26.069> they're<00:04:26.340> using<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.669> as<00:04:26.819> well<00:04:26.940> yeah

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
so they're using this as well yeah

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.790 
so they're using this as well yeah
there's<00:04:27.509> more<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:27.840> more<00:04:28.020> research<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.710> the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
there's more and more research and the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.450 
there's more and more research and the

yes<00:04:32.910> those<00:04:33.150> fun<00:04:33.389> things<00:04:33.600> in<00:04:33.720> mind<00:04:33.870> huh<00:04:34.080> okay

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
yes those fun things in mind huh okay

yes those fun things in mind huh okay
we've<00:04:35.069> got<00:04:35.250> fruits<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.639> vegetables<00:04:36.000> over

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
we've got fruits and vegetables over

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.730 
we've got fruits and vegetables over
here<00:04:36.539> so<00:04:36.750> what<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.139> correlation<00:04:37.440> between

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
here so what is the correlation between

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.100 
here so what is the correlation between
this<00:04:38.099> and<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.389> dragon's<00:04:39.840> blood<00:04:39.900> of

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
this and the the dragon's blood of

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.680 
this and the the dragon's blood of
course<00:04:40.349> nothing<00:04:40.590> substitutes<00:04:41.330> real<00:04:42.330> fruit

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
course nothing substitutes real fruit

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.680 
course nothing substitutes real fruit
and<00:04:42.930> vegetables<00:04:43.590> but<00:04:43.940> one<00:04:44.940> serving<00:04:45.569> of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
and vegetables but one serving of

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.629 
and vegetables but one serving of
dragon's<00:04:46.110> blood<00:04:46.319> one<00:04:46.770> gram<00:04:47.069> of<00:04:47.099> dragon's

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
dragon's blood one gram of dragon's

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.210 
dragon's blood one gram of dragon's
blood<00:04:47.789> equates<00:04:48.599> to<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:48.960> many<00:04:49.259> fruits<00:04:50.069> and

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
blood equates to this many fruits and

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.939 
blood equates to this many fruits and
vegetables<00:04:50.669> so<00:04:51.479> which<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.080> amazing<00:04:52.500> but<00:04:52.770> like

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
vegetables so which is amazing but like

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.249 
vegetables so which is amazing but like
I<00:04:53.069> said<00:04:53.130> nothing<00:04:54.030> sells<00:04:54.419> right<00:04:54.690> well<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.050> worm

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
I said nothing sells right well the worm

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.839 
I said nothing sells right well the worm
is<00:04:55.380> probably<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.919> best<00:04:56.160> but<00:04:56.310> what<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.460> come<00:04:56.729> to

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
is probably the best but what I come to

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:57.860 
is probably the best but what I come to
mind<00:04:57.030> what<00:04:57.180> comes<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.389> mind<00:04:57.539> for<00:04:57.599> me<00:04:57.750> is

higher therapeutics doses should be

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.960 
higher therapeutics doses should be
supervised<00:05:09.449> by<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:09.930> practitioner<00:05:10.759> okay
