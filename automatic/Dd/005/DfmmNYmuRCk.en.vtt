about<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.579> Renault<00:00:38.850> Clio<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.540> quality<00:00:40.379> this

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
about the Renault Clio is quality this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.400 
about the Renault Clio is quality this
car<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.250> about<00:00:41.460> quality<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:43.050> let's<00:00:43.200> take<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
car is all about quality so let's take a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
car is all about quality so let's take a
look<00:00:43.620> inside

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.000 

right<00:00:49.270> let<00:00:49.450> me<00:00:49.480> just<00:00:49.750> work<00:00:50.170> out<00:00:50.380> how<00:00:50.560> to<00:00:50.620> shut

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
right let me just work out how to shut

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.180 
right let me just work out how to shut
up<00:00:51.790> Johnny<00:00:52.570> Hallyday<00:00:53.079> there<00:00:53.680> we<00:00:53.770> go<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.130> will

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
up Johnny Hallyday there we go that will

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.390 
up Johnny Hallyday there we go that will
do<00:00:54.340> it<00:00:54.460> so<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:56.110> nice<00:00:56.260> interior<00:00:56.680> once<00:00:57.220> again

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
do it so really nice interior once again

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.890 
do it so really nice interior once again
it's<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.910> modern<00:00:58.120> super<00:00:58.570> mini<00:00:58.750> that's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
it's a modern super mini that's

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.080 
it's a modern super mini that's
dominated<00:00:59.470> by<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.680> touchscreen<00:01:00.520> this<00:01:00.850> time<00:01:01.059> I

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
dominated by a touchscreen this time I

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.729 
dominated by a touchscreen this time I
think<00:01:01.300> it's<00:01:01.540> probably<00:01:01.720> around<00:01:01.870> seven<00:01:02.260> inches

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
think it's probably around seven inches

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.340 
think it's probably around seven inches
and<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:04.000> dashboard<00:01:04.600> they've<00:01:04.839> really<00:01:05.170> gone

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
and the dashboard they've really gone

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.200 
and the dashboard they've really gone
for<00:01:05.410> a<00:01:05.710> different<00:01:06.160> style<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.610> dashboard<00:01:07.060> with

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
for a different style of dashboard with

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.650 
for a different style of dashboard with
a<00:01:07.240> crisscross<00:01:07.540> pattern<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:09.040> quality<00:01:09.520> wise<00:01:09.729> is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
a crisscross pattern but quality wise is

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.990 
a crisscross pattern but quality wise is
nothing<00:01:11.050> really<00:01:11.470> special<00:01:11.950> yes<00:01:12.610> it's<00:01:12.790> good

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
nothing really special yes it's good

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.520 
nothing really special yes it's good
enough<00:01:13.210> it's<00:01:13.390> nowhere<00:01:13.750> near<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.080> level<00:01:14.110> of<00:01:14.440> a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
enough it's nowhere near the level of a

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.460 
enough it's nowhere near the level of a
Volkswagen<00:01:15.340> Golf<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:17.080> you<00:01:17.140> hear<00:01:17.320> that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
Volkswagen Golf and can you hear that

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.940 
Volkswagen Golf and can you hear that
some<00:01:17.800> really<00:01:18.310> tinny<00:01:18.789> plastics<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.539> seats

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
some really tinny plastics and the seats

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.779 
some really tinny plastics and the seats
frankly<00:01:20.950> they<00:01:21.190> don't<00:01:21.430> look<00:01:21.580> as<00:01:21.700> though

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
frankly they don't look as though

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.850 
frankly they don't look as though
they're<00:01:21.940> going<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.149> last<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.960> hundred<00:01:23.320> thousand

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
they're going to last a hundred thousand

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.520 
they're going to last a hundred thousand
miles<00:01:24.039> with<00:01:24.220> my<00:01:24.460> backside<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.530> things

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
miles with my backside on and things

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.889 
miles with my backside on and things
like<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.800> glove<00:01:27.670> compartment<00:01:27.820> just<00:01:28.539> doesn't

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
like the glove compartment just doesn't

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.980 
like the glove compartment just doesn't
feel<00:01:29.200> particularly<00:01:29.890> solid<00:01:30.399> but<00:01:31.000> it's<00:01:31.630> super

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
feel particularly solid but it's super

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.050 
feel particularly solid but it's super
stylish<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.770> there's<00:01:33.550> probably<00:01:33.640> decent

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
stylish and there's probably decent

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.710 
stylish and there's probably decent
amount<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.270> space<00:01:34.420> in<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.660> back

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.650 

or<00:01:39.380> it's<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.340> little<00:01:40.820> bit<00:01:40.970> tight<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:41.300> this

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
or it's a little bit tight but this

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.990 
or it's a little bit tight but this
front<00:01:41.960> seat<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.350> set<00:01:42.620> up<00:01:42.800> for<00:01:42.830> me<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.460> I'm<00:01:43.940> a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
front seat is set up for me and I'm a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.300 
front seat is set up for me and I'm a
big<00:01:44.360> bloke<00:01:44.660> so<00:01:44.960> for<00:01:45.470> an<00:01:45.530> average<00:01:45.620> family<00:01:46.190> you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
big bloke so for an average family you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.830 
big bloke so for an average family you
probably<00:01:46.610> do<00:01:47.000> all<00:01:47.180> right<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.510> important

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
probably do all right the important

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.840 
probably do all right the important
thing<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:48.050> not<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.350> bad<00:01:48.680> amount<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.220> width<00:01:49.550> so

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
thing is not a bad amount of width so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.430 
thing is not a bad amount of width so
three<00:01:50.150> kids<00:01:50.390> across<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.870> back<00:01:50.990> could<00:01:51.410> be

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
three kids across the back could be

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.890 
three kids across the back could be
doable<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.220> course<00:01:52.820> what's<00:01:53.330> more<00:01:53.510> important

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
doable of course what's more important

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.320 
doable of course what's more important
though<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.290> how<00:01:54.740> good<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.190> cleo<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:56.060> drive

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
though is how good the cleo is to drive

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.030 
though is how good the cleo is to drive
we've<00:01:56.690> already<00:01:56.870> driven<00:01:57.230> one<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.710> early

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
we've already driven one of the early

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.550 
we've already driven one of the early
