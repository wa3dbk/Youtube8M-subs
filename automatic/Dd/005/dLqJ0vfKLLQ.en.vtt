00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.170
 we put the equation on so we 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.660
 expect from part one so knots 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.259
 equations we expect two and 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.929
 tension equation we expect three 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:19.600
 then we take them out of the 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:24.190
 circuit and we start with that 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.590
 knot set for point notation it 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:31.960
 flows in as once it is positive 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.540
 flows out i3 negative it flows clean 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.690
 two positively yes the three me talk 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.790
 still in between and it flows out i 4 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.590
 negative with it and the whole that were 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.150
 here are four streams all there is 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.320
 that's just that's already our first 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:56.290
 knot equal in the coen equation for 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:00.880
 knoten b it flows out ii 1 of it here 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:06.820
 above so - i 1 it flows in 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:10.240
 the 3plus ii 3 it flows out i5 - i5 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.320
 and the whole is of course 0 that is 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.180
 the equation 4 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.979
 These were our two knots 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.570
 equations as we said for c we can 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.720
 Although formally a knot equation 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.840
 up but does not carry 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.190
 additional information 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.960
 when we make equations 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.820
 you have to clarify first which make 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.530
 we want to set up and there it is 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 Imagine that the little ones 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.280
 Mesh can take the inner stitches 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.530
 yes choose differently but that makes it 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.369
 not much sense beats the three stitches 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.110
 here are 2003 mesh equations 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.110
 mesh set 1 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:02:03.290
 we start here this is - u11 r1 +3 r3 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.729
 is zero 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:13.670
 stitch set 2 we start here 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:18.600
 that is then - ii 33 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:25.200
 there is not her plus here ii 4 4 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:28.350
 here is still on 5 - 5 5 compensation only 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.690
 that is our equation 6 and the 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:46.890
 third machine back here in the corner 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:47.790
 that is - ii 4 4 - 2 r2 +2 is the same 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.880
 zero 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.880
 that is our equation 7 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.040
 now I had forgotten completely here 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.730
 write down what we are looking for now 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.110
 Given that we want the network 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.570
 to solve 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:11.570
 That's why we're looking for the two 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.550
 therefore, all currents flow in this case 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:22.709
 and here are the two of us here 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:24.239
 streams 15 november have the streams 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.209
 the voltage can obviously something 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.600
 implemented easily enough and the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.130
 given to the other train 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.280
 We now bring schools to work out 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.820
 that this five equations in one 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.800
 matrices form of a matrix that is 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.940
 not difficult we pull the stream 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:52.130
 our five streams as a split matrix 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:56.570
 out there is then here 1 vj 2 vj 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.570
 34 and 45 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.620
 for orientation, I write here 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.620
 over and over again 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.030
 thus classify know about the 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.099
 write like that and on the other side 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.980
 The tension is the usual 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.440
 form since we have after all is marley 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.299
 so and so order was easy here 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.560
 our equation so we take ourselves 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:25.220
 Equations 3 So the knot set 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.220
 we have one we have two we have 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.400
 three years negative we have four yes 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.600
 negative we have five no the whole 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:41.630
 is new so of course new equation 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:45.169
 Now this is our eight equation 4 in 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.110
 We have 1 to compensate for under four 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:53.990
 year negative we have 2 1 1 we have 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:58.610
 three we have ii 4 1 we have five yes 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:02.360
 the whole is new good that was the 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.650
 both knots continued to the 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.479
 mesh mesh-set rate of 2 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.919
 resolve the number so that's out 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.919
 the equation 5 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.379
 Group 1 should be on the tension side 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:28.180
 So we send cuba here then 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:32.919
 correspondingly positive sign e1r 11 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.569
 is here in the columns matrix 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:40.059
 That's why we only need that 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:43.539
 resistance r1 r2 it is not placed r3 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:49.770
 occupied with i3 so more is not going on here 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:49.770
 that is already our equation 10 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:06:00.639
 continue the equation sex machine 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:02.740
 equation 23 r3 is negative with three 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.029
 cheap comes yes secure the three columns 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:10.649
 four that is positive 45 is negative 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:13.899
 minus 5 and 21 are not occupied 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:15.759
 We do not have any voltage source 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:19.180
 So off is a zero that is 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:22.560
 our equation 11 and already the last one 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:28.659
 equation from the 7th 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:31.599
 - 44 comes here - r 4 1 - 2 r2 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:34.839
 comes year 2002 send to the other 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:39.370
 page is so - u2 the other streams 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:43.209
 are all not laying so and have here 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:47.499
 we have a beautiful matrice, however 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:48.490
 she is not so beautiful because yes 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:50.860
 should that be? 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.539
 Here are knot equations so 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.550
 that a current equations and that one 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:56.469
 tension equation that is that 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.020
 here a mixed matrice very 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:59.860
 annoying there are streams here 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.959
 resistors 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.599
 yes, we just go for trick 17 

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:07.180
 and multiply the upper equation 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:10.110
 easy with a resistance as possible 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.309
 if they want to invert the well 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.319
 if possible with any single digit 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:16.779
 worth format can also be with a top 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.789
 then we multiply that 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:21.669
 multiply the knot equation with 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.339
 a resistance becomes the one 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.650
 tension equation and that's what's going to happen 

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.990
 this stream 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.030
 here are resistance values ​​and thus 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.620
 will be the two knots 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.840
 equations normal stress 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.370
 equation and the mattress becomes one 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.370
 resistance matrix
