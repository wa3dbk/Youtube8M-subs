00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:16.450 

color<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:08.060> applied<00:05:11.919> creating<00:05:12.919> this<00:05:15.460> fading

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.590 
effect just like that you wanna do it
quickly<00:05:26.419> because<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:28.280> white<00:05:28.490> color<00:05:28.790> begins

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
quickly because the white color begins

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.530 
quickly because the white color begins
to<00:05:29.810> dry<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.380> then<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:31.280> will<00:05:31.460> be<00:05:31.669> difficult<00:05:31.970> to

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
to dry and then it will be difficult to

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:42.400 
to dry and then it will be difficult to
drag<00:05:33.229> it<00:05:33.820> into<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.080> root<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:36.800> nail
