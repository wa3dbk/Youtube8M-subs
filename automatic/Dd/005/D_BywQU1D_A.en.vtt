00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
everything it needs so we did one of

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.420 
everything it needs so we did one of
those<00:00:24.260> common<00:00:25.260> stacked<00:00:25.740> walls<00:00:26.099> where<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
those common stacked walls where you

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.960 
those common stacked walls where you
have<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.900> by<00:00:28.080> four<00:00:28.380> bricks<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.460> stacked

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
have the two by four bricks just stacked

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.380 
have the two by four bricks just stacked
on<00:00:30.210> each<00:00:30.449> other<00:00:30.689> creating<00:00:31.080> pattern<00:00:32.390> retail

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
on each other creating pattern retail

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
on each other creating pattern retail
compared<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> clones<00:00:34.290> there<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.460> two

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
compared to the clones there are two

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060 
compared to the clones there are two
guns<00:00:35.880> yep<00:00:36.870> you've<00:00:37.050> got<00:00:37.230> your<00:00:37.469> two<00:00:37.770> gunner

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
turrets on top of the wall here and then

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.090 
turrets on top of the wall here and then
over<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.489> you've<00:00:41.940> got<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.379> rotating<00:00:43.379> super

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
over here you've got a rotating super

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.490 
over here you've got a rotating super
gun<00:00:45.620> from<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.989> modeled<00:00:49.350> on

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
gun from the it's it's it's modeled on

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
gun from the it's it's it's modeled on
top<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.910> modeled<00:00:51.300> after<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> gun<00:00:51.870> on

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
top of the it's modeled after the gun on

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.760 
top of the it's modeled after the gun on
top<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> ATT<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:54.449> swivels<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.350> points<00:00:55.710> down

around till they eat back you can see

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
around till they eat back you can see
it's<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> those<00:01:49.590> designs<00:01:50.009> from

it's it's not one of those designs from
like<00:01:50.790> Echo<00:01:51.720> Base<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.369> just<00:01:53.369> possible<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
like Echo Base it's just possible it

slides on a track and we have all sorts
of<00:01:56.250> stabilizers<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
of stabilizers and we have it so that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.130 
of stabilizers and we have it so that
vehicles<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.670> easily<00:02:00.149> maneuver<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.780> gate<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
vehicles can easily maneuver the gate is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.679 
vehicles can easily maneuver the gate is
wide<00:02:01.350> enough<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> tall<00:02:02.009> enough<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> swamp

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
wide enough and tall enough for a swamp

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.230 
wide enough and tall enough for a swamp
speeder<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.200> maneuver<00:02:04.890> through<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.820> harder

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
speeder to maneuver through it's harder

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.800 
speeder to maneuver through it's harder
for<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> MTR<00:02:07.710> empty<00:02:08.700> RV<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.479> MTR
