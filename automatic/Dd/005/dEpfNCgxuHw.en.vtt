00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 and now knit himself hem 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.250
 pay so do the connecting bar 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.340
 brew 3 air lifting loops in the same 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.510
 arch knit crochet column 2 air 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 2 double crochets here as you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.930
 unchanged knit to prime level in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 I knit every arch of 2 air loops 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.279
 fan consisting of 2 columns with 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.180
 nakida 2 air loops 2 columns with 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.180
 nakidom 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.250
 here is nothing complicated so I see 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.840
 fast enough as it were already showing 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.840
 how all these elements fit in 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.690
 I want to go to the point where you need to 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.690
 time to stop and explain 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:50.630
 Here I see the last arch of the half 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:52.700
 back and now pay attention to 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.399
 the previous year there were three columns 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.530
 nakidom that is, I have one loop that is 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.399
 I skip one bar and into the center 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.500
 column I knit a fan of one 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.899
 loops i mean i knit from one loop 2 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:14.450
 double crochet 2 air loops 2 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.299
 double crochet then again 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.750
 skip one loop and turn to the arch and 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:23.299
 I see further as usual each arch from 2 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.170
 air stitches knit 2 columns with 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.519
 nakida 2 air loops 2 columns with 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.269
 nakida continue to knit on the front 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.269
 parts 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.410
 each arch of 2 air loops i 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.080
 I knit a fan that consists of 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.470
 two double crochet columns 2 air 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.090
 loops and two double crochets 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.580
 there is such a way 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.870
 formed where the armhole line 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.610
 that is, we see here we already have a stream 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.420
 exactly what about the pattern 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.480
 everywhere without any changes front 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.580
 part I see exactly the same 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.860
 I come across to the opposite 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.930
 sides where we have armholes and again in 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.239
 central loop knit fan 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.209
 consisting of two double crochets 2 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.390
 air loops 2 double crochet 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.569
 do i see again in every arch again 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.140
 same fans at the end of the row connecting 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.370
 column this will be the first row of his hem 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.170
 I will repeat to the desired height 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.290
 how long this hem is 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.730
 only rows how much do you want it to be 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.130
 even a fairly skirt or down is not 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.829
 so even but if you want to 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.930
 even more there was a clichÃ© but then 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.359
 can be through several rows example 5 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.600
 mouths knit exactly the same here as 1 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.930
 row 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.480
 and for example 5-7 no matter how much ice 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.280
 your discretion to tie the next row 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.709
 no longer two double crochet 2 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.840
 air loops 2 double crochet 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.239
 for example 3 double crochet 2 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.120
 air loops 3 double crochets 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:18.760
 accordingly, the hem will be expanded by 5 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.760
 resident at the discretion can not do so
