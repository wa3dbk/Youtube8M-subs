this<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:35.490> happens<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.090> from

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
this because what happens and from

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
this because what happens and from
having<00:01:36.360> real-world<00:01:37.259> experience<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.860> know

having real-world experience you know

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.770 
having real-world experience you know
training<00:01:38.280> individuals<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.600> don't

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
training individuals is if you don't

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.210 
training individuals is if you don't
have<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> firm<00:01:40.290> understanding<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
have a firm understanding of some of

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310 
have a firm understanding of some of
these<00:01:41.310> basic<00:01:41.610> concepts<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.720> quite<00:01:43.020> elusive

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
these basic concepts it's quite elusive

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
these basic concepts it's quite elusive
like<00:01:43.619> tracking<00:01:43.860> macros<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.369> oh<00:01:44.430> man<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.670> didn't

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
like tracking macros it oh man I didn't

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.310 
like tracking macros it oh man I didn't
eat<00:01:45.060> anything<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.540> long<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.049> hit<00:01:46.229> these

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
eat anything as long as it I hit these

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
eat anything as long as it I hit these
numbers<00:01:46.380> yeah<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> certain<00:01:47.759> extent<00:01:48.270> but

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
numbers yeah to a certain extent but

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.870 
numbers yeah to a certain extent but
they'll<00:01:48.960> negate<00:01:49.409> something<00:01:50.040> along<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> lines

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
they'll negate something along the lines

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
they'll negate something along the lines
of<00:01:51.180> say<00:01:51.450> their<00:01:51.780> vegetables<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:52.619> happen

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
of say their vegetables and what happen

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
of say their vegetables and what happen
they<00:01:53.070> got<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> pizza<00:01:53.820> face<00:01:54.000> pizza<00:01:54.390> pocket

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
they got that pizza face pizza pocket

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.480 
they got that pizza face pizza pocket
face<00:01:54.899> we're<00:01:55.320> start<00:01:55.500> breaking<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.310> got

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
face we're start breaking out they got

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.819 
face we're start breaking out they got
their<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.119> orange<00:01:57.390> right<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
their all orange right the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.069 
their all orange right the
there<00:01:59.520> may<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.729> lethargic<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:00.630> don't<00:02:00.840> focus

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
there may be lethargic they don't focus

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.289 
there may be lethargic they don't focus
on<00:02:01.439> some<00:02:02.250> things<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.850> important<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
on some things that are important that

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.880 
on some things that are important that
you<00:02:03.450> can't<00:02:03.780> quantify<00:02:04.110> such<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.770> those

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
you can't quantify such as those

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
you can't quantify such as those
micronutrients<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.180> having<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.600> basic

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
micronutrients so having a basic

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
micronutrients so having a basic
understanding<00:02:07.290> before<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.069> dive<00:02:08.429> into<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
understanding before you dive into this

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.589 
understanding before you dive into this
I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.869> essential<00:02:11.000> because<00:02:12.000> then<00:02:12.390> what

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
I think is essential because then what

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.080 
I think is essential because then what
we'll<00:02:12.750> have

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
we'll have

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.940 
we'll have
over<00:02:13.330> time<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.660> said<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.870> know<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.410> beginner

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
over time and said you know a beginner

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.070 
over time and said you know a beginner
would<00:02:15.129> ask<00:02:15.280> well<00:02:15.610> how<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.060> determine<00:02:16.450> my<00:02:16.840> fat

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
would ask well how do I determine my fat

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.320 
would ask well how do I determine my fat
and<00:02:17.319> carb<00:02:17.560> intake<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.030> truths

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
and carb intake and one of the truths

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.440 
and carb intake and one of the truths
over<00:02:20.080> time<00:02:20.349> is<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:21.280> individual<00:02:22.060> not

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
over time is that it's individual not

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.210 
over time is that it's individual not
dependent<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.140> here's<00:02:23.379> what<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.560> mean<00:02:23.620> you

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
dependent and here's what I mean you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.940 
dependent and here's what I mean you
will<00:02:24.370> see<00:02:24.550> over<00:02:24.910> time<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:26.050> as<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.410> do<00:02:26.590> track

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
will see over time that as you do track

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.380 
will see over time that as you do track
your<00:02:27.129> macronutrients<00:02:27.459> after<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.209> are<00:02:28.360> a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
your macronutrients after you are a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.210 
your macronutrients after you are a
beginner<00:02:28.750> you'll<00:02:29.200> quickly<00:02:29.530> notice<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:30.069> your

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
beginner you'll quickly notice that your

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.030 
beginner you'll quickly notice that your
body<00:02:30.489> changes<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.299> course<00:02:31.599> as<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.110> change

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
body changes of course as you change

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.350 
body changes of course as you change
some<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> variables<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.910> between<00:02:34.180> your

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
some of the variables so between your

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.479 
some of the variables so between your
carbs<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.049> your<00:02:35.200> fat<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.739> only<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.310> can

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
carbs and your fat and only you can

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.280 
carbs and your fat and only you can
determine<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.000> over<00:02:37.450> time<00:02:37.599> some<00:02:37.900> people<00:02:37.930> are

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
determine that over time some people are

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.130 
determine that over time some people are
better<00:02:38.440> at<00:02:38.799> handling<00:02:39.190> our<00:02:39.670> carbs<00:02:40.150> some<00:02:40.690> are

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
better at handling our carbs some are

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.500 
better at handling our carbs some are
better<00:02:41.349> at<00:02:41.590> higher<00:02:41.920> fat<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.430> fall<00:02:42.849> as<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.209> mixed

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
better at higher fat I fall as a mixed

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.300 
better at higher fat I fall as a mixed
bag<00:02:43.629> kind<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.049> between<00:02:44.470> those<00:02:44.739> two<00:02:45.069> right

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
bag kind of in between those two right

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.910 
bag kind of in between those two right
neither<00:02:45.549> hi<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.480> other<00:02:46.599> side<00:02:46.930> kind<00:02:47.829> of

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
neither hi on the other side kind of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.280 
neither hi on the other side kind of
even<00:02:48.250> placement<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.150> what<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.540> wanted<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.079> say

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
even placement but what I wanted to say

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.050 
even placement but what I wanted to say
is<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.650> for<00:02:50.829> a<00:02:50.890> beginner<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.700> got<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:51.970> get

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
is that for a beginner you got to get

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.930 
is that for a beginner you got to get
the<00:02:52.180> fundamentals<00:02:52.690> down<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.590> sometimes<00:02:54.250> by

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
the fundamentals down and sometimes by

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.750 
the fundamentals down and sometimes by
just<00:02:55.209> focusing<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.690> tracking<00:02:56.500> those<00:02:56.760> macros

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
just focusing on tracking those macros

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.690 
just focusing on tracking those macros
you<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.720> ignore<00:02:59.200> other<00:02:59.560> areas<00:03:00.160> such<00:03:00.370> as<00:03:00.400> those

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
you can ignore other areas such as those

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.819 
you can ignore other areas such as those
fruits<00:03:01.209> vegetables<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.870> viola<00:03:02.560> which<00:03:02.709> are

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
fruits vegetables and viola which are

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.220 
fruits vegetables and viola which are
just<00:03:03.129> is<00:03:03.310> important<00:03:03.879> so<00:03:04.269> once<00:03:04.599> you<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:04.959> have<00:03:04.989> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
just is important so once you do have a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.080 
just is important so once you do have a
firm<00:03:05.560> understanding<00:03:05.829> yeah<00:03:06.370> absolutely<00:03:06.579> after

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
firm understanding yeah absolutely after

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.610 
firm understanding yeah absolutely after
you've<00:03:07.329> done<00:03:07.420> your<00:03:07.480> first<00:03:07.750> couple<00:03:08.290> months<00:03:08.440> of

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you've done your first couple months of

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.559 
you've done your first couple months of
lifting<00:03:09.010> yes<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.610> think<00:03:09.879> it's<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.090> strong<00:03:10.299> idea

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
lifting yes I think it's a strong idea

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.330 
lifting yes I think it's a strong idea
for<00:03:10.870> those<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.500> want<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.799> be<00:03:11.920> physique

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
for those that want to be physique
