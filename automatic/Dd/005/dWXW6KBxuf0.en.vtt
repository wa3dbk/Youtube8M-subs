00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the water meter looks like you'll notice

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.520 
the water meter looks like you'll notice
you've<00:01:08.310> got<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.490> red<00:01:08.790> sweep<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:10.320> one

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you've got a red sweep and for one

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
you've got a red sweep and for one
revolution<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> sweep<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.820> makes<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
revolution the sweep and makes that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.630 
revolution the sweep and makes that
would<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.049> ten<00:01:13.290> gallons<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> water<00:01:13.950> which

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
would be ten gallons of water which

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.090 
would be ten gallons of water which
moves<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.180> last<00:01:15.509> digit<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.229> time<00:01:16.470> that's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
moves this last digit one time that's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.590 
moves this last digit one time that's
how<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> city<00:01:17.549> calculates<00:01:18.090> how<00:01:18.210> much<00:01:18.330> water
