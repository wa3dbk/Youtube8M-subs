thought<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.060> wheat<00:02:33.210> would<00:02:33.360> fall<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.050> guess

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
thought the wheat would fall but I guess

not<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.530> guess<00:02:34.710> that's<00:02:34.920> an<00:02:35.130> upside<00:02:35.670> because<00:02:36.270> you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
not I guess that's an upside because you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.240 
not I guess that's an upside because you
know<00:02:36.660> there's<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.110> some<00:02:37.410> seeds<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.830> not<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250
