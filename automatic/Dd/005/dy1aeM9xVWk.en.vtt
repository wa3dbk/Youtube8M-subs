 When he was many, he said he had 200 people . 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:29.150
 The fishermen have to know how big they are. 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.150
 Not only do we have to endure the danger of facing nature, but also physically difficult 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.980
 It turned out to be a job that young people are reluctant to do. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.160

 Anchor 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.150
 U 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:50.349
 We will solve the fish caught and give us the reference. 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.799
 The work of extracting the fish from the store is started. 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.400
 U 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.810
 Looking forward to carrying a box without rest 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 I have the same breath. 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.829
 If you put the box down to 320 days 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.360
 I can see all three of these real flesh . 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.740
 U 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.740
 I did not have everything underneath . 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.730
 Become a fish that drops the value of the product 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:29.250
 It's used to make fish paste. 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.250
 The minds of fishermen who have to sell hard-caught fish at cheap prices are bitter 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.260
 next day 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.820
 Cutlass answer ship reappears out to sea 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:04:00.750
 As dusk when the sun rise from 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:07.280
 It is a fateful thing for them to lower and raise their nets . 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.030
 But every moment only one standing in the sea breeze in danger lurks everywhere 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.030
 Safety is essential. 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.650
 At this very moment, there is an accident that breaks. 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.460
 Well, she's fast. 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:40.310
 The captain's voices grow as the situation gets worse. 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:47.750
 I do not have anything to do with it. 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:49.700
 Freedom is the same hwasubun that endlessly and sometimes taking Absolutely terrifying enemies to stone 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.180
 It also changes. 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:59.050
 This is a rough sea, and fishermen must watch their own lives. 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.400
 When I saw it as a material, 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.970
 What is going to come 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.850
 I do not like water and ran past. 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.810
 Security Example

 The Galaxy was to blame Will 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:21.860
 Look at the hand of the equipment . 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:24.460
 The padded straps are working on a rope to do so only to know before making a possible dangerous situation 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.460
 Should not 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:38.419
 It is waiting for the fishermen to cucumber the net again . 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:41.900
 At this time of year last year , I had fun while working with a haircut . 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.810
 But this year is not last year. 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:49.060
 In addition, because of the problem of radioactive contamination in Japan 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:53.830
 The fishermen are deeply moved. 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:59.410
 Last month, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:03.040
 Japan has been investigated as safe from contaminated water . 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:06.340
 But the fish that work hard 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:11.440
 Not getting a reasonable price itdang 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:15.600
 Sometimes patience, sometimes fighting against the sea 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.600
 It is the continuing nose life. 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:25.110
 I have been fantasizing for writing and I am good 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.110
