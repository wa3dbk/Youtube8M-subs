00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.539 
is by far my least favorite of this
series<00:03:09.419> so<00:03:09.659> far<00:03:09.689> it's<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.560> there's<00:03:11.189> nothing

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
series so far it's just there's nothing

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.509 
series so far it's just there's nothing
wrong<00:03:11.849> with<00:03:11.909> it<00:03:12.239> except<00:03:12.689> that<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:12.989> plain

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
wrong with it except that it's plain

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.110 
wrong with it except that it's plain
forgettable<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:15.060> just<00:03:15.359> not<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:16.139> great

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
forgettable and just not that great

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.009 
forgettable and just not that great
something<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.239> this<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.629> know<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.810> would

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
something like this you know you would

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.990 
something like this you know you would
think<00:03:19.049> fire<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.919> blood<00:03:20.129> would<00:03:20.489> live<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:20.760> to

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
think fire and blood would live up to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.089 
think fire and blood would live up to
this<00:03:21.120> big<00:03:21.470> spiciness<00:03:22.470> big<00:03:22.709> maltiness

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
this big spiciness big maltiness

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.219 
this big spiciness big maltiness
something<00:03:23.729> and<00:03:23.849> it<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:24.180> doesn't<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:24.989> I

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
something and it really doesn't and I

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.869 
something and it really doesn't and I
don't<00:03:25.409> know<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:25.680> they<00:03:25.799> did<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.280> kind<00:03:26.729> of

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
don't know if they did that to kind of

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.659 
don't know if they did that to kind of
make<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.269> for<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.720> masses<00:03:28.229> which<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:29.579> know
