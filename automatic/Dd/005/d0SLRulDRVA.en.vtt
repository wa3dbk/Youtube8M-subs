think that it probably would have been

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.020 
think that it probably would have been
better<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:30.130> way<00:01:30.250> that's<00:01:30.460> just<00:01:30.610> my<00:01:30.700> personal

match<00:01:46.060> because<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.420> Undertaker<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.049> getting

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
match because the Undertaker is getting

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.170 
match because the Undertaker is getting
older<00:01:47.650> so<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.250> match<00:01:48.370> wasn't<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.790> great<00:01:49.000> I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
older so the match wasn't that great I

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.490 
older so the match wasn't that great I

they don't do it in the WWE so I think
that<00:03:19.569> if<00:03:19.930> they<00:03:20.200> were<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.500> do<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.739> stuff<00:03:21.099> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that if they were to do that stuff the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.800 
that if they were to do that stuff the
people<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:21.730> really<00:03:21.880> can't<00:03:22.269> do<00:03:22.419> that<00:03:22.540> stuff

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
people that really can't do that stuff

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.940 
people that really can't do that stuff
would<00:03:22.989> be<00:03:23.079> out<00:03:23.169> of<00:03:23.200> business<00:03:23.319> it<00:03:23.709> makes<00:03:23.859> them

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
would be out of business it makes them

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.099 
would be out of business it makes them
look<00:03:24.010> bad<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:25.030> they<00:03:25.299> are<00:03:25.450> actually<00:03:25.630> held<00:03:25.900> back

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
look bad so they are actually held back

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.680 
look bad so they are actually held back
so<00:03:26.410> i<00:03:26.440> think<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.459> forearm<00:03:27.880> smash<00:03:28.060> and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
so i think that the forearm smash and

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.330 
so i think that the forearm smash and
the<00:03:28.750> full<00:03:28.959> nelson<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.769> all<00:03:29.889> this<00:03:29.950> bullshit

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the full nelson and all this bullshit

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.879 
the full nelson and all this bullshit
gone<00:03:31.180> things<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.930> past<00:03:32.079> especially<00:03:32.440> as<00:03:32.769> we

of<00:05:57.940> the<00:05:58.000> NXT<00:05:58.300> girls<00:05:58.600> like<00:05:58.690> Paige<00:05:58.900> doing<00:05:59.170> and

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
of the NXT girls like Paige doing and

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.990 
of the NXT girls like Paige doing and
some<00:05:59.470> of<00:05:59.560> them<00:05:59.680> not<00:06:00.250> necessarily<00:06:00.700> the<00:06:00.820> guys

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
some of them not necessarily the guys

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.430 
some of them not necessarily the guys
but<00:06:01.330> I<00:06:01.360> mean<00:06:01.510> you've<00:06:01.660> always<00:06:01.960> had<00:06:02.050> submission

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
but I mean you've always had submission

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.460 
but I mean you've always had submission
moves<00:06:02.590> like<00:06:02.800> John<00:06:03.190> Cena<00:06:03.490> has<00:06:03.700> is<00:06:03.970> a<00:06:04.470> attitude

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
moves like John Cena has is a attitude

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.290

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
yeah the attitude I whichever one whose

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.530 
yeah the attitude I whichever one whose
move<00:06:09.280> is<00:06:09.370> where<00:06:09.580> you<00:06:09.670> let's<00:06:10.030> get<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.270> ankle

these things off is you know it's not

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.830 
these things off is you know it's not
always<00:07:10.980> plausible<00:07:11.730> so<00:07:12.240> try<00:07:12.390> to<00:07:12.450> figure<00:07:12.660> out

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
always plausible so try to figure out

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.800 
always plausible so try to figure out
something<00:07:12.870> that<00:07:13.700> would<00:07:14.700> basically<00:07:15.420> be

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
something that would basically be

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.200 
something that would basically be
applicable<00:07:16.470> to<00:07:16.650> everyone<00:07:17.250> and<00:07:17.580> would<00:07:18.090> be

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
applicable to everyone and would be

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.030 
applicable to everyone and would be
realistic<00:07:18.840> and<00:07:18.930> that<00:07:19.200> was<00:07:19.350> the<00:07:19.470> spear<00:07:19.770> I<00:07:19.800> was

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040 
realistic and that was the spear I was

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.590 
realistic and that was the spear I was
big<00:07:20.340> enough<00:07:20.370> and<00:07:20.670> brought<00:07:21.000> enough<00:07:21.270> up<00:07:21.390> in<00:07:21.510> the

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
big enough and brought enough up in the

shoulders with the neck similar to

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.160 
shoulders with the neck similar to
Goldberg<00:07:23.970> like<00:07:24.330> I<00:07:24.630> wouldn't<00:07:24.840> say<00:07:24.960> I<00:07:24.990> was<00:07:25.020> as
