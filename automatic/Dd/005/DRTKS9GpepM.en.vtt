00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:05.559
 the engines police in our studio today Frank Ständerates with his 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:09.700
 Working tool to be put a real beautiful engine 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.929
 So to the top 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.139
 Although I may play but probably not the time but that 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.410
 is not against walls if you can still do it on donovan or 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.400
 again in November 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.019
 main character 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.949
 because the boss Ursula Neumann but that already without 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.860
 intermediate steps 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.450
 you have to do that with the patrol car training 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.150
 a special driver training outside the driving license of the normal 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.420
 Driver's license Zauchner Hundt 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.720
 after all, 43 CSV and as a training in Münster 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.210
 on normal Bundeswehr terrain is raised and what might this 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.510
 Exercise what do you have to do we are so driving lessons about percent 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.500
 Obstacles drive in a circle over obstacles so the Bremer already drive 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.070
 pushed to their limits 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.560
 and around 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.860
 because I want to go to school Stock Exchange is quite wanted to see like that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.200
 Machine reacts 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.960
 and that really makes sense, that's something for your life 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.120
 Safety is of course also a keyword 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.160
 Clothes with solid clothes they have on you know that too 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.390
 Leather suit e-mail protection story that's not legal 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.700
 they also have the spring protectors right there 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.980
 Herten back protector the Bone Protector forearm protectors knee 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.080
 twisted and tibia protectors round cymbal protectors 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.580
 Of course, the light shoes are not shoes, either 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.390
 yourself with the normal police boots 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.450
 It is to be done but it is also because important engines have boots 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.560
 and I would recommend it to anyone, even privately 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.610
 so ensures clothes to wear 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.330
 if you look at them you have to take a closer look you have to go though 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 Of course, here are different suitcases stains or wine come in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.939
 maybe here the front man can also see us a bit better 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.380
 what do you have in there so what belongs to Star moderately to the machine 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.580
 to 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.340
 So here I never have all the documents that I need to one 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.800
 Accident record 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.289
 brave feared source yes 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.090
 we do that 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.300
 though higher 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.200
 and I wanted to be there 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.759
 Okay, Kenneth Clarke then explained that percent in cash that it was the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.130
 Device with which the Verwarngelder happens if he fails Stenger 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.670
 fast way the hamburger he knows about ec-card Epoch exactly 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.809
 so here everything 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.489
 small car a camera 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.849
 therefore shamelessly photograph bottle of water sewage 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.169
 So in principle, really only the bare minimum Melo he has to last week 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.429
 Write a patrol car because all percent is possible even more 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:30.750
 Of course they are in there now 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.760
 who did not spend so much time on Holstein, for example, accident scene 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.119
 If they first of all OZ something they say then 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.489
 So there is the blue light and the wheel as such you have to as 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.380
 Premiere in all but still 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.230
 on the Munich street for example on highways there it is already Serres 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.330
 Kandern Apartment to create and then you have to then just have the must 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.699
 then do not help anymore 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.749
 otherwise the victory is underway but we have one behind and behind 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.089
 front smoke 2 I go straight again 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.479
 Percent to him back percent that is of course also appears quite 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.789
 very important to take 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.159
 better so if it is very little one but he real form 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.249
 that is, and blue light and siren 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.019
 It can not always be a very dangerous form of motorz ​​with 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.070
 Special rights coincidence or even around 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.040
 at red times we have to drive then of course we fit into the intersection 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.480
 a patrol car drove in he saw that I had a goal exactly 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:22.039
 Data like many citizens do not expect that his engine suddenly 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.960
 with blue light and siren comes more 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.910
 but then we also slow down 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.910
 If you drive over red in the intersection then you have to make sure 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.249
 you're now torture most expensive domain good reason 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.319
 If the measles horns a splitter, just do that with it 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.319
 can see that there are places too 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.659
 we were in a good mood or had fun 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.019
 Heiden 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.019
 H 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.639
 The latter of the 18 so it's all clear and who therefore you can see already 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.129
 that he still has quite a bit of power, of course 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.319
 second third important point of course Nino Martinshorn and 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.540
 Blue light and so on but also has the radio and there they are 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.969
 probably completely wired in here you can already see that here 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.969
 right with the bright what is the radio 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.569
 I'm talking about this with the foot around and shades speaker 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.619
 not just pointing in the direction 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.169
 REC is the pre 2 in front and parked 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.469
 Wants to bring in euros 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.929
 and so the radio clocks will then be addressed by a talking woman 

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:21.949
 our place 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.969
 can head while driving answers City Xander their son 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:28.310
 since you live in Vancouver Canada with the control center who lives 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.550
 Selling to the wagers thats selling him for one 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.410
 hence the final against both 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.510
 what else is still technically a senior citizen I clear and many buttons 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.300
 green 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.439
 because that's acidifying the groundwater 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.550
 if it does not follow her 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.070
 so architect also sing everything good sometimes look exactly what you know so well 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:46.710
 from the different ones 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.710
 ml patrol car but she on Saturday Orad too 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.469
 he always knows this to everyone immediately 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.469
 not always so - I do not necessarily European Union 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.309
 I'll have to stop over signs soon, but most of them are 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.919
 well, yes 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.090
 otherwise the radio will have to end up in front of all the technology of Kinect 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.569
 for fun up to ten percent 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.759
 you still fit in this process 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.789
 the motorcycle has two batteries 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.120
 one only for football but others 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.539
 arises to incite for every other normal people 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.400
 So there you need a whole 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.980
 own battery for the radio otherwise New front one looks very nice me 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.509
 think that was already in the picture 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.560
 because the Großenhainer that we have just a talking that 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:27.379
 intensive everything you need is here 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.739
 It is not such a dream now to take children for granted 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.139
 if this once 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.559
 but have the feeling 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:40.169
 if the gamer percent ever with the "motor doping" suffers straight in the 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.469
 Amman's summer colleagues were the spells son and mother that in 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.460
 Future also engines for the doors already 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.410
 yes the colleagues know that I work here and so wants to Jung von Wetter 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.900
 with sayings like me Laber 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.010
 I think if a turnaround is yes yes, even the most beautiful resource that 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.840
 So there are no Porsche just for those who like of course 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.409
 Motor of good and evil ascend 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.409
 but like Kerber painted spinning wheel Smith feel down 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.759
 he does not go to whom he knows the shares of COLEXON so not so 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.629
 Keller is because he is always on the Ulmer whether everything is 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.119
 not so easy 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.490
 percent 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.599
 and we'll see 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.309
 I think I think so 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:16.749
 I do not know exactly 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:18.360
 how heavy is the machine 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.319
 now an 80 kilos without 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.679
 Payload and so Doll Theo ten goats 280 kilos on the whole lot 

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.190
 or then 300 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.260
 Picture that is just in the field, I can be difficult in front of you already have one 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.449
 certainly the familiar John Sheehan could be his sunniest 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.790
 since I can probably invent him more likely 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.590
 Best regards 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.189
 Greetings Issue to the arm I'm gonna for God's sake 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.559
 but we see already 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:42.009
 that's basically a moto waiting 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.220
 basically as it is in the penalties so upgrade us buy 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:46.479
 can companies 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.379
 with one or the other aids 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.949
 Blue light broadcasting on the Internet appeal 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.659
 I will donate and will answer your questions 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:58.849
 if we have any from then could now post with us in the forum www qih 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:00.539
 three points before or in the chat 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.830
 We are now going to come and make it decision together 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.539
 and goodbye again hormone ago
