videos the manual thicknesses one could

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
videos the manual thicknesses one could
have<00:00:58.680> been<00:00:59.100> reduced<00:00:59.399> greatly<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.570> original

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
have been reduced greatly the original

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
have been reduced greatly the original
one<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.620> least<00:01:01.800> an<00:01:02.039> inch<00:01:02.190> thick<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:03.510> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
quite surprising and that's obviously

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.899 
quite surprising and that's obviously
taxi<00:01:05.729> cost<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> weight<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.790> last<00:01:08.790> but

taxi cost a lot of weight and last but

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:23.460 
taxi cost a lot of weight and last but
not<00:01:09.030> least<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> important<00:01:10.380> part<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> 3ds

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.690

about a nine-yard attachment which I
probably<00:01:42.220> use<00:01:42.430> at<00:01:42.520> some<00:01:42.700> point<00:01:43.110> while<00:01:44.110> this

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
got a locking pointer you can keep it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.470 
got a locking pointer you can keep it
out<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.720> three<00:01:50.110> deep<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.650> that<00:01:50.800> we<00:01:50.920> know<00:01:51.330> okay
