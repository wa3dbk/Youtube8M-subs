00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
was a very entertaining and I must say

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.909 
was a very entertaining and I must say
where<00:05:09.120> he's<00:05:09.330> planning<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.780> very<00:05:10.110> hard-fought

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
nothing on the line that's right well I

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.670 
nothing on the line that's right well I
think<00:05:14.639> being<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.419> last<00:05:15.690> match<00:05:16.139> they<00:05:16.500> know

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
think being the last match they know

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.730 
think being the last match they know
this<00:05:16.950> is<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.660> it's<00:05:18.660> always<00:05:18.900> nice<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.229> leave

this is it and it's always nice to leave

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.570 
this is it and it's always nice to leave
a<00:05:19.800> tournament<00:05:20.450> with<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.479> winning<00:05:21.780> edge<00:05:22.110> and

a tournament with a winning edge and

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.879 
a tournament with a winning edge and
certainly<00:05:23.580> all<00:05:24.450> four<00:05:24.870> players<00:05:25.530> out<00:05:25.860> here

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
certainly all four players out here

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.760 
certainly all four players out here
today<00:05:26.220> really<00:05:26.729> were<00:05:27.050> playing<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.200> if<00:05:28.380> it<00:05:28.530> meant

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
today really were playing as if it meant

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.040 
today really were playing as if it meant
absolutely<00:05:29.180> playing<00:05:30.180> for<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.419> cap<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.960> know

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
absolutely playing for the cap you know

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.659 
absolutely playing for the cap you know
you<00:05:31.200> would<00:05:31.650> have<00:05:31.680> thought<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.280> this<00:05:32.370> was<00:05:32.639> a

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
you would have thought that this was a

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.900 
you would have thought that this was a
live<00:05:33.450> mixed<00:05:33.930> doubles<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:35.160> think<00:05:35.639> it<00:05:35.729> comes

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
live mixed doubles and I think it comes

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.700 
live mixed doubles and I think it comes
down<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.389> fact<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.780> they<00:05:37.020> they<00:05:37.470> really

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
down to the fact that they they really

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.460 
down to the fact that they they really
love<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:38.880> practice<00:05:39.360> their<00:05:39.690> their<00:05:40.080> doubles
