which I like one of them is you know
this<00:01:08.220> needle<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:10.280> which<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.460> plugs<00:01:12.180> directly

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this needle here which is plugs directly

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.620 
this needle here which is plugs directly
into<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.930> wall<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> then<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.939> other<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.180> was

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
into the wall and then the other one was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
into the wall and then the other one was
that<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.020> actually<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:17.360> micro<00:01:18.360> USB<00:01:19.009> which<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that is actually a micro USB which is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.760 
that is actually a micro USB which is
you<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.790> very<00:01:21.299> convenience<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you know very very convenience it's just

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.719 
you know very very convenience it's just
micro<00:01:23.280> USB<00:01:23.700> straight<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> USB<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.520> plug

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
micro USB straight to USB so you plug

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.120 
micro USB straight to USB so you plug
that<00:01:26.790> into<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.150> computer<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.500> USB<00:01:28.770> wall

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

that into a computer or to USB wall
outlet<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.180> another<00:01:30.720> thing<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.990> like

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
outlet and then another thing I like

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.510 
outlet and then another thing I like
does<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> actually<00:01:31.530> came<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> micro<00:01:32.490> USB

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
does it actually came with a micro USB

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.969 
does it actually came with a micro USB
adapter<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.409> lot<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> cases

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
adapter so you know a lot of cases

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.830 
adapter so you know a lot of cases
generic<00:01:35.880> cases<00:01:36.500> nowadays<00:01:38.210> especially<00:01:39.210> the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
you have here that is the G tab quantum

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.470 
you have here that is the G tab quantum
biometrika<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:23.510> yep<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.780> thank<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.740> guys<00:04:25.890> for

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
biometrika and yep I thank you guys for
