00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
to be removed and that's what got us

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.830 
to be removed and that's what got us
started<00:00:17.460> thinking<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.449> there<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> better

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
performance vehicle that's my job so

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.510 
performance vehicle that's my job so
this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.170> where<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.470> came<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> our<00:02:04.920> project<00:02:05.369> we

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
this is where we came to our project we

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.499 
this is where we came to our project we
did<00:02:05.640> pulled<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> motor<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
did pulled the motor out with the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.050 
did pulled the motor out with the
intention<00:02:06.929> of<00:02:06.960> rebuilding<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.789> we<00:02:08.789> realized

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
intention of rebuilding it we realized

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.130 
intention of rebuilding it we realized
that<00:02:09.119> there's<00:02:09.360> quite<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.569> bit<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> room<00:02:09.959> up

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
that there's quite a bit of room up

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.250 
that there's quite a bit of room up
inside<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.679> truck<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:12.030> some<00:02:12.480> other

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
inside this truck for some other

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.080 
inside this truck for some other
modifications<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.459> we<00:02:14.519> started<00:02:14.760> looking<00:02:14.880> at

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
modifications and we started looking at

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.600 
modifications and we started looking at
the<00:02:15.209> option<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.660> putting<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:15.959> an<00:02:16.080> LS<00:02:16.319> motor

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
the option of putting in an LS motor

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.990 
the option of putting in an LS motor
which<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.640> very<00:02:18.060> similar<00:02:18.330> dimensions<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.790> has

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
which is very similar dimensions but has

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.720 
which is very similar dimensions but has
the<00:02:21.180> ability<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.599> have<00:02:21.870> much<00:02:22.080> higher

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the ability to have much higher

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.839 
the ability to have much higher
technology<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:24.209> more<00:02:24.450> modern<00:02:24.959> prop<00:02:25.920> an

those<00:03:47.240> locations<00:03:47.480> on<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.110> motor<00:03:48.320> even<00:03:48.680> though

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
those locations on the motor even though

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.320 
those locations on the motor even though
they'll<00:03:48.950> come<00:03:49.160> a<00:03:49.520> different<00:03:49.940> way<00:03:50.060> they're

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
they'll come a different way they're

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.480 
they'll come a different way they're
still<00:03:50.540> gonna<00:03:50.660> work<00:03:51.110> right<00:03:51.410> off<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.770> the<00:03:52.160> LS

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
still gonna work right off you the LS

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.060 
still gonna work right off you the LS
motor<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.120> we've<00:03:53.810> left<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.200> fuse<00:03:54.440> panel<00:03:54.710> but

we've removed all of the harness that

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.170 
we've removed all of the harness that
goes<00:03:56.630> with<00:03:57.050> it<00:03:57.520> probably<00:03:58.520> going<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:58.970> try<00:03:59.090> to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
goes with it probably going to try to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.940 
goes with it probably going to try to
tap<00:03:59.480> into<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.440> make<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:02.240> LS<00:04:02.840> fuse<00:04:03.710> box
