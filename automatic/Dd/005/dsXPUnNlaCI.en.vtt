00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the most that you can cope with some of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.050 
the most that you can cope with some of
the<00:01:58.650> guys<00:01:58.800> we've<00:01:59.100> had<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.760> been<00:01:59.880> at

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the guys we've had here have been at

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.250 
the guys we've had here have been at
home<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.240> quite<00:02:00.690> some<00:02:00.960> time

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
home for quite some time

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.620 
home for quite some time
they've<00:02:01.800> got<00:02:01.979> low<00:02:02.190> self-esteem<00:02:02.729> their

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
they've got low self-esteem their

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.650 
they've got low self-esteem their
confidence<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.470> not<00:02:04.679> not<00:02:05.490> good<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.450> much

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
confidence is not not good and it's much

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.419 
confidence is not not good and it's much
better<00:02:06.869> for<00:02:07.170> them<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.440> back<00:02:07.710> into<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.100> group

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
better for them to be back into a group

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.219 
better for them to be back into a group
so<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.820> think<00:02:08.910> that's<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.300> key<00:02:09.509> thing<00:02:09.780> now<00:02:09.990> all

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
so I think that's the key thing now all

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.260 
so I think that's the key thing now all
together<00:02:10.440> they<00:02:11.039> bounce<00:02:11.280> off<00:02:11.490> each<00:02:11.850> other<00:02:12.180> they

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
together they bounce off each other they

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.630 
together they bounce off each other they
get<00:02:12.600> ideas<00:02:13.050> from<00:02:13.290> each<00:02:13.440> other<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.610> know

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
get ideas from each other and you know

potentially journey south their combat

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.470 
potentially journey south their combat
stress<00:03:59.080> we<00:03:59.740> will<00:03:59.860> work<00:04:00.040> from<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.610> support<00:04:00.970> hub

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
stress we will work from the support hub

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.180 
stress we will work from the support hub
once<00:04:01.660> they<00:04:01.840> leave<00:04:02.050> service<00:04:02.350> it's<00:04:02.920> quite<00:04:03.160> a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
once they leave service it's quite a

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.280 
once they leave service it's quite a
short<00:04:03.490> period<00:04:03.790> for<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:04.300> cutoff<00:04:04.510> time<00:04:04.900> and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
short period for the cutoff time and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.890 
short period for the cutoff time and
then<00:04:05.920> they<00:04:06.040> left<00:04:06.190> on<00:04:06.370> their<00:04:06.520> own<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.540> idea

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
then they left on their own so the idea

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.420 
then they left on their own so the idea
is<00:04:08.110> that<00:04:08.140> they<00:04:08.470> get<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.830> see<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.100> welfare

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
is that they get to see the welfare
