00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
monsters fell into a trap so I just did

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.749 
monsters fell into a trap so I just did
it<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> way<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> thought<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.219> would<00:00:32.340> work<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it the way I thought it would work and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.580 
it the way I thought it would work and
then<00:00:32.910> give<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:34.020> over<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:36.469> this<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
then give this out over here this is

some more Pistons whoops
I<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:40.020> probably<00:00:40.350> bad<00:00:41.450> there<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
I was probably bad there we go and so I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.619 
I was probably bad there we go and so I
thought<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.300> um<00:00:47.480> this<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
thought that was just like um this is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.680 
thought that was just like um this is
like<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.230> creation<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:51.149> how<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
like my creation for like how to do it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.350 
like my creation for like how to do it
like<00:00:52.170> my<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> guess<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.309> don't<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.000> he<00:00:54.059> did

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
like my I guess I don't know how he did

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
like my I guess I don't know how he did
it<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:54.719> anyway<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.370> basically

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it but anyway so then what I basically

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.180 
it but anyway so then what I basically
do<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.230> close<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:58.500> doors<00:00:58.890> but

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
do is if there I just close my doors but

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.950 
do is if there I just close my doors but
I<00:00:59.219> leave<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.550> open<00:00:59.820> so<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
I leave them open so you can see and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.429 
I leave them open so you can see and
then<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.980> opens<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.760> into<00:01:03.059> each<00:01:03.420> trap<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
then this opens up into each trap and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.350 
then this opens up into each trap and
I'll<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> looting<00:01:05.850> area<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
I'll go down to the looting area and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.820 
I'll go down to the looting area and
then<00:01:06.450> I'll<00:01:06.570> show<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.960> an<00:01:07.080> example<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
then I'll show like an example of how it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.450 
then I'll show like an example of how it
works<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> basically<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:10.979> fall<00:01:11.220> there's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
works so basically they fall there's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
works so basically they fall there's
basic<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.150> lava<00:01:12.420> looter<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:15.049> yeah

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
basic like lava looter and yeah

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.170
