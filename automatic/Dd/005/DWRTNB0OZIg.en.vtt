00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
chance to pick that up soon because I've

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.120 
chance to pick that up soon because I've
heard<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.080> many<00:03:08.140> great<00:03:08.320> things<00:03:08.410> about<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.860> then

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920
