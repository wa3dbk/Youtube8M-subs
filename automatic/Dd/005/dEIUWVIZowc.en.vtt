00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.180
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.980
 third succession of tired uncovered my 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.300
 name is important and thank you for giving me that 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.770
 in the last video again so many myths 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.180
 catch've written in the comments 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.619
 We simply get involved in the event 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.390
 not crushed when you lie down 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.580
 yes, I have myself in the elevator 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.740
 and he drives up and I am 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.830
 So there you will not be in the elevator 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.230
 squeeze puts on so on 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.180
 it goes with one of my opinion 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.770
 very interesting myth and that holds 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.930
 one with permanent even more punches 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.120
 from yes I could just see it before 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.519
 text was displayed I have myself 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.199
 let me go and that was where I was 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.609
 just hit it dead with it 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.859
 See that I did not have a permanent one 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:52.670
 now i have bought with hunter and 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.729
 let me beat that one blow two thirty four 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.620
 and the fifth kills me so you hold 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.399
 5 so four strokes from the fifth 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.870
 lethal now the whole with permanent 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.930
 hunter one could see I have two 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.190
 suggestions collected and did not die 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.479
 he has to say that talk about it very much 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.860
 many, that's why it's real to me 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.100
 interesting to discover something like that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.330
 so now I have yes and yes the same as 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.460
 I just let me off the zombie 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 let's see how many beats 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.490
 I now think so 123456 so five 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.320
 I hold off the sixth kills 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.840
 So me you have to constantly still 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.450
 more blows out of a blow more 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.590
 The next myth is back 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.540
 again such a myth heavy on the man 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.080
 can uncover but still he came on 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.340
 Most in the comments before and though 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.360
 you get more ammo when you are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.250
 throw away all the grenades 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.080
 yes it's really hard to test though 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.190
 I definitely have baroque and 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.770
 I did it again thanks 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.090
 Baroque that he helped me 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.010
 always have our grenades in the round 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.770
 thrown away I have so short and 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.270
 crisp cut together for you and 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.740
 yes , I have such important moments then 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.180
 just let it in like we did then 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.270
 just got boni for example 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.590
 we are now in round four and 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.430
 get the first time ammo 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.050
 shown on the top right ammo once 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.519
 yes in round four the first time ammunition 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.870
 but that can of course be everything 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.629
 to be a coincidence that has nothing to do with now 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.510
 the grenades have to do 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.590
 Again, they throw away again so 105 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.270
 past 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.209
 Round 6 we get ammo again 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.340
 that was the second time now 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.660
 here ammo in six rounds twice 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.770
 that is actually again that has 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.870
 actually nothing with the grenades 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.190
 to do 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.380
 already in the bottom 7 I believe we 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.420
 have played it around 8 and so until 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.640
 tried around 8 and then the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.720
 end result in round nine had so 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.430
 We now have basically new 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.220
 all the grenades thrown away and had 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.780
 twice ammo you get more often 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.660
 ammunition when throwing away all the grenades 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.850
 no for the next myth we had to 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.080
 transit gamble what once again really 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.420
 it has fun once made such a 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.890
 alternation and although the bus goes to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.630
 a mp with the turbine on 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.980
 we simply have grenades for that 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.940
 Throwing the bus you can see what 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.590
 I'm surprised that he really still 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.930
 So, I have that here too 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.000
 first seen but now stops 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.920
 he immediately 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.709
 Now I'm putting my turbine down 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.099
 It takes moment so raises and the bus 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.720
 continues to drive so yes if you have the bus 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.709
 provided in the mp grenade stops 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.840
 Can you do that with the turbine again 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.340
 drive 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.260
 the bus goes to a mp with the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.450
 turbine continues yes he does 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.940
 let's come to the last myth for today 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.790
 And indeed, lap records are in the 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.040
 have counted private game for it 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.930
 Baroque and I opened a lobby here 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.720
 you can be a lap record on transit 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.760
 two players see that is round two yes 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.329
 then we have our own game 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.920
 started the card selected and yes 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.290
 the difficulty left to original 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.600
 and the privacy minded that 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.190
 is also pretty important because how 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.090
 should it be scored if someone 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.639
 Joining that can not do that 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.540
 function 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.730
 yes I have that a bit now 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.540
 rewinding sounds totally funny at the 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.970
 loading screen the music yes everything completely 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.900
 nobody can join at normal 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.670
 difficulty original you have just 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.280
 I saw this cut here now 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.289
 we played until round 3 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.680
 then we both have the grenade 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.680
 killed 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.710
 they have survived three rounds game over 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.190
 Now we just go to the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.720
 best list and actually there ne 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.930
 3 stand why not is quite 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.930
 normal 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.830
 but it does not become a trader so 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.629
 Round record counted in private game 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.280
 No, I think that's a pity 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.210
 actually they should be counted 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.069
 because you do not really change anything 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.680
 difficulty the original 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.360
 it can not join in and why why 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.500
 do you not simply willed 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.690
 that would be much more pleasant for 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.360
 all players for all players for for 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.680
 the community but well at black ops 1 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.349
 I found it a bit better that one 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.699
 because a private game could level 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.870
 and so what does level smile 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.400
 yes, I also play in my own game here 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.949
 mine now that the round records 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.110
 easy to be counted 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.250
 and therefore a pity but one 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.539
 Unfortunately, it can not change 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.520
 have that's still what I do not 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.940
 think there's just been too long 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.990
 is the player left and well that should be 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.400
 have it been I hope it has you 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.870
 Many thanks for the audience 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.729
 have fun much success with zombies chin 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.860
 and see you at the fourth 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.180
 Followed by Munich uncovered skin pure 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.180
 hectic videos on wonderful jobs 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.180
