 then girls the only thing they are going to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.280

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.129

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.460

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.800

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.280

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.030
 place under the false nail so that 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.759
 adhere very well can last until 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.190
 five days without withdrawing although I 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.500
 I have used and lasted a week and 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.619
 so finally you can change the nails 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.869
 times that you want and also key you go to 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.509
 need a file to make this look 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.700
 The first thing you're going to do is go to 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.890
 look for a nail that looks a lot like the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.460
 shape of your nail so that it looks a lot 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.460
 more natural 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.700
 after you have chosen the 10 a 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.789
 for your hands that look a lot like 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.039
 here are mine more to file the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.580
 that look like the stiletto shape that 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.580
 you like it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 first file on one side and after the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.790
 other 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.490
 keep cheering until you get the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.490
 way that you in you 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.090
 Then look at the fabric and check if you see 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.090
 like the way 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.590
 that looks good continuous with all the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.590
 nail 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.390
 give me the to see if the tips are 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.390
 same 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.010
 you can place them one on top of the other 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.260
 to make it more uniform and so 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.260
 files if both are perfect 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.700
 I find that if I put one on top 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.810
 of the other as it is easier and is 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.810
 less laborious 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.170
 and also instead of having to file 10 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.560
 Sometimes only dimas 5 I'm finishing 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.520
 these are the last you can finish 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.520
 this like in 5 minutes 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.300
 and then you're ready now it's time to 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.170
 use the stickers or two stickers 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.790
 who adhere fingernails to their fingers like this 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.700
 that we go to second at a time so that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.760
 the process is much easier and we are going to 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.760
 start 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:17.480
 squeezes it very well against the nail 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.510
 and then remove the cover to 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.100
 apply the nail over paste fabric 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.640
 all right 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.640
 A) Yes 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.400
 and ready 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.400
 continue with us from 2 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.580
 and 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.580
 ah 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.190
 I like these stickers because in addition 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.450
 that they do not have any kind they do not have 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.430
 strong chemicals also help 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.480
 your fingernails if they are weak do not 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.220
 abuse 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.490
 if you see that error on your mannequin 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.710
 see then correct it with the file but 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.320
 Look how cool they are now is ready 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:27.040
 to paint your nails as you wish and 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.040
 Enjoy your stylet type mannequin 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.380
 apply two layers of your enamel 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.380
 favorite 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.069
 I will use a gold because I love 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.870
 this color and it reminds me of what is the 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.759
 autumn with this vivid color and super autumnal 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.900
 let's make some different designs 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:59.740
 on the ring finger we are going to put it 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.740

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.740
 and on the middle finger we are going to apply 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.740
 the ok that looks like sand 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.389
 I really like how the effect of 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.360
 sand so I 'm going to put it in 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:18.020
 the index finger to make it look much more 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.020
