00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.720 
brand or what this actually is because
it's<00:02:59.870> from<00:03:00.110> my<00:03:00.350> maybe<00:03:00.590> box<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.280> it's<00:03:01.400> all<00:03:01.580> in

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
it's from my maybe box so it's all in

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.790 
it's from my maybe box so it's all in
Korean<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.990> didn't<00:03:03.260> really<00:03:03.440> like<00:03:03.650> this

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
Korean and I didn't really like this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.710 
Korean and I didn't really like this
stuff<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.340> much<00:03:04.520> I<00:03:04.730> went<00:03:04.940> through<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.209> really

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
stuff that much I went through it really

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.810 
stuff that much I went through it really
really<00:03:06.350> quickly<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:07.010> didn't<00:03:07.310> really<00:03:07.430> take<00:03:07.520> me

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
really quickly it didn't really take me

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.699 
really quickly it didn't really take me
that<00:03:07.940> long<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.120> finish<00:03:08.390> up<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.930> don't<00:03:09.530> really

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
that long to finish up I don't really

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.380 
that long to finish up I don't really
think<00:03:09.830> there's<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.100> whole<00:03:10.340> lot<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.610> product<00:03:11.270> in

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
think there's a whole lot of product in

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.140 
think there's a whole lot of product in
it<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.750> as<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.800> scrub<00:03:13.250> part<00:03:13.520> itself<00:03:13.880> I

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
it and as for the scrub part itself I

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.670 
it and as for the scrub part itself I
didn't<00:03:14.360> really<00:03:14.480> feel<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.140> did<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.440> really

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
didn't really feel like it did a really

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.590 
didn't really feel like it did a really
good<00:03:15.830> job<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:16.100> exfoliating<00:03:16.820> my<00:03:17.090> body<00:03:17.330> I<00:03:17.450> found

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
good job of exfoliating my body I found

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.590 
good job of exfoliating my body I found
the<00:03:17.959> scrub<00:03:18.320> part<00:03:18.560> was<00:03:18.739> really<00:03:19.070> weak<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.300> guess

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
the scrub part was really weak I guess

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.509 
the scrub part was really weak I guess
so<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.380> wasn't<00:03:21.560> my<00:03:21.739> favorite<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:22.280> think

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
so this wasn't my favorite I think

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.830 
so this wasn't my favorite I think
Taylor<00:03:22.790> really<00:03:23.030> likes<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.360> smell<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.600> this

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
Taylor really likes the smell of this

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.060 
Taylor really likes the smell of this
but<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.170> not<00:03:24.440> something<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.920> would

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
but this is not something I would

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.860 
but this is not something I would
repurchase<00:03:25.250> so<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.090> have<00:03:26.209> another<00:03:26.420> soap<00:03:26.720> from
