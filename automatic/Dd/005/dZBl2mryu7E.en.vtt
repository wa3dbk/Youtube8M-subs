how our skin ages

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.179 
how our skin ages
basically<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.360> more<00:01:06.540> melanin<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.590> tanning

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
less our skin ages so people who've got

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.069 
less our skin ages so people who've got

what<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.179> steer<00:01:30.539> clear<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.899> enemy

collagen and the elastin so the wrinkles

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.440 
collagen and the elastin so the wrinkles
become<00:02:16.680> deeper<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.400> more<00:02:17.640> collapsed<00:02:18.269> and

wrinkling<00:03:36.720> well<00:03:37.530> we<00:03:37.620> use<00:03:37.830> our<00:03:38.040> facial<00:03:38.490> muscles

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
wrinkling well we use our facial muscles

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.450 
wrinkling well we use our facial muscles
to<00:03:39.090> express<00:03:39.630> ourselves<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.380> by<00:03:40.530> constant

certain types of expression we actually

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.030 
certain types of expression we actually
