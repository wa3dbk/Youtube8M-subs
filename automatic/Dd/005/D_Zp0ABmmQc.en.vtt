00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
were done with all the machining if you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.310 
were done with all the machining if you
want<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.940> go<00:03:30.090> back<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.450> face<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> bit<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.290> a

want you can go back to face a bit or a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.750 
want you can go back to face a bit or a
little<00:03:31.410> bit<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.710> sandpaper<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.310> clean<00:03:32.550> up<00:03:32.670> the

left to do is assemble before you do
however<00:03:37.740> I<00:03:37.860> suggest<00:03:38.190> going<00:03:38.700> back<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.030> making

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
however I suggest going back and making

however I suggest going back and making
