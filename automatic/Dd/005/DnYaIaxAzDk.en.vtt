00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:07.419
 Oo 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.480
 The longer the product is, the lower the price. 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.369
 With the exception of some limited edition or collection products , 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.140
 It's worth less. 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 However, in the case of lectures, especially in the case of apartments, 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:33.290
 More expensive than new apartments around Yiu I'll check it out today 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:36.890
 I 'm coming out to a very economical housewife. Hi . 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.580
 The apartment is rather expensive. Yes. 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.469
 This phenomenon is especially common in Gangnam area of ​​Seoul. 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:49.129
 For example, in the case of a 30-year-old apartment building in Garak-dong, Songpa-gu , 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.120
 The current price of 56 is up from 880 million won to 920 million won 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.039
 About 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.809
 By the way, the eastern part of Songpa East, which is located next to the center, has an area of ​​85 square meters 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:04.699
 In the case of the same location, 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:09.800
 Dongbu Centerville 2 Relatively new apartments, but also bigger in area and cheaper 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:15.530
 Yeah . Well, compared to the sandals, people know. 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:19.130
 But I'm rather pushed to the municipal apartment more than 30 years of Why am 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.220
 Yes, the answer is now in reconstruction. 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.299
 Now Garak test apartment is promoting reconstruction 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.470
 What is just as just one among the largest arch q 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:35.750
 As the reconstruction maintenance project plan passed through the Seoul City Construction Committee, 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:40.640
 But what has become increasingly reconstruction built a new apartment tear down the old building 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:45.530
 If so, why is this rebuilt apartment so expensive? 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.399
 Once in the downtown area, especially in the case of Seoul Gangnam area, 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.909
 You're supposed to just not right. So, for example, sold so the metropolitan For what 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:57.950
 In the new city, the development of this residential district is continuing . 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:02.270
 If you rebuild the Gangnam area apartments already living conditions or another municipal services 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.820
 Lift the new apartment where accessibility is well stocked heard that I am Shem 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.140
 Value reflects nature 4 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.090
 Well, it's three times the water in the core area where everything is already there. 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.580
 I do not think there will be anyone on the moon . 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:20.810
 Having heard that, especially in the Gangnam Now Where Is the construction on the first field 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.890
 In addition to the Seocho-gu, it is now the landmark of Gangnam area 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.100
 Apartment 4 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.210
 There are four Banpo Ramanian pastries and Banpoji. Yes. 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:34.190
 These apartments are built in Banpo Jugong Apartment 2 and 3, respectively. 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:37.690
 Seojiwon apartments indeyo only are the prices previously reconstructed 3.3 m2 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.350
 The house price is enough to reach up to 90 million won per month. 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:47.750
 3.3 million won per square meter would be the best taste 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.140
 Dogok-dong Tower Felice I and Samsung-dong I-Park are much more expensive than this 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.000
 I guess. 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.709
 For the severe real estate bubble in 2005, particularly Article 3 only promulgated Chinese Language 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.540
 45 Report type m 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.190
 I have come up to 1.7 billion won 4 Some dedicated 244 square meters incense 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.320
 Winning members 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:10.130
 Now, the rebuilding rate will add W1bn, so the new apartment sales price 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:15.200
 From 2.6 billion won expected to reach 2.7 billion won, and the so called house prices 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:19.459
 Uh uh, this is about the rent value of a local apartment 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.420
 This is a huge amount, but what you should pay attention to when investing in these reconstructed apartments 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.800
 I will. 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.060
 Yes Reconstructed apartments have large development gains, but risk and variable 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.330
 It is worth 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.080
 It 's already reflected in the expectation of work. 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.400
 It will take more than 10 years from the reconstruction promotion committee to the apartment 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.630
 May be 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.220
 And the process of the project is complicated and intimately familiar with the process. 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.769
 It's hard. 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:50.180
 The Garden relationship's like we've come out the prices'm just talking about reconstruction 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.790
 But now I do not know what Toka reconstruction speeds because they do not match 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.989
 I do not think it's going to be a bit of a challenge. 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.800
 For the same ground shares just about rebuilding just like any other two cases 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:05.720
 I have mentioned earlier in the case of testing the apartments around the rack 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:10.670
 For the first time, 40 square meters of Eddy's shares are 49 square meters, 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.610
 The second 39 square meters of land shares differ from each other by 56 square meters 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.820
 The price of apartments is about 50 million won . 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.770
 Policy regarding the reconstruction would also variable 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.390
 Yes 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:26.110
 The Han River Revamped by Oh Se-hoon, former Mayor of the Han River Renaissance Park, 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:30.550
 Han's now been over ambitious to fulfill while the market is inaugurated 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:35.020
 The skyline is limited to a maximum number of floors by area . 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.800
 And in the meantime , we are also considering 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.980
 You have to leave. 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:44.320
 Seeing heocham example of what this second example, Han Islands 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.310
 When the government literally reclaimed the excess profits from reconstruction apartments 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.990
 It means to do it. 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:53.920
 4 In order to prevent the rebuilding apartment prices from surging, 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:58.570
 The take up to 50% due to the capital appreciation Islands 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.510
 However, as the real estate recession has been prolonged since the 2008 financial crisis 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:06.580
 By the end of 2014, the current application is the state of humanity 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.660
 4 Therefore , if you receive the management disposition after the safety diagnosis up to this time , 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.870
 You can get an exemption 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:18.160
 4 is an important factor that determines the price of apartments in the future Reconstruction worth much 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.820
 When the contents of the reconstruction project for the construction of another investment ppade and information 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.480
 You should also scrutinize the books. 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.920
 We will be looking for new property information next week. 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.920
 That's right 4
