given him some pain medication that's
pretty<00:00:43.140> strong<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.859> he<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.730> probably<00:00:44.999> a<00:00:45.329> lot

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
pretty strong so he is probably a lot

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.599 
pretty strong so he is probably a lot
more<00:00:45.539> comfortable<00:00:45.960> than<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:46.769> he<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.309> out

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
more comfortable than when he was out

more comfortable than when he was out
there<00:00:47.760> by<00:00:47.940> himself<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.589> know<00:00:49.739> we've

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
there by himself so you know we've

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.709 
there by himself so you know we've
looked<00:00:50.159> at<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.429> little<00:00:50.699> foot<00:00:51.089> and<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.569> know

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
looked at this little foot and we know

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.799 
looked at this little foot and we know
for<00:00:51.989> sure<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.499> there<00:00:53.069> is<00:00:53.309> no<00:00:53.760> feeling<00:00:54.420> he's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
for sure that there is no feeling he's
gotten<00:00:55.170> no<00:00:55.409> feeling<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.890> his<00:00:56.039> foot<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.730> most

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
gotten no feeling in his foot and most

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.759 
gotten no feeling in his foot and most
likely<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.749> nerves<00:00:57.960> were<00:00:58.199> all<00:00:58.319> severed<00:00:58.679> on

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630 
gonna go ahead and just have to amputate
this<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.380> no<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.980> to<00:01:05.040> save<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
