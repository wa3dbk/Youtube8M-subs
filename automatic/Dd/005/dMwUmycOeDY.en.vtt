00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
gotten a new I'm gonna trying to say i

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.290 
gotten a new I'm gonna trying to say i
got<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.899> new<00:00:52.050> TV<00:00:52.260> 42<00:00:53.100> inch<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.640> records<00:00:54.090> in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
got a new TV 42 inch and it records in

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.229 
got a new TV 42 inch and it records in
1080i<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.190> therefore<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.520> quality<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.059> now

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
1080i and therefore the quality is now

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.560 
1080i and therefore the quality is now
1080<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.579> indifference<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> mean<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> looks

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
1080 and indifference so I mean it looks

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.049 
1080 and indifference so I mean it looks
grainy<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.260> me<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:02.129> maybe<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.730> me<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
grainy to me but maybe it's just me I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.310 
grainy to me but maybe it's just me I
don't<00:01:03.329> know<00:01:03.420> maybe<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> looks<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
don't know maybe it looks good for you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
don't know maybe it looks good for you
guys<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> me<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.760> looks<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.060> bad<00:01:06.299> in

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
guys but to me it looks really bad in

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
guys but to me it looks really bad in
grainy<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.430> know<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> looks

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
grainy and and you know but it looks

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
grainy and and you know but it looks
good<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.150> TV<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.689> guess<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
good on my TV so I guess that's all that

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440 
good on my TV so I guess that's all that
matters<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.220> run<00:01:11.490> her<00:01:11.610> down<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.880> 720p

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
matters and I do run her down in 720p

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
matters and I do run her down in 720p
maybe<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.110> why<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.220> don't

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
maybe that's why I'm I don't I don't

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
maybe that's why I'm I don't I don't
know<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:15.090> don't<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.450> I've<00:01:15.990> never

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
know I really don't know I've never

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
know I really don't know I've never
recorded<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.740> 1080<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
recorded in 1080 but I do know that it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
recorded in 1080 but I do know that it
you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> takes<00:01:19.140> longer<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.950> render<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you know it takes longer to render out a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.280 
you know it takes longer to render out a
video<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.790> 1080<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.330> stuff<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
video in 1080 and stuff like that so I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
video in 1080 and stuff like that so I
didn't<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.939> here

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
didn't want to do that and that here

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
didn't want to do that and that here
here's<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> start<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.320> downhill<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
here's when I start going downhill and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.380 
here's when I start going downhill and
its<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.310> laggy<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.090> hard<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> get

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
its really laggy and it's hard to get

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
its really laggy and it's hard to get
kills<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.560> what<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> talk

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
kills but that's not what I want to talk

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
kills but that's not what I want to talk
