tutorial today for you guys I've got a
automatic<00:00:07.109> compact<00:00:07.919> rabbit<00:00:08.490> farm<00:00:08.700> here

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
automatic compact rabbit farm here

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.110 
automatic compact rabbit farm here
triggered<00:00:10.110> by<00:00:10.260> two<00:00:10.320> buttons<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.610> let's<00:00:11.969> get

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
triggered by two buttons so let's get

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.339 
triggered by two buttons so let's get
started

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
started

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.560 
started
once<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.429> grown<00:00:14.759> rabbits<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.389> this

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
once you have grown rabbits in this

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.790 
once you have grown rabbits in this
chamber<00:00:15.870> you're<00:00:16.109> gonna<00:00:16.199> want<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.440> press<00:00:16.619> this

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
chamber you're gonna want to press this

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
chamber you're gonna want to press this
button<00:00:16.859> some<00:00:17.760> lava<00:00:18.000> will<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.300> dispensed<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
button some lava will be dispensed and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.140 
button some lava will be dispensed and
then<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:19.590> will<00:00:19.740> burn<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.250> death<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.670> it

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
then they will burn to death here it

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
then they will burn to death here it
takes<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.570> few<00:00:21.750> seconds<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.320> them<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.560> burn<00:00:22.769> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
takes a few seconds for them to burn to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.980 
takes a few seconds for them to burn to
death<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.519> gotta<00:00:23.699> wait<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.240> not

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
death so we just gotta wait for this not

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.689 
death so we just gotta wait for this not
too<00:00:25.170> long<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:25.949> though<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.400> ahead<00:00:26.580> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
too long and then though go ahead and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.359 
too long and then though go ahead and
die<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.930> their<00:00:28.109> drops<00:00:28.410> will<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.800> taking

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
die and all their drops will be taking

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.900 
die and all their drops will be taking
it<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.789> double<00:00:30.090> chest<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:31.109> here

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
it into this double chest right here

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.220 
it into this double chest right here
that's<00:00:32.910> odd<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.420> that's<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:34.050> into

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that's odd that that's not going into

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.840 
that's odd that that's not going into
that<00:00:34.290> stack<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.980> anyway<00:00:35.250> you'll<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that stack but anyway you'll get the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.900 
that stack but anyway you'll get the
rabbit<00:00:36.540> hide<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.440> cooked<00:00:37.680> rabbit<00:00:37.920> so

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
rabbit hide and the cooked rabbit so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.200 
rabbit hide and the cooked rabbit so
let's<00:00:39.300> move<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> breeding<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:42.000> is

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
let's move on to the breeding so this is

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.410 
let's move on to the breeding so this is
triggered<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.879> water<00:00:44.879> bucket<00:00:45.120> being

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
triggered by a water bucket being

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.330 
triggered by a water bucket being
dispensed<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.129> will

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
dispensed in here and then they will

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.220 
dispensed in here and then they will
jump<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.090> consonant<00:00:48.719> rate<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
jump in a more consonant rate when the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.100 
jump in a more consonant rate when the
water<00:00:49.559> bucket<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.039> dispensed<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.930> just

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
water bucket is dispensed so we can just

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
water bucket is dispensed so we can just
go<00:00:52.230> ahead<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.760> get<00:00:53.760> some<00:00:54.030> babies<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.750> they'll

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
go ahead and get some babies and they'll

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.260 
go ahead and get some babies and they'll
just<00:00:55.289> shoot<00:00:55.530> right<00:00:55.890> into<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.940> doesn't

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
just shoot right into here it doesn't

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.819 
just shoot right into here it doesn't
even<00:00:57.329> matter<00:00:57.600> they'll<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
even matter they'll just go in there the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
even matter they'll just go in there the
more<00:00:58.949> babies<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.460> put<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.969> more<00:01:00.180> rabbits

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
more babies you put the more rabbits

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.090 
more babies you put the more rabbits
will<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.870> shot<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.890> there's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
will be shot into here because there's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.119 
will be shot into here because there's
less<00:01:02.340> space<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.290> they'll

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
less space in here for them so they'll

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
less space in here for them so they'll
grow<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.119> won't<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.420> able<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
grow up and then they won't be able to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.140 
grow up and then they won't be able to
get<00:01:06.900> back<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.729> pretty<00:01:08.939> good

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
get back in here so that's a pretty good

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690 
get back in here so that's a pretty good
thing<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.409> why<00:01:10.710> don't<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.040> started<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

around the back here you're gonna want a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.510 
around the back here you're gonna want a
shape<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.210> this

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.460 

and<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:47.270> should<00:02:47.450> be<00:02:47.540> your<00:02:47.570> initial<00:02:48.140> shape

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
and that should be your initial shape

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.290 
and that should be your initial shape
done<00:02:50.980> okay<00:02:51.980> guys<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.640> next<00:02:52.820> part<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.180> your

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
done okay guys so the next part of your

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.620 
done okay guys so the next part of your
tutorial<00:02:53.960> is<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.950> redstone<00:02:55.490> so<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.360> first

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
tutorial is the redstone so the first

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.290 
tutorial is the redstone so the first
step<00:02:56.960> of<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.980> just<00:02:58.010> place<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:58.940> block

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
step of that is to just place a block

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.630 
step of that is to just place a block
next<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.960> this<00:03:00.080> button<00:03:00.380> place<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> piece<00:03:01.490> of

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
next to this button place a piece of

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.430 
next to this button place a piece of
redstone<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.450> place<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.900> piece<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.140> redstone

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
redstone on it place a piece of redstone

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.220 
redstone on it place a piece of redstone
here<00:03:03.710> grate<00:03:04.550> these<00:03:04.790> two<00:03:05.060> blocks<00:03:05.360> place<00:03:06.200> a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
here grate these two blocks place a

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.620 
here grate these two blocks place a
piece<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.650> redstone<00:03:06.980> here<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.760> then<00:03:08.270> a

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
piece of redstone here and then a

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.260 
piece of redstone here and then a
repeater<00:03:09.020> right<00:03:09.260> here<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.880> that's<00:03:10.940> your<00:03:11.090> first

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
repeater right here so that's your first

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.030 
repeater right here so that's your first
side<00:03:11.540> redstone<00:03:12.050> done<00:03:12.260> let's<00:03:12.500> get<00:03:12.650> started<00:03:12.950> on
