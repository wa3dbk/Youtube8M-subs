that we think are the best tabletop
games<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> world<00:01:41.670> yeah<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.299> Alana<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> mean

probably watching this you know you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330 
probably watching this you know you
start<00:01:45.390> early<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.259> start<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.860> oh<00:01:47.040> yeah<00:01:47.280> I

played magic for five years instead of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
played magic for five years instead of
transitioning<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> net<00:01:50.159> runner<00:01:50.369> or

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
transitioning to like a net runner or

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.789 
transitioning to like a net runner or
Star<00:01:51.090> Wars<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.630> even<00:01:51.990> an<00:01:52.110> interest<00:01:52.439> game<00:01:52.590> is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
Star Wars or even an interest game is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.920 
Star Wars or even an interest game is
it's<00:01:53.520> pretty<00:01:53.850> easy<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.390> its<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
it's pretty easy on its then you have a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.359 
it's pretty easy on its then you have a
frame<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.350> reference<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> understand<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.310> know

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
frame of reference I understand you know

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.889 
frame of reference I understand you know
there's<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.670> releases<00:01:57.180> occasionally

I'm<00:02:04.350> building<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> deck<00:02:04.890> even<00:02:05.070> like

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
I'm building a deck even like

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.120 
I'm building a deck even like
how<00:02:05.689> scary<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.350> walk<00:02:06.500> into<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.799> store

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
how scary is it to walk into a store

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.320 
how scary is it to walk into a store
when<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.400> don't<00:02:07.549> know<00:02:07.729> anybody<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:08.270> the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
when you don't know anybody for the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.449 
when you don't know anybody for the
first<00:02:08.539> time<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:08.990> it's<00:02:09.080> like<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:10.220> want<00:02:10.399> to

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
first time and it's like I just want to

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.860 
first time and it's like I just want to
come<00:02:10.580> play<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> game<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.450> know<00:02:11.480> netrunner

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
come play a game of you know netrunner

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.840 
come play a game of you know netrunner
and<00:02:12.170> it's<00:02:12.260> like<00:02:12.410> that's<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.190> idea<00:02:13.580> that's

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
and it's like that's the idea that's

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.180 
and it's like that's the idea that's
actually<00:02:14.330> fundamentally<00:02:15.170> terrifying<00:02:15.739> if<00:02:16.040> you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
actually fundamentally terrifying if you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.620 
actually fundamentally terrifying if you
aren't<00:02:16.489> already<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.910> part<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.300> community

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
aren't already a part of that community

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.750 
aren't already a part of that community
so<00:02:17.930> there's<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.350> lot<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.739> there's<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.580> lot

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
so there's a lot of there's just a lot

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.670 
so there's a lot of there's just a lot
of<00:02:19.819> potential<00:02:20.690> gray<00:02:20.989> areas<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.500> can<00:02:21.650> be

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
of potential gray areas that can be

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.580 
of potential gray areas that can be
cleared<00:02:22.040> up<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:23.540> simple<00:02:23.900> yeah<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
cleared up and just simple yeah and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.390 
cleared up and just simple yeah and
that's<00:02:24.890> our<00:02:25.040> hope

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
that's our hope

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.580 
that's our hope
so<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.090> Covenant<00:02:26.450> starters<00:02:26.780> are<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.440> to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
so the Covenant starters are going to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.160 
so the Covenant starters are going to
include<00:02:27.800> any<00:02:28.190> products<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.090> need<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.750> we

include any products that you need to we
feel<00:02:30.410> get<00:02:30.560> started<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.220> very<00:02:31.280> reasonable

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
feel get started in a very reasonable

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.030 
feel get started in a very reasonable
and<00:02:32.330> cost-effective<00:02:32.959> way<00:02:32.989> in<00:02:33.350> these<00:02:33.709> games

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
and cost-effective way in these games

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800 
and cost-effective way in these games
now<00:02:34.760> for<00:02:35.000> like<00:02:35.120> if<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.390> newer<00:02:35.569> game

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
now for like if it's a newer game

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.880 
now for like if it's a newer game
they're<00:02:35.989> getting<00:02:36.230> into<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.680> might

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
they're getting into you that might

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.490 
they're getting into you that might
include<00:02:37.130> corsets<00:02:37.880> primarily<00:02:38.480> if<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:38.810> more

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
include corsets primarily if it's more

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.870 
include corsets primarily if it's more
mature<00:02:39.680> game<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.220> might<00:02:40.310> include<00:02:40.519> coarse

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
mature game that might include coarse

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.699 
mature game that might include coarse
hats<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.420> some<00:02:41.540> expansions<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.350> appear<00:02:42.590> that

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
hats and some expansions and appear that

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.620 
hats and some expansions and appear that
things<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.550> won't<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.850> identical

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
things so it won't be identical

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.360 
things so it won't be identical
throughout<00:02:44.959> every<00:02:45.200> game<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:45.980> can<00:02:46.160> very

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
throughout every game and it can very

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.410 
throughout every game and it can very
well<00:02:46.400> change<00:02:46.670> throughout<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.090> course<00:02:47.300> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
well change throughout the course and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.240 
well change throughout the course and
absolutely<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> mean<00:02:48.110> will<00:02:48.290> be<00:02:48.470> very<00:02:49.010> game

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
absolutely I mean will be very game

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.490 
absolutely I mean will be very game
specific<00:02:49.790> right<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.959> what<00:02:51.380> we

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
specific right so it's this is what we

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.080 
specific right so it's this is what we
recommend<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.980> start<00:02:52.190> with<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.610> netrunner

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
recommend you start with for netrunner

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.180 
recommend you start with for netrunner
or<00:02:53.239> another<00:02:53.540> game<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.780> thrones<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.470> it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
or another game of thrones and it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.800 
or another game of thrones and it
