welcome<00:00:02.700> back<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:03.120> Lego<00:00:03.449> worlds

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
welcome back to Lego worlds

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.869 
welcome back to Lego worlds
you<00:00:04.560> may<00:00:04.710> notice<00:00:04.950> behind<00:00:05.160> me<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.609> some<00:00:05.759> new

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
you may notice behind me I have some new

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.210 
you may notice behind me I have some new
vehicles<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.480> found<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:07.020> major<00:00:07.350> Steel's<00:00:07.680> hot<00:00:07.980> rod

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
vehicles I found a major Steel's hot rod

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.820 
vehicles I found a major Steel's hot rod
which<00:00:09.120> controls<00:00:09.570> very<00:00:10.170> much<00:00:10.290> like<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.620> buggy

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
which controls very much like the buggy

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.259 
which controls very much like the buggy
it's<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> same<00:00:11.340> speed<00:00:11.730> but<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.120> has<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
it's about the same speed but it has a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.820 
it's about the same speed but it has a
lot<00:00:12.509> better<00:00:12.719> traction

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
lot better traction

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
lot better traction
so<00:00:14.340> it's<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:14.700> actually<00:00:14.820> more<00:00:15.150> useful<00:00:15.450> for

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
so it's it's actually more useful for

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.090 
so it's it's actually more useful for
getting<00:00:15.660> around<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.080> buggy<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.590> found<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
getting around in the buggy I found the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.010 
getting around in the buggy I found the
motorcycle<00:00:17.340> which<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.029> really<00:00:18.480> fast<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
motorcycle which is really fast for a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.529 
motorcycle which is really fast for a
little<00:00:19.260> bit<00:00:19.350> difficult<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.800> control<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.539> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
little bit difficult to control and the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.750 
little bit difficult to control and the
skateboard<00:00:22.289> which<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.590> actually<00:00:22.890> pretty<00:00:23.460> slow

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
skateboard which is actually pretty slow

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
skateboard which is actually pretty slow
I<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> bit<00:00:24.390> disappointed<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.050> hoping

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
I was a bit disappointed I was hoping

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.570 
I was a bit disappointed I was hoping
for<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> little<00:00:25.680> bit<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:25.920> speed<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.490> do

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
for a little bit more speed so I can do

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
for a little bit more speed so I can do
some<00:00:26.699> more<00:00:26.760> tricks<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.900> Sun<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.230> setting

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
some more tricks and the Sun is setting

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.650 
some more tricks and the Sun is setting
here<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.189> loop-d-loop<00:00:29.670> track<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
here on the loop-d-loop track and you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.939 
here on the loop-d-loop track and you
may<00:00:30.779> notice<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.199> another<00:00:31.410> vehicle<00:00:31.619> this

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
may notice I have another vehicle this

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.889 
may notice I have another vehicle this
is<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> creator<00:00:32.669> car<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.390> easy<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.690> find

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
is the creator car which is easy to find

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
is the creator car which is easy to find
you<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.530> need<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:34.980> ahead<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.219> spawn<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you just need to go ahead and spawn the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.360 
you just need to go ahead and spawn the
seasons<00:00:36.239> set<00:00:36.450> which<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
seasons set which is up here this one I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.549 
seasons set which is up here this one I
actually<00:00:38.550> showed<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.059> all<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.290> my

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
actually showed you all about this in my

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.459 
actually showed you all about this in my
tutorial<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.430> infinite<00:00:42.300> money<00:00:42.450> if<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
tutorial for the infinite money if you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.959 
tutorial for the infinite money if you
haven't<00:00:43.649> seen<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:44.040> ahead<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.250> check

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
haven't seen that go ahead and check

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:45.400 
haven't seen that go ahead and check
that<00:00:45.149> out

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
that out

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.209 
that out
at<00:00:46.410> least<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.680> you're<00:00:46.770> looking<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.070> money

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
at least if you're looking for money

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.639 
at least if you're looking for money
anyway<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> only<00:00:48.600> vehicle<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.350> found

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
anyway this is the only vehicle I found

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.270 
anyway this is the only vehicle I found
that<00:00:50.180> pretty<00:00:51.180> much<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> loop-d-loop

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that pretty much can do the loop-d-loop

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
that pretty much can do the loop-d-loop
it's<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:53.850> entirely<00:00:54.210> perfect<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.989> does<00:00:55.230> come

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it's not entirely perfect it does come

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.529 
it's not entirely perfect it does come
off<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.070> track<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> slight<00:00:56.879> bit<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> very

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
off the track a slight bit at the very

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.049 
off the track a slight bit at the very
apex<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> loop<00:00:58.399> but<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.760> as<00:00:59.850> close

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
apex of the loop but it's about as close

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.369 
apex of the loop but it's about as close
as<00:01:00.239> we're<00:01:00.390> ever<00:01:00.539> gonna<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.260> gonna

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
as we're ever gonna get and I'm gonna

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.810 
as we're ever gonna get and I'm gonna
show<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> today<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.100> let's<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.699> ahead

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
show you that today so let's go ahead

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.250 
show you that today so let's go ahead
and<00:01:03.539> give<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> shot

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and give it a shot

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740 
and give it a shot
it<00:01:04.470> might<00:01:04.680> take<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> few<00:01:05.640> tries<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.659> if

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it might take it to a few tries so if

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.170 
it might take it to a few tries so if
there's<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> jump<00:01:07.200> cut<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.979> why

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
there's a jump cut that will be why

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.050 
there's a jump cut that will be why
anyway<00:01:09.180> wish<00:01:09.330> me<00:01:09.360> luck<00:01:09.659> let's<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:11.060> you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
anyway wish me luck let's do this you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
anyway wish me luck let's do this you
have<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.479> perfectly<00:01:13.229> straight<00:01:13.619> on

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
have to be about perfectly straight on

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.179 
have to be about perfectly straight on
the<00:01:13.950> track

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
the track

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.050 
the track
and<00:01:15.340> then<00:01:16.090> hopefully<00:01:16.329> oh<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.670> was<00:01:18.789> actually

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
and then hopefully oh that was actually

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.340 
and then hopefully oh that was actually
pretty<00:01:19.180> good<00:01:19.270> for<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.630> first<00:01:19.750> try<00:01:19.899> but<00:01:20.259> I've

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
pretty good for a first try but I've

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.840 
pretty good for a first try but I've
seen<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.710> do<00:01:20.950> better<00:01:21.189> so<00:01:21.430> we're<00:01:21.549> gonna<00:01:21.640> try

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
seen it do better so we're gonna try

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.749 
seen it do better so we're gonna try
again<00:01:22.560> okay<00:01:23.560> so<00:01:23.590> I'm<00:01:23.770> gonna<00:01:23.890> try<00:01:24.130> making<00:01:24.549> the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
again okay so I'm gonna try making the

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.550 
again okay so I'm gonna try making the
loop<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.270> little<00:01:25.509> bit<00:01:25.600> wider<00:01:25.899> on<00:01:26.259> the

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
loop a little bit wider on the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.950 
loop a little bit wider on the
right-hand<00:01:27.310> side<00:01:27.430> here<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.240> this<00:01:28.509> all<00:01:28.689> are<00:01:28.810> my

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
right-hand side here and this all are my

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.050 
right-hand side here and this all are my
attempts<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.470> keep<00:01:29.860> falling<00:01:30.130> off<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.490> edge<00:01:30.670> and

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
attempts I keep falling off the edge and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.600 
attempts I keep falling off the edge and
that<00:01:32.020> might<00:01:32.409> be<00:01:32.439> affecting<00:01:33.100> this<00:01:33.399> sort<00:01:33.549> of

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
that might be affecting this sort of

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.880 
that might be affecting this sort of
entry<00:01:34.060> angle<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:34.509> get<00:01:34.780> because<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.409> cars<00:01:35.710> try

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
entry angle I get because the cars try

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.429 
entry angle I get because the cars try
and<00:01:36.009> snap<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.640> ground<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:38.049> we're<00:01:38.170> gonna<00:01:38.259> do

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
and snap to the ground so we're gonna do

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.870 
and snap to the ground so we're gonna do
that<00:01:38.560> real<00:01:38.770> quick<00:01:39.009> and<00:01:39.189> then<00:01:39.369> give<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.759> another

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
that real quick and then give it another

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.179 
that real quick and then give it another
shot<00:01:40.319> all<00:01:41.319> right<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:41.649> I've<00:01:41.710> made<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.069> bit

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
shot all right so I've made it a bit

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.429 
shot all right so I've made it a bit
wider<00:01:42.429> on<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.759> side<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.360> hopefully<00:01:43.630> that's

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
wider on this side so hopefully that's

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.460 
wider on this side so hopefully that's
gonna<00:01:44.560> help<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:45.009> make<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.369> good<00:01:45.610> landing<00:01:46.470> let's

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
gonna help it make a good landing let's

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.660 
gonna help it make a good landing let's
give<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.649> some<00:01:47.740> more<00:01:47.979> shots<00:01:48.189> I<00:01:48.369> think<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.580> was

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
give it some more shots I think it was

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.410 
give it some more shots I think it was
up<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.849> 16<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.729> gives<00:01:51.939> you<00:01:52.000> an<00:01:52.090> idea<00:01:52.209> of

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
up to 16 so that gives you an idea of

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.760 
up to 16 so that gives you an idea of
how<00:01:52.539> far<00:01:52.780> into<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.319> am<00:01:54.479> okay<00:01:55.479> attempt<00:01:56.080> 44

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.510 

yes<00:02:03.470> yes<00:02:04.970> right<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:07.530> was<00:02:07.680> pretty<00:02:07.950> good<00:02:08.280> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
yes yes right that was pretty good I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.740 
yes yes right that was pretty good I
liked<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.380> attempt<00:02:10.380> 72<00:02:14.270> yes<00:02:15.500> yeah<00:02:16.730> that

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
liked that one attempt 72 yes yeah that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.770 
liked that one attempt 72 yes yeah that
was<00:02:18.750> good<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.910> trick<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.209> not<00:02:21.420> angle

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
was good and the trick is to not angle

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.380 
was good and the trick is to not angle
the<00:02:21.870> camera<00:02:21.900> too<00:02:22.410> much<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.099> try<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.090> get<00:02:24.239> in

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the camera too much and try and get in

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.440 
the camera too much and try and get in
as<00:02:24.569> close<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.200> right<00:02:25.410> wall<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.950> can

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
as close to the right wall as you can

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.140 
as close to the right wall as you can
okay<00:02:27.450> attempt<00:02:28.069> 75
