 Ajax meets top scorer of the Premier League on Saturday 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.279
 at least that is it is 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.549
 now that's a joke 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.610
 the new plan did not score more than twelve times this season 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.870
 last season the belgian maarten wynants scored an ajax in the 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.159

 times in the premier league 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.219
 the people of Nijmegen are still looking for the first victory in Amsterdam 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.520
 ajax never lost three times it became the same and the lion's share became 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.290

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.840
 for and 17 against 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.940
 a well-known old player from and in the sea and ajax is edo ophof 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.380
 the defender made the switch from nijmegen to amsterdam in the 88th 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.690
 ajax probably encounters two old acquaintances with which he wants with john 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.920
 goossens now play with the opponent 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.880
 according to for young ajax in 2008 this beautiful free kick against the 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.860
 gelderlander 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 once again with a drop of thirty meters the distance 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.510
 last season, ajax won 3 0 in-house 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.040
 siem de jong mitchell donald decided the game that left suares ajax upset 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.520
 had taken the lead from rest 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.550
 in the extra time 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.600
 another chance for ajax 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 if maintenance there everything is resolved 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.680
 made suarez like again 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.330
 she pointed out 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
 customers cannot be solved correctly 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 many customers nothing 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.420
 traitors 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 Ronald is next to it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.810
 4 that's what happened there 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.120
 the match of 3 April with the 82 means that the neighborhood of marco van 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.929
 bark 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.859
 he replaced Johan Cruijff after the break and scored immediately 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:16.090
 ajax won the match with 5 0 that it was nice good fascinating 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.999
 and scoring 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 the email seems ajax 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.389
 before halftime it was still not 2 0 again 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.389
 waiting for movements is annoyance 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.849
 first duel with stabbing then the pole 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.609
 Wim Jansen is going on a journey 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.499
 his cross here 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.499
 stands eventually Dick Schoenaker and 2 0 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.669
 then it appears how do all the ajaxied talents sit this is from bark that 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.669
 the weaver youth player in the east beforehand 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.809

 ns gate animals third goal has celebration for get kieft ensures 4 0 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.619
 the final score was 5 0 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.949
 by a goal from 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.259
 Dick Schoenaker in 2002 won Ajax with 6 0 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.329
 mido was the main role 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.659
 let's be put away 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.539
 nice cross 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.539
 they are in trouble now 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.269
 the fnv is due to the sidelines 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.299
 before the break 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.979

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.259
 and there is a tree 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.259
 taken away by and for me a joke was rejected 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.499

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.109
 53rd minute 30 for ajax 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.109

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.519
 as the most common 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.689
 how it works 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.689
 excellent finish Rafael van der Vaart 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.680
