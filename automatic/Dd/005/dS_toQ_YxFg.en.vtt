00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.249
 the problem of the indebtedness of the mortgage crisis that with these 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:06.620
 conditions in which there is as much indebtedness as you say juan is 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.609
 difficult to start a business when there is a crisis 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.219
 well I think that it is precisely at this moment when it is easiest to mount 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.709
 a business thanks to the internet we are seeing it 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.140
 with the case of José María that I want to congratulate from here because I think 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.300
 all an entrepreneur and like him every time he's seeing a lot more new rich and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.929
 that is a reality and they are the figures I know we can look at different 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.329
 sites 1 towards unemployment issues as you are talking about to the location 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.770
 and we can look at another reality is that they are insisting today 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.270
 in day it is very easy to reach millions of people we are going to meet with 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.550
 obstacles like you are finding José María 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.910
 but no doubt we live a very sweet moment because technology 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.000
 the knowledge we have there 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.630
 two things are missing two things to improve all that are emotions is to say 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.930
 control 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.790
 you come down in a moment of a bandwidth problem like 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.650
 you commented 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.970
 and then as not the shares do not and with that triangle but before where we can 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.170
 go much farther than the truthfulness of the words said ways a moment 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.930
 sweet to start a business this agreement 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.080
 not having attacked john war brother board 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.110
 we know why we have businesses and small businesses have 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.550
 a problem of brutal funding container 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.230
 the year 2008 all banks are 50% 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.770
 from the federation to andrés like this to individuals 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.850
 your mission are completely weddings the SMEs that are financing 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 fundamentally with a credit policy 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.430
 that are reluctant goals are canceling annually they are fine-tuning 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.220
 all all not all policies then at the time if we can not 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.340
 talk about lv is about sociology let's say 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.430
 no emotions 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.679
 if we do not have money 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.849
 little we will be able to ride no period again something we had before 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.349
 if the crisis is necessary to renew this book one of the characteristics 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.679
 of 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.920
 what has been the economic model of the past 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.610
 warns precisely the economic concentration in large groups that has 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.540
 fact that many SMEs also want to even had good times like 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.469
 we have lived in recent years 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.450
 Many SMEs have had to close 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.890
 because if they achieve what they have left alone and labor 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.390
 moral home workers highlighted the construction of the balance sheets and the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.560
 splendor of the Polynesian citizens to go there and now onwards 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.439
 entrepreneurs 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.569
 who have not seen us satisfied with this time and the situation is appreciated 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.639
 economic is an issue that until now much the financial crisis perhaps 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.489
 because it has been 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.720
 as the starting signal for people to realize the situation that 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:26.559
 we lived 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:30.819
 but the mayor and picks up a real economic crisis because people have been 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.999
 married in debt
