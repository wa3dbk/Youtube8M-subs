00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.959
 yes no froze completely to the brim 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:14.940
 this beach see flooded 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.890
 a little bit here and the weather froze 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.880
 us today the sun is great the most 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.880
 business is also not 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.920
 the sun is generally beauty 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.890
 that's how it looks like you can ride 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:43.360
 bike ride 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.360
 comes skating but it wo n't work 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.920
 so here but we continue our 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.830
 we lit a fire on ti3 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:02.520
 in the middle of the river and now I will 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:07.220
 move Donetsk from the left bank to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.050
 right bank side of the village that's where 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.830
 wider glove us can not come in handy 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.380
 and drove in one leg 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.380
 go to the folder strictly for artem 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:29.430
 share in the ice something frozen into ice 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:37.080
 uneven that fry scares here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:41.060
 some dark and it seemed to me here 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:46.380
 the crack is at all visible deep 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.960
 You are a strange Lena and somehow only 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.090
 not afraid to go 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:02:00.049
 I want your footprints I do not see the framework you walked along 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.600
 how did you go then oh well these waves of purpose 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.430
 but I think it is already small 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:15.829
 even blue bird will be sewing somewhere 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:20.209
 so scary she is not there to land in 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:22.890
 the village is already well and the great soldiers fire 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.560
 contrary to all laws of nature to the firm 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 scorching on ice and ice as you see wrong 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.549
 this is something 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.549
 already there is so fat 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.819
 well yes 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.450
 the largest thawed patch on Seversk 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.600
 the bottom is near the bridge in this bridge 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.150
 and here it is thawed if you look closely 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.550
 you can see water flowing here 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.640
 why in this place did not freeze to the end 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:28.490
 unknown maybe here just fine and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.490
 a large current is a flooded forest 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:51.290
 rather unusual place cage slippery 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:56.810
 but so normally ours can pass 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.810
 Madame C found the first hole 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.620
 the sheet and here we see the thickness of the ice 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:10.410
 the film that there is a small flow 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:17.160
 Now we measure the thickness you know how to her 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:21.010
 get though not really the king of fat 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.690
 ice gray thickness 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:32.800
 That's about such a thin one can 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:38.620
 say expected and thicker see but not 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:41.950
 rattling I came to Donetsk after a week 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.080
 after traveling on ice and ice already 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.080
 began to thaw 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.110
 you can watch pieces of ice float and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.630
 so understood here an hour is not safe because 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.420
 that cliff on which I stood absolutely 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.600
 recently collapsed 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:02.410
 can take a closer look will show that 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.930
 tumbled so hard that it broke the ice 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.000
 which is still quite thick in this 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:13.780
 everywhere here is a tree 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:17.010
 very soon fall into the river broke away 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.010
 one of the biggest people 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.520
 with a huge lesson there something goes 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:39.800
 and after a couple more weeks the ice melted 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:47.990
 just a little bit left 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:56.890
 coast of the hour you show better if he 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:56.890
 wo n't collapse so it looks on among
