00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.779
 after making the veil part 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.679
 of the whole wall 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:13.530
 we left this this one 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.360
 four inches that counting that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.270
 this being the whole wall 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.830
 here we have the ceiling so we have 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.699
 left a 4 cm ribbon 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.689
 now let's put the steering in 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.070
 this case the steering is what the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:40.980
 we put flush with the color 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 upstairs so we're going to put in 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:52.260
 this way that is with the ribbon placed 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.699
 so a dot of here is a dot was 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 thought part so that this comes 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.520
 can also be placed here also for 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.400
 be safer in this case us 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.280
 let's go beat with the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 brush in this case we have it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.130
 with this small brush we are going to emerge 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.100
 inside this sequin which would be of la 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.229
 painting now color to that of the walls 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:30.030
 of the sails then we go to put 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.979
 so we can then we can not 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.710
 beat too much because otherwise 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:41.250
 we can also exceed the level and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:48.229
 out inside so let's go to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.229
 beat this way slightly 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:12.690
 so this way so by 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.260
 to color from all parts of the 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:28.190
 stencil therefore still important that it is 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:34.239
 little the color they are we risk of 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.239
 pass also keep inside 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:56.930
 critics the difference between here and not here 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.930
 so let's go and beat 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:19.140
 when we take them back we are the color 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.020
 too much color we go to beat date 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:40.350
 part so that if you download the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:43.350
 brush so then we do not 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:49.050
 really full because otherwise it comes a 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:53.040
 too much too obvious effect from that 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.760
 both a shaded effect also 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 the steering 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:11.780
 once you finished but us 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:15.020
 we raise everything and therefore this remains 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.020
 this drawing 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:26.480
 this design now we do it 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:29.340
 in a fillet below and then here flush 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.250
 and then possibly even one 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.070
 light turquoise sponge here inside 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.670
 steering so that this is 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.440
 just a completely different Greek 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:47.190
 and that it is precisely shaded 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.920
 aged as here as in these 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.400
 points here if they are too full I will 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.190
 I show with sandpaper 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.969
 light fades so that 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.879
 see right 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:04.369
 as I said the first dive here 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:06.699
 now let's move on to the let 's say 

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:06.699
 righini
