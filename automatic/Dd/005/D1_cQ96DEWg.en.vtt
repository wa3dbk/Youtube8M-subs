my week on two pages and even though it
is<00:01:15.509> clear<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.320> has<00:01:16.380> still<00:01:16.740> been<00:01:16.799> annoying<00:01:17.549> me

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and it was just in the way but I was

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
and it was just in the way but I was

still liking to use it because it was

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.749 
still liking to use it because it was
functional<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.369> gradually<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.579> just

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

couple<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> ideas<00:02:08.550> together<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.360> I've<00:02:09.509> come

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
couple of ideas together and I've come

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.199 
couple of ideas together and I've come
up<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.379> solution<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.489> think<00:02:11.940> you'll

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
up with a solution that I think you'll

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.250 
up with a solution that I think you'll
like<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> works

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
like and it works

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.179 
like and it works
at<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.890> moment<00:02:14.250> than<00:02:14.640> here<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.950> looks

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
at the moment than here it is it looks

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.530 
at the moment than here it is it looks
massive<00:02:17.909> compared<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.230> Franklin<00:02:20.129> Covey

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
massive compared to the Franklin Covey

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.569 
massive compared to the Franklin Covey
plastic<00:02:21.540> ruler<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.620> works<00:02:23.010> really<00:02:23.310> well

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
plastic ruler but it works really well

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.449 
plastic ruler but it works really well
and<00:02:24.299> what<00:02:25.140> I've<00:02:25.260> done<00:02:25.409> is<00:02:25.590> I've<00:02:25.739> taken<00:02:25.769> eighth

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
and what I've done is I've taken eighth

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.819 
and what I've done is I've taken eighth
an<00:02:26.790> old<00:02:27.000> folder<00:02:27.510> then<00:02:27.810> I'll<00:02:27.930> document<00:02:28.470> folder

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
an old folder then I'll document folder

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.009 
an old folder then I'll document folder
that's<00:02:29.040> quite<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.670> strong<00:02:30.120> plastic<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:30.959> not

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
that's quite a a strong plastic it's not

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.420 
that's quite a a strong plastic it's not
flimsy<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:32.040> did<00:02:33.030> experiment<00:02:33.870> with<00:02:34.430> laminating

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
flimsy I did experiment with laminating

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.970 
flimsy I did experiment with laminating
pouches<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.180> tried<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.780> use<00:02:37.409> that<00:02:37.650> type<00:02:37.860> of

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
pouches and tried to use that type of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.830 
pouches and tried to use that type of
plastic<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.610> was<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:39.000> little<00:02:39.269> bit<00:02:39.420> too

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
plastic but it was just a little bit too

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.170 
plastic but it was just a little bit too
thin<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:41.069> found<00:02:41.430> one<00:02:41.609> that<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:41.970> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
thin so I found one that was just a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.300 
thin so I found one that was just a
little<00:02:42.569> bit<00:02:42.780> more<00:02:43.019> rigid<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.069> good<00:02:44.280> thing

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
little bit more rigid but the good thing

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.960 
little bit more rigid but the good thing
is<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.810> see-through<00:02:46.650> okay<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
is it is see-through okay this is a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.190 
is it is see-through okay this is a
slide<00:02:49.370> translucent<00:02:50.370> look<00:02:50.549> but<00:02:51.450> now<00:02:51.959> here's

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
slide translucent look but now here's

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.440 
slide translucent look but now here's
how<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.470> works<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.400> actually<00:02:53.579> put<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.269> the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
how it works so I actually put it on the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.490 
how it works so I actually put it on the
day<00:02:54.629> before

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
day before

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.490 
day before
let's<00:02:55.889> open<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.629> greens<00:02:58.700> place<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.909> in<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.290> it's

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
let's open up greens place it in so it's

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.440 
let's open up greens place it in so it's
actually<00:03:01.680> going<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.280> at<00:03:02.400> my<00:03:02.549> page<00:03:02.849> marker

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
actually going to be at my page marker

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.050 
actually going to be at my page marker
from<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.260> side<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.799> that's<00:03:05.190> how<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.519> will<00:03:05.849> use

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
from the side and that's how I will use

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.289 
from the side and that's how I will use
it<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.359> close<00:03:06.720> up<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:07.139> my<00:03:07.859> Filofax<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
it I close up my my Filofax like so and

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.229 
it I close up my my Filofax like so and
then<00:03:10.290> when<00:03:10.409> I<00:03:10.440> open<00:03:10.889> it<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.129> reach<00:03:11.430> up<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> top<00:03:12.000> I

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
then when I open it I reach up the top I

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.099 
then when I open it I reach up the top I
can<00:03:12.269> feel<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.930> straight<00:03:13.440> away<00:03:13.560> pull<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.639> open

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
can feel it straight away pull it open

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.039 
can feel it straight away pull it open
flap<00:03:16.109> goes<00:03:16.829> open<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.430> there<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.989> I've

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
flap goes open and there it is so I've

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.099 
flap goes open and there it is so I've
got<00:03:19.260> my<00:03:19.410> whole<00:03:19.650> week<00:03:19.949> on<00:03:20.129> two<00:03:20.370> pages<00:03:20.699> free<00:03:21.660> from

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
got my whole week on two pages free from

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.069 
got my whole week on two pages free from
all<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.530> clutter<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.190> ruler<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:24.660> also

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
all the clutter of the ruler I have also

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.099 
all the clutter of the ruler I have also
adapted<00:03:25.949> it<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.519> you've<00:03:27.239> made<00:03:27.389> it<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.599> mini

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
adapted it and you've made it a mini

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.240 
adapted it and you've made it a mini
dashboard<00:03:28.769> on<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.040> side<00:03:29.250> here<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:31.129> when<00:03:32.129> I'm

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
dashboard on the side here and when I'm

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.240 
dashboard on the side here and when I'm
finished<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.760> closed<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.389> marker<00:03:33.750> up<00:03:33.900> over<00:03:34.889> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
finished I closed the marker up over the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.780 
finished I closed the marker up over the
page<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:36.299> close<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.049> diary<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:38.220> it's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
page and close the diary up and it's

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.939 
page and close the diary up and it's
really<00:03:38.940> working<00:03:39.480> for<00:03:39.510> me<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.500> show<00:03:40.859> you

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
really working for me so just show you

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.140 
really working for me so just show you
once<00:03:41.129> more<00:03:41.400> again<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:43.650> if<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:44.730> do<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.940> fast

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
once more again and if I do it fast

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.089 
once more again and if I do it fast
enough<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.569> actually<00:03:45.660> flips<00:03:46.230> open<00:03:46.530> itself<00:03:46.949> so

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
enough it actually flips open itself so

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.530 
enough it actually flips open itself so
I've<00:03:47.190> got<00:03:47.340> posts<00:03:47.669> at<00:03:47.760> notes<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.209> things<00:03:48.389> like

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
I've got posts at notes and things like

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.000 
I've got posts at notes and things like
that<00:03:48.599> so<00:03:48.870> let's<00:03:49.169> have<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.349> quick<00:03:49.500> look<00:03:49.769> at<00:03:49.859> what

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
that so let's have a quick look at what

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.430 
that so let's have a quick look at what
it<00:03:50.129> is<00:03:50.329> it's<00:03:51.329> actually<00:03:51.540> two<00:03:52.019> pieces<00:03:52.669> which<00:03:53.669> I

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
it is it's actually two pieces which I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.250 
it is it's actually two pieces which I
have<00:03:55.440> taped<00:03:55.709> together<00:03:55.889> with<00:03:56.220> some<00:03:56.430> washi<00:03:56.669> tape

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
have taped together with some washi tape

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.069 
have taped together with some washi tape
so<00:03:58.260> I've<00:03:58.409> cut<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:58.919> a<00:03:59.419> larger<00:04:00.419> than<00:04:00.599> the

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
so I've cut out just a larger than the

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.129 
so I've cut out just a larger than the
page<00:04:01.500> size<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:03.180> holes<00:04:03.389> that<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:03.690> punched

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
page size and the holes that I punched

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.729 
page size and the holes that I punched
in<00:04:05.120> fit<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:06.419> that<00:04:06.599> it<00:04:06.690> goes<00:04:06.930> flush<00:04:07.409> with<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
in fit so that it goes flush with the

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.280 
in fit so that it goes flush with the
bottom<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.190> page<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.790> sticks<00:04:09.510> out<00:04:09.720> around

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
bottom of the page and sticks out around

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.369

two eighths of an inch

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.150 
two eighths of an inch
so<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.310> then<00:04:28.030> I've<00:04:28.150> got<00:04:28.270> another<00:04:28.300> strip<00:04:28.870> of

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
so and then I've got another strip of

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.180 
so and then I've got another strip of
plastic<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.699> same<00:04:30.910> plastic<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.720> then<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:32.800> have

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
plastic the same plastic and then I have

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.080 
plastic the same plastic and then I have
why<00:04:34.030> she<00:04:34.090> taped<00:04:34.449> on<00:04:34.630> both<00:04:34.870> sides<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:36.940> I've

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
why she taped on both sides and I've

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.360 
why she taped on both sides and I've
used<00:04:37.270> one<00:04:37.479> that<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.770> what<00:04:38.979> I<00:04:39.010> did<00:04:39.220> was

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
used one that I like and what I did was

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.280 
used one that I like and what I did was
when<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.610> put<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.880> washi<00:04:40.090> tape<00:04:40.449> on<00:04:40.630> I<00:04:40.840> actually

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
when I put the washi tape on I actually

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.730 
when I put the washi tape on I actually
folded<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.919> over<00:04:42.010> first<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:43.330> taped<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.870> closed

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
folded it over first and taped it closed

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.250 
folded it over first and taped it closed
and<00:04:45.190> then<00:04:45.250> opened<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.120> then<00:04:46.720> place<00:04:46.960> the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
and then opened it and then place the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.830 
and then opened it and then place the
second<00:04:47.650> piece<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.460> tape<00:04:48.639> there<00:04:49.060> so<00:04:49.330> it

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
second piece of tape there so it

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.900 
second piece of tape there so it
actually<00:04:50.020> acts<00:04:50.410> as<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.770> hinge<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.460> it's<00:04:51.639> quite

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
actually acts as a hinge and it's quite

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.840 
actually acts as a hinge and it's quite
loose<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.889> you<00:04:53.889> need<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.490> don't<00:04:54.699> want

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
loose and you need that you don't want

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.930 
loose and you need that you don't want
it<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.120> be<00:04:55.300> bending<00:04:56.110> over<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.470> paper<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:57.729> I'll

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
it to be bending over the paper so I'll

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.360 
it to be bending over the paper so I'll
just<00:04:58.090> set<00:04:58.240> this<00:04:58.479> back<00:04:58.750> into<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.290> qualitex<00:05:00.220> to

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
just set this back into the qualitex to

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.480 
just set this back into the qualitex to
show<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:00.610> one<00:05:00.790> more<00:05:00.820> time<00:05:01.200> now<00:05:02.200> prior<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.070> this

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
show you one more time now prior to this

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.460 
show you one more time now prior to this
version<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:04.180> did<00:05:04.479> actually<00:05:04.990> do<00:05:05.200> another

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
version I did actually do another

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.260 
version I did actually do another
mock-up<00:05:05.979> which<00:05:06.100> I'll<00:05:06.280> show<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:06.490> in<00:05:06.639> a<00:05:06.790> second

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
mock-up which I'll show you in a second

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.000 
mock-up which I'll show you in a second
because<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:07.960> was<00:05:08.110> toying<00:05:08.380> with<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.680> idea<00:05:08.710> of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
because I was toying with the idea of

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.180 
because I was toying with the idea of
maybe<00:05:09.370> using<00:05:09.729> some<00:05:09.970> card<00:05:10.600> stock<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.290> there

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
maybe using some card stock that there

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.629 
maybe using some card stock that there
is<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:13.229> divider<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:14.770> wants<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.250> show<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.520> this

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
is my divider so wants to show you this

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.520 
is my divider so wants to show you this
one<00:05:15.880> here<00:05:15.910> this<00:05:16.240> was<00:05:16.419> sort<00:05:16.600> of<00:05:16.660> mark<00:05:16.960> one<00:05:17.260> which

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
one here this was sort of mark one which

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.890 
one here this was sort of mark one which
I<00:05:17.800> tried<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> bit<00:05:18.760> creative<00:05:19.030> with<00:05:19.419> some

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
I tried to be a bit creative with some

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.390 
I tried to be a bit creative with some
card<00:05:20.169> stock<00:05:20.289> because<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.770> wanted<00:05:21.039> some<00:05:21.160> color

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
card stock because I wanted some color

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.550 
card stock because I wanted some color
but<00:05:21.669> I<00:05:21.880> really<00:05:22.419> did<00:05:22.570> realize<00:05:22.900> I<00:05:23.139> don't<00:05:23.200> need

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
but I really did realize I don't need

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.189 
but I really did realize I don't need
anything<00:05:23.860> but<00:05:24.190> just<00:05:24.430> clear<00:05:24.669> plastic<00:05:24.940> so<00:05:25.810> and

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
anything but just clear plastic so and

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.050 
anything but just clear plastic so and
this<00:05:26.260> was<00:05:26.470> also<00:05:26.650> laminating<00:05:27.370> pouch<00:05:27.610> because<00:05:27.970> I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
this was also laminating pouch because I

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.360 
this was also laminating pouch because I
wanted<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.479> clear<00:05:28.750> look<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.800> when<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:29.949> had<00:05:30.340> a

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
wanted the clear look and when I had a

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.830 
wanted the clear look and when I had a
look<00:05:30.520> through<00:05:30.700> my<00:05:30.789> book<00:05:31.120> store<00:05:31.389> and<00:05:31.419> I<00:05:31.660> could

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
look through my book store and I could

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.270 
look through my book store and I could
see<00:05:32.050> that<00:05:32.200> this<00:05:32.350> actually<00:05:32.860> was<00:05:33.010> see-through

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
see that this actually was see-through

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.659
