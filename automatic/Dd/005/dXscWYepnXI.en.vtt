as an MPP resilience now why hit is six
point<00:04:31.070> twelve<00:04:31.310> percent<00:04:31.610> six<00:04:32.240> percent<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.690> the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
point twelve percent six percent is the

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.680 
point twelve percent six percent is the
cap<00:04:33.310> so<00:04:34.310> you'd<00:04:34.490> want<00:04:34.670> to<00:04:34.730> be<00:04:34.820> just<00:04:35.240> over<00:04:35.510> six

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
cap so you'd want to be just over six

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.780 
cap so you'd want to be just over six
percent<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.230> get<00:04:36.650> closer<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:37.070> six<00:04:37.460> percent<00:04:37.700> as

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
percent and get closer to six percent as

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.710 
percent and get closer to six percent as
much<00:04:37.910> as<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.120> can<00:04:38.560> ppl<00:04:39.560> is<00:04:39.950> 37.8<00:04:40.940> three<00:04:41.240> that's

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
much as you can ppl is 37.8 three that's

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.540 
much as you can ppl is 37.8 three that's
basically<00:04:42.230> everything<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.250> more<00:04:43.400> highly

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
basically everything so the more highly

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.830

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
of people in calories the more damage

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.220 
of people in calories the more damage
