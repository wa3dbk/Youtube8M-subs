00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.730
 a donkey 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.180
 brushes 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.930
 and further that of course does not sound very logical on a hockey field but that is 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.500
 it does come as one of the good ones in a good player of kampong and 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.639
 of orange 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.519
 and maybe she also has some artistic talent because that is because it is 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.990
 in the family he is capable the classic has been around for 15 years and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.359
 poverty that paints the entire house is full of it 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.759
 chances after exercise also a bit of painting that we will see 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 paint a cool day in a bass 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.420
 is a pair of glasses 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.430
 pirates 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.940
 along with it I don't think I chose them 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.930
 I will do my best to make something beautiful out of it, it is a bit artistic 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.039
 family in the branch talents familia 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.639
 yes that's right making it harder to paint but I don't think I am 

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.410
 that the interest received 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.940
 must be what we are going to auction for charity 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 yes i'm going to the forum i'm going now 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.250
 what was going on 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.720
 it's an ideal 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.750
 I ended up saying I will not say no to see that internal 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.830
 procedures are not very good at being good at 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.310
 it the media i have 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 I also sat a classical ballet myself 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.109
 it is not so good at 9 so no we will go and you too 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.320
 it became one anyway 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
 that was going to take her 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.629
 leak 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.949
 per barrel at that location 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.999
 you seem like I think camps deal with 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.259
 really one of the nicest club in the Netherlands and depth no 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.569
 maybe sports that you have and that everyone also hits me in it 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.919
 clubhouse and 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.849
 yes i just love cozy atmosphere chi is always someone 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.719
 and 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.719
 at 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.039
 in terms of game level 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:43.519
 in a broadcast 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.119
 this year not really started well but last year it went well 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.969
 only have ad 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.449
 yes they just say good middle engine 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.459
 have been last year 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.410
 and i hope that this year you can get as if but now it doesn't go 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.709
 so good but who knows maybe there will also be a duel from a young team 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:07.059
 I think we just put it together with you in the world then I still have 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.959
 will be fine 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.689
 for your personal ambition and you say that you are already in the middle bracket 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.149
 a good start 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.389
 I see that at some point there is a cas change to another team 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.520
 emmen 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.599
 not on yet 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
 veenendaal for myself it is important if i have them 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.449
 very long many play a lot to do that I have a lot of balls on the hook 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.259
 and now at kampong if you of course get one of the better bands then you get too 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:33.579
 verbally and then we find everyone a tenth on I think it's quite for me 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.009
 It is important to learn to cook to learn to take responsibility 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.149
 and 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.229
 make choices and I think that here even more man can learn when for example 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:46.000
 when den bos opened in amsterdam you know where a lot of good players 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.629
 play 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.489
 Are you one of the good nirway players really? 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.069
 the together with the show of the post and animal can make the difference i think i 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.069
 here even more in that respect 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.419
 previously was the fastest 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.659
 yes i do tell dreams about getting a nasty game in the olympic 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:27.930
 play play 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.710
 that pays 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.780
 I was clear actually it was actually nea they are still so much 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.870
 to win more things and to do what has not been played and 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.069
 yes people already the denominator 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.270
 yes i played free chemical world yesterday, that is to say they also play 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.819
 and of course inside 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.689
 and small left this week after more than two are much nicer ending with eric 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:56.969
 dea 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.120
 a nice one for the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120
 yes i have really easy viewers but just take a look 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.550
 if we just don't get a mega bid here or we don't know 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:21.699
 I would say 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.089
 bake the camera and or the people that they should mainly bid for 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.509
 these people 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.740
 I hope you have included a nice pot here I know that not all the best 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.449
 and the talent is certainly not to be seen here but it is for a good cause 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:38.729
 open jessica 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.729
 that fit nicely 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.530
 do you want to bid then it can of course not just send mail to the 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.629
 editors the field six point also so the editors have the right to TV 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:50.889
 yes and the highest bidder 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.430
 of course you get that beautiful painting at home 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.089
 Who would not want that
