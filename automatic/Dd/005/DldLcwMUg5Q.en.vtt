I've already reviewed heat up it's a
nice<00:00:48.210> figure<00:00:50.420> not<00:00:51.420> much<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.929> to<00:00:52.050> him<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829

and here's a these nice gun arms which

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
and here's a these nice gun arms which
are<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.280> always<00:00:59.640> thought<00:00:59.879> were<00:00:59.999> cool<00:01:00.149> just

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
are pretty always thought were cool just

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.939 
are pretty always thought were cool just
have<00:01:01.159> these<00:01:02.159> four<00:01:03.030> arms<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.559> don't<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
have these four arms but they don't do I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.290 
have these four arms but they don't do I
think<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> own<00:01:05.489> fighter

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
think the own fighter

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.990 
think the own fighter
they<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.729> paint

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
they just that are there the paint

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
they just that are there the paint
applications<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:10.049> nice<00:01:10.200> it's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
applications are pretty nice it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.069 
applications are pretty nice it's
accurate<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.520> green<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.630> bit<00:01:12.780> too

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
accurate the green is a little bit too

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.270 
accurate the green is a little bit too
green<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.340> wishes<00:01:14.520> maybe<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> little<00:01:15.780> bit<00:01:15.979> of<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
green it wishes maybe a little bit of a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.090 
green it wishes maybe a little bit of a
lighter<00:01:17.610> green<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.200> think<00:01:19.649> they<00:01:19.829> mainly

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
lighter green but I think they mainly

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
lighter green but I think they mainly
use<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.579> for<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.939> ultimate<00:01:21.360> form<00:01:21.600> which

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
use that for it is ultimate form which

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.819 
use that for it is ultimate form which
I'll<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.380> bit<00:01:24.110> some<00:01:25.110> kibble<00:01:25.590> on

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
I'll get to a little bit some kibble on

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.120 
I'll get to a little bit some kibble on
back<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:28.460> just<00:01:29.460> hang<00:01:29.880> around<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:31.130> but

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
back or just hang around there but

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.969 
back or just hang around there but
that's<00:01:32.640> about<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.869> form<00:01:34.289> so<00:01:34.799> let's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that's about it for this form so let's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's about it for this form so let's
convert<00:01:35.610> them<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> ultimate<00:01:36.930> form<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
convert them to ultimate form which is a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.249 
convert them to ultimate form which is a
wrap<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.899> just<00:01:40.049> gonna

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
