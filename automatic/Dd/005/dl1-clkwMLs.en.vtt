I<00:00:00.130> got<00:00:01.030> a<00:00:01.060> quick<00:00:01.300> question<00:00:01.330> here<00:00:01.900> Kristen<00:00:02.439> Zach

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:02.620 
I got a quick question here Kristen Zach

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.850 
I got a quick question here Kristen Zach
asked<00:00:02.949> me<00:00:03.040> how<00:00:03.280> do<00:00:03.340> I<00:00:03.459> teach<00:00:03.550> myself<00:00:03.879> I<00:00:04.860> taught

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:05.860 
asked me how do I teach myself I taught

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.669 
asked me how do I teach myself I taught
myself<00:00:05.980> by<00:00:06.370> the<00:00:06.760> basics<00:00:07.150> and<00:00:07.499> working<00:00:08.499> my<00:00:08.650> way

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:08.679 
myself by the basics and working my way

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.610 
myself by the basics and working my way
up<00:00:09.089> when<00:00:10.089> you<00:00:10.209> do<00:00:10.389> the<00:00:10.509> basics<00:00:10.959> like<00:00:11.289> I<00:00:11.440> say

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
up when you do the basics like I say

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.109 
up when you do the basics like I say
everyone<00:00:12.249> Maivia<00:00:12.639> we're<00:00:12.879> talking<00:00:13.059> about

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:13.119 
everyone Maivia we're talking about

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.759 
everyone Maivia we're talking about
breaking<00:00:13.570> down<00:00:13.599> techniques<00:00:14.200> you<00:00:14.410> start<00:00:14.650> from

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
breaking down techniques you start from

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.980 
breaking down techniques you start from
the<00:00:14.860> basics<00:00:15.339> in<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:15.730> next<00:00:16.059> level<00:00:16.359> up<00:00:16.599> always

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
the basics in the next level up always

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.929 
the basics in the next level up always
is<00:00:17.140> that<00:00:17.710> much<00:00:17.859> easier<00:00:18.189> to<00:00:18.279> get<00:00:18.369> down<00:00:18.550> because

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
is that much easier to get down because

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.790 
is that much easier to get down because
you're<00:00:19.150> used<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.689> basic<00:00:20.050> movements<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.619> it

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
you're used to the basic movements of it

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.660 
you're used to the basic movements of it
all<00:00:21.340> right<00:00:21.490> um<00:00:22.109> what<00:00:23.109> I<00:00:23.140> do<00:00:23.259> is<00:00:23.710> I<00:00:24.339> break<00:00:24.640> a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
all right um what I do is I break a

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.480 
all right um what I do is I break a
technique<00:00:25.150> down<00:00:25.420> if<00:00:26.259> there's<00:00:26.800> a<00:00:26.890> video<00:00:27.039> I<00:00:27.220> saw

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
technique down if there's a video I saw

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.279 
technique down if there's a video I saw
of<00:00:27.669> it<00:00:27.849> i<00:00:28.000> watch<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.330> video<00:00:28.630> over<00:00:28.929> and<00:00:28.960> over<00:00:29.109> i

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
now watch Lucy look with where betray

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.380 
now watch Lucy look with where betray
that<00:00:36.190> has<00:00:36.399> turning<00:00:36.789> if<00:00:36.910> they<00:00:37.030> look<00:00:37.210> at<00:00:37.300> the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
that has turning if they look at the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.610 
that has turning if they look at the
ground<00:00:37.539> while<00:00:37.750> they're<00:00:37.899> coming<00:00:38.170> down<00:00:38.379> the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
ground while they're coming down the

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.319 
ground while they're coming down the
spot<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.010> stuff<00:00:39.160> like<00:00:39.280> that<00:00:39.340> what<00:00:40.180> they<00:00:40.270> do

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
spot and stuff like that what they do

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.880 
spot and stuff like that what they do
with<00:00:40.510> this<00:00:40.600> with<00:00:40.809> certain<00:00:41.170> legs<00:00:41.350> so<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:41.590> you

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
with this with certain legs so that you

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.160 
with this with certain legs so that you
watch<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.250> hips<00:00:42.460> watch<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.910> upper<00:00:43.180> body<00:00:43.390> you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
watch the hips watch the upper body you

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.830 
watch the hips watch the upper body you
break<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.469> technique<00:00:44.980> down<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:45.820> then<00:00:46.629> walk

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
break a technique down and then walk

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.250 
break a technique down and then walk
yourself<00:00:47.230> through<00:00:47.260> it<00:00:47.469> step-by-step<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:49.539> it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
yourself through it step-by-step if it's

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.360 
yourself through it step-by-step if it's
a<00:00:50.320> move<00:00:50.469> that<00:00:50.500> involves<00:00:50.980> going<00:00:51.100> in<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.340> air

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
a move that involves going in the air

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.299 
a move that involves going in the air
it's<00:00:51.820> hard<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.149> do<00:00:52.269> it<00:00:52.390> slowly<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.739> we<00:00:54.190> are

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
it's hard to do it slowly because we are

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.009 
it's hard to do it slowly because we are
in<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.579> air<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.910> you<00:00:55.090> can't<00:00:55.300> exactly<00:00:55.629> flow

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
in the air and you can't exactly flow

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.689 
in the air and you can't exactly flow
you<00:00:56.410> can<00:00:56.710> move<00:00:56.829> that<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.100> all<00:00:57.219> like<00:00:57.430> stay<00:00:57.579> on

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
you can move that of all like stay on

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:58.529 
you can move that of all like stay on
the<00:00:57.760> ground<00:00:57.910> stuff<00:00:58.179> like<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.329> like<00:00:58.420> a

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
the ground stuff like that like a

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.520 
the ground stuff like that like a
cartwheel<00:00:59.160> you<00:01:00.160> can<00:01:00.309> walk<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.579> red<00:01:00.699> slowly<00:01:01.030> oh

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
cartwheel you can walk the red slowly oh

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.979 
cartwheel you can walk the red slowly oh
sorry<00:01:02.530> just<00:01:02.829> got<00:01:02.920> off<00:01:03.039> work<00:01:03.190> um<00:01:03.839> 744<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:04.869> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
morning anyways uh I broke them down

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.380 
morning anyways uh I broke them down
I'll<00:01:10.810> walk<00:01:10.990> myself<00:01:11.020> through<00:01:11.530> them<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:13.210> try

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
I'll walk myself through them and I try

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.700 
I'll walk myself through them and I try
not<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:13.600> ask<00:01:13.780> other<00:01:14.020> people<00:01:14.259> of<00:01:14.350> questions

not to ask other people of questions
that<00:01:15.070> i<00:01:15.100> can<00:01:15.280> answer<00:01:15.460> myself<00:01:15.670> or<00:01:16.060> eventually

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
that i can answer myself or eventually

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.450 
that i can answer myself or eventually
figure<00:01:16.780> out<00:01:16.840> myself<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.610> uh<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:20.369> used<00:01:21.369> to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
figure out myself like I uh I used to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.830 
figure out myself like I uh I used to
ask<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.790> know<00:01:21.880> how<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.090> do<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.299> double<00:01:22.509> leg<00:01:22.750> and

shoulders first you know he leads with
his<00:01:35.259> hip<00:01:35.500> he<00:01:35.979> leads<00:01:36.220> with<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.520> legacy<00:01:36.880> that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
his hip he leads with this legacy that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.789 
his hip he leads with this legacy that
he<00:01:37.420> uses<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.869> lake<00:01:38.110> for<00:01:38.290> momentum<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.710> swing

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
he uses the lake for momentum to swing

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.060 
he uses the lake for momentum to swing
around<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.250> know<00:01:39.340> on<00:01:39.460> this<00:01:39.670> kick<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:39.970> know<00:01:40.210> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
around you know on this kick you know so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.959 
around you know on this kick you know so
you'll<00:01:42.070> figure<00:01:42.250> out<00:01:42.340> different<00:01:42.520> techniques

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
you'll figure out different techniques

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.219 
you'll figure out different techniques
and<00:01:43.149> just<00:01:43.270> play<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> little<00:01:43.930> bit<00:01:44.079> you<00:01:44.170> know

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
and just play with a little bit you know

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.630 
and just play with a little bit you know
start<00:01:44.469> with<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.619> basic<00:01:44.979> movements<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:45.520> then

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
start with the basic movements and then

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.179 
start with the basic movements and then
work<00:01:45.909> your<00:01:45.939> way<00:01:46.119> up<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.439> taught<00:01:47.649> myself<00:01:47.770> in

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
work your way up but I taught myself in

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.830 
work your way up but I taught myself in
a<00:01:48.310> nutshell<00:01:48.490> by<00:01:49.000> breaking<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.479> techniques

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
a nutshell by breaking the techniques

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.560 
a nutshell by breaking the techniques
down<00:01:50.020> walking<00:01:50.890> myself<00:01:51.340> thrown<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.880> then

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
down walking myself thrown and then

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.420 
down walking myself thrown and then
going<00:01:52.719> for<00:01:53.049> him<00:01:53.140> if<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:53.619> didn't<00:01:53.950> make<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.100> i

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
going for him if I didn't make it i

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.130 
going for him if I didn't make it i
would<00:01:54.640> pay<00:01:54.790> attention<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.180> what<00:01:55.360> i<00:01:55.390> did<00:01:55.689> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
would pay attention to what i did the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.550 
would pay attention to what i did the
last<00:01:56.350> time<00:01:56.820> while<00:01:57.820> i'm<00:01:57.939> doing<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.329> and<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:59.320> fix

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
last time while i'm doing it and it fix

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.160 
last time while i'm doing it and it fix
what<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.740> did<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:01.119> know<00:02:01.180> walk<00:02:01.450> myself<00:02:01.600> doing<00:02:01.869> a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
what I did you know walk myself doing a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.480 
what I did you know walk myself doing a
video<00:02:02.320> stuff<00:02:02.590> like<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.920> don't<00:02:03.310> just

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
video stuff like that and don't just

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.039 
video stuff like that and don't just
give<00:02:03.700> up<00:02:03.729> once<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.689> don't<00:02:04.869> make<00:02:04.990> it

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
give up once you if you don't make it

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.260 
give up once you if you don't make it
the<00:02:05.229> first<00:02:05.439> couple<00:02:05.590> times<00:02:05.829> keep<00:02:06.670> at<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:06.880> stay

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
the first couple times keep at it stay

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.520 
the first couple times keep at it stay
consistent<00:02:07.869> or<00:02:08.020> you're<00:02:08.140> not<00:02:08.260> going<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> get

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
consistent or you're not going to get

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.840 
consistent or you're not going to get
that<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.800> me<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.130> won't<00:02:09.340> get<00:02:09.490> anywhere<00:02:09.730> close

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
that to me you won't get anywhere close

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.180 
that to me you won't get anywhere close
to<00:02:10.150> getting<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.660> technique<00:02:10.960> down<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:12.100> by

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
to getting a technique down just by

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.860 
to getting a technique down just by
trying<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.460> three<00:02:12.640> times<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.060> then<00:02:13.150> giving<00:02:13.450> up

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
trying it three times and then giving up

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.360 
trying it three times and then giving up
figure<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.709> out<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:15.099> where<00:02:15.280> that's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
figure it out that's where that's

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.360 
figure it out that's where that's
usually<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:15.909> I<00:02:15.970> try<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.150> do<00:02:17.129> hopefully<00:02:18.129> that

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
usually what I try to do hopefully that

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.369 
usually what I try to do hopefully that
helped<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> guys<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:19.239> know<00:02:19.330> that's<00:02:19.629> how<00:02:20.110> this

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
helped you guys you know that's how this

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.289 
helped you guys you know that's how this
best<00:02:20.590> way<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.769> teach<00:02:20.830> yourself<00:02:21.190> kind<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.030> think

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
best way to teach yourself kind of think

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.580 
best way to teach yourself kind of think
of<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:22.569> if<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.900> were<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.110> one<00:02:23.230> person<00:02:23.349> who

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
of it as if you were the one person who

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.320 
of it as if you were the one person who
thought<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.769> up<00:02:23.950> you've<00:02:24.760> never<00:02:24.909> seen<00:02:25.030> anybody

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
thought it up you've never seen anybody

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.640 
thought it up you've never seen anybody
doing<00:02:25.690> something<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.290> just<00:02:26.319> thought<00:02:26.560> in

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
doing something that you just thought in

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.440 
doing something that you just thought in
your<00:02:26.709> head<00:02:26.769> you're<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.010> okay<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.580> wonder<00:02:28.390> if

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
your head you're like okay I wonder if

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.119 
your head you're like okay I wonder if
this<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.659> possible<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.500> walk<00:02:29.739> yourself

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
this is possible so you walk yourself

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.199 
this is possible so you walk yourself
through<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.519> see<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:30.879> can<00:02:30.970> do<00:02:31.030> that's

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
through it and see if you can do that's

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.300 
through it and see if you can do that's
how<00:02:31.299> that's<00:02:31.510> what<00:02:31.569> moves<00:02:31.780> are<00:02:31.900> created<00:02:32.379> that's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
how that's what moves are created that's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.949 
how that's what moves are created that's
how<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.579> moves<00:02:33.909> are<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.390> basically<00:02:34.720> like

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
how the moves are like basically like

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.509 
how the moves are like basically like
stick<00:02:35.260> save<00:02:35.590> consistent<00:02:36.129> with<00:02:36.220> something

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
stick save consistent with something

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.580 
stick save consistent with something
like<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.700> inward<00:02:36.970> from<00:02:37.180> above<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.569> long<00:02:37.750> now

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
like the inward from above the long now

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.899 
like the inward from above the long now
that<00:02:38.620> didn't<00:02:38.950> just<00:02:38.980> happen<00:02:39.099> naturally<00:02:39.400> they

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
that didn't just happen naturally they

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.130 
that didn't just happen naturally they
thought<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.239> doing<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:40.629> wanted<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:40.989> as

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
thought of doing like I wanted this as

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.509 
thought of doing like I wanted this as
possible<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.739> they<00:02:41.829> walk<00:02:42.040> themselves<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.489> a

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
possible so they walk themselves to a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.979 
possible so they walk themselves to a
couple<00:02:42.790> times<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.090> hey<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.569> possible

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
couple times and hey this is possible

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.460 
couple times and hey this is possible
let's<00:02:44.379> go<00:02:44.560> for<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:44.890> BAM<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.299> know

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
let's go for it BAM what do you know

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.369 
let's go for it BAM what do you know
hopefully<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.680> helps<00:02:47.950> um<00:02:48.569> that's<00:02:49.569> will<00:02:50.260> have

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
hopefully that helps um that's will have

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.720 
hopefully that helps um that's will have
to<00:02:50.440> say<00:02:50.560> about<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.250> guys<00:02:51.370> every<00:02:51.640> other

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
to say about that you guys every other

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970 
to say about that you guys every other
corner<00:02:51.940> store<00:02:52.239> them<00:02:52.329> in<00:02:52.390> there<00:02:52.629> a<00:02:52.810> good<00:02:53.799> time

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
corner store them in there a good time

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.430 
corner store them in there a good time
stay<00:02:54.400> positive
