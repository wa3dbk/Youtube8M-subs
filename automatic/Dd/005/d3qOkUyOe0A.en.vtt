 will need the mirror cut to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.229
 those thin slices of zucchini 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.200
 long greens that we will cut into slices 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.300
 thin and chicken you can use both 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.190
 roof that the shards or even the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.410
 turkey wanting what you prefer 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.539
 Meanwhile I prepared an oil 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.670
 I put spice inside one of them 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.289
 cup of oil with many many spices 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.020
 that you put them more good and not 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.030
 let them rest and prepare 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.920
 zucchini with mandolin i this which 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.020
 Uranus you are a fair kind of person to whom I have it 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.539
 already used in short, the slicing for a long time 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.399
 I recommend you make life saving 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.200
 after you have sliced ​​all the 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.179
 waste do not throw them we put them from 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.729
 part those that are the most notes 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.410
 beautiful and longer you put them in one 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.959
 bowl arranged like I'm doing 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.390
 see and take from a brush in 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.819
 I silicone this here and brush it 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.610
 all of these zucchini because yes 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.740
 they will feed with oil and will be seasoned 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.690
 well with all the spices we have 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.619
 put it if you want to reach too 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.780
 some chilli or pepper and I put it 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.050
 also a bit of paprika because me 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.730
 in short, it seemed nice as a thing and then 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.040
 apples color even a little bit for not 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.739
 leave them as they are 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.120
 a point the zucchini usually anyway 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.590
 the spices really choose you 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.030
 put cv 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.520
 garlic powder 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.470
 or put the garlic in there but it was there 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.350
 oil that puts all prepared 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.880
 zucchini and spices are prepared on 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.540
 chicken on one side 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.920
 this oil is then very well seasoned 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.750
 leave these beautiful courgettes 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.640
 to flavor we take our voice 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.260
 chicken thigh in use the thigh because 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.940
 I had these first and therefore not 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.040
 they sent to count the roofs but it comes 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.560
 even softer and roll in my opinion 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.239
 you can even get the spindles that maybe it is 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.780
 so chicken that maybe a little more 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.340
 easy to clean and anyway why 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.050
 then I would have made the broth can have it 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.150
 in short, I show you what 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.250
 remains to not throw anything anyway 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.290
 it was because I had these then uses 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.519
 these will show you how to use 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.650
 also chicken hiroshi that maybe 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.330
 they cost less than the parks and in any case yes 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.819
 find more on offer and works on a 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.310
 family heel cut attention to 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.430
 fingers of slices trying to be 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.100
 as thin as possible and it does n't matter 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.319
 how big they are because 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.660
 we will also use high waste only 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.360
 nervetti and tenerumi because it is not that 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.130
 they are very nice and then we take one 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.230
 pan I slightly wet the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.790
 baking paper to make it adhere well to the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.430
 pan and then we brush it then 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.140
 our spicy and yummy oil that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.299
 will still make it all more 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.610
 tasty and fragrant especially because 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.640
 oven will smell a mess when you do 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.060
 will warm the pan we warm the 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.670
 that is, we put it at 180 static 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.130
 especially while we prepare our own 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.150
 rolls and those here we take one 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.910
 puff pastry we take one 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.190
 speck puff a slice of speck e 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.079
 we cut off the excess that comes out too much 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.019
 because they are careful to scorch 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.510
 put another slice of zucchini e 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.760
 then we put the chicken and break it too 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.880
 the meat because the only fact remains 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.280
 a little more sciapa and I recommend it in 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.039
 this oil you can now add a 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.530
 pinch of salt so as to salt also 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.690
 a little bit the chicken that I am 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.700
 it remains chapeau so we count well 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.070
 this little piece of chicken even if little 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.539
 and roll it all up that pizzino the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.800
 little piece of mirrors we have cut 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.800
 we don't throw it away 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.669
 put in the middle of the zucchini so 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.440
 that without cleaning even those a 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.900
 pinch of salt anyway to put 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.789
 even before in oil for pumpkins and 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.699
 zucchini but not too much because otherwise 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.680
 they hunt an app so we go to 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.970
 make all these goods wrapped here 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.770
 I show you how alternatively e 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.780
 we can use precisely the remains of the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.879
 chicken that is small pieces that are a bit 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.949
 small numbers we throw them out here you throw 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.169
 nothing i'm going well save over i am 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.620
 Marche but also because with these 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.930
 times of crisis in short, if you use it 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.569
 we all logically stop them with one 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.490
 toothpick how I show you and we are 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.009
 ready we have already done 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.530
 I'm really the stratospheric speed 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.120
 I have not even brushed over it 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.889
 oil because as you have seen we have it 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.810
 with di di prima therefore there is need of ri 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.340
 dirty everything again because 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.990
 we have brushed it above and below the 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.719
 tank top and puts them in that container 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.000
 of plastic and brushing the various layers 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:33.400
 one above the other they hate each other even above 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.690
 and then under it they are very soft 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.190
 precisely because we have beautiful nourished it 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.740
 then nothing after twenty minutes 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.930
 about put it on and put it on 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.310
 so ventilated if even 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.889
 steamy 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.810
 the glass is for you because I was doing it 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.419
 like the passage the broth just like me 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.009
 I said with chicken waste and while 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.099
 everything is cooked I'll show you a 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.440

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.029
 share what i do so i have 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.819
 made the chicken broth and the chicken with 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.229
 the courgettes, in short, everything 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.360
 what I advanced from times to 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.370
 I started brusquely a little in the bread 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.400
 oven since it is turned on in the dinner is 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.860
 ready, in short, nothing then greeting and o 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.310

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.530

 very good my hands 12 every day 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.670
