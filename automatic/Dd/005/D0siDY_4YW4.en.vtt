one's got an extra gear that extra one I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.240 
one's got an extra gear that extra one I
told<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.570> about<00:03:06.630> six<00:03:07.410> speeds<00:03:07.709> but<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.040> top

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
told you about six speeds but the top

told you about six speeds but the top
one<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.640> called<00:03:08.880> ee4<00:03:09.840> economy<00:03:10.320> perhaps<00:03:10.500> but<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
one is called ee4 economy perhaps but it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.220 
one is called ee4 economy perhaps but it
is<00:03:11.489> an<00:03:11.610> overdrive<00:03:12.150> gear<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.840> that's<00:03:13.050> all

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
is an overdrive gear so that's all

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.130 
is an overdrive gear so that's all
displayed<00:03:13.650> there<00:03:14.000> also<00:03:15.000> displayed<00:03:15.420> all<00:03:15.780> these

that's<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.050> it's<00:03:19.200> got<00:03:19.320> switchable<00:03:19.800> ABS

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
that's because it's got switchable ABS

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
and it's no surprise that adventurers

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.570 
and it's no surprise that adventurers
use<00:04:12.150> these<00:04:12.420> for<00:04:12.690> long<00:04:12.810> distance<00:04:13.290> work<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.770> now

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
use these for long distance work and now

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.130 
use these for long distance work and now

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
with the 6-speed gearbox

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.890 
with the 6-speed gearbox
you've<00:04:16.440> even<00:04:16.650> got<00:04:16.800> that<00:04:17.130> overdrive<00:04:17.780> whip<00:04:18.780> it

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
you've even got that overdrive whip it

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.270 
you've even got that overdrive whip it
up<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.170> speed<00:04:19.440> through<00:04:19.740> the<00:04:19.830> first<00:04:20.040> mile

up to speed through the first mile

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.430 
up to speed through the first mile
ratios<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:21.239> drop<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.600> into<00:04:21.750> six<00:04:22.110> and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
ratios and then drop it into six and

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.770 
ratios and then drop it into six and
watch<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.920> world<00:04:23.100> go<00:04:23.190> by<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:24.240> will<00:04:24.390> take<00:04:24.600> you

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
watch the world go by it will take you

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.290 
watch the world go by it will take you
up<00:04:24.930> beyond<00:04:25.260> 110<00:04:26.010> if<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.220> want<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.610> but<00:04:27.090> that's

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
up beyond 110 if you want to but that's

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.230 
up beyond 110 if you want to but that's
missing<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.900> point

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.540 

so<00:04:30.780> what<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.199> point<00:04:31.380> well<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.039> is<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.310> big

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
so what is the point well it is a big

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.520 
so what is the point well it is a big
job<00:04:32.819> purpose<00:04:33.330> bike<00:04:33.509> they<00:04:33.810> are<00:04:33.960> incredibly

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
job purpose bike they are incredibly

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.170 
job purpose bike they are incredibly
