00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.560
 hello has ever happened to us that going 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.180
 to the bathroom at night or going home to 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.000
 a few hours that you do not want to wake up 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.889
 nobody when you open the door this emits 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.010
 a noise that seems to come from the underworld 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.869
 from the depths of hell and 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 start making an infinite noise that does not 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.850
 never ends something like 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.820
 that until it stops completely not 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.180
 stop making noise even just before 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.610
 to finish makes more noise than ever because 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.680
 that is usually due to two reasons and we are going 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.530
 to explain how to get rid of that annoying 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.239
 noise 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.890
 One of the reasons is usually the 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.309
 hinges and is that the hinges of the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.890
 doors accumulate dirt dust rice 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.780
 of the friction are released as auditory in 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.750
 order and that is staying within the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.790
 hinge what it does is that there is more 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.640
 friction of the one who owes and hence the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.960
 noise to end that noise in case 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.860
 that it is the hinge what is 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.869
 causing there are these bottles of 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.720
 liquid in graz ante or sell it as 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.390
 well the three in one typical of all the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.310
 life or multi-purpose liquid that is called 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.750
 we apply this to the hinge 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.210
 we raise the door a little bit without 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.490
 disarm the we throw it in the center of 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.840
 the hinge with care that you do not 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.729
 Leave the oil too much because this 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.680
 It stains the floor a lot especially if there 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.420
 only two wooden 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.060
 and with this in each of the hinges 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.800
 that make up the door because we would end 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.440
 with that problem assuming it's the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.710
 hinge what is generating the noise 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.840
 another possible other possible reason for the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
 that a door makes noise is that just 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.390
 below where it is skimming with the ground to 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.790
 along the door 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.950
 what would be the width of the door has 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.560
 something that has been trapped and that 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.360
 they can be mud stones that we carry in 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.140
 shoes small objects for example 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.240
 the tail of a pear for saying something that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.110
 you can get stuck between the door 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.440
 and the floor and every time we open it goes 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.180
 dragging and generating that noise that 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.340
 happens on ceramic floors for example 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.560
 if a stone gets trapped and 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.650
 We open the door by dragging that stone 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.790
 besides scratching the floor it makes a noise 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.330
 which is that you feel like hitting him 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 kicked something then to get that out 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.800
 what is causing the noise is enough 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.440
 with catching something finite but that can 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.300
 serve to push and pull out whatever 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.070
 that is generating that noise so 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.560
 simple as that but is 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.890
 generating the noise is too close 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.370
 and it does not come out pushing because we would have to 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.050
 fit the door pull it out and scrape it up 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.490
 that the bottom part until the base 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.010
 be totally smooth 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.750
 that would be basically the two reasons 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.350
 main ones by which normally a 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.610
 door squeaks and makes noise like that of 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.460
 apply this is very simple because 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.110
 it's just tightening and good to put 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.880
 something under the door until 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.980
 get out what is generating the noise 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.870
 we'll see 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.690
 a tip this is also very simple 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.110
 but how to apply this type of oil to 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.110
 the hinges 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.340
 ok this is a hinge a door 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.620
 from a closet and to pour the oil 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.420
 we simply bring the adapter that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.480
 it has to be very long it is very comfortable what 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.450
 We place on the hinge board 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.180
 we put a paper underneath so that he 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.010
 that on not exhaust the ground and we throw a 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.659
 bit 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.659
 it does not take much a little 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.069
 we let him get right there in the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.840
 center of the hinge 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.180
 and when we're sure that it's not going 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.219
 to drip to avoid staining the floor because 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.409
 already would be this we apply it to the three 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.549
 hinges or those with the door and 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.549
 problem solved
