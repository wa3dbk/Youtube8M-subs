those<00:01:05.220> settings<00:01:05.580> within<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> effect<00:01:06.270> change

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
those settings within the effect change

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
those settings within the effect change

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
we're going to add an adjustment layer

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
we're going to add an adjustment layer
and<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.759> selected<00:01:30.150> let's<00:01:30.600> head<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and with that selected let's head up to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.240

effect distort and turbulent displace

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.690 
effect distort and turbulent displace
we'll<00:01:35.250> set<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> amount<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> 90<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.950> size<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.430> 4

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
we'll set the amount to 90 the size to 4

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.740 
we'll set the amount to 90 the size to 4
and<00:01:39.770> hit<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> stopwatch<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.430> evolution<00:01:42.119> pet

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and hit the stopwatch on evolution pet

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.569 
and hit the stopwatch on evolution pet
to<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.899> enter<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> comp<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> throw<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.430> an

to the enter the comp and throw on an

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.730 
to the enter the comp and throw on an
evolution<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.240> 1<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.290> will<00:01:46.470> give<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
evolution of 1 this will give it a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.870 
evolution of 1 this will give it a
little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> movement<00:01:47.340> throughout<00:01:47.759> the

little bit of movement throughout the
animation<00:01:48.590> after<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.740> we'll<00:01:50.130> head<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.460> up

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
animation after that we'll head back up

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.480 
animation after that we'll head back up
