00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 now to continue talking about numbers in 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.300
 this english lesson I want to talk to you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 of a subject that causes a lot of confusion 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.540
 especially in the press in 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.640
 journalists when you talk about economics 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.800
 and numbers and it's because there are some 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.710
 countable numbers very large numbers 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.529
 in English and in Spanish there are words that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.470
 they are almost identical for numbers that are 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.949
 well different from each other let's look for 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 example here 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.040
 here we have 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.010
 and 90 this in Spanish is called a thousand 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.530
 million billion 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.839
 in English however it's called one 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.839
 billion one billion 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.980
 here we have 10,000 million 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.950
 we have 10 zeros 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:06.940
 ten billion 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.940
 in English this is called having billions 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.590
 here we have 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.420
 one billion 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.670
 that is, we have 11 zeros 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.810
 100,000 million in Spanish but in 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.950
 English and this is called one hundred 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.070
 milion or would it be 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.079
 would sound like 100 billion but there 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.619
 three difference zeros in reality 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:39.939
 these are 100 billion here we have 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.560
 12 zeros is space in Spanish is a 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.729
 billion 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.670
 but in English this is now called one 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.270
 trillion 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.900
 however, it is not a trillion in Spanish 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.690
 a billion in Spanish is a meeting in 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.340
 English 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.130
 when we talk about 12 zeros 12 zeros in 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.170
 Spanish is called one of lyon in English 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.170
 it's called one kidney 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.890
 one union-pro one trillion in Spanish 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.630
 here we are talking about 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.260
 15 zeros 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260
 11 and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.730
 15 zeros 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:35.390
 a trillion but in English when we have 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:38.810
 15 zeros this is called equal 4 and lion 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.130
 well that is for large numbers 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.510
 after the million 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.710
 there are three zeroes of difference no less 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.000
 between 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.880
 the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.900
 between the name of the numbers in English 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.019
 and in Spanish 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.360
 and this is interesting because the 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.489
 economic news that occurs in the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.790
 daily or many are also transmitted 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.790
 times on television 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.610
 sometimes they are translated from English and 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.540
 in the journalists 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:18.500
 when they translate for example they talk about the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.250
 pp and or talk about economic gains 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.700
 their economic losses and translate one 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:30.490
 billion translate it as a trillion without 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.490
 But I should tell you one billion 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:39.040
 when you talk about the pp and some 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.140
 countries for example in usa the pp of usa 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.810
 we are talking about red jones 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.690
 we are talking about trading here 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.750
 However, if we translate it in Spanish, 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.060
 we can say trillions we have to 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.230
 talk about billions 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.230
 that's why it's always important 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.400
 understand well this distinction of how you 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.319
 they say the numbers in Spanish and English 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.749
 especially when they are very numbers 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.760
 great clear that these figures these 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:09.680
 numbers are so big that they do not 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.499
 we manage in our daily life but 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.469
 when we speak or when we are reading 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:18.650
 about international economics or 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:23.169
 large-scale national economy these 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.169
 they are numbers that we see constantly 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.260
 another interesting thing to see for 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.300
 distinguish between English and Spanish 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.300
 is the numerical entry 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.720
 as you will see here 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.210
 when we have several zeros 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.680
 so as not to have to count the zeros one 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.670
 two three four five every three zeros 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.670
 we put a point 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.460
 in this way we only count groups 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.580
 of zeros for example we have several 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.130
 groups of zeros divided by points 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.500
 true separated by points then 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.539
 we only count 1 2 3 4 5 and already 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.870
 we know we are talking about a 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.210
 trillion here we see that there is a group of 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.830
 zeros with a point and one we do not know that 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.969
 this is 1000 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.489
 and the coma and what we 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.999
 mark that after the coma we have the 

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:23.999
 decimals 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.129
 however in English the notation 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.129
 numerical is the other way around 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.880
 the zeros are grouped 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:39.390
 they are separated with commas as you will see here 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.390
 and decimals 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.820
 they are pointed after a point like 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.660
 you will see here 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.140
 so that 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.420
 English and Spanish are opposite in 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.790
 regarding this type of numerical notation 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:01.620
 of the score for example here 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:03.510
 We have 2 million 350 thousand 100 50 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.870
 in English we have 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:13.140
 with / with the commas we have 2 million 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:16.530
 350 thousand 100 points 50 and that's why you can 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.340
 see that in the calculators and in the 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.449
 computers 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.449
 when we want 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.099
 click on the button for decimals 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:31.650
 this button is usually a point and not a 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:34.490
 It was true and that is why 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.490
 do 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:41.729
 having been designed the calculator in 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:47.449
 a country in the USA for example 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.449
 the point is taken as the decimal
