00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.130 
do that and once you do this it should
work<00:02:58.950> then<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.210> double<00:03:00.450> check<00:03:00.690> here<00:03:00.720> to

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
work then you just double check here to

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.300 
work then you just double check here to
make<00:03:01.470> sure<00:03:01.500> I'm<00:03:01.740> not<00:03:01.800> forgetting<00:03:02.130> anything

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310
