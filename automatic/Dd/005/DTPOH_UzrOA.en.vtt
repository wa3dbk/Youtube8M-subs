we'll make our way this is basically

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.130 
we'll make our way this is basically
just<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.709> way<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.549> compass<00:03:08.079> is<00:03:09.079> telling

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
just the way that the compass is telling

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.259 
just the way that the compass is telling
us<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.709> go<00:03:09.829> no<00:03:10.459> nothing<00:03:10.940> out<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.239> ordinary

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
us to go no nothing out of the ordinary

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.420 
us to go no nothing out of the ordinary
here<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.260> we're<00:03:12.769> gonna<00:03:12.890> make<00:03:13.100> our<00:03:13.280> way<00:03:13.310> up

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
here and we're gonna make our way up

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.830 
here and we're gonna make our way up
into<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.760> building<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.239> this<00:03:14.329> one<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.660> not

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
into the building and this one is not

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.720 
into the building and this one is not
miscible<00:03:15.260> it's<00:03:15.530> actually<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:15.890> family<00:03:16.489> looking

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.819 
miscible it's actually a family looking
out<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.910> window<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.600> it's<00:03:18.079> part<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.470> part

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
out a window and it's part of the part

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.069 
out a window and it's part of the part
of<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:18.950> main<00:03:19.100> story<00:03:19.579> so<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.359> cannot<00:03:20.780> miss

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
of the main story so you cannot miss

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.189 
of the main story so you cannot miss
this<00:03:21.260> one<00:03:21.609> and<00:03:22.609> I<00:03:23.390> would<00:03:23.540> imagine<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.959> think<00:03:24.139> you

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
this one and I would imagine I think you

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.930 
this one and I would imagine I think you
have<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.410> get<00:03:24.530> them<00:03:24.650> all<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:24.949> one<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.160> didn't

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
have to get them all in one I didn't

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.310 
have to get them all in one I didn't
test<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.269> one<00:03:26.419> way<00:03:26.570> or<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.780> other<00:03:26.810> like<00:03:26.959> if<00:03:27.230> you

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
test it one way or the other like if you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.720 
test it one way or the other like if you
can<00:03:27.470> get<00:03:27.650> three<00:03:28.070> or<00:03:28.160> four<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.430> them<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.609> then

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
can get three or four of them and then

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.020 
can get three or four of them and then
come

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
come

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.610 
come
