00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
exceptionally strong is the fact that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
exceptionally strong is the fact that
not<00:01:23.250> only<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.820> he<00:01:23.850> played<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> poke<00:01:24.600> champion

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020

not only is he played as a poke champion
in<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> very<00:01:25.409> strong<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.369> his

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in a very strong one at that because his

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
in a very strong one at that because his
Q<00:01:27.090> range<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> actually<00:01:27.780> higher<00:01:28.110> than<00:01:28.140> Zara's<00:01:28.920> Q

right<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.590> absolutely<00:01:32.009> absurd<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:33.060> long

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
right here is absolutely absurd as long

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
beautiful thing is the fact that as the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.420 
beautiful thing is the fact that as the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
to kill than you would think while also

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.210 
to kill than you would think while also
being<00:02:06.240> very<00:02:06.509> strong<00:02:06.899> he's<00:02:07.259> very<00:02:07.350> easy<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.950> farm

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
being very strong he's very easy to farm

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740

what<00:02:08.399> he<00:02:08.489> has<00:02:08.670> good<00:02:08.970> poke<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.569> only

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
what he has good poke but the only

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.910 
what he has good poke but the only
problem<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> fact<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.679> he

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
problem is the fact that he

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.920 
problem is the fact that he
is<00:02:11.009> somewhat<00:02:11.520> easy<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.970> gain<00:02:12.150> another<00:02:12.599> very

the queue as often as possible oh and by
the<00:02:49.890> way<00:02:50.040> here's<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.400> neat<00:02:50.610> little<00:02:50.730> trick<00:02:51.000> with

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the way here's a neat little trick with

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.030 
the way here's a neat little trick with
this<00:02:51.330> Q<00:02:51.660> as<00:02:51.810> you're<00:02:52.140> charging<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.560> q<00:02:52.860> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
this Q as you're charging the q it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.590 
this Q as you're charging the q it
doesn't<00:02:53.340> look<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.730> Q<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.000> actually<00:02:54.450> on

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
doesn't look like the Q is actually on

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
doesn't look like the Q is actually on
cooldown<00:02:54.989> but<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.890> cooldown<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.549> queue

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
cooldown but the cooldown of the queue

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
cooldown but the cooldown of the queue
starts<00:02:56.850> as<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.720> begin<00:02:58.019> charging<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.739> up<00:02:58.860> not

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
starts as you begin charging it up not

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.460 
starts as you begin charging it up not
as<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.610> fire<00:02:59.880> it<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.360> trick<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.780> use<00:03:00.930> your<00:03:01.200> Q

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
as you fire it so trick is to use your Q

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.930 
as you fire it so trick is to use your Q
charge<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.010> as<00:03:02.220> you're<00:03:02.370> out<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.549> range<00:03:02.790> of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
charge it up as you're out of range of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.610 
charge it up as you're out of range of
your<00:03:03.090> opponent<00:03:03.540> fire<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.080> near<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.290> last

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
your opponent fire it near the last

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
your opponent fire it near the last
second<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.190> charge<00:03:05.489> time<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.940> queue

second of the charge time of the queue

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.059 
second of the charge time of the queue
and<00:03:06.390> then<00:03:06.600> as<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:07.019> finally<00:03:07.350> do<00:03:07.470> fiery<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.250 
at the beginning of the video guys this
is<00:03:29.910> truly<00:03:30.269> something<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.720> really<00:03:31.019> have<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
is truly something you really have to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.810

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
you need the mana but it takes a bit

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.300 
you need the mana but it takes a bit
longer<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:49.170> ramp<00:03:49.380> up<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.859> at<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.070> end<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
longer to ramp up and at the end of the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.550 
longer to ramp up and at the end of the
day<00:03:50.459> he<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.790> still<00:03:51.090> mainly<00:03:51.420> physical<00:03:52.140> damage

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
day he is still mainly physical damage

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.140 
day he is still mainly physical damage
but<00:03:52.890> following<00:03:53.250> all<00:03:53.549> this<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.880> think<00:03:53.940> we<00:03:54.120> should

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
but following all this I think we should

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150 
but following all this I think we should
finally<00:03:54.660> go<00:03:54.780> into<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.109> most<00:03:55.350> important<00:03:55.920> part

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
finally go into the most important part

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.250 
finally go into the most important part
