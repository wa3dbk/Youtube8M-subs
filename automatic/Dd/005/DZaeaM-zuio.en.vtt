this flexco trimmer abrasive and an old
rod<00:00:15.830> blank<00:00:16.160> I<00:00:16.490> like<00:00:17.449> to<00:00:17.600> look<00:00:17.750> around<00:00:17.960> and<00:00:18.170> try

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
rod blank I like to look around and try

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.470 
rod blank I like to look around and try
to<00:00:18.350> find<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.770> blank<00:00:19.039> that<00:00:19.280> has<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:19.880> tip<00:00:20.060> broken

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
to find a blank that has the tip broken

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.200 
to find a blank that has the tip broken
off<00:00:20.660> of<00:00:20.689> it<00:00:21.050> now<00:00:21.080> carve<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:21.859> shave<00:00:22.130> remove<00:00:23.029> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.990 
guides and clean the rod up the best I
can<00:00:25.789> then<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:26.990> would<00:00:27.470> like<00:00:27.679> to<00:00:27.859> have<00:00:28.099> a<00:00:28.460> section

can then I would like to have a section

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.519 
can then I would like to have a section
of<00:00:29.119> blankets<00:00:29.539> about<00:00:29.660> three<00:00:30.050> or<00:00:30.109> four<00:00:30.320> feet

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
of blankets about three or four feet

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.050 
of blankets about three or four feet
long<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.210> preferably<00:00:32.210> with<00:00:32.330> a<00:00:32.480> slow<00:00:32.780> taper

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
long and preferably with a slow taper

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.790 
long and preferably with a slow taper
now<00:00:35.060> you've<00:00:35.300> got<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.600> find<00:00:35.630> a<00:00:36.110> solid<00:00:36.590> steel

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
now you've got to find a solid steel

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.500 
now you've got to find a solid steel
shank<00:00:37.130> that<00:00:37.340> you<00:00:37.550> can<00:00:37.640> glue<00:00:37.820> into<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.210> end<00:00:38.390> of

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
shank that you can glue into the end of

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.050 
shank that you can glue into the end of
that<00:00:38.630> rod<00:00:38.870> blank<00:00:39.220> now<00:00:40.220> we<00:00:40.310> have<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.730> build<00:00:40.910> up

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
that rod blank now we have to build up

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.700 
that rod blank now we have to build up
some<00:00:41.270> masking<00:00:41.660> tape<00:00:41.690> bushes<00:00:42.260> on<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.560> that

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
some masking tape bushes on to that

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.680 
some masking tape bushes on to that
steel<00:00:42.920> rod<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:43.520> we<00:00:43.640> get<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.820> good<00:00:44.030> tapered<00:00:44.480> fit

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
steel rod so we get a good tapered fit

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.600 
steel rod so we get a good tapered fit
into<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.080> end<00:00:45.200> of<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.380> blind<00:00:45.650> mix<00:00:46.340> up<00:00:46.520> a

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
into the end of the blind mix up a

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.910 
into the end of the blind mix up a
little<00:00:46.790> five-minute<00:00:47.060> epoxy<00:00:47.450> apply<00:00:48.440> it<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.770> the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
little five-minute epoxy apply it to the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.970 
little five-minute epoxy apply it to the
rod<00:00:49.400> slide<00:00:50.360> it<00:00:50.510> up<00:00:50.630> in<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.020> end<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.500> rod

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
rod slide it up in the end of the rod

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.520 
rod slide it up in the end of the rod
blank<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.610> now<00:00:52.670> we<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.780> something<00:00:54.080> to<00:00:54.350> hook

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
blank and now we have something to hook

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.700 
blank and now we have something to hook
our<00:00:54.710> drill<00:00:54.980> onto<00:00:55.450> next<00:00:56.450> we<00:00:56.690> apply<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.050> contact

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
our drill onto next we apply a contact

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.310 
our drill onto next we apply a contact
cement<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.340> our<00:00:58.430> reamer<00:00:58.850> abrasive<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.540> also

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320

cement to our reamer abrasive and also
to<00:01:00.530> our<00:01:00.560> rod<00:01:00.950> blank<00:01:01.250> it's<00:01:01.460> important<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.030> use

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
to our rod blank it's important to use

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.920 
to our rod blank it's important to use
solvent<00:01:02.840> based<00:01:02.960> contact<00:01:03.890> cement<00:01:04.750> you've<00:01:05.750> got

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
solvent based contact cement you've got

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.750 
solvent based contact cement you've got
to<00:01:06.020> let<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:06.290> dry<00:01:06.350> for<00:01:06.619> about<00:01:07.009> 15<00:01:07.520> or<00:01:07.640> 20

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
to let that dry for about 15 or 20

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.170 
to let that dry for about 15 or 20
minutes<00:01:08.890> for<00:01:09.890> all<00:01:10.010> my<00:01:10.220> Reimers<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.730> use<00:01:10.940> about

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
minutes for all my Reimers I use about

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.860 
minutes for all my Reimers I use about
an<00:01:11.330> 8<00:01:11.480> foot<00:01:11.720> piece<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.290> reamer<00:01:13.160> abrasive<00:01:13.730> and<00:01:13.940> I

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
an 8 foot piece of reamer abrasive and I

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.960 
an 8 foot piece of reamer abrasive and I
started<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.500> temp<00:01:15.770> working<00:01:16.430> my<00:01:16.550> way<00:01:16.580> down<00:01:16.910> to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
started the temp working my way down to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.810 
started the temp working my way down to
the<00:01:17.120> butt<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.720> rod<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:19.190> leave<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.580> little

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
the butt of the rod and I leave a little

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.300 
the butt of the rod and I leave a little
gap<00:01:20.060> in<00:01:20.120> between<00:01:20.510> my<00:01:20.960> wraps<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:22.010> kind<00:01:22.220> of

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
gap in between my wraps and that kind of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.690 
gap in between my wraps and that kind of
works<00:01:22.460> like<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:22.820> flew<00:01:23.090> on<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.270> drill<00:01:23.570> bit<00:01:24.700> finally

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
works like I flew on a drill bit finally

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.950 
works like I flew on a drill bit finally
we<00:01:25.790> got<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.120> add<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.300> little<00:01:26.780> extra
