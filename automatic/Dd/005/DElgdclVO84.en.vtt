to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> shanty<00:00:48.510> pass<00:00:48.899> you're<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> want

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
to the shanty pass you're going to want

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.319 
to the shanty pass you're going to want
to<00:00:50.280> buy<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.760> shanty<00:00:51.360> past<00:00:51.600> 45<00:00:52.469> GP<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.850> through<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
to buy a shanty past 45 GP go through it

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.279 
to buy a shanty past 45 GP go through it
and<00:00:54.739> then<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.879> 205<00:00:57.629> GP<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.109> your

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and then you want to have 205 GP in your

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.130 
and then you want to have 205 GP in your
inventory<00:00:58.760> bypass<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.690> come<00:01:00.930> through

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
inventory bypass and then come through

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.890 
inventory bypass and then come through
and<00:01:01.579> my<00:01:02.629> my<00:01:03.629> recommendation<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.739> use<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
and my my recommendation is use a

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.760 
and my my recommendation is use a
transportation<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> don't<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
transportation so you don't have to have

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.149 
transportation so you don't have to have
water<00:01:08.130> skins<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.790> inventory<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.159> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
water skins in your inventory and it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
water skins in your inventory and it
costs<00:01:11.460> 200<00:01:11.909> GP<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.020> want<00:01:13.229> um<00:01:14.450> travel<00:01:15.450> all

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
costs 200 GP and you want um travel all

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.910 
costs 200 GP and you want um travel all
the<00:01:15.780> way<00:01:15.810> over<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.140> bedded<00:01:17.780> bed<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.350> camp
