inches<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.680> an<00:02:28.830> 8-inch<00:02:29.310> dead<00:02:29.610> band<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
inches with an 8-inch dead band the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.990 
inches with an 8-inch dead band the
maximum<00:02:31.080> fill<00:02:31.350> height<00:02:31.680> would<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.190> 200

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
maximum fill height would be 200

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.740 
maximum fill height would be 200
87<00:02:33.570> inches<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.650> get<00:02:35.180> 287<00:02:36.180> inches<00:02:36.540> by

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
87 inches we get 287 inches by

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.560 
87 inches we get 287 inches by
subtracting<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.980> 8-inch<00:02:38.400> dead<00:02:38.670> ban<00:02:38.940> from<00:02:39.360> our

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
subtracting the 8-inch dead ban from our

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.290 
subtracting the 8-inch dead ban from our
total<00:02:39.960> sensor<00:02:40.440> range<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:41.300> 295<00:02:42.300> inches<00:02:44.300> so

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
total sensor range of 295 inches so

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.020 
total sensor range of 295 inches so
let's<00:02:45.510> put<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.960> all<00:02:46.170> together<00:02:46.550> first<00:02:47.550> we're

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
let's put this all together first we're

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.970 
let's put this all together first we're
going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.210> select<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.810> sensor<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.709> has<00:02:49.830> an

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
going to select a sensor that has an

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.580 
going to select a sensor that has an
appropriate<00:02:50.610> range<00:02:50.940> based<00:02:51.630> on<00:02:51.810> our<00:02:52.230> tank

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
appropriate range based on our tank

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.580 
appropriate range based on our tank
height<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.100> application<00:02:54.000> variables<00:02:54.590> second

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
height and application variables second

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.710 
height and application variables second
we're<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.310> input<00:02:56.490> our<00:02:56.940> tank<00:02:57.300> height<00:02:57.510> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
we're going to input our tank height and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.440 
we're going to input our tank height and
fill<00:02:58.080> height<00:02:58.320> set<00:02:58.680> points<00:02:59.190> which<00:02:59.760> will<00:02:59.970> span

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
fill height set points which will span

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.830 
fill height set points which will span
our<00:03:00.690> 4<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.080> 20<00:03:01.470> milliamp<00:03:01.980> output<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.840> third

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
our 4 to 20 milliamp output and third

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.060 
our 4 to 20 milliamp output and third
well<00:03:04.440> you're<00:03:05.190> done<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.540> simple<00:03:10.070> thanks
