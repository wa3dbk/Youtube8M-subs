00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.750
 they move away to covián unique pieces that these cases 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.660
 this time a few months ago we made a palmer arrangement I know that you 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.409
 inca 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.540
 they sing the boxes with food 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 me too 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.759
 and good when the donostiarras ma 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.459
 but you remember that it is not segmented we made some standing candles 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.980
 well now let's use 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.740
 the houses that we love 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.599
 Andean 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.279
 and those of the feet 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.739
 and a new element that we have not talked about 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.079
 are the vases with relatives or acquaintances of the family 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.460
 before abundance 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.150
 feel more business system is that this arrangement is already finished has a 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.420
 very father concept because he has 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.550
 this vase with seeds in what then as abundance 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.560
 this brake with something there are elbows and half feem wake 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.170
 and they take our sailing fights 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.400
 what we did in another segment of the chassis 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.520
 earth and fire the sand energy up is 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.140
 if you are a phenomenon to have a relationship in your house and that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.300
 surely it will cure your home much the regions 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.290
 the energy level is going to be very very father 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.330
 then we predicted we are going to work 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 so that he can soon make some rules in his house and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.400
 from here we have already sax a box of these in a very simple way 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.490
 you can do 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.390
 as fine as your budget here we have a mdf box no no 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.690
 it's nothing complicated 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.700
 has 30 for 30 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.590
 i'm going to put it I'll be in which both are much that if I eat 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.740
 yellowish 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.650
 there is practically no waiting to be deserved from acapulco 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.130
 it's really that I do not know which beach is 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.730
 nicki minaj 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 and well, the relationship 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.989
 efe 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.989
 as you will see here you already have the sand also illicit 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.209
 and we are going to start working 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.019
 with the flowers 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.889
 this show also created of families but in this case we put him abellán 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.819
 the jojoba clinics 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.950
 but everything exists in brown tones 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.680
 and in this case we put it more mixed 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.779
 here we have branches tending to fiscal stimuli 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.029
 We try bean beans I invite you to put what you have at home 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.599
 the important thing is that they are similar that mean the tip 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.409
 that's the important thing here we're going to put it different puts us in front 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.799
 because it is more veneer rite 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.919
 then let's put 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.349
 the vase a very simple vase 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.349
 with water 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:15.699
 i in this case we are going to put your hands to grind why 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.769
 I want to think that maybe you do not find the quartz says they are located 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.349
 in harmony support 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.050
 that's why there are those who want to say that you find 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.040
 ideally if it would be quartz but also to advance with very dignified sea 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.799
 because quartzes are not always found 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.059
 of important deficiencies with nation 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.679
 of the stones product of the earth from the bottom of the earth 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.409
 i the angel 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.339
 and then we're going to decorate it 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.990
 with these stones these stones where 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.990
 raised marble 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.629
 cristina is going to assume but here for you to make very father balance one 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.359
 great a girl 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.359
 just the other side a big one a girl 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.729
 and then you're going to assume I had the stone that we did before 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.580
 and how in this one we put quartz 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.719
 if we're going to put a couple of rooms over here 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.979
 because I'm thinking that it's better not to us in contrast cocktail without presence 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:17.699
 mind 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:23.860
 you want different projects as you'll see are two arrangements that look a lot like 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.520
 they are cousins 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.889
 They have different ingredients 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.680
 0 we are looking for the same 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 a combination of energies 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.800
 between the fire 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.900
 the girls 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.169
 so that your house is very father very culminated 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.969
 What if you have a new and different energy at home 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.099
