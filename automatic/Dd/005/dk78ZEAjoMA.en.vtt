00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.880 
these kind of unexpected and unplanned
moments<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.630> really<00:03:04.110> often<00:03:04.380> leave<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
moments that really often leave the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.500 
moments that really often leave the
guests<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.340> most<00:03:05.550> exhilarated<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.270> it's

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
guests the most exhilarated and it's

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:15.850 
guests the most exhilarated and it's
something<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:06.990> take<00:03:07.170> home<00:03:07.350> with<00:03:07.500> them

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.280 

so<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.220> where<00:03:17.690> expedition<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.870> extreme

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
so this is where expedition and extreme

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.920 
so this is where expedition and extreme
comfort<00:03:19.590> kind<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.430> meat<00:03:20.580> we<00:03:21.420> decided<00:03:21.900> that

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
comfort kind of meat we decided that

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.470 
comfort kind of meat we decided that
when<00:03:22.140> we<00:03:22.260> built<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.620> ship<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.880> concept

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
when we built the ship that the concept

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.940 
when we built the ship that the concept
of<00:03:24.569> expedition<00:03:25.170> being<00:03:25.500> out<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.800> world

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
of expedition being out in the world

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.949 
of expedition being out in the world
exploring<00:03:26.489> looking<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.599> these<00:03:27.750> great

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
exploring looking in all these great

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.290 
exploring looking in all these great
things<00:03:28.160> being<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> world's<00:03:29.730> wildest

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
things being in the world's wildest

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.600 
things being in the world's wildest
places<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.709> good<00:03:32.010> measure<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.310> comfort

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
places and a good measure of comfort

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.880 
places and a good measure of comfort
were<00:03:32.970> not<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.360> bad<00:03:33.599> combination<00:03:33.959> so<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:34.709> really

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
were not a bad combination so we really

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.470 
were not a bad combination so we really
endeavored<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.730> succeeded<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.300> make
