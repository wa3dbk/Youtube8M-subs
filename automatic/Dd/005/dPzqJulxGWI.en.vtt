know what it is though

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.859 
know what it is though
muscular<00:01:14.340> dystrophy<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
muscular dystrophy there are a lot of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.070 
muscular dystrophy there are a lot of
different<00:01:16.259> types<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.880> most<00:01:18.330> types<00:01:18.750> though

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
different types in and most types though

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.070 
different types in and most types though
it's<00:01:19.409> basically<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.460> weakens<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> muscles

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it's basically it weakens the muscles

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.429 
it's basically it weakens the muscles
gradually<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.780> my

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
gradually over time like but my

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.380 
gradually over time like but my
disability<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> doctors<00:01:26.850> told<00:01:27.060> me<00:01:27.240> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
disability the doctors told me it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
disability the doctors told me it's
basically<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:28.049> remission<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.680> guess<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.280> they

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
basically in remission I guess like they

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
basically in remission I guess like they
said<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> probably<00:01:29.970> won't<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.329> any<00:01:30.509> better<00:01:30.810> but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
said I probably won't get any better but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.020 
said I probably won't get any better but
I<00:01:31.680> probably<00:01:31.920> won't<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.310> any<00:01:32.520> worse<00:01:32.729> either

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I probably won't get any worse either

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.140 
I probably won't get any worse either
like<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:33.930> said<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.380> try<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:35.430> active<00:01:35.970> to
