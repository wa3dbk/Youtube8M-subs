00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.950
 I welcome all fans of the game on 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.130
 guitar 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.710
 as well as channel subscribers are not tot 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.390
 this video we will analyze 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 Meladze South Korean composer July 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.430
 we revive this sounds so lasagna 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 melodies can look here on this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.460
 video 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.919
 we will learn to disassemble it and 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.949
 standard system 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.629
 in the original, it sounds a tone higher then 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.489
 there is a capo on the second fret you 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.040
 will play with the original using those 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.420
 the same tablature c tablature here you can 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.589
 view or download 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.030
 here is this link that's how I said 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:49.760
 we will play with the standard system 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.949
 and so tune and go so i 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.839
 I will play slowly in difficult places 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.899
 I will stop and explain more 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.500
 pay close attention to 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.359
 fingering 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.879
 how i put my fingers and try 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.879
 repeat after me let's start 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.840
 repeat a second time 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.090
 then we will have a difficult place see 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.159
 let's analyze it here we are a friend 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.950
 at the same time 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.409
 third and sixth strings on the third fret 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:57.030
 with the little finger after that doing the slide 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.030
 on 4 contribution again 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.899
 I hope everything is clear to this point 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.119
 then we use the Hummer technique 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.580
 here 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.580
 i.e. hit the blow to the string 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.080
 cameron 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.390
 and repeat again all over again 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.510
 only here is the fourth open 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.510
 string 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.270
 such a complicated place let's break it down 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.270
 in detail 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.510
 here we use two methods Hummer 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.700
 he and pools then first hamar he hit on 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.690
 string and then containment same 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.830
 finger and little finger 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.830
 that is to say 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.120
 30 each 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:20.629
 then index fingers with 3 frets on 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.629
 2 slide life 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.070
 then Hammer again 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.519
 numbers 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.030
 here here again to the defense floor 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.650
 again 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
 Well 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.450
 right here let's get this place here now 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:17.170
 and 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:19.470
 that is, we extract the sound of the little finger two 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.470
 strings 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.610
 here is this place 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:57.590
 and make a slide to the second fret 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.590
 time we pull the fourth open string 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.750
 one more like 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.940
 and repeat 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:31.440
 for the third time we play the little finger with 3 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.440
 fret on 5 and back and in the end do 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 pilaf 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.760
 look again slowly game 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 repeat 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.930
 and finish the slides on 4 boards
