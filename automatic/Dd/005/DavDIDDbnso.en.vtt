design for computer which is called the
red<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> now<00:00:33.630> let's<00:00:33.930> start<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.290> machine

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
red one so now let's start the machine

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.319 
red one so now let's start the machine
and<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.940> hope<00:00:36.210> you'll<00:00:36.980> hear<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> noise<00:00:39.000> it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.860 

the<00:02:14.060> graphic<00:02:14.420> chip<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:17.390> right

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the graphic chip and here like right

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.600 
the graphic chip and here like right
there<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:20.260> AMCC<00:02:21.549> 440<00:02:22.659> system-on-chip<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:25.310> as

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
there the AMCC 440 system-on-chip and as

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.280 
there the AMCC 440 system-on-chip and as
you<00:02:26.000> can<00:02:26.150> see<00:02:26.439> both<00:02:27.439> chips<00:02:27.829> have<00:02:28.280> no<00:02:29.120> fan<00:02:29.450> so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you can see both chips have no fan so

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.960 
you can see both chips have no fan so
there<00:02:31.159> are<00:02:31.340> no<00:02:31.610> moving<00:02:32.299> parts<00:02:32.659> and<00:02:33.579> they<00:02:34.579> don't

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
there are no moving parts and they don't

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.940 
there are no moving parts and they don't
produce<00:02:35.120> any<00:02:35.720> sound<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.340> as<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.420> see<00:02:38.950> the
