00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.740 
have the swiveled ear cuffs here just
like<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> lowriders<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.910> swiveling

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
like the lowriders as well as swiveling

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.889

this<00:00:51.960> way<00:00:52.219> these<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.579> fold<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.149> upon<00:00:54.690> each

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
this way these do fold up upon each

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.479 
this way these do fold up upon each
other<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> makes<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.340> bit

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
other so it makes it a little bit

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
other so it makes it a little bit
smaller<00:00:56.850> easy<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.960> caring<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.710> like

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
a style kind of thing in my opinion

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.420 
a style kind of thing in my opinion
which<00:01:57.509> makes<00:01:57.719> these<00:01:57.899> great<00:01:58.439> they<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.130> come<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
which makes these great they do come in

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
which makes these great they do come in
different<00:01:59.579> styles<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
different styles as well you can have a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
different styles as well you can have a
Boba<00:02:01.770> Fett<00:02:01.979> i<00:02:02.009> believe<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
Boba Fett i believe you can have a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.990 
Boba Fett i believe you can have a
stormtrooper<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.950> cannot<00:02:05.280> these<00:02:05.520> obviously

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
stormtrooper you cannot these obviously

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.100 
stormtrooper you cannot these obviously
and<00:02:06.119> i<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.329> there's<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.509> more<00:02:06.840> not

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.510 
and i think there's one more not
entirely<00:02:07.409> sure<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.829> don't<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.340> look

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
