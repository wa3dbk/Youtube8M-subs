bottom<00:03:35.570> I'm<00:03:36.570> not<00:03:36.720> sure<00:03:36.900> what<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.140> one<00:03:37.320> was

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
bottom I'm not sure what this one was

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.990 
bottom I'm not sure what this one was
called<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.070> it's<00:03:38.190> basically<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.700> big

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
called but it's basically like a big

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.350 
called but it's basically like a big
trampoline<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:40.140> was<00:03:40.350> gigantic<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:42.269> was

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
trampoline it was gigantic and it was

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.660 
trampoline it was gigantic and it was
real<00:03:42.600> fun<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.840> bounce<00:03:43.019> on<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.709> they<00:03:44.310> told<00:03:44.549> you

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
real fun to bounce on and they told you

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
real fun to bounce on and they told you
not<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.150> flips

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
not to do flips

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.900 
not to do flips
I'm<00:03:45.989> sure<00:03:46.320> if<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.530> did<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.769> flip<00:03:47.070> there<00:03:47.790> would

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
I'm sure if you did a flip there would

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.060 
I'm sure if you did a flip there would
be<00:03:47.940> no<00:03:48.269> consequences<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.350> don't<00:03:49.799> think<00:03:49.950> they

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
be no consequences I don't think they

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.110 
be no consequences I don't think they
would<00:03:50.190> actually<00:03:50.370> kick<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.820> out<00:03:50.940> you'd

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
would actually kick you out you'd

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.539 
would actually kick you out you'd
probably<00:03:51.239> just<00:03:51.390> be<00:03:51.570> yelled<00:03:51.780> at<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:53.250> we<00:03:53.340> didn't

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
probably just be yelled at but we didn't

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.580 
probably just be yelled at but we didn't
risk<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.850> just<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:54.930> we<00:03:55.049> didn't<00:03:55.200> get<00:03:55.290> kicked<00:03:55.500> out

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
risk it just so we didn't get kicked out

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.250 
risk it just so we didn't get kicked out
just<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.400> case<00:03:56.750> but<00:03:57.750> if<00:03:57.840> you're<00:03:57.930> watching<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
just in case but if you're watching the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.870 
just in case but if you're watching the
leftist<00:03:58.620> go<00:03:58.799> up<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.010> guy<00:03:59.160> bounces<00:03:59.610> into<00:03:59.760> this

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
leftist go up this guy bounces into this

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.580 
leftist go up this guy bounces into this
girl<00:04:00.120> who's<00:04:00.269> filming<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:01.019> completely<00:04:01.320> knocks

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.940 

this<00:04:13.660> one's<00:04:13.840> called<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.110> bubble<00:04:14.260> bash<00:04:14.530> swing

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
this one's called the bubble bash swing

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.380 
this one's called the bubble bash swing
I<00:04:15.190> don't<00:04:15.370> know<00:04:15.460> why<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.730> was<00:04:15.880> called<00:04:16.120> the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
I don't know why it was called the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.479 
I don't know why it was called the
bubble<00:04:16.690> or<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.959> bash<00:04:17.380> because<00:04:17.980> neither<00:04:18.400> of

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
bubble or the bash because neither of

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.060 
bubble or the bash because neither of
those<00:04:18.640> things<00:04:18.700> happened<00:04:19.709> basically<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:21.010> a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
those things happened basically just a

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.820 
those things happened basically just a
big<00:04:21.250> giant<00:04:22.060> rope<00:04:22.630> swing<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.410> if<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.590> fell

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
big giant rope swing that if you fell

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.420 
big giant rope swing that if you fell
you<00:04:24.400> would<00:04:24.550> land<00:04:24.790> on<00:04:24.940> an<00:04:25.240> air<00:04:25.360> mattress<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:27.400> is

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
you would land on an air mattress it is

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.950 
you would land on an air mattress it is
one<00:04:27.670> of<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.820> harder<00:04:28.090> ones<00:04:28.270> if<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.540> don't<00:04:28.840> have

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
one of the harder ones if you don't have

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.510 
one of the harder ones if you don't have
the<00:04:29.050> strength<00:04:29.200> to<00:04:29.380> hold<00:04:29.470> yourself<00:04:29.590> up<00:04:29.920> or<00:04:30.340> if

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the strength to hold yourself up or if

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.790 
the strength to hold yourself up or if
you<00:04:30.610> don't<00:04:30.880> know<00:04:31.030> how<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.270> swing<00:04:32.140> on<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.260> rope<00:04:32.350> I

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
you don't know how to swing on a rope I

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.850 
you don't know how to swing on a rope I
obviously<00:04:33.760> have<00:04:34.270> very<00:04:34.780> skilled<00:04:35.590> rope

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
obviously have very skilled rope

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.190 
obviously have very skilled rope
swinging<00:04:36.240> skills<00:04:38.400> okay<00:04:39.400> this<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.670> sweeper

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
swinging skills okay this is a sweeper

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.150 
swinging skills okay this is a sweeper
this<00:04:41.200> one<00:04:41.320> was<00:04:41.440> cool<00:04:41.560> because<00:04:41.710> they<00:04:41.860> put<00:04:42.070> you

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
this one was cool because they put you

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.480 
this one was cool because they put you
inside<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.760> one<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.600> buildings<00:04:43.780> there<00:04:44.170> and

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
inside of one of the buildings there and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.920 
inside of one of the buildings there and
it<00:04:45.490> was<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.730> more<00:04:45.880> intimidating<00:04:46.420> one<00:04:46.600> because

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
it was the more intimidating one because

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.920 
it was the more intimidating one because
that<00:04:47.110> thing<00:04:47.380> was<00:04:47.950> swinging<00:04:48.400> very<00:04:48.640> fast<00:04:49.090> but<00:04:49.900> I

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
that thing was swinging very fast but I

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.110 
that thing was swinging very fast but I
quickly<00:04:50.200> realized<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:51.400> can<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.730> crawl

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
quickly realized you can just crawl

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.670 
quickly realized you can just crawl
underneath<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.900> after<00:04:53.140> watching<00:04:53.470> people

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
underneath it and after watching people

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.740 
underneath it and after watching people
crawl<00:04:53.920> underneath<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.550> was<00:04:54.850> like<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.360> am

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
crawl underneath it I was like I am

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.380 
crawl underneath it I was like I am
going<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.230> try<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.500> just<00:04:56.770> jump<00:04:57.100> over<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:57.790> it

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
going to try to just jump over it and it

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.290 
going to try to just jump over it and it
did<00:04:58.600> not<00:04:58.630> work<00:04:58.870> out<00:04:59.290> well<00:04:59.500> at<00:04:59.530> all<00:04:59.830> because<00:05:00.300> it

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
did not work out well at all because it

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.420 
did not work out well at all because it
obviously<00:05:01.450> just<00:05:01.840> throws<00:05:02.020> me<00:05:02.050> off<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.500> thing

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.940 

and<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:10.180> hurt<00:05:10.420> it<00:05:10.630> didn't<00:05:11.050> stop<00:05:11.260> rotating<00:05:11.560> that

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
and it hurt it didn't stop rotating that

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.440 
and it hurt it didn't stop rotating that
the<00:05:12.070> speed<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.370> was<00:05:12.430> rotating<00:05:13.000> there<00:05:13.240> was<00:05:13.330> no

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
the speed it was rotating there was no

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.050 
the speed it was rotating there was no
give<00:05:13.750> to<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.380> was<00:05:14.920> just<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.310> little<00:05:15.430> fly<00:05:15.760> that

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
give to it I was just a little fly that

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.810 
give to it I was just a little fly that
it<00:05:16.180> swatted<00:05:16.510> away<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:17.290> I<00:05:17.410> went<00:05:17.530> flying<00:05:17.830> but<00:05:18.490> I

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
it swatted away and I went flying but I

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.880 
it swatted away and I went flying but I
highly<00:05:19.660> suggest<00:05:19.960> just<00:05:20.440> jumping<00:05:20.740> up<00:05:20.830> and

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
highly suggest just jumping up and

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.410 
highly suggest just jumping up and
getting<00:05:21.130> hit<00:05:21.250> by<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.430> it<00:05:21.790> was<00:05:21.910> way<00:05:22.030> more<00:05:22.060> fun

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
getting hit by it it was way more fun

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.450 
getting hit by it it was way more fun
than<00:05:22.450> crawling<00:05:22.930> underneath<00:05:23.230> it<00:05:23.470> this<00:05:24.280> is

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
than crawling underneath it this is

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.130
