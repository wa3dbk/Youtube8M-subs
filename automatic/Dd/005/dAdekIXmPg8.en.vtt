00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
so I start from the center and work my

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.150 
so I start from the center and work my
way<00:02:10.060> down<00:02:10.450> one<00:02:10.720> side<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.319> then<00:02:11.590> work<00:02:11.799> my<00:02:11.830> way

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
way down one side and then work my way

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.559 
way down one side and then work my way
down<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.549> other<00:02:12.760> side

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
down the other side

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.539

you<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:14.019> do<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.260> however<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.799> like<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.250> just

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
you can do it however you like this just

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.880 
you can do it however you like this just
works<00:02:15.730> best<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.180> me<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.230> ghost<00:02:17.709> pine

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
works best for me now the ghost pine

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.460 
works best for me now the ghost pine
glue<00:02:18.190> does<00:02:18.549> go<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:18.940> white<00:02:19.180> smells<00:02:20.140> kind<00:02:20.410> of

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
glue does go on white smells kind of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.819 
glue does go on white smells kind of
like<00:02:20.530> Elmer's<00:02:20.980> glue<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.260> can<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.650> that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
like Elmer's glue and you can see that

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.080 
like Elmer's glue and you can see that
if<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.069> look<00:02:24.130> real<00:02:24.400> close<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.819> already

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
if you look real close it's already

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.089 
if you look real close it's already
starting<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.569> dry<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.319> dries<00:02:26.560> really<00:02:26.890> very

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
starting to dry it dries really very

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.370 
starting to dry it dries really very
quickly<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.750> kind<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:28.989> have<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.170> work

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
quickly so you kind of have to work

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.309 
quickly so you kind of have to work
quickly<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.760> once<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.150> clear<00:02:31.540> you're

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
quickly but once it is clear you're

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.270 
quickly but once it is clear you're
going<00:02:32.799> you're<00:02:33.220> good<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.579> go<00:02:33.610> ahead<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.329> apply

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
going you're good to go ahead and apply

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.699 
going you're good to go ahead and apply
the<00:02:36.280> proceeding<00:02:36.819> layers<00:02:37.349> now<00:02:38.349> I've<00:02:38.500> already

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
the proceeding layers now I've already

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.559 
the proceeding layers now I've already
done<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.190> time<00:02:39.489> you'll<00:02:40.209> want<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.540> a

total<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:41.079> four<00:02:41.410> times<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.459> make<00:02:42.640> sure<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
total of four times so make sure you

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.600 
total of four times so make sure you
repeat<00:02:43.390> three<00:02:43.840> times<00:02:44.140> after<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:45.099> initial

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
repeat three times after the initial

repeat three times after the initial
layer<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.870> make<00:02:47.079> sure<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.440> between<00:02:47.799> each

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
layer and make sure in between each

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.789 
layer and make sure in between each
layer<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.970> dries<00:02:49.329> once<00:02:50.200> you're<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.470> your

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
layer that it dries once you're on your

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.340 
layer that it dries once you're on your
fourth<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.489> final<00:02:52.090> layer<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.989> want<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.200> make

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.830 
sure it's good to dry and everything is
good<00:02:56.340> now<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> directions<00:02:58.359> say<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.720> you

need to wait seven minutes before you
attempt<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.600> apply<00:03:01.900> your<00:03:02.200> unit<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.280> a

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
attempt to apply your unit this is a

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.370 
attempt to apply your unit this is a
very<00:03:04.030> important<00:03:04.420> step<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.900> have<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.230> wait

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
very important step you have to wait

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.530 
very important step you have to wait
that<00:03:05.560> time<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:06.040> know<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.430> easy<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.760> get<00:03:06.970> antsy

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that time I know it's easy to get antsy

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.360 
that time I know it's easy to get antsy
but<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.230> meantime<00:03:08.440> while<00:03:09.069> you're<00:03:09.190> not

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
playing with your glue you should take

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.470 
playing with your glue you should take
out<00:03:11.230> your<00:03:11.410> unit<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.670> go<00:03:13.000> ahead<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.359> apply

you've<00:03:16.209> got<00:03:16.239> your<00:03:16.480> unit<00:03:16.930> ready<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.410> set<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.889> top

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
you've got your unit ready to set on top

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.099 
you've got your unit ready to set on top
of<00:03:18.340> your<00:03:18.519> head<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.269> seven<00:03:19.540> minutes<00:03:19.810> will<00:03:19.959> go

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
of your head the seven minutes will go

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.020 
of your head the seven minutes will go
by<00:03:20.290> in<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.500> breeze<00:03:20.709> if<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.099> make<00:03:21.250> yourself<00:03:21.430> busy

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
by in a breeze if you make yourself busy

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.839 
by in a breeze if you make yourself busy
so<00:03:22.569> what<00:03:23.019> I've<00:03:23.139> done<00:03:23.319> is<00:03:23.650> gone<00:03:23.799> ahead<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.639> take

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
so what I've done is gone ahead and take

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.150 
so what I've done is gone ahead and take
my<00:03:24.880> unit<00:03:25.420> I've<00:03:25.840> clicked<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.560> up<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.950> back

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
my unit I've clicked it up in the back

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.069 
my unit I've clicked it up in the back
and<00:03:27.549> I've<00:03:27.760> put<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> clips<00:03:28.420> all<00:03:28.660> around<00:03:28.959> the

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
and I've put the clips all around the

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.289 
and I've put the clips all around the
parameter<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.340> I<00:03:30.370> don't<00:03:30.609> get<00:03:30.760> any<00:03:30.910> glue

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
parameter just so I don't get any glue

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.900 
parameter just so I don't get any glue
into<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.750> hair<00:03:32.079> because<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.160> not<00:03:33.549> nice<00:03:33.880> to
