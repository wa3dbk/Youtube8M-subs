oh yeah but that's perfectly

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.920 
oh yeah but that's perfectly
understandable<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.830> same<00:01:43.010> way

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.560 

but<00:01:46.440> every<00:01:46.680> level<00:01:47.010> I<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.150> be<00:01:48.300> productive

but every level I want to be productive
I<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.230> working<00:01:49.530> slowly

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.020 

of<00:01:53.630> grinding<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.780> way

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
of grinding on way

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.600 
of grinding on way
you<00:01:56.119> can<00:01:56.510> spend<00:01:56.690> any<00:01:56.869> person

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
you can spend any person

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.490 
you can spend any person
well<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:57.940> look<00:01:58.180> up<00:01:58.360> over<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.810> payoff<00:01:59.350> at<00:01:59.470> the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
well you look up over the payoff at the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.680 
well you look up over the payoff at the
end<00:01:59.590> it<00:02:00.340> finally<00:02:00.550> did<00:02:00.850> resolve<00:02:01.210> itself<00:02:01.510> of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
end it finally did resolve itself of

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.810 
end it finally did resolve itself of
that<00:02:01.810> age<00:02:01.960> 58<00:02:02.470> page<00:02:02.740> spread<00:02:03.100> there's

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
that age 58 page spread there's

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.210 
that age 58 page spread there's
something<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.090> lose

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
something to lose

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.680 
something to lose
yeah<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.250> guess<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:07.210> was<00:02:07.330> very<00:02:07.360> quick

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
yeah I guess so that was very quick

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.050 
yeah I guess so that was very quick
issue<00:02:07.900> two<00:02:08.200> draws<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.649> one<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.700> fastest

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
issue two draws it one of the fastest

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.530 
issue two draws it one of the fastest
ones<00:02:10.270> do<00:02:11.050> it

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
ones do it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.720 
ones do it

these<00:03:02.400> big<00:03:02.819> titles<00:03:03.150> off<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.390> ground

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.600 

I<00:03:06.599> think<00:03:07.439> he's<00:03:07.530> got<00:03:07.709> farmer<00:03:08.069> without<00:03:08.340> within

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
I think he's got farmer without within

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.149 
I think he's got farmer without within
with<00:03:08.760> me<00:03:08.939> so<00:03:09.530> what<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.650> two<00:03:10.799> are<00:03:10.829> synonymous

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
with me so what you two are synonymous

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.459 
with me so what you two are synonymous
with<00:03:11.609> success<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.689> operative<00:03:13.200> course

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
with success of the operative course

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.330 
with success of the operative course
with

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
with

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:31.890 
with
for<00:03:15.300> now<00:03:15.480> being<00:03:15.720> memory<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.470> disgusting

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.740 

devoid<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.050> any<00:03:33.200> big<00:03:33.710> hits<00:03:34.190> really

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
devoid of any big hits really

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.390 
devoid of any big hits really
so<00:03:36.350> I<00:03:36.380> think<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.890> expectations

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.979 

we<00:03:41.670> did<00:03:41.819> better<00:03:41.970> than<00:03:42.209> out<00:03:42.360> listening<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
we did better than out listening to the

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.160 
we did better than out listening to the
occasion<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.709> great

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.570 

continues<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.410> rolls<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:48.890> fly<00:03:49.099> upward

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
continues and rolls as you fly upward

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.800 
continues and rolls as you fly upward
should<00:03:49.790> really<00:03:50.060> see<00:03:50.360> quite<00:03:50.569> a<00:03:50.629> lot<00:03:50.690> of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
should really see quite a lot of

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:58.229 
should really see quite a lot of
interesting<00:03:51.410> reaction

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.050

I<00:04:57.570> think<00:04:58.290> it's<00:04:58.410> probably<00:04:58.710> easier<00:04:59.220> than<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.670> was

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
I think it's probably easier than it was

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.910 
I think it's probably easier than it was
because<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.570> internets<00:05:00.960> then<00:05:01.260> in<00:05:01.440> my<00:05:01.590> space

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
because the internets then in my space

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.220 
because the internets then in my space
like<00:05:02.580> all<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.120> stuff<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.450> can<00:05:03.870> won't<00:05:03.990> work
