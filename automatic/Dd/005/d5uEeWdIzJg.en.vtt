00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello my name is salvatore I am 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.840
 home sports coach and I you 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.210
 presented the theme how did 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.639
 after a session so a session is 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.650
 composed of three phases we have the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.240
 warm-up phase 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.199
 the body of the session or there we go 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.560
 place the specificity of the session 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.630
 endurance or speed and at the end we 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.429
 have the basis of stretching that we in 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 see immediately in running 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.270
 we mainly solicit 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.790
 muscles following therefore the calf the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.640
 ischios the back of the thigh the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.610
 quadriceps in front of the thigh and the facts 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.320
 it's then the upper body is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.160
 totally gainer during our race to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.309
 foot to balance the stride he is 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.899
 important to pull all his muscles that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.199
 we asked before 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:04.049
 so the calves the stretching of the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.670
 calves therefore to stretch the calf 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.330
 which is located on the back of my leg 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.030
 at the bottom we put the heel on the ground 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.280
 let's bend the bust slightly towards 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.700
 forward we place ourselves tomorrow on the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.320
 front leg at the knee and we 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.939
 push the heel towards the ground this 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.939
 which will allow for stretching at the level of 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.390
 calf hockey could shoot the same 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.820
 leg 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.549
 we will attract the ischios we 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.229
 let's put the same leg on the front we 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.630
 let's place the fact so backwards we 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.570
 let's bend the other leg and we 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.909
 let's bring back the tip of the feet of the leg 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 bent we point the eye towards 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.320
 the front and the bottom 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.140
 pushing the buttocks backwards the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:52.530
 and stood chest and back well 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.049
 well flat for stretched the quadriceps of the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 same people let's catch up with the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.770
 ankle and foot 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 the top of the foot is placed on the heel 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 against the buttock so bring the heel 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.420
 against buttocks so heels buttocks the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.489
 two youngsters or both knees are 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 glued to each other and the basin and 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.140
 bring back to the front what allows for 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.620
 manage the front face 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.190
 thigh could pull the chest 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.740
 we will cross hands bring back 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.940
 the shoulders back to so 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.260
 stretch the chest then to stretch 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.240
 back shoulders 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.720
 we are were we going we are 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.550
 place arms against the chest 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.530
 here and with the other hand we go 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.150
 encircle the elbow 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 which allows to stretch the back side 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.680
 back and shoulders the same thing from 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.730
 the other arm we're going to stretch back 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.210
 as a whole 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.060
 so there a round back place your head between 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.920
 both arms flexing on the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.600
 legs 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.970
 we go up we unroll the back and 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.280
 the last stretching we spend the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.360
 hands cross your fingers crossed and we 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.580
 let's do a hyperextension 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.850
 hanotal enlargement of our body 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.950
 to stretch two vertebrae that in August 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.550
 she was solicited during all our 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.080
 race so here we go back to 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.470
 their initial position 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.700
 and here we come back on the heels we 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.080
 also have the stretching of the adductors 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.210
 so you spread your legs wider 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.780
 that shoulders you place your knees 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.980
 on the outside oriented on the same 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.700
 line that the tips of your feet 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.070
 place your hands 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.870
 inside a hand inside the 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.450
 feet and elbow on the inside of the knee 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.710
 with the blow of pushing your knee 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.060
 outward it's that allows 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.800
 to stretch the inner part of the thigh 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.440
 you perform the same thing of the other 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.940
 side pushed the gluteal backwards and 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.890
 be careful that the knee does not protrude 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:59.290
 not tiptoe and we go back up and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.390
 we go back to the initial positions so 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.230
 a good stretching was done at the end 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.460
 of each session 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.450
 this helps prevent injuries without 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.240
 the improves the recovery is also 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.800
 also allows to increase the elasticity of 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.800
 your muscles so gain amplitude
