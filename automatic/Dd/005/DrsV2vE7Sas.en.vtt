00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.680 
for a lightweight but I need to make
sense<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.520> UFC<00:00:35.940> back<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.480> when

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.620 
the body you know and just decimate guys
that<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.149> also<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.209> don't<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.420> his

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that way also I don't think his

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.629 
that way also I don't think his
wrestling<00:01:58.139> is<00:01:58.289> is<00:01:58.529> that<00:01:58.950> good<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.429> point

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
wrestling is is that good to the point

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.069 
wrestling is is that good to the point
where<00:01:59.789> he's<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.029> to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.179> able<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.450> take<00:02:00.689> jose

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
where he's going to be able to take jose

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.569 
where he's going to be able to take jose
aldo<00:02:01.289> down<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.679> keep<00:02:01.799> him<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:02.069> all<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> time

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
aldo down and keep him down all the time

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.849 
aldo down and keep him down all the time
and<00:02:03.539> he'll<00:02:03.719> probably<00:02:03.869> try<00:02:04.349> to<00:02:04.409> score<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
and he'll probably try to score a

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.319 
and he'll probably try to score a
decision<00:02:05.310> victory<00:02:05.669> and<00:02:05.819> I<00:02:05.880> don't<00:02:06.149> think

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
decision victory and I don't think

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.180 
decision victory and I don't think
that's<00:02:06.419> gonna<00:02:06.599> work<00:02:06.689> against<00:02:07.079> Jose<00:02:07.409> Aldo<00:02:07.529> I<00:02:07.829> do

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that's gonna work against Jose Aldo I do

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.469 
that's gonna work against Jose Aldo I do
think<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> good<00:02:09.000> decision<00:02:09.450> for

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
think this is a good decision for

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750 
think this is a good decision for
Frankie<00:02:09.929> Edgar<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.770> since<00:02:11.099> he's<00:02:11.250> changing

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
Frankie Edgar but since he's changing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.070 
Frankie Edgar but since he's changing
weight<00:02:11.970> he's<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.630> cutting<00:02:12.780> down

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
weight he's going to be cutting down

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.069 
weight he's going to be cutting down
probably<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.530> little<00:02:13.650> bit<00:02:13.800> more<00:02:14.930> he<00:02:15.930> should

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
probably a little bit more he should

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.569 
probably a little bit more he should
probably<00:02:16.349> have<00:02:16.439> another<00:02:16.680> fight<00:02:16.920> at<00:02:17.040> 145

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
probably have another fight at 145

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.150 
probably have another fight at 145
before<00:02:18.500> facing<00:02:19.500> Jose

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
before facing Jose

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.240 
before facing Jose
but<00:02:20.430> if<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.810> know<00:02:21.930> Erik<00:02:22.350> Koch<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.860> injured

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
but if you know Erik Koch is injured

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.700 
but if you know Erik Koch is injured
then<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:24.030> need<00:02:24.240> someone<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.960> fight<00:02:25.410> Jose

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
then they need someone to fight Jose

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.430 
then they need someone to fight Jose
Aldo<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.670> makes<00:02:27.300> for<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.570> pretty<00:02:27.750> big<00:02:28.020> fight<00:02:28.230> I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
Aldo this makes for a pretty big fight I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.740 
Aldo this makes for a pretty big fight I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
think cuz you've got an ex-champion and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.600 
think cuz you've got an ex-champion and
you've<00:02:30.930> got<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.380> champion<00:02:31.950> who's<00:02:32.130> been<00:02:32.340> raining

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you've got a champion who's been raining

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.880 
you've got a champion who's been raining
for<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.760> long<00:02:32.970> time<00:02:33.240> facing<00:02:34.020> off<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> title

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
for a long time facing off for the title

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.950 
for a long time facing off for the title
it<00:02:35.190> should<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.550> good<00:02:35.700> but<00:02:35.940> I'm<00:02:36.390> pic<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.750> jose

probably the best gym in the world some

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.140 
probably the best gym in the world some
people<00:03:07.470> might<00:03:07.680> argue<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.880> they<00:03:08.970> might

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.810
