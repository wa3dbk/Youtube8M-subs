00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 whoever we have now we keep in 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.110
 hands holding a platform or frame 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:13.080
 frame and platform or frame for the wagon and 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.650
 quickly we collect it is done very 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.029
 just look slowly at first 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.900
 collect then quickly yes we already 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.900
 there are wheels on the platform 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.550
 put the back then add 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.460
 boiler 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.470
 So 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.120
 boiler for heating 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.310
 where is he 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:47.320
 boiler for the cabin driver's cabin 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.320
 next driver's cabin 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 so they decided to first platform 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.090
 to hook 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.989
 to the train platform under the car that there 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.969
 will ship yet unknown rather 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.400
 All this is cargo pain to cargo with 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.400
 coal wagon coal 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.340
 so ahead there must be another muzzle 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.130
 thomas the train with vampires with light 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.750
 with a lantern that's all finished small 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 short little train 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.549
 train now you quickly collect and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.240
 more so so so and then he we 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.240
 will go 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.530
 We are looking at how the train will work 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.510
 thomas through on our locomotive rushed 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.900
 breaking through here hooked up more cars I 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.210
 I see 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.720
 go building materials on last 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.900
 the platform on the last trailer is not 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.530
 understandable as in some load but here 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.750
 no 2 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 so here we are 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.800
 railway track reds 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.800
 holds enter and blue 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.479
 only vane faced 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.890
 to prevent an accident 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.740
 So 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:23.250
 but there is only one wagon goes on 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.250
 mind muse chest with coal 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.640
 boy maxim worry to record 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.560
 ok it turned out we still have 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.060
 crane that will load 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.340
 Materials apparently some 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.370
 heavy loads so u will have to 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.880
 load here on this train to train 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.880
 thomas where many many trucks 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.760
 We operate cranes, expand it and 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.760
 first serve these concrete slabs then 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.180
 again under them so as to show how we 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.180
 ship 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:15.690
 that the crane will grab these plates 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.690
 put on the train platform 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.470
 and drove along the load to 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.470
 so the train is going to stay on something 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.270
 meteorite probably downloaded a lot 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.270
 Hades went, went, went everything is fine 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.750
 so ends the work on vitim or 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.710
 not yet 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.710
 we'll see 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:59.430
 can burn the moment opa here 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:02.220
 transparent tunnel maxi is clearly not 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.580
 wants to put their camp and in the tunnel in 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.580
 garage 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.460
 be careful 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.520
 i can 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.520
 but 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.699
 dad nervous a little bit 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.710
 so two of each look 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.199
 the railway line goes so they after all 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.199
 connect sits once they can and somehow 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.580
 i'm not regulated regulates the boil to 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.510
 they are not confronted in any way 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.510
 there was no accident 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.390
 So 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.139
 two trains thomas 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:07.910
 each in its own direction tailoring by 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:12.440
 your lacoste no no work be 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.670
 continue to play with the trains 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.670
 don't want to leave 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.919
 what 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.509
 Well, we are finishing goodbye
