00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.939

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.720
 and here is also the national one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 lc in it 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.920
 So six days before release is 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.020
 already a horny shit here in the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 stephen book version 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.879
 I have now not expected 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 I can go and order it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.030
 read aloud there is unfortunately 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.050
 everything in english that the man himself 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.930
 But as far as I know in German 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.420
 okay here's because we have battle angel four 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.420
 out of fear is in there ok and 64 are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 we put these customers in monster fischer there 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.539
 also needs 50 gigabytes again so the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 player if ever more demanding 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.040
 up to 1080p and for a player only 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.030
 So no multiplayer what I am now 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.110
 not bad because that's good 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.350
 hopefully a pretty good story 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:24.210
 and here we do it again and again 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.900
 look English is the game is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.900
 actually in German 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.579
 but also the german usk version is 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 as only identical so now once the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.119
 Control what I like very much 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.119
 Things should bring in the times often 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:49.009
 which would have almost revealed again 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.110
 what's in there does not know nationally 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.520
 probably pick up some weapons 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 or the way to go back to the bsi 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.880
 can unlock 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.700
 is it in the order I know I know 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.410
 not yourself 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.209
 Clever she is just a cover shooter 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.860
 since it was announced 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.269
 men with beards here men with beards 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.780
 are the story in the main role 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.650
 should 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.480
 and which are in the main role and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.030

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.790

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.080
 as not really boilern 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.760

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:49.250

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.930
 dollar is probably not something else 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.000
 that means the order six days 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.980
 earlier with me I had only from 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.090
 to make a display but I think so 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.099
 do not start boxing is enough 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.200

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.150
 for me and then good is a relative 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.799
 short let's play cost unboxing though 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.859
 she really looks forward to it 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.380
 the game itself and yes I hope 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.850
