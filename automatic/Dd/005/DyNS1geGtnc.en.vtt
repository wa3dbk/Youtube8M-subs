00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 You saw in the previous civil video back 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.620
 there to see who enters the market is 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.099
 made by different economic classes 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.929
 therefore the construction in the final price will 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:21.779
 depending on the class you intend to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:24.810
 meet you will discover along the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 series that value price has nothing to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.550
 see one thing with the other 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 pedro son right what so before 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.489
 nothing is not that guy who does not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.440
 competition research says so 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.090
 Price is my price is what I think 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.010
 right where the price of the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.989
 I do not know the price of the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.820
 competition I find it ugly to look at the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 municipality is not applied because it is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 wrong do not feel like a cheater one 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.239
 pilan or anything like that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.190
 do a good market research 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.930
 companies do market research is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 important that you do research on 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.469
 market for you to know how the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 price of its competitor as that of the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.019
 package that offers services such as 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 This is important to do and is not ugly or 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.760
 of the company prepared on the market 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.979
 sap 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.590
 the price of your competitor we will stay 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.170
 oscillating old there are dozens of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.619
 shapes and formulas for you to build 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.080
 your price the class is the one you make 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.090
 the whole calculation of its fixed cost but its 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.580
 variable cost depreciation of 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.729
 equipment closes everything in a large 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:36.299
 spreadsheet puts a profit margin 30% 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.729
 50% 600 in 500% but this is not wrong 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.280
 quite the contrary, it's quite right 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.799
 but this calculation is incomplete 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.500
 classic you will build your beautiful 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.290
 inner and color this term that people 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.030
 will use this expression a lot 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.630
 throughout the series whenever 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.710
 talking about table price of 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.200
 packages and services 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.210
 even because this is an account that you 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.880
 need to know anyway said 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.780
 This is how we will organize all this and 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 four transition steps first passed 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.460
 to research the market if we already speak 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.920
 about this and 15 raise all 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.120
 possible budgets and life in four 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.550
 bands 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.550
 second passed because four tracks 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.800
 because the class a class b class c ea 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.300
 amateur class because the photographer 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.790
 amateur that guy just came in 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.620
 in the market will charge even cheaper 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.660
 than the photographer who attends class c 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.550
 because he still does not know the costs that he 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.830
 have to keep that price still 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.959
 makes an account that gives him the sensation 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.030
 that you are making lots of money and just 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.160
 will find out that his price is off 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.630
 of reality and for a year this is the 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.739
 moment he will try to 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.450
 to professionalize 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.459
 or he will leave the market to 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.140
 get professional 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.720
 he will have to raise the price to climb the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.360
 price will mean losing all or 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.580
 almost all of the customers who have already 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.989
 Conquered but this is chat for another 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.550
 video making back abc and amateurs 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.320
 for example let's say you have to ask 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.320
 budgets in the marriage area of your 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.600
 city and microregion there you received the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.120
 budgets in the range of 2,000 budgets 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.820
 in the range of 5 6 thousand per cement in the range 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.220
 from 15 to 20 thousand only assuming you make the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.350
 division of the government of 15 21 that goes 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.549
 receive two or three are the class 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.680
 of 678 thousand are class b the use 2 3 thousand 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.410
 are of class c is just an example going 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.140
 after price and you also receive 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.160
 some budgets below one thousand reais 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.959
 800 500 reais 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.910
 these are the amateurs they do not 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.150
 have realized that they will pay to do 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.180
 third services has now passed you 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.900
 choose which band of these you want 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.670
 insert 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.230
 but it is not now that you choose this 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.910
 choice is one thing you have to go 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.330
 thinking and have to think a lot 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.350
 care because things work 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.080
 Completely different 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.269
 between these bands the workflow at 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.700
 amount of time you spend 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.570
 every photo the style of photography 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.330
 What do you do 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.160
 the equipment 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.840
 What are you going to use this kind of team? 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.970
 Are you going to hire like that? 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.820
 made the delivery of the product what will be 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.710
 your sales plan what kind of 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.570
 supplier outsourcing 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.640
 everything changes everything the room has passed now 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.410
 Monk to your price list because the 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.630
 from this price table that you 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.850
 going back your packs are the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.980
 packages that will sell you cheap I am 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.680
 present this structure in the model 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.590
 price lists and 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.650
 that service packages or 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.240
 have values based on the price table 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.460
 so with the table ready you 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.200
 can put together different packages you 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.580
 can give a discount percentage 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.490
 these packages 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.650
 this is already the external table is not that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.080
 table that you set up in the beginning with the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.460
 your costs with variables and we'll 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.440
 make more low cut little video of 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.690
 suddenly even after this same one that goes 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.000
 differentiate for you internal table of 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.970
 external table so you can build 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.700
 their packages because there is a mother is 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.210
 which is to present your product in three 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.840
 packages but this is also a subject for 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.970
 another day and the fourth step endpoint 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.840
 party atmosphere idea and put your 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.030
 price as the second most expensive of that 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.919
 that you want to enter I suppose then 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.030
 that you want to get into class b 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:27.660
 you received 9 budgets between four 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:31.260
 thousand reais and 6,700 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:35.490
 puts its price at 6,300 this morning 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:38.040
 for you to stay in the middle of that class 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.290
 which will be considered by the public when 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.570
 by that economic band with the 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.330
 dignity of being among the most expensive 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.040
 without running the risk of getting much more 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.080
 expensive that class b and much more to 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.020
 to finance what would make you lose 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.970
 two car faces of the unpaid class 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.490
 if the product is too cheap in the case 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.450
 of class p is not paid if the product is 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.729
 too expensive 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.820
 So stay at all step does not work 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.090
 in a ready space you are priced 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.430
 liked this and of course it's not only that 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.650
 Now you have to take care of many. 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.560
 other aspects related to the portfolio 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.440
 the very final presentation of your 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.350
 price that should be clear and direct and 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.300
 conciseness among many other aspects that 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.669
 We are going to talk over time. 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.760
 now talking through this ours 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.040
 Friends, leave the joinha for me if you 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.300

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.300
 next videos and
