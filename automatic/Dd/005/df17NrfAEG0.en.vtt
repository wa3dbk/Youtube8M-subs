00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.469
 before that it was easy to get hold of it, ready to go 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.189
 make say 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:15.959

 olivier very few vegetables and you face the downfall per person per day 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:20.949
 required 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.669
 so I also propose to bite a lot faster too 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.660
 and then you get it 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.240
 with the small steps and a better name got by and why is that so 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.779
 important there comes a heavy one there 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.039
 Vegetable contains a lot of vitamins and minerals and fiber gives good washing 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:36.999
 go the stollen 

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.050
 it yielded few calories 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.510
 it is really valuable every day around the chain 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.340
 and the best thing about it is also the varying types of vegetables that live that specific 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.960
 vitamins and minerals 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.639
 in one go, 14 beans and broccoli are liked in hongkong 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:58.230
 is enough choice I cherish back immediately and then I see what is on the table 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.030
 good luck with making some goodies on the other hand 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.680
 it is expected that made president you have to go the woman is found 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.230
 foundation wants hands full of cucumber and tomato 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.060
 I could come and meet where to make up for four too 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.750
 variation is important this edition every day take cucumber and salad 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.120
 also other types of vegetables all of us not specific good 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.180
 have properties 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 there may also be requests there being on the street 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.200
 with a supermarket we cannot be ready to go now 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.690
 withdrawal becomes sell 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.910
 is also fine in antwerp being on only in the jura 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.290
 after the leg ends 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.100
 I see now that can be 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.450
 Another good dressing by a salad is an example and inflation 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.200
 to arrive but fortunately nothing 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.520
 on the errors based on made catcher anyway 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.030
 the tomato ketchup a little pepper through little 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.979
 later this year a gamers who have very few candidates from france 7 a 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.739
 plate 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.809
 no mayonnaise here 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.900
 damage caused by the damage 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.389
 14 years old in his career 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.000
 the other side of getting fat yes i think a lot is enough 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.910
 and do a little extra for the extra so there are more 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.719
 the collision 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.719
 we go 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.859
 This is a consequence of the NATO-led ISAF 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.889
 after fiat 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.589
 we worked hard to achieve that 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:51.129
 he always asks fixed by one and with that fifth but it is five for 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.509
 twelve but that time very good choice 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:55.939
 salt 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.180
 fat in it anp 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.479
 the big room 5 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.019
 geertje inspection 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.230
 a good given 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.749
 fat few calories per year 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.469
 the bouncers then it will with the waterbus little cheese and then choose the 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.189
 thirty-something cheese 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.999
 so the gouda cheese is forty-eight this is a full-fat cheese this 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.690
 very tasty nowadays 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.159
 30 plus kg contain much less perth 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.979
 so choose there for questions kav it always remains a very nice neighborhood 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.669
 and also a very familiar product 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.739
 I think it's done, ladies 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.319
 there are a few 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.379
 rio has gone 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.619
 yes and then what is that very easy around the window and has too long 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.259
 and I learned that they meet each other 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.589
 Vegetables abroad have looked at pieces of fruit as well as he comes in 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:46.659
 I can see that also not really confronted according to Meijer a lot 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.089
 boys soccer hence those kids always went well yes 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.219
 happens two years 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.119
 so this gives he would get absolutely yes 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.629
 so what's the best pick 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.180
 I think this with machine guns is the best tip to pay attention to 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:03.519
 but she can do well 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.419
 I like this year with my career but there are also other alternatives 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.689
 which allows the purchase wholegrain buddy johnny cooking 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.779
 a little colbourn baker's clothes 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.079
 buy sliced ​​or cut a congo 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.870
 a little tomato cubes and murdered by the publishers 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.210
 in the court a few pieces of party 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.860
 in super fast meal 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.289
 with two plans 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.319
 I don't have any 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.219
 meat grinder baker 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:33.070
 by maes and by green beans the door 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.409
 even then the door made a bit of work 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.340
 you also have the plan once a week and also very quickly true 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.259
 but we go 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:44.400
