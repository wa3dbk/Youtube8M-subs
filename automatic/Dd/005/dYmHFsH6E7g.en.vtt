00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in the corner of this bag up here I have

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.279 
in the corner of this bag up here I have
a<00:00:56.219> sort<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> an<00:00:56.910> establishing<00:00:57.329> lens<00:00:57.600> shot<00:00:57.899> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
a sort of an establishing lens shot this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.819 
a sort of an establishing lens shot this
is<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.710> Tokina<00:00:59.609> 11<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> 16<00:01:00.539> F<00:01:00.989> 2.8<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
is the Tokina 11 to 16 F 2.8 so this is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.470

dirty but that's the way that you cover

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.429 
dirty but that's the way that you cover
up<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.850> mic<00:01:30.060> outside<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.140> any<00:01:31.290> wind
