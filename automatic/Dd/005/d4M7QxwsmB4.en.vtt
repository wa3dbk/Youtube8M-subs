00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.279
 Eleven inspiration I have you the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.290
 I showed myself one last time 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.340
 Storage've weighed for earrings 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.410
 and there are many of you 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.450
 asked if I might again 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.179
 Make a storage for a plug 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.109
 can and I want you one today 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 give a little tip 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 I've been here for some time 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 made this pin board that's one 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.439
 have a simple piece and there I have 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.570
 just a piece of pure fabric 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.260
 curious depending on which material such as 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.450
 you can use as insert make 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.000
 and then use it as a storage 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 or as I do that now today 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 Can you do that with a piece? 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 felt make because you can also low or 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.210
 Plug in the ear plug 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.629
 That's why I have one here today 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.730
 fritter felt a scissors boarding 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.590
 frame and then I have here 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.149
 in addition a little loop around 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.590
 to beautify that a little bit me 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.590
 have the pieces on 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:06.210
 and by doing so you can get the inner circle 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.649
 dissolve out and the fabric goes out me 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 I think that's really nice too 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.520
 this material and you should 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.869
 maybe just try it out though 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.820
 have her beautiful fabric that you are there 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.390
 once earrings try through 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.200
 stick 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.670
 if that works or not and then 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.149
 can you just that with his fabric 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.039
 do 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.549
 and even if you feel that way 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.520
 then it really tries out before 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.220
 felt yes maybe there are synonymous 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.899
 thicker and thinner rock plates and at 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.179
 the very fat can probably also 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.860
 the no less well stuck but 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.000
 with this one here it is now completely 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.009
 normal thin the a4 fitz but the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.220
 fourth plate and there it works 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.289
 well the only problem now is that 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.670
 that the circle is slightly larger than 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.590
 the biz plate and therefore with me that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.539
 not completely filled in now 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.299
 but it does not look that bad either 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.810
 yes, but then I am quite nice 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:10.129
 put the plate on the smaller circle 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:13.260
 and then so on the edge so 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.150
 that something survives here and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.370
 less so you do not overdo it 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.739
 wasted and now I put those 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.739
 bigger this larger circle about it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.390
 a little bit more that it really 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.390
 gets so tight 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.500
 so the fiz plate is now relative 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.770
 tight in it 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.600
 and now it has come off if you have it 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.060
 got the plate right 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.740
 died in there then you have to 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.430
 whole here quickly outside again 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.880
 rotate 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.880
 So here at this screw of 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.160
 the piece junk the whole turn again 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.510
 until it is really nice and tight 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.640
 can not slip on its own 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.770
 just like that happened to me just like that 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.450
 if the whole thing is really nice 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.310
 then all I need is the footrest 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.620
 at that time just cut off with the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.530
 scissors go along the way 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.530
 edge and the cordial cut off 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.790
 then theoretically the earring is already 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.470
 holder finished that you can easily 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.790
 Hang up here I have such a drawstring 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.380
 from the last time 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.200
 or you can get out of a loop band 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.610
 Do it on top and down here 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.870
 I count the gaps as I wanted to 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.420
 just a little bit nice that we 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.920
 in the loop, but do it 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.210
 is also an alternative to the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.130
 whole thing and I'll show you 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.690
 now to alternatively you can namely 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.670
 Just a few grind if 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.370
 there still with in the frame purely span 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.310
 and then of course the ends here as well 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.380
 cut off at the edge 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.250
 and here you can go to the background 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.810
 make the studs and here 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.930
 These ribbons you can still a few 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.360
 dranhÃ¤ngen earrings I have them for 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.220
 pull zigzag criss-cross 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.720
 but of course if you do that right now 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.350
 of course, the earrings serve 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.820
 best 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.760
 I wanted it a bit 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.440
 looks more interesting and chic 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.510
 yes that was my suggestion for one 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.160
 Storage for the plug that is 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.100
 really quite simple so have a piece 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.570
 You can also buy relatively cheap and 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.220
 there just a nice fitz plate 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.350
 make it pure and that is practical 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.700
 can just with the frame several things 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.680
 if you do that someday 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.120
 does not look so nice then does 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.160
 Just do something different again 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.490
 purely like me here last time in there too 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.340
 This one had this beautiful colorful fabric 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.190
 and here you can really beautiful now 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.500
 hang up the whole thing and there the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.760
 studs turn down here is yes 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.960
 such a gap with my kids of course 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.030
 was big enough 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.190
 and there you can, for example, beautiful 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.370
 so not live 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.080
 drum do so just here 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.630
 continuous and here in front then such a 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.550
 loop it on it makes it 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.550
 bit more interesting still looks 

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:37.359
 so 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.430
 if you keep these earrings 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.629
 like it then give me the thumb 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.000
 it is really something completely up 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:53.599
 simple no big no big 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.330
 work to do that so the idea 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.889
 still like about the writing but 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.210
 that simply in the comments gives one 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.210
 Thumbs up the video shares 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.650
 maybe with his friends and yes 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.659
 I think it's exciting to happen 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.970
 If I have the retention 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.539
 like and see you at the 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.539
 next time again
