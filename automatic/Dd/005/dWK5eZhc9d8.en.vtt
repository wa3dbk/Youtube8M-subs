there<00:01:02.840> are<00:01:02.960> about<00:01:03.350> 12<00:01:03.590> other<00:01:03.739> states<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.280> are

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
there are about 12 other states that are

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.820 
there are about 12 other states that are
doing<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.820> same<00:01:05.030> thing<00:01:05.329> it's<00:01:05.840> not<00:01:05.990> illegal<00:01:06.560> to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
doing the same thing it's not illegal to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.640 
doing the same thing it's not illegal to
buy<00:01:07.760> things<00:01:08.120> for<00:01:08.299> silver<00:01:08.630> right<00:01:08.840> now<00:01:09.049> or<00:01:09.290> gold

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
buy things for silver right now or gold

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.950 
buy things for silver right now or gold
so<00:01:10.010> i<00:01:10.280> think<00:01:10.729> that's<00:01:11.030> what<00:01:11.270> would<00:01:11.390> happen<00:01:11.720> more

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
so i think that's what would happen more

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440 
so i think that's what would happen more
and<00:01:12.400> again<00:01:13.400> going<00:01:13.610> back<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.090> currency

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
and again going back to the currency

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.510 
and again going back to the currency
side<00:01:14.690> will<00:01:15.530> go<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.740> absolute<00:01:16.100> zero<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.460> the

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
side will go to absolute zero and the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.510 
side will go to absolute zero and the
answers<00:01:16.880> could<00:01:17.650> again<00:01:18.650> before<00:01:18.799> that<00:01:19.100> happens

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
answers could again before that happens

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.240 
answers could again before that happens

they<00:02:33.650> don't<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> clue<00:02:34.190> because<00:02:34.640> they

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
they don't have a clue because they

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.730 
they don't have a clue because they
never<00:02:35.060> had<00:02:35.180> earned<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.480> living<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.470> when<00:02:36.650> they

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
never had earned a living so when they

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.530 
never had earned a living so when they
start<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.190> earn<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> living<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:37.910> they<00:02:38.090> start<00:02:38.360> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
start to earn a living and they start to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.480 
start to earn a living and they start to
look<00:02:38.780> at<00:02:38.960> prices<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.410> little<00:02:39.500> more<00:02:39.890> diligently

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
look at prices a little more diligently

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.740 
look at prices a little more diligently
and<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.940> goes<00:02:41.090> into<00:02:41.120> their<00:02:41.390> memories

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
and then it goes into their memories

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.390 
and then it goes into their memories
anyway<00:02:42.110> I'm<00:02:42.200> probably<00:02:42.440> drilling<00:02:42.920> too<00:02:43.070> far<00:02:43.310> on

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
anyway I'm probably drilling too far on

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.560 
anyway I'm probably drilling too far on
that<00:02:43.430> question<00:02:43.940> why<00:02:44.060> don't<00:02:44.180> we<00:02:44.240> do<00:02:44.330> another

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
that question why don't we do another

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.800 
that question why don't we do another
one<00:02:44.920> as<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.130> am<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.280> middle-aged<00:02:46.670> sorry<00:02:47.360> as<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.780> am

three to four years I would like to hear
your<00:02:55.280> thoughts<00:02:56.230> okay<00:02:57.230> what<00:02:57.410> kind<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.740> is<00:02:58.070> a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
your thoughts okay what kind of is a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.390 
your thoughts okay what kind of is a
nice<00:02:58.400> piggyback<00:02:58.880> on<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.180> last<00:02:59.360> question<00:02:59.630> so

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
nice piggyback on the last question so

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.170 
nice piggyback on the last question so
basically<00:03:01.400> if<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.670> think<00:03:01.850> there's<00:03:02.000> going<00:03:02.090> to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
basically if you think there's going to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.400 
basically if you think there's going to
be<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.300> currency<00:03:02.720> collapse<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.260> should

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
be a currency collapse you should

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.530 
be a currency collapse you should
probably<00:03:03.680> hold<00:03:03.800> some<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:05.210> event<00:03:05.480> that

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
probably hold some in the event that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.530 
probably hold some in the event that
that<00:03:05.780> happens<00:03:06.230> if<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.250> are<00:03:07.730> willing<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.270> cash

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
that happens if you are willing to cash

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.720 
that happens if you are willing to cash
out<00:03:08.810> when<00:03:09.320> silver<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:09.800> overvalued<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.610> I

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
out when silver is overvalued and I

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.510 
out when silver is overvalued and I
think<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.090> will<00:03:11.209> be<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.770> gold<00:03:12.770> as<00:03:12.950> well<00:03:12.980> I

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
think it will be and gold as well I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.580 
think it will be and gold as well I
think<00:03:14.450> three<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.720> four<00:03:14.900> years<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.230> about<00:03:15.350> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
think three to four years is about the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.380 
think three to four years is about the
right<00:03:15.680> time<00:03:15.950> frame<00:03:16.190> no<00:03:16.490> no<00:03:16.790> one<00:03:16.940> knows<00:03:17.150> these

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
right time frame no no one knows these

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.790 
right time frame no no one knows these
things<00:03:17.450> but<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.989> average<00:03:18.170> commodity<00:03:18.650> cycle

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
things but the average commodity cycle

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.060 
things but the average commodity cycle
17<00:03:19.160> years<00:03:19.720> Gold's<00:03:20.720> bottom<00:03:21.050> was<00:03:21.170> about<00:03:21.350> 2,000

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
17 years Gold's bottom was about 2,000

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.979 
17 years Gold's bottom was about 2,000
so<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.430> be<00:03:22.520> that<00:03:23.150> would<00:03:23.300> indicate<00:03:24.459> 2017

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
so that be that would indicate 2017

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.570 
so that be that would indicate 2017
silver<00:03:26.989> would<00:03:27.410> ride<00:03:27.680> along<00:03:28.010> with<00:03:28.190> gold<00:03:28.430> or

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
silver would ride along with gold or

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.520 
silver would ride along with gold or
actually<00:03:28.940> probably<00:03:29.209> accelerating<00:03:30.170> out<00:03:30.290> do

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
actually probably accelerating out do

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.990 
actually probably accelerating out do
gold<00:03:30.800> in<00:03:30.950> fact<00:03:31.160> we<00:03:31.250> believe<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.550> strongly

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
gold in fact we believe that strongly

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.060 
gold in fact we believe that strongly
and<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.959> could<00:03:33.110> even<00:03:33.260> peek<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.709> little<00:03:33.739> bit

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
and it could even peek a little bit

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.130 
and it could even peek a little bit
before<00:03:34.220> all<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.730> last<00:03:35.000> bull<00:03:35.450> market<00:03:35.959> they

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
before all the last bull market they

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.840 
before all the last bull market they
peaked<00:03:36.410> basically<00:03:36.980> honest<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.550> know<00:03:37.640> very

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
peaked basically honest you know very

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.229 
peaked basically honest you know very
much<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.209> same<00:03:38.270> day<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:39.560> time<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.970> could<00:03:41.180> be

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
much the same day this time it could be

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.360 
much the same day this time it could be
different<00:03:41.570> so<00:03:42.440> yeah<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.680> took<00:03:42.830> three<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.160> four

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
different so yeah I took three to four

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.010 
different so yeah I took three to four
years<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.790> good<00:03:44.000> time<00:03:44.239> frame<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.660> don't<00:03:44.840> think

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
years is a good time frame I don't think

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.900 
years is a good time frame I don't think
you're<00:03:45.080> gonna<00:03:45.230> have<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.470> wait<00:03:45.620> ten<00:03:45.950> how<00:03:46.700> having

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
you're gonna have to wait ten how having

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.550 
you're gonna have to wait ten how having
said<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.420> when<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.570> had<00:03:47.750> one<00:03:47.989> thing<00:03:48.260> if

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
said that it's when I had one thing if

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.640 
said that it's when I had one thing if
you<00:03:48.739> were<00:03:49.010> oh<00:03:49.959> whatever<00:03:50.959> eight<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.350> doesn't

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
you were oh whatever eight it doesn't

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.760 
you were oh whatever eight it doesn't
really<00:03:51.739> matter<00:03:52.010> grandparent<00:03:52.880> parent<00:03:53.770> college

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
really matter grandparent parent college

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.440 
really matter grandparent parent college
student<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.190> wanted<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.700> put<00:03:55.940> something<00:03:55.970> away

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
student you wanted to put something away

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.570 
student you wanted to put something away
from<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.900> next<00:03:57.110> 30<00:03:57.380> years<00:03:57.500> now<00:03:57.860> that's<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.370> long

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
from the next 30 years now that's a long

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.550 
from the next 30 years now that's a long
time<00:03:58.880> horizon<00:03:59.450> Amundson<00:03:59.870> grandparents<00:04:00.470> want

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
time horizon Amundson grandparents want

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.140 
time horizon Amundson grandparents want
to<00:04:00.709> i'm<00:04:00.920> thinking<00:04:01.190> of<00:04:01.280> grandparents<00:04:01.880> thinking

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
to i'm thinking of grandparents thinking

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.870 
to i'm thinking of grandparents thinking
about<00:04:02.390> their<00:04:02.600> grandkids<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.700> really<00:04:04.700> thought

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
about their grandkids I really thought

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.370 
about their grandkids I really thought
this<00:04:05.120> through<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.600> think<00:04:05.810> silver<00:04:06.260> is

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
this through and I think silver is

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.010 
this through and I think silver is
probably<00:04:07.130> physical<00:04:08.060> solar<00:04:08.420> one<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.750> best

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
probably physical solar one of the best

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.380 
probably physical solar one of the best
you<00:04:09.200> could<00:04:09.320> do<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:10.489> reason<00:04:10.850> being<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:11.239> the

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
you could do the reason being is the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.210 
you could do the reason being is the
supply<00:04:11.750> even<00:04:12.019> though<00:04:12.109> it<00:04:12.200> is<00:04:12.320> increasing<00:04:12.950> as<00:04:13.100> I

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
supply even though it is increasing as I

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.640 
supply even though it is increasing as I
said<00:04:13.430> earlier<00:04:14.260> is

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
said earlier is

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.219 
said earlier is
short<00:04:16.250> relative<00:04:16.940> or<00:04:17.209> smaller<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.959> should<00:04:18.199> say

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
short relative or smaller I should say

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.159 
short relative or smaller I should say
relative<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.009> gold<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.519> there<00:04:20.509> are<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.109> many

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
relative to gold and there are so many

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.010 
relative to gold and there are so many
innovations<00:04:21.650> for<00:04:22.070> silver<00:04:22.580> on<00:04:23.419> an<00:04:23.630> annual

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
innovations for silver on an annual

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.290 
innovations for silver on an annual
basis<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:25.039> think<00:04:25.400> one<00:04:25.580> term<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:26.030> could<00:04:26.210> be

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
basis that I think one term I could be

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.300 
basis that I think one term I could be
wrong<00:04:26.509> but<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:26.930> long-term<00:04:27.289> silver<00:04:27.979> still

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
wrong but I think long-term silver still

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.390 
wrong but I think long-term silver still
is<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:29.030> good<00:04:29.449> long<00:04:30.320> long<00:04:30.620> term<00:04:30.860> investment

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
is a good long long term investment

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.570 
is a good long long term investment
nonetheless<00:04:31.699> I<00:04:32.180> expect<00:04:33.220> however<00:04:34.220> we<00:04:34.400> get

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
nonetheless I expect however we get

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.490 
nonetheless I expect however we get
through<00:04:34.789> this<00:04:34.940> financial<00:04:35.900> contender<00:04:36.380> room

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
through this financial contender room

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.900 
through this financial contender room
and<00:04:37.009> we<00:04:37.190> will<00:04:37.419> for<00:04:38.419> that<00:04:39.130> silver<00:04:40.130> you<00:04:40.789> know

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
and we will for that silver you know

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.150 
and we will for that silver you know
short<00:04:41.270> term<00:04:41.509> is<00:04:41.690> going<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.900> overvalue<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:42.919> at

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
short term is going to overvalue and at

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.040 
short term is going to overvalue and at
that<00:04:43.340> time<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:44.120> should<00:04:44.240> be<00:04:44.539> looking<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.900> take

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
that time you should be looking to take

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.050 
that time you should be looking to take
at<00:04:45.289> least<00:04:45.410> partial<00:04:45.919> profits<00:04:46.370> i<00:04:46.490> know<00:04:46.550> i<00:04:46.669> will

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
at least partial profits i know i will

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.680 
at least partial profits i know i will
be<00:04:47.270> as<00:04:47.840> much<00:04:48.050> as<00:04:48.260> what<00:04:48.440> silver<00:04:48.770> bowl<00:04:48.949> as<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.250> am

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
be as much as what silver bowl as I am

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.360 
be as much as what silver bowl as I am
when<00:04:50.690> silver<00:04:51.050> becomes<00:04:51.380> over<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:51.860> I'm<00:04:52.190> going

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
when silver becomes over that I'm going

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.860 
when silver becomes over that I'm going
to<00:04:52.430> be<00:04:52.520> looking<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:52.880> buy<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.360> don't<00:04:53.539> know<00:04:53.630> what
