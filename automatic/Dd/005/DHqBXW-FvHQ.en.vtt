that to draw briefly as you can see it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.280 
that to draw briefly as you can see it
already<00:03:14.730> looks<00:03:15.030> as<00:03:15.300> though<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.510> tooth<00:03:16.080> is

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
already looks as though that tooth is

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.740 
already looks as though that tooth is
missing<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:18.380> it's<00:03:19.380> already<00:03:19.890> pretty<00:03:20.070> well<00:03:20.190> dry

missing and it's already pretty well dry

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.960 
missing and it's already pretty well dry
so<00:03:21.750> that's<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.590> simplest<00:03:22.980> way<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.250> go<00:03:23.490> and<00:03:23.760> get

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
so that's the simplest way to go and get

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.600 
so that's the simplest way to go and get
out<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.360> whole<00:03:25.110> tooth<00:03:25.380> completely<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.250> evenly

out a whole tooth completely and evenly

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.480 
out a whole tooth completely and evenly
it's<00:03:27.240> using<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:27.660> kind<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.960> enamel<00:03:28.460> however<00:03:29.460> a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
it's using this kind of enamel however a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.450 
it's using this kind of enamel however a
lot<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.850> times<00:03:30.060> when<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.390> need<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> go<00:03:30.840> and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
lot of times when you need to go and

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.860 
lot of times when you need to go and
make<00:03:32.460> two<00:03:32.730> teeth<00:03:33.180> look<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.690> they've<00:03:33.840> been

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
to give somebody a look that is more

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.100 
to give somebody a look that is more
like<00:04:44.180> bits<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.419> pieces<00:04:45.659> gone<00:04:46.080> bad<00:04:46.349> so<00:04:48.050> now<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
like bits and pieces gone bad so now the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.170 
like bits and pieces gone bad so now the
wax<00:04:49.379> doesn't<00:04:49.830> hold<00:04:50.069> on<00:04:50.310> very<00:04:50.520> well<00:04:50.639> which<00:04:51.030> is

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
wax doesn't hold on very well which is

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.770 
wax doesn't hold on very well which is
why<00:04:51.389> it's<00:04:51.629> not<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.900> good<00:04:52.349> for<00:04:53.330> this<00:04:54.330> kind<00:04:54.629> of

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
why it's not that good for this kind of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.119 
why it's not that good for this kind of
thing<00:04:55.020> where<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.259> want<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.680> make<00:04:56.009> it

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
thing where you want to make it

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.219 
thing where you want to make it
completely<00:04:56.580> black<00:04:56.879> it<00:04:57.180> wears<00:04:57.539> off<00:04:57.810> very

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
completely black it wears off very

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.119 
completely black it wears off very
quickly<00:04:58.729> however<00:04:59.729> it<00:04:59.849> is<00:04:59.970> non-toxic<00:05:00.409> so<00:05:01.409> the

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
quickly however it is non-toxic so the

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.499 
quickly however it is non-toxic so the
fact<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.370> you're<00:05:02.550> eating<00:05:02.909> it<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.180> not<00:05:03.330> going

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
fact that you're eating it is not going

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.159 
fact that you're eating it is not going
to<00:05:03.659> kill<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:04.050> but<00:05:04.830> it's<00:05:05.699> better<00:05:06.150> for<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:06.690> sort

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
to kill you but it's better for the sort

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.659 
to kill you but it's better for the sort
of<00:05:07.199> subtle<00:05:07.560> things<00:05:08.129> that<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:10.400> sections<00:05:11.400> like

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
of subtle things that have sections like

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.450 
of subtle things that have sections like
that<00:05:12.110> okay

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
that okay

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.140 
that okay
dubious<00:05:14.460> teeth<00:05:15.199> they<00:05:16.199> also<00:05:16.409> make<00:05:17.039> both<00:05:17.969> this

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
dubious teeth they also make both this

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.050 
dubious teeth they also make both this
kind<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.509> enamel<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.729> sometimes<00:05:20.729> you<00:05:20.909> can
