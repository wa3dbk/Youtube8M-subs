00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
some different springs in there but

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.639 
some different springs in there but
upgrade<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:09.929> shops<00:02:10.140> while<00:02:10.320> you're<00:02:10.500> at<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and it will actually still write

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880 
and it will actually still write
properly<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.930> try<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.200> completely<00:02:13.590> dump

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
properly if you try and completely dump

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
properly if you try and completely dump
it<00:02:14.070> then<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.550> need<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.820> start<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.390> join<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it then you need to start to join the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.020 
it then you need to start to join the
world<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.080> drop<00:02:16.830> axles<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.430> welding<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:17.940> you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
world of drop axles and welding so you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.390 
world of drop axles and welding so you
do<00:02:18.209> not<00:02:18.330> any<00:02:18.660> car<00:02:18.840> park<00:02:19.080> mates<00:02:19.400> which

do not any car park mates which

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.740 
do not any car park mates which
basically<00:02:20.880> means<00:02:21.090> can't<00:02:21.330> drive<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.630> car
