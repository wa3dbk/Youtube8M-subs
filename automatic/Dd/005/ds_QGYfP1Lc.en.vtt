to the meteors because of their small
site<00:02:29.680> one<00:02:30.680> theory<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.519> small<00:02:31.880> meteor

uninhabited forest in the area this

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.290 
uninhabited forest in the area this
could<00:02:39.080> also<00:02:39.319> explain<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> 2.1<00:02:40.760> tremor

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300
