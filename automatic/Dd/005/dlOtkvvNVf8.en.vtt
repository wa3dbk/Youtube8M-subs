the next episode we're going to go back
to<00:00:32.700> our<00:00:32.820> teleport<00:00:33.450> plug-in<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.110> add<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.280> data

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to our teleport plug-in and add a data

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.780 
to our teleport plug-in and add a data
warping<00:00:36.870> command<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.620> we're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> be

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
warping command and we're going to be

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.799 
warping command and we're going to be
storing<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:41.070> warp<00:00:41.489> information<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
storing the the warp information and the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
storing the the warp information and the
spawn<00:00:43.140> information<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.430> separate<00:00:44.850> file

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
spawn information in a separate file

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.040 
spawn information in a separate file
that<00:00:45.750> we'll<00:00:45.930> call<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.739> data<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.020> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
that we'll call you know data so that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
that we'll call you know data so that
can<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> helpful<00:00:49.920> because<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.730> like

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
can be helpful because if you have like

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.110 
can be helpful because if you have like
a<00:00:51.510> lot<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> configuration<00:00:52.620> options<00:00:53.090> then<00:00:54.090> you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
a lot of configuration options then you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.520 
a lot of configuration options then you
want<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> keep<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.660> separate<00:00:55.079> from<00:00:55.260> all<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
want to keep them separate from all of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.470 
want to keep them separate from all of
your<00:00:55.730> information<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.940> first<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
your information so the first thing that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
your information so the first thing that
you're<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.770> already<00:01:02.219> have

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
you're going to do and I already have

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
you're going to do and I already have
all<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.820> code<00:01:03.210> done<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> walk

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
all this code done so I'm going to walk

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
all this code done so I'm going to walk
you<00:01:05.159> through<00:01:05.189> how<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.540> can

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you through how to do it and you can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.920 
you through how to do it and you can
look<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> description<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.729> link<00:01:08.930> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
look in the description for a link to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.910 
look in the description for a link to
see<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.950> code<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.560> need<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.799> do

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
see the code so first what we need to do

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
see the code so first what we need to do
is<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.670> made<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.330> config<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
is just how you made this config and the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
is just how you made this config and the
C<00:01:16.799> file<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.939> called<00:01:18.060> data<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> made

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
C file this one is called data so I made

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.109 
C file this one is called data so I made
the<00:01:19.140> file<00:01:19.409> configuration<00:01:19.979> data<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:20.790> D

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the file configuration data and then D

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.390 
the file configuration data and then D
file<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.220> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
file and now what you're going to do is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.070 
file and now what you're going to do is
in<00:01:23.610> your<00:01:23.880> setup<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.740> did<00:01:25.759> see<00:01:26.759> file<00:01:27.060> equals<00:01:27.509> new

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
in your setup I did see file equals new

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.710 
in your setup I did see file equals new
file<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
file and you know that's all there and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
file and you know that's all there and
now<00:01:31.259> um<00:01:32.360> if<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> configuration

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
now um if you do have a configuration

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.660 
now um if you do have a configuration
file<00:01:36.210> generate<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.560> don't<00:01:37.860> technically<00:01:38.549> need

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
file generate you don't technically need

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.030 
file generate you don't technically need
this<00:01:39.299> part<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:40.020> recommend<00:01:40.470> adding<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
this part I would recommend adding it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.399 
this part I would recommend adding it
just<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> habit<00:01:43.350> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
just because if you get in the habit of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740 
just because if you get in the habit of
doing<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.130> won't<00:01:44.340> accidentally<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.479> do

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
doing it you won't accidentally not do

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.560 
doing it you won't accidentally not do
it<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.549> also<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.360> there

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it and also like in this one there

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
it and also like in this one there
aren't<00:01:48.930> any<00:01:49.020> configuration<00:01:49.740> options<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
aren't any configuration options in the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.219 
aren't any configuration options in the
teleport<00:01:50.759> plugin<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.810> stopped<00:01:52.079> it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
teleport plugin so I just stopped it

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.950 
teleport plugin so I just stopped it
from<00:01:52.290> generating<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> config<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.060> what

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
from generating the config so what

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.319 
from generating the config so what
you're<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:56.329> you're

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you're going to want to do is you're

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420 
you're going to want to do is you're
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.170> exclamation<00:01:58.979> point<00:01:59.189> P

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
going to do this if exclamation point P

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.609 
going to do this if exclamation point P
get<00:01:59.939> data<00:02:00.119> folder<00:02:00.450> dot<00:02:00.600> exists<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.380> data

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
get data folder dot exists and the data

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
get data folder dot exists and the data
folder<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:03.270> plugins<00:02:03.689> folder<00:02:03.899> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
folder is in your plugins folder that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.100 
folder is in your plugins folder that
folder<00:02:04.829> with<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.430> name<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.060> plug-in<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
folder with the name of the plug-in and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.719

then in there is usually like the
configuration<00:02:09.390> file<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.319> whatever

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
configuration file or you know whatever

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.250 
configuration file or you know whatever
other<00:02:10.679> files<00:02:11.190> are<00:02:11.629> generated

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
other files are generated

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.229 
other files are generated
along<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.250> everything<00:02:14.909> is<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.120> if

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
along with it so everything is it if

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.509 
along with it so everything is it if
this<00:02:15.480> file<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.230> folder<00:02:16.709> doesn't<00:02:16.980> exist

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
this file if this folder doesn't exist

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.390 
this file if this folder doesn't exist
then<00:02:18.209> we're<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.750> try<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.500> create<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:20.189> but

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
then we're going to try to create it but

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.520 
then we're going to try to create it but
if<00:02:20.519> something<00:02:20.909> happens<00:02:21.019> then<00:02:22.019> we're<00:02:22.230> going<00:02:22.409> to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
if something happens then we're going to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.649 
if something happens then we're going to
I'm<00:02:23.459> gonna<00:02:23.610> are<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.000> log<00:02:24.239> we're<00:02:24.540> going

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
I'm gonna are going to log we're going

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.929 
I'm gonna are going to log we're going
to<00:02:24.750> say<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.439> we<00:02:26.069> couldn't<00:02:26.340> create<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
to say that that we couldn't create the

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.430 
to say that that we couldn't create the
teleport<00:02:27.560> folder<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.879> then<00:02:30.000> once<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.840> once

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
teleport folder and then once the once

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.970 
teleport folder and then once the once
were<00:02:31.739> sure<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:33.299> folder<00:02:34.019> exists<00:02:34.500> we're

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
were sure that this folder exists we're

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.979 
were sure that this folder exists we're
defining<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.819> file<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.510> we're<00:02:36.659> saying<00:02:36.870> that

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
defining the file and we're saying that

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.050 
defining the file and we're saying that
the<00:02:37.470> file<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:39.590> data<00:02:40.590> dot<00:02:40.859> yml<00:02:41.069> in<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.819> data

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the file is data dot yml in the data

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.899 
the file is data dot yml in the data
folder<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.829> what<00:02:44.400> we're<00:02:44.549> doing<00:02:44.819> is

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
folder and then what we're doing is

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.970 
folder and then what we're doing is
we're<00:02:45.090> saying<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.359> if<00:02:45.629> it<00:02:45.840> doesn't<00:02:46.260> exist<00:02:46.620> so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
we're saying that if it doesn't exist so

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.530 
we're saying that if it doesn't exist so
if<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.489> their<00:02:47.670> first<00:02:47.879> time<00:02:48.090> running<00:02:48.329> it

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
if this is their first time running it

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.720 
if this is their first time running it
or<00:02:48.690> they've<00:02:48.840> reset<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:50.069> doesn't<00:02:50.370> exist

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
or they've reset it and it doesn't exist

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.360 
or they've reset it and it doesn't exist
then<00:02:51.599> again<00:02:52.470> we're<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.739> try<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.099> create

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
then again we're going to try to create

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.849 
then again we're going to try to create
a<00:02:53.459> new<00:02:53.639> file<00:02:53.970> but<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.870> doesn't<00:02:55.079> work<00:02:55.409> then

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
a new file but if it doesn't work then

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.199 
a new file but if it doesn't work then
we're<00:02:56.010> just<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> say<00:02:56.609> that<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.060> could

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
we're just going to say that it could

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.309 
we're just going to say that it could
not<00:02:57.329> be<00:02:57.389> created<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.129> finally<00:02:59.129> we're

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
not be created and finally we're

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.569 
not be created and finally we're
declaring<00:03:01.319> this<00:03:01.409> file<00:03:01.650> configuration<00:03:02.400> called

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
declaring this file configuration called

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.349 
declaring this file configuration called
data<00:03:02.909> to<00:03:03.299> be<00:03:03.780> load<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.769> configuration<00:03:05.069> of<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
data to be load the configuration of the

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.050 
data to be load the configuration of the
D<00:03:06.629> file<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:07.799> just<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.549> did<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
D file and then just like we did for the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
D file and then just like we did for the
configuration<00:03:10.040> we<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.780> get<00:03:12.780> data<00:03:13.049> save<00:03:13.889> data

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
configuration we have get data save data

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.979 
configuration we have get data save data
and<00:03:14.489> reload<00:03:14.879> data<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:15.629> just<00:03:15.810> take

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
and reload data and you can just take

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.839 
and reload data and you can just take
this<00:03:16.109> get<00:03:16.349> config<00:03:16.739> save<00:03:16.980> config<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.489> reload

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
this get config save config and reload

this get config save config and reload
config<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.930> copy<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.590> paste<00:03:19.799> it

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
config you can just copy it and paste it

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.979 
config you can just copy it and paste it
change<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.760> data<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.329> then<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.870> know

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
change it to data and then you know

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.339 
change it to data and then you know
change<00:03:22.349> config<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.430> data<00:03:23.699> and<00:03:24.000> C<00:03:24.629> file<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.169> D

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.199 
change config to data and C file to D
file<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.949> you<00:03:26.340> know<00:03:26.459> change<00:03:26.669> whatever<00:03:27.030> you

the teleport plug-in and you know it'll

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.289 
the teleport plug-in and you know it'll
have<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> warp<00:03:43.230> command<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:44.099> set<00:03:44.639> warp<00:03:44.849> command
