00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.480
 yeah anyway 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.480
 to lead his boat 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.000
 web 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.800
 so his cut 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.830
 he 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.229
 Here it is good to desire the gaffe is 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.340
 do not know little trip with pierre esnault 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.100
 to your electric bike 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.390
 so what do you think about it 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.320
 pierre-alain first thank you because you 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.970
 made me discover something 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.250
 extraordinary landscape 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.869
 thus they have been wonderful 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.310
 it really is it's a paradise of 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.350
 mountain bike I think you have a lot of 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.670
 game that is loud and then say 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.750
 regards the bike it's true that me without 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.510
 a bike like that I would have been unable 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.190
 to be able to make a course like you 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.420
 made me do it but first I tell you 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.340
 thanks for their advanced part then 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.390
 on the other hand it is necessary to say to oneself that a 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.009
 bike like that it was had been I 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.200
 left with a priori thinking that 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.910
 I was going to feel the weight of the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.560
 room battery is a little heavy angel 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.509
 in fact when you're on the bike 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.880
 and we started to understand a little 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.200
 how does it work and on the one hand the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.479
 rear gears and secondly the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.009
 different power modes we have 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.509
 adapt to that and we are able to 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.200
 go everywhere with ease 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.759
 baffling 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.289
 I was ashamed to follow you with so much 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.520
 of ease in the bottles then 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.509
 that you were sweating 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.429
 but when we see the thighs that you have 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.360
 chosen it's really a beautiful a beautiful 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.360
 compliment for this bike
