00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
cup of water and made up as per
instructions<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.150> need<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.510> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
instructions so what we need to do is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.299 
instructions so what we need to do is
combine<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:31.140> these<00:00:31.230> ingredients<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.070> let's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
combine all these ingredients so let's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.410

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
now pour that into the curd cheese like

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
now pour that into the curd cheese like
that<00:00:40.700> there<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:42.110> next<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that there we go next to go in is the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.940 
that there we go next to go in is the
carnation<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:45.480> any<00:00:45.750> other<00:00:45.930> brand<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
condensed milk this is the one that's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.939 
condensed milk this is the one that's
similar<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.809> 400<00:00:54.809> grams<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.739> me

similar to 400 grams I think it's me
like<00:00:56.390> 397<00:00:57.390> grams<00:00:58.460> let<00:00:59.460> me<00:00:59.579> just<00:01:00.590> scrape<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
like 397 grams let me just scrape that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
like 397 grams let me just scrape that

camera I love this stuff right do that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.730 
camera I love this stuff right do that
and<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.740> quarter<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.850> cup<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
and now we have a quarter of a cup of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
and now we have a quarter of a cup of
lemon<00:01:16.740> juice<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> measured<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.180> it's

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
lemon juice when I measured it out it's

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.160 
lemon juice when I measured it out it's
basically<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.200> juice<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.640> lemon<00:01:21.170> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
basically one juice of one lemon and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.460 
basically one juice of one lemon and
it's<00:01:22.470> roughly<00:01:22.860> 50<00:01:23.729> milliliters<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.170> pour

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it's roughly 50 milliliters so you pour

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.120 
it's roughly 50 milliliters so you pour
that<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.100> well<00:01:26.900> right<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.799> i'm<00:01:29.009> just

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that in as well right and now i'm just

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.359 
that in as well right and now i'm just
going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.880> combine<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.530> stir<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
going to really combine that up stir it

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:41.600 
going to really combine that up stir it
well<00:01:34.100> until<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.400> combined<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:40.430> might<00:01:41.430> be

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
well until it's all combined I might be

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 
well until it's all combined I might be
here<00:01:41.790> sometime<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:43.290> obviously<00:01:43.590> could<00:01:43.740> use<00:01:43.920> an

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
here sometime you obviously could use an

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
here sometime you obviously could use an
electric<00:01:44.490> hand<00:01:44.729> risk<00:01:45.060> although<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.450> can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
electric hand risk although I can

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840 
electric hand risk although I can
imagine<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.930> might<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.610> splattering<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
imagine it might be a bit splattering a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.649 
imagine it might be a bit splattering a
bit<00:01:48.030> messy<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.470> once<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:53.299> looks<00:01:54.299> right

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
bit messy so once that's looks right

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.980 
bit messy so once that's looks right
once<00:01:55.229> that's<00:01:55.439> all<00:01:56.030> combined<00:01:57.030> through

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.770 

we're<00:02:00.409> going<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.890> pour<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:01.430> on<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.630> our

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
we're going to pour that on to our

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.250 
we're going to pour that on to our
biscuit<00:02:03.380> basis<00:02:03.950> from<00:02:04.700> earlier<00:02:05.119> on<00:02:06.189> right<00:02:11.260> it's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
biscuit basis from earlier on right it's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.890 
biscuit basis from earlier on right it's
nice<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.770> do<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.330> I'm<00:02:14.330> going<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.569> get<00:02:14.690> that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
nice to do this I'm going to get that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.559 
nice to do this I'm going to get that
nice<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:16.330> high<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.569> like<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:22.150> perfect<00:02:23.150> and

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
nice and high up like that perfect and

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.900 
nice and high up like that perfect and
then<00:02:23.840> we're<00:02:23.959> going<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> pop<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.739> back<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.819> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
then we're going to pop that back in the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.349 
then we're going to pop that back in the
fridge<00:02:26.090> ready<00:02:26.569> for<00:02:26.989> stage<00:02:27.290> 4
