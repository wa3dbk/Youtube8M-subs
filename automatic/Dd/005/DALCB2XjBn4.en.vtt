00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.100

 of the artists and of course also 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.060

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.460

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.240
 well it's a relationship many years ago 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.830
 that we are renewing all the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.750
 productions I do not know how much time you 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.450
 you participate in this type of activities 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.190
 in circles or in a year but in 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.720
 seven years total I know how much is 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.250
 linked in this life eight years 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.070
 tell me what it is that has to have 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.470
 one as an artist when he stops here 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.759
 in front of many people of course 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.200
 to do something as serious as it is 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.590
 ice skating and the way 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.440
 they do nerves 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.600
 people 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.390
 it is fundamental to be nervous about the truth 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.460
 if one does not have nerves, it is no longer 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.800
 to stay here on the slopes always 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.380
 it's nice that much discipline a lot 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.660
 I respect being very aware that it is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.900
 something very risky you can fall we have 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.510
 many injuries 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.340
 and a lot of work is a lot of discipline well 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.290
 you have traveled a lot for many 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.390
 places what if you give me a 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.340
 anecdote that has happened to you in the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.080
 presentation you are the one that animates 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.090
 constantly the one that motivates that all the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.220
 world so do not stay cold but the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.710

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.000

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.670

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.660

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.320
