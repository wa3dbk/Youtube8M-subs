hi<00:00:00.390> my<00:00:00.870> name<00:00:01.079> is<00:00:01.110> Chris<00:00:01.530> this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.310> second

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hi my name is Chris this is the second

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi my name is Chris this is the second
part<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.060> making<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.510> rolling<00:00:03.899> cube<00:00:04.200> in<00:00:04.950> the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
part of making a rolling cube in the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.130 
part of making a rolling cube in the
previous<00:00:05.549> video<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:06.089> started<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.839> make<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
previous video I started to make the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.350 
previous video I started to make the
flywheel<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.859> brake<00:00:08.099> construction<00:00:08.820> if

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
flywheel and the brake construction if

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.209 
flywheel and the brake construction if
you<00:00:09.510> haven't<00:00:09.870> seen<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.170> yet<00:00:10.380> check<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.099> out

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
you haven't seen it yet check it out

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.990 
you haven't seen it yet check it out
first<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:13.309> still<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> finish<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
first I still have to finish the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.420 
first I still have to finish the
flywheel<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> bracket<00:00:16.650> holder<00:00:17.070> servo

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
flywheel and make a bracket holder servo

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:27.270 
flywheel and make a bracket holder servo
motor

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.070 

here<00:00:28.280> you<00:00:28.430> see<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.760> servo<00:00:29.060> motor<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.660> control

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
here you see the servo motor to control

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.200 
here you see the servo motor to control
the<00:00:30.230> brake<00:00:30.529> attached<00:00:31.340> to<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:31.760> rest<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
the brake attached to the rest of the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.840 
the brake attached to the rest of the
construction<00:00:33.010> with<00:00:34.010> all<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.340> mechanical

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
construction with all the mechanical

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.240 
construction with all the mechanical
parts<00:00:34.880> finished<00:00:35.690> up<00:00:35.930> I'm<00:00:36.140> ready<00:00:36.739> to<00:00:36.980> do<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.130> test

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
parts finished up I'm ready to do a test

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.799 
parts finished up I'm ready to do a test
setup<00:00:37.880> I'm<00:00:39.010> using<00:00:40.010> an<00:00:40.280> Arduino<00:00:40.879> Uno<00:00:41.059> but<00:00:41.780> I

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
setup I'm using an Arduino Uno but I

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.450 
setup I'm using an Arduino Uno but I
will<00:00:42.080> replace<00:00:42.410> it<00:00:42.470> later<00:00:42.650> with<00:00:43.129> something

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
will replace it later with something

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.400 
will replace it later with something
smaller<00:00:45.730> it's<00:00:46.730> quite<00:00:46.970> a<00:00:47.000> simple<00:00:47.330> setup<00:00:47.720> when<00:00:48.379> I

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
smaller it's quite a simple setup when I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.320 
smaller it's quite a simple setup when I
push<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.769> button<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.489> fly<00:00:49.699> wheel<00:00:49.940> starts

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
push a button the fly wheel starts

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.840 
push a button the fly wheel starts
turning<00:00:50.420> when<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.290> release<00:00:51.680> I<00:00:51.949> stop<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.640> motor

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
turning when I release I stop the motor

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.030 
turning when I release I stop the motor
and<00:00:53.239> engage<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.809> break<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.350> hopefully

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
and engage it to break and hopefully

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.250 
and engage it to break and hopefully
this<00:00:55.699> will<00:00:55.879> do<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.180> trick<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:58.900> also<00:00:59.900> made<00:01:00.229> a

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
this will do the trick I also made a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.770 
this will do the trick I also made a
holder<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.860> simulates<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.519> cube<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.570> base

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
holder that simulates the cube the base

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.539 
holder that simulates the cube the base
is<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.049> little<00:01:03.080> bit<00:01:03.470> bigger<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.159> total

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
is a little bit bigger but the total

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.300 
is a little bit bigger but the total
weight<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:05.059> much<00:01:05.360> less<00:01:05.690> if<00:01:06.590> I<00:01:06.680> can't<00:01:06.950> flip<00:01:07.130> that

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
weight is much less if I can't flip that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.370 
weight is much less if I can't flip that
over<00:01:07.549> I<00:01:07.909> have<00:01:08.540> at<00:01:08.690> least<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:09.080> good<00:01:09.229> start<00:01:09.650> and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
over I have at least a good start and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.990 
over I have at least a good start and
here<00:01:12.380> we<00:01:12.470> go<00:01:14.080> mmm<00:01:15.080> not<00:01:15.619> really<00:01:15.650> it<00:01:16.400> starts<00:01:16.820> to

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
here we go mmm not really it starts to

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.789 
here we go mmm not really it starts to
flip<00:01:17.210> with<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.600> released<00:01:17.960> force<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.560> still

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
flip with the released force is still

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.950 
flip with the released force is still
too<00:01:19.010> small<00:01:21.520> my<00:01:22.520> camera<00:01:22.880> has<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.119> crappy<00:01:23.420> slow-mo

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
too small my camera has a crappy slow-mo

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:51.490 
too small my camera has a crappy slow-mo
feature<00:01:24.260> so<00:01:24.860> let's<00:01:25.070> see<00:01:25.250> what<00:01:25.400> happens

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.870 

you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.190> wheel<00:01:53.340> keeps<00:01:53.670> on

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you can see that the wheel keeps on

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.810 
you can see that the wheel keeps on
spinning<00:01:54.090> after<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.810> brake<00:01:55.049> engages<00:01:55.820> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
spinning after the brake engages so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.380 
spinning after the brake engages so
maybe<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.330> servo<00:01:57.780> has<00:01:57.930> two<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.350> torch<00:01:59.390> but

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
maybe the servo has two little torch but

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.359 
maybe the servo has two little torch but
I<00:02:00.420> use<00:02:00.690> these<00:02:00.869> bicycle<00:02:01.440> brake<00:02:01.710> pads<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
I use these bicycle brake pads for the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.029 
I use these bicycle brake pads for the
brake<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:03.930> too<00:02:04.409> hard

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
brake and I think they are just too hard

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.760 
brake and I think they are just too hard
I<00:02:05.070> ordered<00:02:05.940> softer<00:02:06.420> ones<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.590> wait

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
I ordered softer ones but I have to wait

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.580 
I ordered softer ones but I have to wait
a<00:02:07.830> couple<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.280> days<00:02:08.519> for<00:02:08.729> them<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.090> arrive<00:02:09.590> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
a couple of days for them to arrive so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.670 
a couple of days for them to arrive so
in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> meantime<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.459> gonna<00:02:11.730> clean<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.150> shop

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
in the meantime I'm gonna clean my shop

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.229 
in the meantime I'm gonna clean my shop
