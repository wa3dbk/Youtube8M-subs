00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.889
 So most allied yes 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.040
 somehow eyelashes stick with it 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 tantrums with me not otherwise but it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.340
 is also much easier in the beginning 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.080
 many mistakes 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 where it is much easier to do 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.930
 could stick with the opel so that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.250
 first thing you should pay attention to is that 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 the court becomes the vitter of glue he becomes 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.429
 is there 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.120
 because that's usually so very so 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 clear all-hard glue and that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 makes it even harder was that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.520
 dry very quickly and thereby 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.079
 could i still know she lives sick 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 yes that's the one side still off 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.860
 stands and the other glued and then 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.690
 it is already dry and the glue is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.120
 That's why it's the most important thing ever 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.610
 the eyelash glue i live every day 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.199
 then accept and I buy for 12 euros 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.280
 a winter glue the hero really that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.000
 all year 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 That's the dumbest glue that's all right 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.910
 a little bit of user in any case 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.409
 who knows it so well who he is on 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 at the beginning he only needs one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.850
 drop that will be transparent if 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.479
 he is dry now come medium 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.189
 Works for all beginners I have 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.659
 That's when I started that too 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.270
 bit too difficult with the whole 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.159
 I have long eyelashes to indicate 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.409
 then started with those here 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.270
 that's half the time I have with 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.060
 bought Douglas and yes they are just like that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 half the power one only makes 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.920
 you only on the outside turn 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.049
 that means you stick the eyelashes on the outside 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 in matusche and she actually almost 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.470
 no transition so dark that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.390
 one even my real eyelashes as 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.909
 used at that time means so if so 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.909
 I got a little practice from it 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.000
 I started 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:55.500
 yes to take the whole 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:02.430
 adele that on it and douglas wheelock 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:05.040
 this is the 111 black and the dazzles 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.570
 cost 5 euro 95 as the others 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.379
 cosplay on 595 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.840
 you can also get the full ones from 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.209
 Amec get the cost 15 euro 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.300
 I also think that's very good 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.770
 long, however, I find if you have the 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.000
 proper eyelash glue actually makes 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.470
 almost no difference more than 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.270
 only thing to look out for is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.190
 that maybe it's genuineness 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.110
 now also real hair but not because of 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.879
 quality or that is the longer holds 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.400
 what are labels maybe yet 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.230
 longer but just so that's better 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.550
 is because it is softer and easier to stick 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.709
 that can be better then bend 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.180
 and adapts even better to the eyes 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.620
 I would not recommend so thin too 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.500
 because they will be with the times 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.849
 I also thinner and that's why I am 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.900
 Also here a bit so bushy 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.069
 brought because now two weeks use 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.750
 then they will be thinner if you can 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.970
 also a bit of mascara goes over it 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.340
 which you actually do not mind 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.220
 Now we start 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.050
 I chose that first so that 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.090
 eyelash glue can dose better 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.310
 can you do that and then you can 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.090
 that really make a drop on it 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.650
 I hope you can if you just 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.959
 a pair of tweezers because it's easier too 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.489
 grab as with the fingers and I have 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.590
 the users still relatively close 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.690
 taken at the roots next 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.909
 then you would have an adhesive you now 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.239
 do it and do it once 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.239
 over it 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.530
 as you can see i have quite 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.300
 very minimal glue on it 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.830
 really so little if you are conditionally 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.200
 the whole tube has to be a year 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.300
 Really enough if you are me every day 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.130
 do every day in prÃ¼m and that's right 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.960
 me at least a year 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.870
 find the beginning must say now 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.760
 the Egyptians are better if you are 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.800
 now really waiting these 30 seconds 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.120
 until the need is dried out because 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.370
 then it is easier to eaves 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.600
 I do not slip, I actually do 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.770
 rather less because I am a 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.270
 bit if all pictures if you 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.040
 even a dream but as I said 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.050
 I now have more than succeeded 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:22.940
 is already two years exercise then puts 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:24.800
 that's simply because the tip is in the east 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.260
 the middle of the so decided 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:33.620
 has that a little stop and 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:35.720
 then you can still as much as 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.290
 easy it is quite difficult without 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.290
 mirror 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.910
 so 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.930
 so right on the other side 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:00.930
 now upgrade to first center 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.580
 then looks 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.750
 it creates now made without mirror 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.630
 I still have mirrors 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.790
 faster but if you have the glue 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.360
 Dried on behind is a US car 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.830
 the haier along mascara of clinic and 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.540
 so that's why they are happy 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.389
 take because I'm just artificial 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.610
 familiarize 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:34.889
 that's why I hope you can 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.900
 recognize well but I believed something 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.780
 nothing because of the mascara on it already 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.880
 But that's the one that has so little 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.280
 Bars are so thin 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.660
 that makes a lot just below the 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.190
 you will whisper and not around 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.290
 second the spikes to go 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.060
 That's why it was a perfect match 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.919
 genuine and artificial eyelashes 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.990
 that's what he likes so much 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.340
 also receives heldt course everything 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.640
 distracts when he does not want the likes of 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.640
 the wall clock is okay 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.839
 so do the whole day and day 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.430
 I hope you liked it me 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.749
 could help a little bit further 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.939
 I 'm happy if you my channel
