00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the things we're going to focus in on

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.870 
the things we're going to focus in on
these<00:02:03.909> plants<00:02:04.450> look<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.720> bit<00:02:04.930> sparse<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:06.430> did

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
these plants look a bit sparse I did

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.899 
these plants look a bit sparse I did
some<00:02:07.060> figuring<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:08.649> end<00:02:08.890> gets<00:02:09.519> shaded

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
some figuring and this end gets shaded

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.149 
some figuring and this end gets shaded
quite<00:02:10.269> a<00:02:10.299> bit<00:02:10.539> by<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.780> eucalyptus<00:02:11.439> tree<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.980> my

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
quite a bit by the eucalyptus tree to my

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.539 
quite a bit by the eucalyptus tree to my
right<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.989> do<00:02:14.140> not<00:02:14.260> get<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> full<00:02:14.890> Sun<00:02:15.220> all

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549

actually I don't mind my plants being a
little<00:02:26.830> bit<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.280> wilt<00:02:27.520> because<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.090> do<00:02:28.270> put<00:02:28.480> a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
little bit of a wilt because we do put a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.870 
little bit of a wilt because we do put a
bit<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.930> stress<00:02:29.230> on<00:02:29.440> them<00:02:29.740> which<00:02:30.310> helps<00:02:30.640> set

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
bit of a stress on them which helps set
