00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello today there are 5 reasons 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.470
 to eat meat 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.940
 reason number one high nutrient density 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.010
 meat and especially a pure sage 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.929
 a very high micronutrient density on 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.120
 Where can you get by small amounts 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.710
 a simple food great 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.180
 lots of vital vitamins and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.070
 to lead minerals 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 this with all herbal remedies too 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.460
 achieve is less and less 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.990
 less efficient and it is like 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.150
 disputed whether that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.039
 vital vitamin b12 at all 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.040
 without winning animal sources 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 basic number two environmental protection by 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.850
 correct animal husbandry like that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 grazing of cattle can surface 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 used more efficiently and infertile 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.739
 soils for the production of food 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.989
 be used 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.270
 with careful pasture management can 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 carbon dioxide bound under the dash 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 and by the cattle keeping the co2 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.350
 be dealt with effectively 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.850
 by extensive grazing can also 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.170
 the country will be cured by the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.969
 now again original 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.320
 Material cycles becomes the bottom of the soil 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.940
 the country will be rebuilt 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 more fruitful in contrast to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 Industrial animal husbandry is the code 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.729
 not a problem but an important one 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.790
 ingredient and continues to serve the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.049
 landscape management in the basic number three 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.720
 efficient protein supply and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.369
 amino acids profile meat contains a lot 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.170
 a lot of protein and that shows one for the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 people complete amino acids 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 profile on hardly any other food 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.369
 is capable of such a high density essential 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.710
 to provide amino acids and so it is 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.020
 an efficient nutrient supply is allowed 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.390
 Number four 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 fatty acid composition conjugated 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.189
 linoleic acid or cla is a fatty acid 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.470
 which practically only in ruminate animals 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.329
 she helps according to the current state 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.790
 the science of fat loss and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.680
 muscle building still there instructions 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 that they are the growth of tumors 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.329
 However, wittmann curbs cattle with 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.009
 cereals or concentrated feed like this in 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.299
 Industrial livestock farming is common 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.939
 lose within two weeks 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.619
 all conjugated linoleic acid too 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.299
 Here, then, the pure grazing is the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.700
 only meaningful alternative 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.130
 reason number five animal rights the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.100
 grazing allows a species-appropriate 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.780
 life of the entire ecosystem city 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.550
 to break up land for agriculture 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.739
 we can, for example, lean grass 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.480
 Both obtained through the extensive 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.340
 we can feed many grazing animals 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.319
 a species-appropriate happy life 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.520
 otherwise allow each other even 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.260
 could not afford 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.700
 and even the renowned animal rights activist 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 Peter singer is of the opinion that it 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.640
 makes more sense 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 to have many happy animals 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.020
 as no one and what follows from it 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.819
 to be able to judge this conclusively 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.970
 you should also know the other side 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:39.379
 five reasons no meat to eat and 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.379
 here is the conclusion 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.340
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.340
 next time
