00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.260
 with buh so hennes became 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.540
 weisweiler on bökelberg welcomes 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.189
 certainly prepared the former 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.990
 mönchengladbacher trainer the receipt 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.360
 less worried by the audience than 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.490
 what I initially on the field 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.500
 if the german master completely in 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.820
 White seemed to be the German Cup winner 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.130
 to roll over 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.110
 the boy of the sharks was in front of everybody 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.420
 He's going to join in with his long spurts 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.910
 the cologne defended against the ball and thus 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.100
 also know further unsettled the sharks 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.739
 resembles alan simon in size and stature 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.719
 and if he wants something more 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.730
 Assertiveness may win 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.620
 even a similarly important one 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.450
 players for monchengladbach again those 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.450
 here a corner of lines 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.050
 But then the cautious, careful 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.640
 but not as in mönchengladbach 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.100
 was heard 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.020
 oversleep they mostly chose the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.020
 right time for your advances 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:18.440
 Gerber the libero of the first FC today 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.350
 offensive as usual a surprise 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.930
 the 21 year old dieter prestin with the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.250
 Number 11 klinkhammer had great difficulty 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.869
 with the fast and tricky 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.880
 Cologne berti vogts in the fight with fun 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.790
 Ball on the right Mönchengladbacher 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.890
 defensive side on the other side the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.890
 duel klinkhammer against prestin 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.840
 However flanks do not belong to the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.860
 strengths of the cologne as well as 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.880
 score goals 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.110
 told about the strengths of del rey 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.580
 on the other hand, prestin seems to be in this 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.420
 relationship of the monks Gladbacher 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.410
 superior 1 0 in the 24 minute level 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.410
 by christine 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.439
 then berti vogts of the cologne took 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.439
 outside striker 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.530
 The Mönchengladbach captain was 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.530
 successful because he showed respect 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.230
 klinkhammer was now busy with 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.270
 van goal of kölner müller before of bonos 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.860
 shadowed it now with shepherd too 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.989
 do 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.849
 flexibility or uncertainty today 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.830
 the latter seemed to be responsible 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.650
 for the tasks changes in the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.930
 Mönchengladbach defense farm now 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.790
 more often in attack but also he did not wear 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.790
 to improve the monchengladbacher 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.090
 play by look at what kulik 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.090
 makes 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.540
 but then still a useful one 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.540
 flanks 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.500
 On this day one is usually only such 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.500
 scenes 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.860
 haphazard game through the middle and this 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.260
 although the german champion on the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.190
 external positions with simon and the sharks 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.190
 is particularly busy 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.370
 again the attempt by the center by 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.870
 to come and then attack you 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.870
 cologne style neumann gerber 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.610
 flohr 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.710
 tanner 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.800
 carpenter that looks better 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.530
 out as what monksgladbach and the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.580
 Cologne did not leave their foreign position 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.720
 However, referenced away 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.120
 logically the 2 0 by 9 at this 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.470
 hit in the fourth minute too late 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.470
 reaction from kneipp 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.680
 20 halftime five minutes after 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.360
 changing a shortened Bohndorf 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.440
 wonderful shot from 18 meters like the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.440
 torkamera shows 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.400
 Now the monks Gladbach were similar 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.400
 as at the beginning of the first half 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.740
 the superior team del rey too 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.520
 this shot from a different perspective in 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.940
 slowed down movement in this phase 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.550
 in however the 3 1 by christi the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.510
 second goal of the cologne unsustainable for 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.510
 Goalkeeper pops 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.419
 the german champion reacted with 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:51.099
 Resignation of one will these two 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.809
 gates to catch up 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:54.809
 At any rate, nothing to feel 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.980
 the ball and thus the game belonged to the 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.810
 cologne a counterpart of german 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.810
 cup winner with hallways 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.070
 shepherd alone against three kölner das 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.860
 insufficient konopka 4 far too 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.470
 1 4 gates on bökelberg against 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.270
 mönchengladbach you rarely see that and 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.400
 when would you have this season already 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.840
 once such pictures of cologne players 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.840
 and her coach 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.499
 from the previous twelve play in 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.549
 mönchengladbach, the cologne have only one 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:36.929
 only won 

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:39.179
 november 65 with 3 2 celebrated this time like 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:42.569
 the rare event with a clear 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:43.819
 win again by a counter dieter 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:49.729
 miller 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:49.729
 the ball is deflected to 5 to 1 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.330
 even a gate from simon singh can not 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.220
 shake that after this game that 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.940
 frown in monchengladbach 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.940
 outweighs
