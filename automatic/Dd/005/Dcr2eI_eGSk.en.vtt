 hello nice to meet you on board 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.130
 this morning and we will tackle the theme 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.110
 of kidding that is actually all 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.089
 business around the world of children 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.800
 when we know that in France for example 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.140
 there are more than eight hundred thousand 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.029
 births per year for five years and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.340
 this is a theme that is recurrent in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 the Anglo Saxon countries for example to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 united states 7 million women have 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 tried to this kind of business 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.529
 it's about reconciling mom's life 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
 while undertaking a new business 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.800
 and it's true that with the arrival 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.800
 internet and social networks 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.510
 this has radically changed the deal and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 this allowed to cut down a lot of 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.960
 barriers to entry 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
 the basic idea is often to simplify 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 the life of expectant mothers or moms 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.050
 who have babies and that was the right 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.809
 d'Auxerre was exploited but there is 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 still many opportunities and the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.149
 sub sectors of activity which are the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.070

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 first on the decoration side by 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.390
 example if you go to the art site 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.710

 and the basis of this idea was the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.280
 request from one of the two children of the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.409
