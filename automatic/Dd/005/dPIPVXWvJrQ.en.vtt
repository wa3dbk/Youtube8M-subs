an intake I've had on I had this product

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.609 
an intake I've had on I had this product
on<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.170> car<00:00:13.440> for<00:00:13.799> about<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.980> year<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
if something is worth it for the price

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
if something is worth it for the price
that's<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.869> makes<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.380> buyer

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619

outright I got it from a vendor on eBay
called<00:00:41.850> chrome<00:00:42.270> intakes<00:00:42.950> now<00:00:45.829> they're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
called chrome intakes now they're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
called chrome intakes now they're
supposedly<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.910> don't<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.390> if<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.600> make<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
supposedly I don't know if they make the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.049 
supposedly I don't know if they make the
claims<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.559> there<00:00:50.039> were<00:00:50.280> products<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.030> there

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
claims but there were products out there

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.740 
claims but there were products out there
that<00:00:51.510> were<00:00:51.600> much<00:00:51.840> more<00:00:52.140> expensive<00:00:53.480> least<00:00:54.480> two

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
that were much more expensive least two

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.389 
that were much more expensive least two
or<00:00:54.899> three<00:00:54.930> times<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:55.980> were<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
or three times more they were out in the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.000 
or three times more they were out in the
past<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.690> claimed<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.230> was<00:00:58.350> performance

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
past that claimed there was performance

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400 
past that claimed there was performance
increases<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.000> probably<00:01:00.660> might<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.140> true

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
increases it probably might be true

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.310 
increases it probably might be true
because<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.890> look<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.290> some

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
because if you look at you know some

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.370 
because if you look at you know some
minor<00:01:04.769> increased<00:01:05.689> probably<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.810> noticeable

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
minor increased probably not noticeable

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
minor increased probably not noticeable
but<00:01:07.619> something<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.619> notice<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> stock

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
but something and you notice the stock

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.350 
but something and you notice the stock
one<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.680> ribbed<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.460> smooth<00:01:14.880> inside

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
one is ribbed so it's not smooth inside

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.080 
one is ribbed so it's not smooth inside
and<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.530> does<00:01:16.740> affect<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:17.250> air<00:01:17.430> flow<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and that does affect your air flow so

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
and that does affect your air flow so
you<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.720> smoother<00:01:19.259> air<00:01:19.500> flow<00:01:19.799> with

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you have a little smoother air flow with

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.480 
you have a little smoother air flow with
this<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.689> way<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.830> was<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
this now the way I put this on was a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.170 
this now the way I put this on was a
little<00:01:23.729> bit<00:01:23.850> different<00:01:24.830> not<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.549> some

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
little bit different not that it's some

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.170 
little bit different not that it's some
major<00:01:27.470> modification<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.369> even

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
major modification but you know even

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
major modification but you know even
though<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.829> Cana<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.100> am<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> book<00:01:32.700> smart

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
though I Cana I am in the book smart

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.560 
though I Cana I am in the book smart
area<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.680> some<00:01:34.890> mechanical<00:01:35.400> things<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
area I do know some mechanical things so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.350 
area I do know some mechanical things so
I<00:01:36.600> thought<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.400> this<00:01:38.400> being<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.090> area

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I thought about this being in this area

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.100 
I thought about this being in this area
like<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> lower<00:01:41.369> airbox

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
like if you take out this lower airbox

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.600 
like if you take out this lower airbox
it's<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.710> three<00:01:43.979> screws<00:01:44.310> down

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it's actually just three screws down

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's actually just three screws down
here<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.049> take<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.439> out<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
here if you take this out it's not a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.340 
here if you take this out it's not a
problem<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> problem

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
problem you know it's not a problem

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.080 
problem you know it's not a problem
that's<00:01:49.619> normally<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> way<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> installed

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
that's normally a way this is installed

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.810 
that's normally a way this is installed
I<00:01:51.240> had<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> installed<00:01:52.530> above<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.670> it's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
I had this installed above this and it's

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
I had this installed above this and it's
actually<00:01:53.970> kind<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> rest<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
actually kind of rest right on the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.179 
actually kind of rest right on the
airbox<00:01:56.280> itself<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:58.649> necessarily

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
airbox itself so it's not necessarily

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.660 
airbox itself so it's not necessarily
needed<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.640> do<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> little

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
needed to do but there is a little

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.620 
needed to do but there is a little
opening<00:02:03.000> down<00:02:03.689> here<00:02:04.020> by<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> wheel<00:02:04.590> well<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
opening down here by the wheel well and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.309 
opening down here by the wheel well and
that's<00:02:06.630> where<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> wires<00:02:07.439> come<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
that's where the wires come up for the

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.860 
that's where the wires come up for the
positive<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.410> negative<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> battery

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
positive and negative on the battery
