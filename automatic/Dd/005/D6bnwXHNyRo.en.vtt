00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.829
 I repeat again, it's going to lead to this 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.120
 we give you click here in the download to find 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:38.600
 this says it can hurt 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.149
 the computer and this comes by default not 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.780
 I do not know if it comes by default in the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.610
 others the google chrome project if you 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.940
 they will download it equally and once 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.250
 what is the discharge zeal 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.410
 good where they downloaded it for 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.170
 example to me I leave it in the downloads 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.989
 what they have to do is go to a point 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.750
 where they have what would be the launch the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.760
 milestone did a version you already have 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.800
 to have create 1.6 point 4 as they do 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.230
 now in the launcher 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.590
 ana edith profile and here put in 16.45 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.420
 file and I and play off line and ready and there 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.300
 you would have to create them 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.440
 what they do is copy it 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.440
 they change the name 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.680
 and they put this name down 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.890
 and cinema 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.620
 and this comes in but I do it from another 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.660
 shortest form and ready I copy the name 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.430
 I'm going to change the name with my name 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.580
 updated with the name change the name 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.580
 now open in the j are 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.160
 I use by default so do not use the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.270
 notebook that I think would be the 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.820
 same shit here in and of this the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.970
 1.6 point 4 this what you have to do 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.950
 is to line the 1.0 point 4 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.710
 control plus v and they are copied if 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.060
 they keep it ready one is that they already did 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.560
 all of that goes to 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.650
 to 16.4 more reduced and fine where it has 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.959
 the java icon right click to 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.239
 open with winrar archiver this what 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.030
 we can close we pass it by one side 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.090
 this optimum we open on him with 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.209
 winrar archiver we process it for the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 other side this metal should eliminate 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.140
 one that was already removed 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.210
 they do more control to select everything 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.820
 and they pass it through these folders here 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.130
 down if they put it up here is if 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.380
 can put in all these folders in 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.020
 some of these three folders and that 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.510
 maybe it's the escrache so what 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.760
 pass for these folders below lean 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.790

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.930
