00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.069
 benefit bought it is a big timer that 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.110
 you apply before your foundation goes 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.849
 and the result is just 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.200
 really amazing 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.970
 they told that it really 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.859
 really just the outpatient reduces the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.900

 am really very unhappy I 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.109
 am glad that I sold this dollar and 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.900

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.690
 I discovered her on her blog and it 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.310
 actually movies are going on youtube 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.040
 and from day 1 I am real 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.859
 completely successful on and through but have 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.120
 I bought the familiar tools and brushes 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.889
 they always say told this 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.099
 have the same qualities as people 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.960
 other high-end brushes and orphans 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.550
 their just nicely affordable 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.730
 I just didn't get that from me immediately 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.120
 just order them all really all 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.980
 eye shadow brushes 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.540
 I just had to have it and I'm here 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.820
 really happy with was that too 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.650
 just really really good and I wanted to 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.480
 first real brand was the purchase 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.340
 she was found just really incredibly expensive 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.770
 and I am really very happy with the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.060
 know this and have found the following 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.590
 product they have purchased 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.680
 that is the fit me foundation of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.420

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.680
 also really sold because its the same 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.000
 color used 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.310
 I find it very difficult 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.050
 to really have a suitable bit of it 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.420
 to find my skin color that is a moment 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.160
 a bit the same skin color and one 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.750
 same hair color and then I really thought 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.790
 why this should just really it 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.800

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.640
 quality gives us other high end 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.700
 and brands and so I have this 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.590

 and the way they go to make up 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.480
 is just so subtle in it 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.980
 classic that I really thought of that 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.960

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.370
 just really so so here I am whole too 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.470
 I'm glad wrap it through her go 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.300
 and then she has taken care of it 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.070
 that I end up with more products 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.290
 by her letter and buy and that is 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.170
 namely the means skin finish stress 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.360

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.160
 really a super start the highlighter really 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.360
 I don't use a lot of youtubers 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.700
 also had a lot with others 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.270
 but we are really over the line 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.790
 drawn 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.830
 because she keyless bra in her tutorials 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.450
 always just so incredibly beautiful that I 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.130
 really thought that I just have to have 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.520
 so it's the midline skin finish 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.590
 family dye and gentle one i am going to 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.720

 channel is also just called chloe morello and 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.990

 seen very often with others 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.630
 youtube users but really specific 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.490
 because of her I started to buy this and you 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.440
 are really very happy with it 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.210
 and I also have this concealer but a member 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.370
 purchased and this is mine 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.870
 it is called the pro concealer quick palette 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.639
 it is the color medium 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.830
 it is actually a kind of cream 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.110
 concealer and this inside through as well 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.220
 to use for contouring 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.290
 you can do this under the concealer brush 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.150
 apply just below the cheekbone 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.040
 or from the sides of your nose and you 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.260
 forehead and those at the bottom of the jaw line 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.610
 and with the foundation class you can do it 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.620
 blending out very nicely and it 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.030
 result is just really super 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.910
 english last i agree with you 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.419

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.010
 51 make such beautiful makeup looks and 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.410
 it finally time for care 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.590
 that I want things mascara from benefit 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.300
 went to buy and I find myself and me 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.550
 a little less feyenoord 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.139
 the result of which is soo 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.240
 nice but that is also because they just 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.080
 very beautiful full natural eyelashes already 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.790
 has 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.830
 and when she went to wear it just lay 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.570
 what she wore false eyelashes with me 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.880
 unfortunately not so with me it is just like that
