00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
unlike most DeWalt tools you actually

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.300 
unlike most DeWalt tools you actually
have<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> put<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> together<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:22.470> motor

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
have to put it together the the motor

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.550 
have to put it together the the motor
and<00:01:23.640> saw<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.330> comes<00:01:24.630> disconnected<00:01:25.290> from<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and saw here comes disconnected from the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.640 
and saw here comes disconnected from the
base<00:01:26.540> ten<00:01:27.540> minutes<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> had<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.470> put

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
base ten minutes and I had it all put

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
base ten minutes and I had it all put
together<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> big<00:01:29.460> deal<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.850> all

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
together not a big deal at all

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.260

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
not constantly constantly refilling it

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.340 
not constantly constantly refilling it
is<00:03:11.500> also<00:03:11.829> pretty<00:03:12.100> nice<00:03:12.299> it's<00:03:13.299> kind<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.630> loud

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
is also pretty nice it's kind of loud

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.309 
is also pretty nice it's kind of loud
that's<00:03:14.680> my<00:03:14.829> only<00:03:15.010> sort<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.750> Ian<00:03:16.750> downside<00:03:17.290> I

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
that's my only sort of Ian downside I

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.490 
that's my only sort of Ian downside I
think<00:03:17.709> it's<00:03:17.859> a<00:03:17.920> lot<00:03:18.069> louder<00:03:18.790> than<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.600> him<00:03:20.019> and

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
think it's a lot louder than the him and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.270 
think it's a lot louder than the him and
case<00:03:20.709> or<00:03:21.370> MK<00:03:21.700> saws<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.859> forget<00:03:23.859> which<00:03:23.950> one<00:03:24.010> of

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
case or MK saws I forget which one of

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.240 
case or MK saws I forget which one of
the<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.370> think<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.819> was<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.120> 101<00:03:25.900> or<00:03:26.109> 102<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:27.220> I

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the I think it was the 101 or 102 that I

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.340 
the I think it was the 101 or 102 that I
had<00:03:27.519> used<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.269> views<00:03:28.660> before<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.260> that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
had used in the views before and that

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.129 
had used in the views before and that
was<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.530> lot<00:03:29.739> quieter<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.459> guess<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:31.030> word<00:03:31.989> of

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
was a lot quieter so I guess a word of

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.870 
was a lot quieter so I guess a word of
warning<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.680> louder<00:03:32.950> if<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.370> like<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.579> quiet

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
warning it is louder if you like a quiet

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.569 
warning it is louder if you like a quiet
tool<00:03:34.150> but<00:03:36.420> yeah<00:03:37.420> it's<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:38.040> pretty<00:03:39.040> slick

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
tool but yeah it's a pretty slick

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.819 
tool but yeah it's a pretty slick
