so uh from the factories makes to ten to

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.080 
so uh from the factories makes to ten to
the<00:01:28.570> crank<00:01:28.960> but<00:01:29.860> with<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.370> 5-speed<00:01:30.790> it<00:01:30.940> feels

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
the crank but with the 5-speed it feels

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.430 
the crank but with the 5-speed it feels
way<00:01:31.270> more<00:01:31.300> than<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.750> that's<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.200> way<00:01:32.290> it's

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
way more than that that's the way it's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.320 
way more than that that's the way it's
geared<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:32.980> geared<00:01:33.310> for<00:01:33.370> acceleration<00:01:33.970> step

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
geared it's geared for acceleration step

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.280 
geared it's geared for acceleration step
top<00:01:34.570> speed<00:01:34.870> so<00:01:35.370> you<00:01:36.370> know<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.810> makes<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.170> more

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290
