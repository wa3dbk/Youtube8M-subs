00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
this this one I was able to just trace

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
this this one I was able to just trace
using<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> old<00:02:09.209> gasket<00:02:10.069> poke<00:02:11.069> some<00:02:11.400> holes<00:02:12.170> in

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.320 
using the old gasket poke some holes in
the<00:02:13.290> cardboard<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.569> stick

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
the cardboard and then I can just stick

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.480 
the cardboard and then I can just stick
the<00:02:18.330> bolts<00:02:18.720> in<00:02:18.990> there<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:19.920> order<00:02:20.160> them

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
they go in the bag and then I put it in

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.059 
they go in the bag and then I put it in
the<00:02:27.900> box<00:02:29.209> with<00:02:30.209> all<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> other<00:02:30.630> bags<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.590> each

the box with all the other bags and each

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.770 
the box with all the other bags and each
box<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.819> different<00:02:33.150> part<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> engine

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
box is a different part of the engine

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.910 
box is a different part of the engine
okay<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.830> got<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.130> little<00:02:35.480> rack<00:02:36.480> that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
okay so I got this little rack that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.910 
okay so I got this little rack that
pulled<00:02:37.920> out<00:02:38.099> from<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.880> back<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.620> case

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
pulled out from the back of this case

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.650 
pulled out from the back of this case
here<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.090> engages<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.050> clutch<00:02:43.440> release

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
here and engages in this clutch release

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.300 
here and engages in this clutch release
yes<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:45.900> opinion<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.650> moves<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.010> rack

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
yes it be opinion if it moves this rack

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.160 
yes it be opinion if it moves this rack
around<00:02:48.830> okay<00:02:49.830> then<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:51.569> half<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
around okay then it this half of the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.510 
around okay then it this half of the
damper

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
damper

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.050 
damper
slides<00:02:54.300> out<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.780> there<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:56.070> I'm<00:02:56.160> splines<00:02:56.610> and

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
slides out of there so I'm splines and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.400 
slides out of there so I'm splines and
then<00:02:57.180> there's<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.420> damper<00:02:57.960> spring<00:02:59.150> and<00:03:00.410> that's

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
then there's a damper spring and that's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.100 
then there's a damper spring and that's
all<00:03:01.560> they<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.800> come<00:03:01.980> apart<00:03:02.100> for<00:03:02.520> now<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:04.020> the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
all they can come apart for now so the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.350 
all they can come apart for now so the
next<00:03:04.320> step<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.980> pry<00:03:05.220> up<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.430> stalking<00:03:05.910> on

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
next step is to pry up the stalking on

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.980 
next step is to pry up the stalking on
this<00:03:06.690> damper<00:03:07.290> cam<00:03:07.950> knot<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:09.210> for<00:03:09.870> that

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
this damper cam knot and for that

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.960 
this damper cam knot and for that
usually<00:03:10.320> use<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> little<00:03:10.680> chisel<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.460> don't<00:03:11.850> have

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
usually use a little chisel I don't have

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.260 
usually use a little chisel I don't have
a<00:03:12.060> chisel<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.540> small<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.260> this

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
a chisel that small but I have this

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.760 
a chisel that small but I have this
screwdriver<00:03:15.270> bit<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:15.870> fits<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:16.320> there<00:03:16.500> so

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
screwdriver bit that fits in there so

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.440 
screwdriver bit that fits in there so
try<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.160> pound<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.460> in<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.120> see<00:03:18.270> how<00:03:18.330> that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
try and pound that in and see how that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:47.230 
try and pound that in and see how that
works

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.220
