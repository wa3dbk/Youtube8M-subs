00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:11.939
Hey! Today I will make a Brûlée with Strawberry 
and Mascarpone,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.890
which will be super refreshing and it's very, very 
quick to make.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.367
After that, two versions of Cointreau Fizz. 
Let's make it?

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:26.032
I start chopping 200g of strawberries - without 
the green part, it can be chopped anyway,

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:29.449
it's supposed to be rustic. You can do it your way.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.993
I will add 2 tbsps of castor sugar in these strawberries

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:36.061
and also the zest of 1/2 lemon.

00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:40.226
The smell is so good I've decided to add the zest
of a whole lemon,

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:45.425
so do the same at your house and also squeeze half 
of it in the mixture.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.497
Add 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar reduction.

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:54.663
I am using this one I always have, but you can use
anyone you want to.

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:57.920
It can be the regular balsamic vinegar, too.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.712
If you've never tried to add some balsamic vinegar 
in your strawberries, do this because

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:06.627
it enhances the flavors and it's very tasty.

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:08.317
Now I just have to combine.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:16.499
While my strawberries are marinating here, I will
whip 150g of fresh cream.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:21.132
If you don't have the fresh cream, don't worry.

00:01:21.132 --> 00:01:27.651
You can use the heavy cream in tin, or even better, if
you can find double cream, use it.

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:31.003
It's even tastier.

00:01:31.272 --> 00:01:36.950
I will whip the fresh cream with 1/3 cup of castor sugar,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.648
2 tablespoons of Cointreau and 1 vanilla bean.

00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:48.047
The vanilla is just to add some flavor.

00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:52.865
You can add 1/2 tbsp of vanilla essence, but if you don't

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.029
want to, it's okay.

00:01:54.029 --> 00:02:00.035
When it's almost stiff, I add 250g of mascarpone cheese.

00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:04.517
If you can't find mascarpone, it can be cream cheese
or ricota cheese, also.

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:09.982
I keep beating until have a mousse.

00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:14.116
The strawberries are almost ready and very juicy.

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:18.502
I won't use the juice in my pot, I will try to drain

00:02:18.502 --> 00:02:22.697
until have just strawberries to fill the bottom of my ramekins.

00:02:22.697 --> 00:02:27.995
Don't throw away the liquid. I'll use this liquid to make my

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:33.725
Strawberry Cointreau Fizz, but you can also save the juice
in the refrigerator for a couple days

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:37.138
and make a delicious pancake.

00:02:37.138 --> 00:02:41.241
Then, you pour this juice on top and it's just perfect!

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.640
So here in my ramekin, I will add some strawberry

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.508
and then fill with some mascarpone mousse. Take it 
to the fridge for 30 minutes

00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:52.796
to cool.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.591
To make my first version of Cointreau Fizz, I keep the base,

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:09.760
which is nothing more than 50ml of Cointreau,
100ml of sparkling water,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.298
the juice of 1/2 lemon and lots of ice,

00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:17.657
which I will add 3 chopped strawberries, 
5 basil leaves

00:03:17.657 --> 00:03:22.196
and 20ml of that strawberry juice left.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.672
It's gonna be good!

00:03:37.428 --> 00:03:43.354
For the second Cointreau Fizz, I will use the same base,
which is nothing more than 50ml of Cointreau,

00:03:43.862 --> 00:03:49.939
100ml of sparkling water, the juice of 1/2 lemon and some
ice to finish, but I will add my secret:

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.638
20ml of gooseberry syrup, which will sweeten the cocktail

00:03:54.638 --> 00:04:01.435
and to add a funny thing, I will finish with some pink
and cute cotton candy.

00:04:11.907 --> 00:04:17.675
To finish the Mascarpone Brûlée, take it to the freezer 
for 30 minutes before using the blowtorch,

00:04:17.675 --> 00:04:23.377
or it will melt. When the top is frozen,

00:04:23.377 --> 00:04:29.910
add some crystal sugar and arrange it on top of the pot.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.566

take a look to learn.

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:39.446
Use the blowtorch on top a little bit,

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.548
wait to cool and burn the remaining.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:46.180
Then, wait for 5 minutes until the crust is ready.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.663
When you crack it, is so tasty and delicious. It's
perfect with the mascarpone and strawberry

00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:52.729
mousse.

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:58.768
If you can't find a blowtorch, you know: you can use
a spoon and heat it in the stove.

00:04:58.768 --> 00:05:01.997
Then, you burn the sugar.

00:05:01.997 --> 00:05:07.890
But every time you'll burn the sugar, you have to
wash this spoon - and then, I advice you

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.837
to use some hot water to clean the spoon.

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:17.533
Heat it again, burn a little bit more and keep
doing this until your sugar

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:19.298
is all burnt.

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:31.893
Well, and this was another episode, I hope you liked it!

00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:37.028
I made the Mascarpone Brûlée with strawberries, which is
perfect! Make it at home because it's very quick and easy.

00:05:37.028 --> 00:05:42.111
I also made two versions of Cointreau Fizz, both
delicious.

00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:49.481
The gooseberry one has a tutti frutti flavor and the 
strawberry one is fancy with a delicious flavor.

00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:50.985
Both are very tasty.

00:05:50.985 --> 00:05:55.117
A cocktail for who has a sweeter tooth and another one
for who has a sophisticated taste.

00:05:55.117 --> 00:06:00.563
I hope you liked it, click on "like" right down 
and share it in every social network.

00:06:00.563 --> 00:06:04.513
We see each other next show with another 
delicious recipe. Bye!
