00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
here and then two lines of four and then

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.650 
here and then two lines of four and then
1-2<00:00:39.629> centered<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:41.309> diagonally<00:00:42.149> from

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
to give you your creeper face and if you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.000 
to give you your creeper face and if you
want<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.470> make<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:39.910> just<00:05:40.910> easier<00:05:41.350> go<00:05:42.350> ahead<00:05:42.650> and

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
want to make it just easier go ahead and

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.610 
want to make it just easier go ahead and
do<00:05:43.610> the<00:05:43.729> little<00:05:43.820> face<00:05:44.180> and<00:05:44.450> then<00:05:44.780> just<00:05:45.229> make<00:05:45.440> it

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
do the little face and then just make it

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.890 
do the little face and then just make it
light<00:05:45.830> green<00:05:46.130> wall<00:05:46.400> but<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.180> think<00:05:47.539> this<00:05:47.690> looks

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
light green wall but I think this looks

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.420 
light green wall but I think this looks
more<00:05:48.229> realistic<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.039> for

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
more realistic and for

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.640 
more realistic and for
generally<00:05:49.760> there<00:05:50.000> are<00:05:50.120> not<00:05:50.330> enough<00:05:50.600> shades<00:05:51.320> of

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
generally there are not enough shades of

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.690 
generally there are not enough shades of
green<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:53.380> perfect<00:05:54.380> this<00:05:54.650> make<00:05:54.980> it<00:05:55.160> like<00:05:55.490> the

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
green to perfect this make it like the

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.810 
green to perfect this make it like the
perfect<00:05:55.970> creeper<00:05:56.570> face<00:05:56.810> so<00:05:57.680> this<00:05:58.100> is<00:05:58.280> about<00:05:58.550> as

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
perfect creeper face so this is about as

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.480 
perfect creeper face so this is about as
close<00:05:58.850> as<00:05:59.090> you're<00:05:59.420> gonna<00:05:59.570> get<00:05:59.890> so<00:06:00.890> I<00:06:00.920> hope<00:06:01.340> you
