that<00:02:12.270> would<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.959> cool<00:02:13.110> feature

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that would be a really cool feature

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.700 
that would be a really cool feature
really<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.460> Apple<00:02:14.820> doing<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:16.050> Apple

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
really see Apple doing that and Apple

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.440 
really see Apple doing that and Apple
would<00:02:16.890> definitely<00:02:17.340> embrace<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.060> use<00:02:18.240> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
would definitely embrace the use of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.040 
would definitely embrace the use of
buttons<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.770> past<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.250> was<00:02:20.400> very<00:02:21.180> easy<00:02:21.900> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
buttons in the past it was very easy to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.110 
buttons in the past it was very easy to
just<00:02:22.320> game<00:02:22.620> using<00:02:23.190> your<00:02:23.220> touch<00:02:23.550> screen<00:02:23.910> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
just game using your touch screen and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.000 
just game using your touch screen and
everything<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.110> seems<00:02:25.320> like<00:02:25.500> Apple<00:02:25.890> has

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
everything but it seems like Apple has

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.010 
everything but it seems like Apple has
finally<00:02:26.490> listened<00:02:26.910> because<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.750> next

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
finally listened because the next

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.380 
finally listened because the next
version<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.410> iOS<00:02:28.680> will<00:02:29.370> include<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.940> standard

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
version of iOS will include a standard

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.060 
version of iOS will include a standard
way<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:30.810> game<00:02:31.230> developers<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.950> add

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
way for game developers to add

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.130 
way for game developers to add
controller<00:02:32.550> support<00:02:33.120> now<00:02:33.630> thinking<00:02:34.020> of

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
controller support now thinking of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.290 
controller support now thinking of
adding<00:02:34.410> controller<00:02:34.950> support<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.090> would<00:02:36.180> be

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
adding controller support it would be

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.960 
adding controller support it would be
very<00:02:36.480> similar<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.800> Apple<00:02:38.010> iCade<00:02:38.790> and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
very similar to the Apple iCade and

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.050 
very similar to the Apple iCade and
everything<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:40.740> if<00:02:41.400> Apple<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:41.940> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
everything like that so if Apple was to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.730 
everything like that so if Apple was to
embrace<00:02:42.270> buttons<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.020> would<00:02:43.200> make<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> game

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
embrace buttons this would make the game

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.160 
embrace buttons this would make the game
console<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.430> much<00:02:44.880> better<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.540> all<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
console a much better and all the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.770 
console a much better and all the
headline<00:02:46.710> iOS<00:02:47.220> games<00:02:47.520> would<00:02:47.970> be<00:02:48.030> very<00:02:48.480> good

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
headline iOS games would be very good

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.650 
headline iOS games would be very good
with<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:50.730> will<00:02:50.970> definitely<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.630> a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
with it and this will definitely be a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.460 
with it and this will definitely be a
hit<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.170> Apple<00:02:53.150> now<00:02:54.150> apples<00:02:54.750> game<00:02:54.990> center<00:02:55.380> is

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
hit for Apple now apples game center is

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.010 
hit for Apple now apples game center is
now<00:02:55.650> approaching<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.760> being<00:02:57.090> three<00:02:57.510> years<00:02:57.540> old

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and while it started out rough it has

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.240 
and while it started out rough it has
since<00:03:00.330> matured<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.470> could<00:03:01.620> really<00:03:01.890> see

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
since matured and I could really see

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.690 
since matured and I could really see
Apple<00:03:02.640> implemented<00:03:03.210> game<00:03:03.450> center<00:03:03.870> much<00:03:04.350> like

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
Apple implemented game center much like

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.730 
Apple implemented game center much like

for<00:03:09.990> their<00:03:10.140> game<00:03:10.380> console<00:03:10.860> because<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.490> would

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
for their game console because it would

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.700

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.680 
storage a chunk of which is occupied by
the<00:04:07.230> operating<00:04:07.709> system<00:04:07.940> also<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.090> not

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
the operating system also it's not

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.490 
the operating system also it's not
unheard<00:04:10.040> for<00:04:11.040> iOS<00:04:11.370> games<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.970> exceed<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.870> one

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
unheard for iOS games to exceed a one

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.190 
unheard for iOS games to exceed a one
gigabyte<00:04:13.890> in<00:04:14.100> size<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:15.120> now<00:04:15.420> Apple<00:04:15.810> should

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
gigabyte in size and now Apple should

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.890 
gigabyte in size and now Apple should
probably<00:04:16.440> put<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.160> around<00:04:17.340> whatever<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.390> Xbox

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
probably put it around whatever the Xbox

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.650 
probably put it around whatever the Xbox
one<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.410> ps4<00:04:19.590> has<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.580> add<00:04:21.030> for<00:04:21.299> storage

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
one and ps4 has it I add for storage

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.780 
one and ps4 has it I add for storage
space<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:21.930> probably<00:04:22.440> 500<00:04:23.070> gigabytes<00:04:23.490> will<00:04:23.640> do

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
space so probably 500 gigabytes will do

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.230 
space so probably 500 gigabytes will do
the<00:04:23.940> trick

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
the trick

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.570 
the trick
but<00:04:25.140> Apple<00:04:25.470> would<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.979> to<00:04:26.100> think<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.430> making

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
but Apple would have to think of making

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.379 
but Apple would have to think of making
it<00:04:26.880> cost<00:04:27.120> of

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
it cost of

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.689 
it cost of
effective<00:04:27.689> simultaneously<00:04:28.680> but<00:04:29.310> Apple

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
effective simultaneously but Apple

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.369 
effective simultaneously but Apple
should<00:04:29.909> probably<00:04:30.509> make<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.930> cost-effective

00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:31.379 
should probably make it cost-effective

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:34.939 
should probably make it cost-effective
and<00:04:32.069> make<00:04:32.849> it<00:04:32.999> somewhere<00:04:33.419> between<00:04:33.629> the<00:04:34.289> Xbox

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
and make it somewhere between the Xbox

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.189 
and make it somewhere between the Xbox
one<00:04:35.219> the<00:04:35.249> PlayStation<00:04:35.909> 4<00:04:35.939> and<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.330> Wii<00:04:36.449> U<00:04:36.689> now

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
one the PlayStation 4 and the Wii U now

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.860 
one the PlayStation 4 and the Wii U now
respectively<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:38.099> we<00:04:38.249> use<00:04:38.490> $300<00:04:39.479> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
respectively that we use $300 the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.129 
respectively that we use $300 the
PlayStation<00:04:40.469> 4<00:04:40.499> is<00:04:40.939> $400<00:04:41.939> and<00:04:42.150> Xbox<00:04:42.779> one<00:04:42.990> is

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
PlayStation 4 is $400 and Xbox one is

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.010 
PlayStation 4 is $400 and Xbox one is
$500<00:04:44.069> I<00:04:44.279> think<00:04:44.759> a<00:04:44.879> great<00:04:45.120> base<00:04:45.419> price<00:04:45.779> would

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
$500 I think a great base price would

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.909 
$500 I think a great base price would
probably<00:04:46.319> be<00:04:46.499> around<00:04:47.360> $350<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.680> $370<00:04:49.680> and

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
probably be around $350 to $370 and

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.709 
probably be around $350 to $370 and
Apple<00:04:50.460> would<00:04:50.610> probably<00:04:50.969> nail<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.479> price

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
Apple would probably nail the price

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:53.839 
Apple would probably nail the price
right<00:04:52.169> there<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:52.770> they<00:04:52.979> cannot<00:04:53.279> mess<00:04:53.550> up<00:04:53.699> on

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
right there and they cannot mess up on

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.279 
right there and they cannot mess up on
the<00:04:53.879> price<00:04:54.120> kind<00:04:54.539> of<00:04:54.629> like<00:04:54.719> they<00:04:54.870> did<00:04:55.050> with<00:04:55.169> the

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
the price kind of like they did with the

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.489 
the price kind of like they did with the
iPad<00:04:55.710> Mini<00:04:55.949> has<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.729> be<00:04:56.879> straight<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:58.139> to<00:04:58.469> the

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
iPad Mini has to be straight and to the

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.679 
iPad Mini has to be straight and to the
point<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.979> have<00:04:59.129> a<00:04:59.159> good<00:04:59.430> price<00:04:59.759> point<00:05:00.029> for<00:05:00.270> it

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
point and have a good price point for it

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.779 
point and have a good price point for it
to<00:05:00.810> sell<00:05:01.020> like<00:05:01.229> hotcakes<00:05:01.439> so<00:05:02.279> overall<00:05:02.490> that's

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
to sell like hotcakes so overall that's

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.059 
to sell like hotcakes so overall that's
all<00:05:03.060> my<00:05:03.270> opinions<00:05:03.719> on<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:03.990> Apple<00:05:04.319> I<00:05:04.439> play<00:05:04.800> game

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
all my opinions on the Apple I play game

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.189 
all my opinions on the Apple I play game
console<00:05:05.610> there's<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.150> lot<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.539> think<00:05:06.719> of<00:05:06.960> but<00:05:07.169> I

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
console there's a lot to think of but I

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.320 
console there's a lot to think of but I
really<00:05:07.590> think<00:05:07.740> if<00:05:07.979> one<00:05:08.550> company<00:05:08.759> wants<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.150> do

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
really think if one company wants to do

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.589 
really think if one company wants to do
it

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
it

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.779 
it
Apple<00:05:10.349> would<00:05:10.469> definitely<00:05:10.949> pull<00:05:11.159> it<00:05:11.279> off<00:05:11.400> and

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
Apple would definitely pull it off and

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.200 
Apple would definitely pull it off and
if<00:05:11.939> they<00:05:12.090> did<00:05:12.270> before<00:05:12.419> Google<00:05:12.990> then<00:05:14.210> Apple

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
if they did before Google then Apple

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.850 
if they did before Google then Apple
would<00:05:15.360> probably<00:05:15.659> be<00:05:15.779> awarded<00:05:16.259> for<00:05:16.409> doing<00:05:16.680> that

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
would probably be awarded for doing that

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.159 
would probably be awarded for doing that
and<00:05:17.099> it<00:05:17.759> would<00:05:17.939> be<00:05:18.060> much<00:05:18.210> more<00:05:18.449> revolutionary

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
and it would be much more revolutionary

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.019 
and it would be much more revolutionary
