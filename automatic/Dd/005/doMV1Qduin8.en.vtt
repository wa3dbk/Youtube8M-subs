00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
like we do in the other series so the

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.340 
like we do in the other series so the
next<00:05:06.410> opponent<00:05:07.160> has<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.610> 42<00:05:08.180> free<00:05:08.870> one<00:05:09.110> of

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
next opponent has a 42 free one of

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.380 
next opponent has a 42 free one of
formation<00:05:09.950> we're<00:05:10.070> ruining<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.460> cam<00:05:10.700> Aguero<00:05:11.150> it

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
formation we're ruining it cam Aguero it

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.960 
formation we're ruining it cam Aguero it
can<00:05:11.600> also<00:05:11.990> let<00:05:12.380> cam<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.860> I<00:05:13.280> think<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.640> second

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
can also let cam and I think that second

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.170 
can also let cam and I think that second
involves<00:05:14.180> Suarez<00:05:14.690> up<00:05:14.810> front<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:16.670> says<00:05:16.880> so

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
involves Suarez up front and it says so

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.280 
involves Suarez up front and it says so
