00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.480
 I greet you friends with you I am Vasiliev 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 gennady 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.450
 and the site play info where that point ru and in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.940
 today's video tutorial I want you 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.280
 show how your right hand should 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.060
 play guitar 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 and so there are two options 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.880
 playing guitar breaks 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.100
 the project of it is being smashed with your fingers and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 play with a mediator 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.880
 each of these species has its own technique 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.210
 spilling so let's start with 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.190
 playback passing when playing 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 fingers of your hand should 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.149
 positioned as follows in 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.200
 first it should be as much as possible 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.270
 relaxed and dangle over a wall outlet 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.760
 socket is the hole of the part that is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.850
 approximately at the outlet level at 1 suck 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.590
 your right hand doesn't need to be there somehow 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 to strain when there to push out 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.789
 relax on so she should 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.129
 be above the level of the outlet before i'm your brush 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.690
 should be a little bent about 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.479
 Now in this way as if you 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.479
 hold some kind of round thing don't know 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.950
 is there an apple or a tennis ball to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.549
 your hand was like this 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.979
 slightly bent over 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.909
 you can not rely on the stand is not necessary 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.540
 somehow there is surgery with a small brush on 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.180
 the top deck of the thread should just hang 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.470
 above the chair 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.030
 operation can only thumb on 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.189
 chair 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.229
 something like this in databases 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.509
 playing fingers through each 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.890
 finger is in charge of your desk and so 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.700
 index and middle and nameless 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.860
 fingers 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.649
 responsible for playing the first three 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.990
 the strings i.e. the nameless part we jump 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.299
 1 country middle finger for the second side 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.950
 and index for the third string 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.540
 big fingers are responsible for 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.830
 playing 6 5 and 4 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.160
 I'll show you a simple example. 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.160
 busting 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.110
 in such a way to play 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.700
 fingering 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.459
 further brute force and can be played at 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.000
 aid mediator here is completely different 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.010
 equipment 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.740
 when playing mediator is not necessary 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.510
 to brush and sat down on tuesday there need 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.630
 to and edge brush your hands 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.100
 leaned on a stand about here 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.830
 this is the way the brush should 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.020
 located parallel to the stand they 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.600
 parallel to the strings in some way 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.610
 your brush should be positioned 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.650
 should also be a little bit when bent 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.650
 in this way 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.410
 this is the way to break through 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.200
 and a mediator on this this lesson came up 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.459
 By the end with you was Vasily in Gennady 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.660
 and play site and mfp guitar. ru 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.660
 see you in the next video tutorials
