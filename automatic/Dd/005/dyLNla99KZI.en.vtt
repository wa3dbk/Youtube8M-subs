00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
site we felt it was a really good

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:31.429 
site we felt it was a really good
example<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:29.119> being<00:01:30.119> able<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> use<00:01:30.659> fencing<00:01:31.200> -

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
example of being able to use fencing -

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.629 
example of being able to use fencing -
to<00:01:31.889> affect<00:01:32.399> a<00:01:32.689> positive<00:01:33.689> change<00:01:33.990> by<00:01:34.829> fencing

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639

to affect a positive change by fencing
it<00:01:35.759> off<00:01:35.880> especially<00:01:36.209> with<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.929> southern

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it off especially with the southern

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
it off especially with the southern
block<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.189> noticing<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.329> we're

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
block we're really noticing that we're

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.330 
block we're really noticing that we're
getting<00:01:39.780> much<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.229> production<00:01:40.799> from<00:01:41.039> it<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
getting much more production from it and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
getting much more production from it and
we're<00:01:41.969> getting<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.389> diversity<00:01:42.990> there's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
we're getting more diversity there's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.109 
we're getting more diversity there's
certainly<00:01:43.469> more<00:01:43.619> clover<00:01:43.950> now<00:01:44.279> in<00:01:44.459> the<00:01:44.609> in<00:01:44.969> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
certainly more clover now in the in the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.139 
certainly more clover now in the in the
pasture<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.069> we're<00:01:47.069> certainly<00:01:47.459> gaining<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
pasture and we're certainly gaining a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.999 
pasture and we're certainly gaining a
lot<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.569> think<00:01:49.020> overall<00:01:49.350> we're<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.889> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
lot I think overall we're going to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
lot I think overall we're going to
probably<00:01:50.249> find<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.329> perennial<00:01:51.749> pasture

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
probably find that the perennial pasture

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.679 
probably find that the perennial pasture
the<00:01:52.380> phalaris<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:53.219> be<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.429> lot<00:01:53.670> stronger<00:01:54.029> by

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the phalaris will be a lot stronger by

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.019 
the phalaris will be a lot stronger by
rotating<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:55.679> giving<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.399> spell<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
rotating and giving it a spell and

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.120 
rotating and giving it a spell and
making<00:01:57.810> more<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.529> with<00:01:59.039> the

and<00:02:12.150> one<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.450> ways<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.690> persists<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
and one of the ways that persists is it

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.530 
and one of the ways that persists is it
has<00:02:14.610> buds<00:02:15.330> at<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.630> dormant<00:02:16.020> through<00:02:16.200> summer<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
has buds at a dormant through summer and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.479 
has buds at a dormant through summer and
while<00:02:18.540> rotational<00:02:19.440> grazing<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:20.010> important

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
while rotational grazing is important

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.640 
while rotational grazing is important
particularly<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:20.909> the<00:02:21.140> newer<00:02:22.140> types<00:02:22.470> of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
particularly for the newer types of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.380 
particularly for the newer types of
phalaris<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:24.269> it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
phalaris is that it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.990 
phalaris is that it
helps<00:02:25.660> preserve<00:02:26.080> those<00:02:26.500> buds<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.400> for

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
helps preserve those buds so for

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.790 
helps preserve those buds so for

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
know that at the end of the year but we

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.070 
know that at the end of the year but we
are<00:02:54.640> certain<00:02:55.120> about<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.420> clover<00:02:55.870> there's<00:02:56.050> a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
are certain about the clover there's a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.170 
are certain about the clover there's a
lot<00:02:56.230> more<00:02:56.350> clover<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.010> with<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.730> clover

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
lot more clover and with that clover

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.640 
lot more clover and with that clover
it's<00:02:58.300> putting<00:02:58.480> nitrogen<00:02:59.140> back<00:02:59.320> into<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.530> soil

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
it's putting nitrogen back into the soil

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.949 
it's putting nitrogen back into the soil
to<00:02:59.950> feed<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.370> grasses<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.420> it's<00:03:01.540> got<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.870> be

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
to feed the grasses so it's got to be

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.780 
to feed the grasses so it's got to be
producing<00:03:02.410> more<00:03:02.470> grass<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.430> long<00:03:03.580> term

and looking at that it's telling me that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.170 
and looking at that it's telling me that
we're<00:03:22.690> using<00:03:23.370> utilizing<00:03:24.370> all<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.550> feed<00:03:24.880> but

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
we're using utilizing all the feed but

we're using utilizing all the feed but
we're<00:03:25.540> getting<00:03:25.840> as<00:03:25.959> much<00:03:26.140> productivity<00:03:26.739> out

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
of the other two paddocks so it's only

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.729 
of the other two paddocks so it's only
great<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.840> see<00:03:31.989> what<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.200> results<00:03:32.530> are<00:03:32.620> like

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
great to see what the results are like

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.860 
great to see what the results are like
at<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.010> end<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.370> know<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:34.329> there<00:03:34.540> gonna<00:03:34.660> be<00:03:34.750> a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
at the end you know is there gonna be a

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.660 
at the end you know is there gonna be a
higher<00:03:35.049> stocking<00:03:35.380> rate<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.579> know

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
higher stocking rate is the you know

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.430 
higher stocking rate is the you know
forest<00:03:37.150> composition<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.900> clover

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
forest composition and clover

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.470 
forest composition and clover
composition<00:03:38.920> gonna<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.579> know<00:03:39.670> match<00:03:40.150> what's

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
composition gonna you know match what's

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.259 
composition gonna you know match what's
going<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:40.900> over<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:41.200> those<00:03:41.380> other<00:03:41.530> paddocks

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
going on over in those other paddocks

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.490 
going on over in those other paddocks
yeah<00:03:43.269> we<00:03:43.510> can<00:03:43.690> find<00:03:43.900> out<00:03:44.019> by<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.230> end<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
yeah we can find out by the end of the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.850 
yeah we can find out by the end of the
year

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
year

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.259 
year
it'll<00:03:45.040> be<00:03:45.100> very<00:03:45.130> interesting<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.790> say<00:03:46.030> well

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
it'll be very interesting to say well

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:58.650 
it'll be very interesting to say well
yeah
