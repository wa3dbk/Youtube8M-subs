introduces<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.859> air<00:00:23.100> automatically<00:00:23.939> so

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
introduces that air automatically so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.080 
introduces that air automatically so
it's<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> very<00:00:24.930> simple<00:00:25.380> process<00:00:25.880> now<00:00:26.880> our

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's a very simple process now our

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.240 
almond milk that might be a little brand
dependence<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.350> might<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> change

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
dependence so you might like to change

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.340 
dependence so you might like to change
your<00:00:38.370> brand<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.360> get<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> best<00:00:39.870> result<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
your brand to get the best result that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.160 
your brand to get the best result that
you<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.559> from<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> system<00:00:41.660> also<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.809> rely<00:00:43.140> on

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
you can from the system also we rely on

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
you can from the system also we rely on
making<00:00:43.649> sure<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> steam<00:00:44.460> wand<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.789> very

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
making sure that the steam wand is very

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.209 
making sure that the steam wand is very
clean<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.469> important<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.039> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
clean so it's really important that you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.220 
clean so it's really important that you
have<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> damp<00:00:47.700> cloth<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.660> right

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
have a damp cloth like this one right

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.990 
have a damp cloth like this one right
next<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.649> espresso<00:00:50.129> machine<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
next to your espresso machine so that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
next to your espresso machine so that
you're<00:00:51.239> able<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.660> wipe<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> steam<00:00:52.289> wand<00:00:52.440> as

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you're able to wipe the steam wand as

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.260 
you're able to wipe the steam wand as
soon<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.160> finish<00:00:53.489> texture<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:53.969> milk

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
soon as you finish texture in your milk

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.720 
soon as you finish texture in your milk
it's<00:00:54.960> also<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.620> important<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> wipe<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's also really important to wipe the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's also really important to wipe the
tip<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.449> keep<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> holes<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> tip<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
tip to keep the holes in the tip of the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
tip to keep the holes in the tip of the
steam<00:00:58.980> wand<00:00:59.039> clear<00:00:59.550> because<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.390> affects

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
steam wand clear because that affects

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.049 
steam wand clear because that affects
the<00:01:00.930> performance<00:01:01.430> even<00:01:02.430> though<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> steam

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the performance even though the steam

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.149 
the performance even though the steam
wand<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.480> auto<00:01:03.750> purge<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> help<00:01:04.650> these<00:01:04.860> holes

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
wand will auto purge to help these holes

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
wand will auto purge to help these holes
stay<00:01:05.430> clear<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.150> still<00:01:06.450> very<00:01:06.659> important

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
stay clear it's still very important

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.250 
stay clear it's still very important
that<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.740> wipe<00:01:07.979> them<00:01:08.189> directly<00:01:08.700> after<00:01:09.240> use<00:01:09.420> so

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that you wipe them directly after use so

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
that you wipe them directly after use so

should purge right before you actually
text<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.790> milk<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.869> tap<00:02:07.110> down

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
amount that you can texture just

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.030 
amount that you can texture just

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
generally what I like to do is I like to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.020 
generally what I like to do is I like to
fill<00:02:29.020> up<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.380> V<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.890> jug<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.370> seems

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
fill up to the V on the jug that seems

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.270 
fill up to the V on the jug that seems
to<00:02:31.150> be<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.300> good<00:02:31.570> balance<00:02:31.810> between<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.920> small

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
amount and a large amount another tip is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.910 
amount and a large amount another tip is
always<00:02:37.000> use<00:02:37.210> really<00:02:37.630> cold<00:02:37.900> milk<00:02:38.110> if<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.620> can

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
always use really cold milk if you can

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.470 
always use really cold milk if you can
have<00:02:39.070> your<00:02:39.220> milk<00:02:39.400> jug<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.910> fridge<00:02:40.180> prior

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
have your milk jug in the fridge prior

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.870 
have your milk jug in the fridge prior
to<00:02:40.630> use<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.500> means<00:02:41.740> it'll<00:02:42.100> start<00:02:42.490> out<00:02:42.580> really

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
to use that means it'll start out really

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.820 
to use that means it'll start out really
cold<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.959> steam<00:02:44.230> will<00:02:44.260> actually<00:02:44.650> have

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
cold and the steam will actually have

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.890 
cold and the steam will actually have
longer<00:02:45.310> contact<00:02:45.790> time<00:02:46.000> with<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.240> milk<00:02:46.540> to

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
longer contact time with the milk to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.080 
longer contact time with the milk to
generate<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.560> really<00:02:47.950> nice<00:02:48.190> silky<00:02:48.760> texture

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
generate that really nice silky texture

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.930 
generate that really nice silky texture
that<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.720> get<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.080> cafe<00:02:50.440> or<00:02:50.470> coffee<00:02:50.890> shop<00:02:51.190> so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
that you get in a cafe or coffee shop so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.880 
that you get in a cafe or coffee shop so
let<00:02:52.180> me<00:02:52.300> show<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.540> how<00:02:52.720> simple<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.350> use

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.880 

lift<00:02:56.890> up<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.160> steam<00:02:57.400> wand<00:02:57.550> just<00:02:58.620> put<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.709> milk

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
lift up the steam wand just put the milk

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.020 
lift up the steam wand just put the milk
in<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.160> center<00:03:00.459> tap<00:03:01.090> down<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.450> start<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:03.790> right

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
in the center tap down to start so right

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.210 
in the center tap down to start so right
now<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.270> system<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:04.959> introducing<00:03:05.470> air<00:03:05.830> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
now the system is introducing air and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.370 
now the system is introducing air and
steam<00:03:06.640> into<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.030> milk<00:03:07.240> so<00:03:07.930> we're<00:03:08.260> getting

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
steam into the milk so we're getting

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.770 
steam into the milk so we're getting
heating<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.490> nook<00:03:09.670> thing<00:03:09.970> stretched<00:03:10.480> by

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
heating and the nook thing stretched by

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.690 
heating and the nook thing stretched by
increasing<00:03:11.380> its<00:03:11.500> volume<00:03:11.709> flow<00:03:12.160> at<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.490> same

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
increasing its volume flow at the same

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.970 
increasing its volume flow at the same
time<00:03:13.030> they're<00:03:13.510> not<00:03:13.690> two<00:03:13.959> separate<00:03:14.350> processes

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
time they're not two separate processes

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.500 
time they're not two separate processes
they're<00:03:15.489> actually<00:03:15.880> happening<00:03:16.300> together

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
they're actually happening together

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.770 
they're actually happening together
simultaneously<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:18.340> our<00:03:18.580> LCD<00:03:19.150> we<00:03:19.300> have<00:03:19.480> live

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
simultaneously on our LCD we have live

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.750 
simultaneously on our LCD we have live
temperature<00:03:20.290> feedback<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.280> can<00:03:21.489> see

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
temperature feedback so you can see

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.520 
temperature feedback so you can see
exactly<00:03:22.269> what<00:03:22.570> temperature<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.110> milk<00:03:23.410> of

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
exactly what temperature the milk of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.100 
exactly what temperature the milk of
that<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.790> we've<00:03:24.970> set<00:03:25.209> our<00:03:25.330> milk<00:03:25.570> for<00:03:25.750> sixty

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
that so we've set our milk for sixty

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.650 
that so we've set our milk for sixty
degrees<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:27.130> when<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.430> milk<00:03:27.820> reaches<00:03:28.209> sixty

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
degrees so when the milk reaches sixty

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.210 
degrees so when the milk reaches sixty
the<00:03:29.620> steam<00:03:30.250> system<00:03:30.670> will<00:03:30.880> automatically<00:03:31.420> stop

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the steam system will automatically stop

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.040 
the steam system will automatically stop
all<00:03:33.220> we<00:03:33.400> need<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.700> do<00:03:33.820> now<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.209> lift<00:03:34.720> up<00:03:34.840> our

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
all we need to do now is lift up our

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.670 
all we need to do now is lift up our
steam<00:03:35.350> one<00:03:35.590> drop<00:03:36.190> down<00:03:36.370> our<00:03:36.550> jug<00:03:37.440> why<00:03:38.440> power

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
steam one drop down our jug why power

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.949 
steam one drop down our jug why power
steam<00:03:38.950> one<00:03:39.130> with<00:03:39.280> our<00:03:39.400> damp<00:03:39.670> cloth<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.720> wipe

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
steam one with our damp cloth just wipe

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.930 
steam one with our damp cloth just wipe
the<00:03:41.170> tip<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.530> clean<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.860> tip<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.280> then<00:03:42.820> we

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
the tip to clean the tip and then we

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.370 
the tip to clean the tip and then we
push<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.420> back<00:03:43.570> down<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.989> home<00:03:44.170> position

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
push it back down to the home position

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.860 
push it back down to the home position
it'll<00:03:45.220> automatically<00:03:45.790> purge<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.209> clean<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
it'll automatically purge to clean the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.810 
it'll automatically purge to clean the
tip<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.769> what<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.040> need<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.310> do<00:03:48.430> now<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.790> just

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
tip so what you need to do now is just

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.050 
tip so what you need to do now is just
tap<00:03:49.209> down<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.570> jug<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:51.670> will<00:03:51.760> settle

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
tap down the jug and that will settle

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.640 
tap down the jug and that will settle
any<00:03:52.299> large<00:03:52.600> bubbles<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.140> are<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.440> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
any large bubbles that are in the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.729 
any large bubbles that are in the
textured<00:03:54.310> milk<00:03:54.459> and<00:03:54.730> then<00:03:55.299> just<00:03:55.540> swirl<00:03:55.900> quite

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
textured milk and then just swirl quite

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.190 
textured milk and then just swirl quite
vigorously<00:03:57.250> just<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.090> integrate<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.750> texture

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
vigorously just to integrate the texture

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.170 
vigorously just to integrate the texture
and<00:03:59.380> bring<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.010> silkiness<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.760> milk<00:04:01.000> all

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
and bring the silkiness of the milk all

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.020 
and bring the silkiness of the milk all
together<00:04:01.360> it<00:04:02.170> should<00:04:02.500> look<00:04:02.709> like<00:04:03.010> white<00:04:03.670> paint

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
together it should look like white paint

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.720 
together it should look like white paint
or<00:04:04.450> white<00:04:04.810> chrome<00:04:05.170> very<00:04:05.860> very<00:04:06.070> shiny<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
or white chrome very very shiny and

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.600 
or white chrome very very shiny and
really<00:04:07.299> silky<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.680> if<00:04:08.830> you<00:04:08.980> get<00:04:09.160> milk<00:04:09.430> that's

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
really silky so if you get milk that's

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.880 
really silky so if you get milk that's
not<00:04:09.880> really<00:04:10.239> silky<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.900> well<00:04:11.200> textured<00:04:11.709> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
not really silky and well textured and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.440 
not really silky and well textured and
has<00:04:12.130> large<00:04:12.340> bubbles<00:04:12.880> or<00:04:13.090> maybe<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.510> bit<00:04:13.750> thin<00:04:14.019> in

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
has large bubbles or maybe a bit thin in

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.420 
has large bubbles or maybe a bit thin in
texture<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:15.349> probably<00:04:15.709> means<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.160> the

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
texture that probably means that the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.039 
texture that probably means that the
holes<00:04:16.669> in<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.970> tip<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.389> steam<00:04:17.630> wand<00:04:17.690> are

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
holes in the tip of the steam wand are

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.009 
holes in the tip of the steam wand are
not<00:04:18.560> fully<00:04:18.889> clear<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.060> weight<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.419> unblock

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
not fully clear so the weight of unblock

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.590 
not fully clear so the weight of unblock
those<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.680> just<00:04:22.130> use<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.520> cleaning<00:04:22.790> tool<00:04:23.120> now

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
those is just use the cleaning tool now

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.210 
those is just use the cleaning tool now
the<00:04:23.660> cleaning<00:04:24.050> tools<00:04:24.260> located<00:04:24.470> in<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.010> tool

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
the cleaning tools located in the tool

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.520 
the cleaning tools located in the tool
storage<00:04:25.550> tray<00:04:25.910> just<00:04:26.540> behind<00:04:26.870> our<00:04:27.080> drip<00:04:27.290> tray

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
storage tray just behind our drip tray

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.320 
storage tray just behind our drip tray
now<00:04:28.310> there's<00:04:28.550> our<00:04:28.730> tool<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:29.090> we're<00:04:29.180> going<00:04:29.210> to

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
now there's our tool that we're going to

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.060 
now there's our tool that we're going to
use<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:29.690> clean<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.020> tip<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:30.470> all<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.860> need<00:04:31.040> to

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
use to clean the tip and all you need to

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.969 
use to clean the tip and all you need to
do<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:32.000> just<00:04:32.360> insert<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.110> tiny<00:04:33.889> little

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
do is just insert that tiny little

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.200 
do is just insert that tiny little
needle<00:04:34.490> just<00:04:35.360> into<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> five<00:04:36.020> holes<00:04:37.000> in<00:04:38.000> the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
needle just into the five holes in the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.940 
needle just into the five holes in the
tip<00:04:38.450> just<00:04:39.169> to<00:04:39.260> make<00:04:39.410> sure<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.770> they're

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
tip just to make sure that they're

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.830 
tip just to make sure that they're
unblocked<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:41.180> will<00:04:41.330> improve<00:04:41.660> the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
unblocked and that will improve the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.659 
unblocked and that will improve the
performance<00:04:41.919> now<00:04:42.919> if<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:43.430> doesn't

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
performance now if that doesn't

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.310 
performance now if that doesn't
completely<00:04:44.240> improve<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.780> performance

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
completely improve the performance

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.250 
completely improve the performance
perhaps<00:04:45.950> they<00:04:46.160> may<00:04:46.760> need<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.000> deeper<00:04:47.419> clean<00:04:47.690> now

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
perhaps they may need a deeper clean now

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.350 
perhaps they may need a deeper clean now
the<00:04:48.320> way<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.590> do<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> deeper<00:04:49.250> clean<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.700> using<00:04:50.300> a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
the way you do a deeper clean is using a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.190 
the way you do a deeper clean is using a
damp<00:04:50.630> cloth

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
damp cloth

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.440 
damp cloth
we<00:04:51.740> just<00:04:51.979> unscrew<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.669> tip<00:04:52.880> from<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.180> steam

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
we just unscrew the tip from the steam

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.650 
we just unscrew the tip from the steam
wand<00:04:54.580> making<00:04:55.580> sure<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.880> it's<00:04:56.030> not<00:04:56.210> too<00:04:56.450> hot

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
wand making sure that it's not too hot

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.960 
wand making sure that it's not too hot
if<00:04:56.780> you've<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.110> recently<00:04:57.350> used<00:04:57.889> it<00:04:58.070> now<00:04:58.250> once

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
if you've just recently used it now once

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.969 
if you've just recently used it now once
you<00:04:59.090> have<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.389> tip<00:04:59.600> off<00:04:59.810> it's<00:05:00.229> very<00:05:00.560> easy<00:05:00.800> to

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
you have the tip off it's very easy to

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.129 
you have the tip off it's very easy to
clean<00:05:01.280> it's<00:05:01.880> much<00:05:02.150> easier<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.630> clean<00:05:02.750> with<00:05:03.020> our

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
clean it's much easier to clean with our

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.379 
clean it's much easier to clean with our
pin<00:05:03.380> tool<00:05:03.590> when<00:05:03.860> it's<00:05:04.010> off<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:05.000> we<00:05:05.090> can<00:05:05.240> also

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
pin tool when it's off and we can also

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.659 
pin tool when it's off and we can also
soak<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.080> in<00:05:06.169> some<00:05:06.350> hot<00:05:06.500> water<00:05:06.770> all<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:07.520> need
