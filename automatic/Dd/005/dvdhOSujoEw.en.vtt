00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.440 
no other choice because otherwise he
wouldn't<00:03:48.660> say<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.590> knows<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.799> woman<00:03:50.519> well<00:03:51.420> I

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
wouldn't say you knows a woman well I

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.120 
wouldn't say you knows a woman well I
mean<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.900> guess<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.260> could<00:03:52.319> say<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:52.799> he

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
mean I guess you could say that but he

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.650 
mean I guess you could say that but he
didn't<00:03:53.340> want<00:03:53.459> he's<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.760> one<00:03:53.940> killed<00:03:54.269> too<00:03:54.450> so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
didn't want he's the one killed too so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.910 
didn't want he's the one killed too so
I'm<00:03:54.720> guessing<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.200> he's<00:03:55.440> saying<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.829> I

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
I'm guessing that he's saying that I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.740 
I'm guessing that he's saying that I
killed<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.370> because<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:57.030> had<00:03:57.209> something<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.569> do

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
killed it because it had something to do

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.550 
killed it because it had something to do
with<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.019> war<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:59.690> the<00:04:00.690> new<00:04:00.870> children<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
with the war so the new children you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.569 
with the war so the new children you
know<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.829> Nora<00:04:02.069> telling<00:04:02.340> them<00:04:02.459> they

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
know like Nora telling them they

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.220 
know like Nora telling them they
shouldn't<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.060> go<00:04:03.209> through<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.599> but

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
shouldn't have to go through it but

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.940 
shouldn't have to go through it but
anyway<00:04:04.859> we<00:04:05.040> flashed<00:04:05.340> forward<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:06.030> so

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
anyway we flashed forward to that so

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.190 
anyway we flashed forward to that so
that<00:04:07.950> leaves<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.579> question<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.329> how<00:04:09.720> did
