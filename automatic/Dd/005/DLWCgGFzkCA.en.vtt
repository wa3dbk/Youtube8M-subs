all<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:01.079> we're<00:00:01.829> doing<00:00:01.920> in<00:00:02.159> science

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
all right we're doing in science

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.050 
all right we're doing in science
experiment<00:00:03.210> with<00:00:03.330> milk<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.929> little<00:00:04.350> Milken<00:00:05.060> as

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
experiment with milk a little Milken as

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.690 
experiment with milk a little Milken as
you<00:00:06.870> can<00:00:07.020> see<00:00:07.200> now<00:00:08.130> what<00:00:08.280> we're<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.580> do

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
you can see now what we're going to do

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.169 
you can see now what we're going to do
is<00:00:08.790> we're<00:00:08.910> gonna<00:00:09.000> add<00:00:09.210> green<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:12.200> couple<00:00:13.200> drops

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
is we're gonna add green a couple drops

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.230 
is we're gonna add green a couple drops
one<00:00:15.179> two<00:00:17.359> now<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.020> very<00:00:19.260> careful

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
one two now you have to be very careful

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.679 
one two now you have to be very careful
use<00:00:21.240> how<00:00:21.420> much<00:00:21.570> color<00:00:22.460> in<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.539> can

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
use how much color in there how it can

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.960 
use how much color in there how it can
affect<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:27.090> next<00:00:28.019> step<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:29.340> had<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> different

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
affect so next step we had a different

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.179 
affect so next step we had a different
color<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.390> food<00:00:30.570> dye<00:00:30.750> yellow<00:00:31.470> green<00:00:31.890> orange

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
color of food dye yellow green orange

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:42.880 
color of food dye yellow green orange
whatever<00:00:33.829> drop<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.430> drop<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:40.730> another<00:00:41.730> color

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
whatever drop one drop to another color

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
whatever drop one drop to another color
okay<00:00:44.480> one<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:47.180> as<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.539> they're<00:00:48.690> kind

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
okay one two as you can see they're kind

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
okay one two as you can see they're kind
of<00:00:48.899> bonding<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.039> green<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.520> taking<00:00:50.969> over

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
of bonding the green is like taking over

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.920 
of bonding the green is like taking over
because<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.660> more<00:00:54.590> darker<00:00:55.590> darker<00:00:56.219> probably

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
because it's more darker darker probably

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.529 
because it's more darker darker probably
now<00:00:57.930> we're<00:00:58.079> gonna<00:00:58.170> add<00:00:58.350> some<00:00:58.530> red<00:00:58.760> one<00:01:00.140> too<00:01:01.170> oh

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
now can do this science dawn whatever

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.520 
now can do this science dawn whatever
soap<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.510> want<00:01:32.690> soap<00:01:33.620> so<00:01:34.130> show<00:01:34.580> me<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.820> soap<00:01:35.530> put

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
look you can get that full color in

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.590 
look you can get that full color in
makes<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.250> look<00:01:55.369> real<00:01:55.580> cool<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.210> mean<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:56.540> just

such<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> simple<00:01:57.380> look<00:01:57.500> science<00:01:57.890> experiment

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
such a simple look science experiment

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.150 
such a simple look science experiment
that<00:01:58.460> makes<00:01:58.729> everything<00:01:59.000> look<00:01:59.149> real<00:01:59.600> cool

that makes everything look real cool

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.469 
that makes everything look real cool
after<00:02:01.160> you're<00:02:01.369> done<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:01.700> stir<00:02:02.180> up<00:02:02.300> the

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
after you're done you just stir up the

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.990 
after you're done you just stir up the
rest<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.740> look<00:02:03.890> screen<00:02:04.280> stuff<00:02:04.790> it

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
rest of it and look screen stuff it

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.100 
rest of it and look screen stuff it
doesn't<00:02:05.360> really<00:02:05.509> matter

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
doesn't really matter

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:23.920 
doesn't really matter
drop<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:11.470> make<00:02:12.470> sure<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.850> notice<00:02:23.090> at<00:02:23.390> one<00:02:23.660> time

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
drop it make sure you notice at one time

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.380 
drop it make sure you notice at one time
I<00:02:24.410> didn't<00:02:24.739> clean<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.100> my<00:02:25.430> space<00:02:25.790> after<00:02:26.299> our

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
I didn't clean up my space after our

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.600 
I didn't clean up my space after our
work<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.900> made<00:02:27.590> sure<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.280> did

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
work I made sure that I did

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.500
