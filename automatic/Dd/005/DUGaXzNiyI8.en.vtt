00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.379
 Hello I am from texts we have that 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.509
 new logo it 5000 have that here just 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:10.690
 has presented to a pretty fancy 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.200
 the tablet is 246 grams, it weighs only 79 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.480
 mm 6 7 2 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.590
 I suspect a hd display and if one 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.540
 it also look at the device 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.390
 You can see here you have one outside 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.550
 nice yes chrome edge installed one 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 lenovo logo on the front here 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.750
 Of course, another one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.460
 a headphones speaker 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.040
 presumably it will also be called a telephone 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.990
 be suitable who knows maybe in the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.180
 future here then the beautiful 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.770
 the beautiful metal back the camera 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.420
 the yes I think so 25 I clap 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 right there I'm five millimeters 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.370
 headphones connection here one more 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.079
 insert for I think times a sims 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.469
 loks and is there really there of course 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.719
 also a variant with 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.760
 with telephony functions or simply 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.739
 micro sd slot does not know exactly now 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.409
 In any case, however, a switch-off louder 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.699
 quieter and yes I have to say it feels 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.040
 not so high quality then 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.790
 but 190 euros it should cost only 1 gb 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.149
 ram installed 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.920
 a quad core mediatek processor and we 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.070
 let's see easily in here what 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.479
 we get offered software here because 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.630
 you can see there was a little bit of that 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.810
 normal android adapted and yes 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.460
 a few important or simply meaningful 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.409
 Enhancements we made see here the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.119
 now everything is just plain 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.259
 Homescreens gave the whole apps 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.289
 lie on it and there are apparently 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.619
 no real menu more where to go 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.240
 just making the apps clean is 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.170
 maybe we will get used to it 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.289
 very briefly in the camera 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.140
 of course we have a camera on the 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.940
 back exactly so yes I guess 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.060
 That will not be more than 5 megapixels 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.649
 but still responded quickly and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.929
 for a few snapshots that should 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.930
 rich and I see solves the very 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.970
 fast 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.830
 So also serial images maybe whole 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.690
 well suited front camera I want too 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.660
 be on it again 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.340
 right here i am watching myself video 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.060
 The front camera can also be seen well 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.500
 pretty good I have to say yes 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.830
 There is still to see I do not care 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.620
 seen above, it actually has a sim 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.180
 slot, there is no SIM card inserted 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.820
 but we have definitely a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.500
 symbol for theater connection is 3g 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.370
 here is also installed directly is watching 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.780
 still very briefly what a 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.850
 android version is preinstalled here 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.020
 that, of course , always very important 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.550
 or go up here directly the 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.950
 setting in there is always on 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.110
 your easiest way is to build your tablet and 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.250
 then we will see again here 4.2.2011 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:47.030
 latest 4.3 but I think so 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.390
 acceptable for this price of 199 euro 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.880
 that's it from the logo es 5000 tablet 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.800
 should also be up towards the end of the year 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.390
 the market comes november something like that 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.080
 rotating reunion to look and to 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.080
 next time bye
