00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
leave a marker there now strafe jumping

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.380 
leave a marker there now strafe jumping
is<00:01:48.570> quite<00:01:49.140> easy<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> does<00:01:49.890> not<00:01:50.130> take<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
is quite easy and it does not take that
