00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello we are in the company of jesus baican 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.500
 plus e of iphone 5 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.470
 the videos I want to show you this 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.600
 battery will be made of aluminum a 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.940
 5,200 milan for the already mobile is a 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.290
 product that you also find on the app 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:33.360
 store is perfectly compatible with 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:39.760
 iphone 5 has created some confusion 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:44.499
 because the apple has preferred to exclude 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:48.010
 on its store site the compatibility of 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:51.550
 this model with the iphone 5 but has it 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.589
 done not because the battery itself 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.989
 let's say you are not actually 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.829
 compatible because in fact it is about 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.899
 a product with a usb output but 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.969
 simply because inside 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:09.270
 these packets a verso la apriamolo e 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:12.520
 let's see a cable is present 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 still the old charging cable 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.450
 30-pin dock 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.920
 so let's say it's natural that for 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.190
 use it as iphone 5g or I'll have to 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.810
 go and use the original cable e 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:32.110
 live in 5 apple lightning ok in the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.289
 package we find the 5,200 battery 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:42.759
 million and is realized 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:47.530
 really good little tool 8 light 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:51.030
 has a USB port which is possible 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.030
 go to connect 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.860
 a cable for charging in a 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.990
 device that both apple and with 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.980
 micro usb charging 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.040
 it is even possible to connect the iPad 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.850
 then we have an entrance door instead 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.670
 micro usb for charging these short ones 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.280
 charge with a wall power supply 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.890
 I recommended or from the colleague to the PC 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.210
 let's face it test constant is a series 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.590
 of five bed and luminous indicating 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.320
 the status of the charge 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.140
 ok in this case it is meta charge 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.590
 battery entirely from combustion 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.880
 domestic and well cared for 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.110
 own weak feature 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.490
 of the artisan file we find a cable 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.440
 here it is a cable that is written ie 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.620
 be a micro usb cable with a lift 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.620
 let's see them in detail 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.600
 an 30-pin ax dock adapter here 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.130
 consequently I will be able to use 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.090
 this wire is beautiful 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.150
 loans 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:06.700
 apple then from iphone 4s down ipod 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.280
 touch 4 down ipad 3 down yes to avail 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.470
 summer with micro usb charging 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.720
 and therefore natural that I to use 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.400
 this battery 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.970
 then we find we find one 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 housing bag for transportation 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.319
 of the battery of Italy 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.719
 when he gets sick 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.260
 ok this say that apart from everything from 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:34.450
 voices then on the battery and up 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.310
 our iphone 5 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.799
 the battery we have already seen here 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:45.569
 buy yourself and then ignite 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:53.650
 close our light league cable 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:56.829
 we connect the battery there 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.780
 we ensure that the battery is active 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:03.310
 has turned on 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.439
 pressing here is what LEDs must do 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.220
 in this case, flash as shown 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:11.680
 they blink a little because it is not 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.739
 connected a load ie a state 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.790
 by loading at this point we connect 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:24.820
 the iPhone 5 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:27.930
 how do you see part on charge la 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.970
 battery part to charge the iPhone 5 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.639
 so a bit of confusion was created 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.770
 because it will be this time they are not hunted 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.840
 the latest noise compatibility are 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.220
 perfectly compatible with each other 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.400
 the only care and use the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.460
 right cabbage if we want to end 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.210
 the charge we have to deactivate the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.870
 battery if to me with this step 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:56.169
 and charging stops 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:00.250
 here it is for active and starts again 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.250
 thanks for your attention hello
