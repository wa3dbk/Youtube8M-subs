is<00:00:27.400> a<00:00:27.640> 98<00:00:28.150> Dodge<00:00:29.070> Ram<00:00:30.070> 3500<00:00:30.640> one<00:00:31.090> ton<00:00:31.330> it<00:00:31.540> is<00:00:32.080> a

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
is a 98 Dodge Ram 3500 one ton it is a

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.740 
is a 98 Dodge Ram 3500 one ton it is a
wide<00:00:32.380> body<00:00:33.840> built<00:00:34.840> by<00:00:35.020> explorer<00:00:36.540> Explorer<00:00:37.540> is

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
wide body built by explorer Explorer is

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.300 
wide body built by explorer Explorer is
probably<00:00:38.260> one<00:00:38.500> of<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.650> highest<00:00:38.830> quality

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
probably one of the highest quality

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.970 
probably one of the highest quality
class<00:00:39.610> B's<00:00:39.880> that<00:00:40.180> you're<00:00:40.330> ever<00:00:40.510> going<00:00:40.660> to<00:00:40.720> find

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
class B's that you're ever going to find

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.799 
class B's that you're ever going to find
they<00:00:41.980> actually<00:00:42.489> cut<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:43.300> van<00:00:43.450> down<00:00:43.630> the

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
they actually cut the van down the

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.780 
they actually cut the van down the
middle<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.170> tapered<00:00:44.770> it<00:00:44.890> out<00:00:45.010> on<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.550> sides

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
middle and tapered it out on the sides

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.700 
middle and tapered it out on the sides
so<00:00:46.300> it's<00:00:46.570> actually<00:00:46.900> wider<00:00:47.140> than<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.470> leisure

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
so it's actually wider than a leisure

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.760 
so it's actually wider than a leisure
travel<00:00:48.100> van<00:00:48.250> wider<00:00:48.730> than<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.030> pleasure<00:00:49.300> way

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
travel van wider than a pleasure way

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.200 
travel van wider than a pleasure way
wider<00:00:50.770> than<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.040> lot<00:00:51.309> of<00:00:51.430> wide-body<00:00:51.760> vans<00:00:52.000> out

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.370 
wider than a lot of wide-body vans out
there<00:00:52.390> even<00:00:52.540> though<00:00:52.720> it<00:00:52.780> doesn't<00:00:52.900> look<00:00:53.050> like<00:00:53.350> a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
there even though it doesn't look like a

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.620 
there even though it doesn't look like a
wide-body<00:00:53.770> it<00:00:54.040> is<00:00:54.309> it's<00:00:54.640> actually<00:00:54.820> 10<00:00:55.330> inches

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
wide-body it is it's actually 10 inches

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.990 
wide-body it is it's actually 10 inches
wider<00:00:55.840> at<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.680> rear<00:00:56.830> axle<00:00:57.190> than<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.670> is<00:00:57.790> at<00:00:57.910> the

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
wider at the rear axle than it is at the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.840 
wider at the rear axle than it is at the
front<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:58.930> that's<00:00:59.050> why<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.410> has<00:00:59.680> dual<00:01:00.550> wheels

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
front and that's why it has dual wheels

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.950 
front and that's why it has dual wheels

redesigned<00:03:34.579> these<00:03:34.760> vans<00:03:34.970> they<00:03:35.180> put<00:03:35.329> the<00:03:35.419> fuel

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
redesigned these vans they put the fuel

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:36.970 
redesigned these vans they put the fuel
tank<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.079> middle<00:03:36.109> of<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.439> van<00:03:36.590> underneath

tank in the middle of the van underneath

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.250 
tank in the middle of the van underneath
so<00:03:37.579> they<00:03:38.389> couldn't<00:03:38.690> do<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.900> lowered<00:03:39.139> floor

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
so they couldn't do the lowered floor

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.780 
so they couldn't do the lowered floor
anymore<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:39.859> instead<00:03:40.190> they<00:03:40.340> made<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.639> van

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
anymore so instead they made the van

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.729 
anymore so instead they made the van
wider<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:41.359> taller<00:03:41.389> to<00:03:42.379> make<00:03:42.500> up<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
wider and taller to make up the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.500 
wider and taller to make up the
difference<00:03:42.859> so<00:03:43.760> it's<00:03:43.879> more<00:03:44.000> like<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.180> Class<00:03:44.479> C

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
difference so it's more like a Class C
