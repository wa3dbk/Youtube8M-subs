compared to the current standard of care

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.960 
compared to the current standard of care
yes<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.100> very<00:03:11.280> different<00:03:11.760> than<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
yes so it's very different than the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.759 
yes so it's very different than the

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
current standard of the care there are a

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.289 
current standard of the care there are a

easier to use and understand it's simple

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.310 
easier to use and understand it's simple
we<00:03:30.120> also<00:03:30.329> believe<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.049> will<00:03:31.140> work

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
we also believe that it will work

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.949 
we also believe that it will work
tremendously<00:03:31.560> faster<00:03:32.549> in<00:03:32.790> its<00:03:33.000> time<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.690> stop

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
rather than in minutes and we also

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.699 
rather than in minutes and we also
believe<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.910> c5<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.690> safer<00:03:40.200> with<00:03:40.380> fewer

adverse effects we believe that a c5
should<00:03:43.739> also<00:03:43.890> be<00:03:44.100> more<00:03:44.310> versatile<00:03:44.820> than<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
should also be more versatile than the

ago regarding the challenges with some
of<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.290> products<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.920> market<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.760> simple

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
of the products on the market the simple

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.030 
of the products on the market the simple
reality<00:03:57.450> is<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.930> surgeons<00:03:58.230> are<00:03:58.560> looking<00:03:58.890> for

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
reality is that surgeons are looking for

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.250 
reality is that surgeons are looking for
anything<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.579> help<00:03:59.790> them<00:04:00.000> make<00:04:00.329> their<00:04:00.630> job<00:04:01.019> a

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
anything to help them make their job a

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.380 
anything to help them make their job a
bit<00:04:01.500> easier<00:04:01.530> it's<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.640> very<00:04:02.910> difficult<00:04:03.120> job

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
bit easier it's a very difficult job

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.449 
bit easier it's a very difficult job
they've<00:04:04.260> improved<00:04:04.650> their<00:04:05.010> techniques

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
they've improved their techniques

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.789 
they've improved their techniques
tremendously<00:04:06.090> over<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.420> past<00:04:06.510> decades<00:04:07.200> their

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
tremendously over the past decades their

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.979 
tremendously over the past decades their
tools<00:04:08.100> have<00:04:08.370> generally<00:04:08.850> gotten<00:04:09.180> better<00:04:09.359> but

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
tools have generally gotten better but

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.569 
tools have generally gotten better but
one<00:04:10.230> area<00:04:10.470> in<00:04:10.709> which<00:04:10.859> we've<00:04:11.069> heard<00:04:11.250> complaints

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
one area in which we've heard complaints

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.030 
one area in which we've heard complaints
is<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.359> their<00:04:12.889> biomaterials

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
is that their biomaterials

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.949 
is that their biomaterials
the<00:04:14.400> products<00:04:15.060> they<00:04:15.239> use<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.630> help<00:04:15.750> them

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
the products they use to help them

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.050 
the products they use to help them
control<00:04:16.289> bleeding<00:04:16.560> have<00:04:17.250> not<00:04:17.489> kept<00:04:17.850> up<00:04:18.000> with

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
control bleeding have not kept up with

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.539 
control bleeding have not kept up with
their<00:04:18.359> underlying<00:04:18.720> skill<00:04:19.169> set<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:19.650> we<00:04:20.250> think

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
their underlying skill set so we think

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.820 
their underlying skill set so we think
that<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.180> will<00:04:21.389> be<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.539> big<00:04:21.930> driver<00:04:22.260> for<00:04:22.650> them

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
that this will be a big driver for them

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.190 
that this will be a big driver for them
to<00:04:23.099> want<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.400> try<00:04:23.610> something<00:04:24.030> new<00:04:24.360> something

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
to want to try something new something

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.500 
to want to try something new something
effective<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.099> something<00:04:26.700> simple<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.210> can

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
effective and something simple that can

be
