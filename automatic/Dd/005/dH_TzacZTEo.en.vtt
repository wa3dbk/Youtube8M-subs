00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.359
 video I want to show you my recipe 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 monica what we need for him 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.840
 literally 1 glass of flour and a glass of sugar 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.900
 a glass of semolina 3 eggs 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.839
 teaspoon 100 or some thread 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.699
 baking powder and which one you use and 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.949
 150 grams fifteen twenty percent 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.180
 sour cream here I have a jar of 200 grams 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.250
 house happiness cat will leave her 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 first of all since we have mannick it 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.449
 still stretched in time 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 Regarding dishes for three thing to do 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.340
 so simple thing as semolina soak 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.460
 sour cream 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.860
 just lay out the mix and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.710
 reserve for an hour 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.280
 this is done so that she does not 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 crunched on the teeth was more or less such 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.550
 gentle consistency but gave all the same 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.539
 some kind of friability 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:06.080
 so this pie is good 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.680
 mix and part 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.689
 Look at me was such 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 consistency so i advise taking no 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 how do I have 20 percent at all 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.770
 a little thinner so she was more 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.600
 This is all on a wet but the window is already there 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 relish 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 licks the whole jar of sour cream watch 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.729
 we passed well it became grabbed to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.799
 tent thick well let's hope that 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.380
 all is well the next thing that you need to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.040
 do it on just beat the eggs with 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.040
 sugar. 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.080
 i like to whip so i just 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:55.660
 an ordinary blender such a plan, I beat 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.890
 and filling up a little dad so notes and glasses 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:04.140
 now we just whipped and this mass 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:09.729
 add sour cream to our mix 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:14.590
 monkey but then just carefully 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:18.340
 mix all the lumps monkey broken 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.959
 It turns out this consistency now 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.470
 while it is more or less liquid we introduce here 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.520
 our soda or baking powder 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.440
 so he in such a more liquid 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.440
 consistency better distributed 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.670
 such a plan and now knead here 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.099
 a cup of flour I love almost 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.959
 not to overdo it because it should 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.580
 be so more or less liquid 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.739
 consistency but also at this stage when 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.400
 you are already kneading it all 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:56.739
 turn on the oven 180 degrees all 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.200
 the ingredients here are already introduced from 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.239
 if something like this 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.760
 consistency should be like it is not 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.829
 too thick and not too much for cards and 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.630
 now taking advantage of any 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.910
 silicone mold or whatever you have 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.250
 if it is not silicone then you can 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.160
 surely oil can also be sprinkled 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.690
 let's say a little king breadcrumbs 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.560
 breadcrumbs in general so that later it 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:26.769
 it was possible to get it easier to shift and 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:32.410
 level out natalya as soon as it comes 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.879
 temperatures and put in the oven at 40 50 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.069
 minutes but or 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.650
 both if different forms of the depth 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.480
 before readiness is determined 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.870
 standard toothpick or match 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.170
 stuck in the middle of garges 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.030
 if when pulling out we are left with 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.470
 slices of dough mean it is still damp 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.780
 not ready all mannica we are ready 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.359
 I turned out not very high 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.209
 but this here in time and get it 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.910
 and now I will offer you an option like it 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.310
 case of just file such as 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.370
 option when I have a chic here 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.329
 gentle such currant jam without 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.190
 a single bone with such a monik so 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.539
 that here was my recipe for this I 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.539
 I wish everyone happiness to all bye
