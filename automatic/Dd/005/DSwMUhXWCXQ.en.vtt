00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
to use it as a getting dating the fire

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.230 
to use it as a getting dating the fire
guys<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.830> know<00:01:59.950> and<00:01:59.979> listen<00:02:00.670> we<00:02:00.880> got<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.149> be

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
guys you know and listen we got to be

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.780 
guys you know and listen we got to be
quieter<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.750> 82<00:02:01.990> games<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.619> that<00:02:02.710> one<00:02:02.950> stop

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
quieter for 82 games and that one stop

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.859 
quieter for 82 games and that one stop
wording<00:02:04.090> think<00:02:04.300> chemistry<00:02:04.570> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
wording think chemistry and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.270 
wording think chemistry and
communication<00:02:05.470> is<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:05.860> point<00:02:06.070> heading

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
communication is at this point heading

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.190 
communication is at this point heading
in<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.640> illustrate<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.390> mean<00:02:07.630> chemistry<00:02:08.080> is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
in to illustrate I mean chemistry is

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.190 
in to illustrate I mean chemistry is
terrific<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:10.000> again<00:02:10.270> we<00:02:10.420> have<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.600> name<00:02:11.049> to

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
terrific but again we have a name to

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.770 
terrific but again we have a name to
start<00:02:11.440> line<00:02:11.680> up<00:02:11.860> guys<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:12.970> figured<00:02:13.180> out<00:02:13.420> that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
start line up guys have figured out that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.259 
start line up guys have figured out that
some<00:02:14.080> aren't<00:02:14.320> gland<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.820> easy<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.180> have

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
some aren't gland and so is easy to have

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.600 
some aren't gland and so is easy to have
good<00:02:16.390> chemistry<00:02:16.630> now<00:02:17.049> you<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:17.799> when

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
good chemistry now you know it's when

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.610 
good chemistry now you know it's when
you<00:02:18.730> start<00:02:18.760> playing<00:02:19.299> guys<00:02:19.690> less<00:02:20.110> medicine

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
you start playing guys less medicine

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.560 
you start playing guys less medicine
they<00:02:20.739> want<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.040> play<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.519> guys<00:02:22.239> aren't

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
they want to play and guys aren't

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.050 
they want to play and guys aren't
getting<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:22.780> many<00:02:22.930> shots<00:02:23.290> that's<00:02:23.680> when<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
getting as many shots that's when you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.220 
getting as many shots that's when you
think<00:02:25.060> then<00:02:25.480> you'll<00:02:25.630> find<00:02:25.959> out<00:02:26.110> what

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
think then you'll find out what

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.530 
think then you'll find out what
chemistry<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:27.519> play<00:02:27.760> Miami<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.390> many

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
chemistry is you play Miami so many

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.090 
chemistry is you play Miami so many
times

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
times

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.840 
times
you<00:02:29.670> don't<00:02:29.910> know<00:02:30.060> about<00:02:31.280> yeah<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
you don't know about yeah they have a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.100 
you don't know about yeah they have a
guy<00:02:33.000> ray<00:02:33.240> allen<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.690> don't<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.900> how<00:02:33.990> they're

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
guy ray allen I don't know how they're

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.190 
guy ray allen I don't know how they're
going<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.260> use<00:02:34.320> him<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.360> really<00:02:36.690> think<00:02:36.900> our

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
going to use him and I really think our

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.860 
going to use him and I really think our
children<00:02:37.500> news<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.520> another<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.120> think<00:02:39.360> it's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
children news is another I think it's

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.740 
children news is another I think it's
next<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.380> pick<00:02:40.590> up<00:02:40.740> for<00:02:40.890> them<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:42.420> know<00:02:42.570> each

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
next to pick up for them so we know each

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.410 
next to pick up for them so we know each
other<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:42.990> well<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:44.970> know<00:02:45.120> each

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
other very well but you don't know each

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.270 
other very well but you don't know each
scene<00:02:45.720> each<00:02:45.990> year<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.620> know<00:02:46.680> teams<00:02:46.950> come<00:02:47.160> in

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
scene each year you know teams come in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.950 
scene each year you know teams come in
with<00:02:47.490> different<00:02:47.850> sets<00:02:48.120> different

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
with different sets different

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.350 
with different sets different
personalities<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.340> Miami<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:51.030> having

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
personalities I think Miami is having

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.060 
personalities I think Miami is having
has<00:02:51.540> married<00:02:51.960> themselves<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.500> go<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.740> small

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
has married themselves to go in small

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.030 
has married themselves to go in small
this<00:02:53.640> year<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.120> whole<00:02:54.270> year<00:02:54.650> last<00:02:55.650> year<00:02:55.800> they

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
this year the whole year last year they

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.560 
this year the whole year last year they
didn't<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.370> until<00:02:56.730> we<00:02:56.970> forced<00:02:57.450> him

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
didn't do it until we forced him

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.350 
didn't do it until we forced him
basically<00:02:58.020> from<00:02:58.920> Game<00:02:59.100> four<00:02:59.610> or<00:02:59.760> five<00:03:00.000> oh<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
basically from Game four or five oh and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.760 
basically from Game four or five oh and
they<00:03:00.420> went<00:03:00.600> small<00:03:00.870> other<00:03:01.200> than<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.500> they're

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
they went small other than that they're

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.580 
they went small other than that they're
trying<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> big<00:03:02.490> team<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.990> now<00:03:04.320> we<00:03:04.380> have

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
trying to be a big team and now we have

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.960

are even expected to even hearing an

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.670 
are even expected to even hearing an
extensional<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.020> while<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.470> with<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
extensional in a while but with the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.380 
extensional in a while but with the
extra<00:03:10.890> date<00:03:11.010> out<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.220> Miami<00:03:11.670> be<00:03:11.790> expect<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.270> lot
