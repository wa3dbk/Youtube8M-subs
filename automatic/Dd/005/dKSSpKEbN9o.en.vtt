capabilities<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.839> camera<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:07.740> it's<00:00:08.069> not

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
capabilities of the camera now it's not

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.410 
capabilities of the camera now it's not
going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> best<00:00:08.790> slow-motion

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
going to be the best slow-motion

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.820 
going to be the best slow-motion
recording<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.139> you've<00:00:10.230> ever<00:00:10.320> seen<00:00:10.650> it's

recording that you've ever seen it's

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.100 
recording that you've ever seen it's
still<00:00:11.010> only<00:00:11.219> shoots<00:00:11.460> at<00:00:11.580> 720p<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.900> think

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
still only shoots at 720p but I think

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.660 
still only shoots at 720p but I think
it's<00:00:13.230> good<00:00:13.380> enough<00:00:13.530> quality<00:00:13.710> especially<00:00:14.490> for

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
it's good enough quality especially for

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.849 
it's good enough quality especially for
like<00:00:14.790> web<00:00:15.030> web<00:00:15.750> use<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.590> definitely

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
