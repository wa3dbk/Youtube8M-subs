00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello together and I welcome you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.849
 something from warm to fifa 15 and indeed 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.860
 the ultimate team mode i could 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.529
 me today a copy of the latest 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.990
 letgers get hold of a day before 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
 actual release for the 25th today 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 he is actually the date in any 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.060
 If I have the thing now, too 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.590
 Immediately before I play this game 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 of course I had the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.759
 days before with the web a bit around 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.489
 played my starter packs open 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.809
 and the best player was the one 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.750
 defender of juventus turin 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.480
 You also have a keel line right now 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 initially seen rest 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.059
 of course, bronze players and a few 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.700
 worse gold players are in 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.770
 my planning actually not with 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.539
 involved and we're just starting to do that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.219
 I opened a few packs to open 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.609
 also at fifa points worried about 3700 and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.729
 I will score now until 2004 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.400
 Of course apex open goldbecks for 150 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 points the piece had just been 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.470
 nani in it pleasingly five stars over 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.990
 one can use the right wing 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.090
 This pack was nothing really cool 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.000
 Maybe the jersey in Bavaria 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.070
 the best one does not know it's the pack 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 already better dos santos 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 kevin de bruyne and campell of the costa 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.600
 Ricans played a pretty strong wm 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.600
 he is now playing with arsenal 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.400
 By the way, we continue to do that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.650
 whole here if someone accelerates 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.979
 ask if i'm on drugs thats following 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.220
 fast no, I have three 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.590
 faster 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 So do not worry you have rad 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.270
 seen peres pack warns the central 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.829
 midfield man from benfica wants to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.990
 I did have to try the good 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.500
 Ora and stats for a central man 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.290
 Here we see getting jogi lÃ¶w as 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.270
 Of course, coach is not like that either 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.960
 bad but we want a right one 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.659
 crusher impact has been up to now 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.119
 not yet there I have, by the way 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.280
 Overrunning many culprits I think 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.459
 67 pieces that 's too much 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.410
 Do not waste too many herbs so many 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.600
 I do not need it especially if you are 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.190
 Consider that almost all of which I agree with 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.110
 Use was here is the best 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.290
 example in this way are two perpetrators 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.850
 one from the Spanish league and one 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.220
 from the Dutch are both 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.569
 not so the weirdo of course 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.980
 I would be such a new one 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.790
 I would first transfer friends 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.310
 sell off 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.500
 but so we did not yet we wait 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.220
 nothing ingenious in this pack 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.130
 in it three mediocre gold players and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.959
 some consumption objects and slow 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.720
 but surely we come to the magical 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.370
 limit of 2004 points i believe we 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.310
 After that, two more is here 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.190
 by the way, an ok player of inter 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.840
 the chilean of the six maybe will 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.130
 he used white one is not yet too 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.269
 At the beginning you take everything you need 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.000
 can get 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.470
 Nothing is awesome in this pack 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.330
 thereby individual examples has even 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.720
 creepy annoyed there we lead 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.410
 the first duplicate on 1 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.489
 and now I open with 2125 points 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.650
 a pack for 104 points where I madjidi 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.549
 get that is the best keeper of 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.200
 all the track here on the one 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.560
 and here I have all the players 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.150
 listed to use are nani 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.620
 I will definitely start working 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.410
 the right wing 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.220
 Do you already have a modification 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.859
 card brought from rm to done 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.750
 Tasks are this year 18 I believe 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.310
 Last year, I knew less 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.720
 now not exactly above you see 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.680
 also that I have made coins 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.840
 By putting all the bad players 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.880
 and now I'm building mine 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.070
 first team up in one 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.870
 formation 4 3 3 the fifth variant with 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.359
 two outside players and one 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.660
 midfielder who created the game 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.609
 should therefore also totti 40 pace 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.519
 still completely no matter whether pass through this 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:11.489
 this dribbling value is that 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.680
 What I need is the passports then 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.940
 then play on the outside 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.729
 Feed Feeding Feeding 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.590
 the left wing is owned by el 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.910
 Shaarawy is not that cheap anymore 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.790
 beginning 5300 coins 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.110
 that's always such a topic on 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.300
 At the beginning, the games are so expensive 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.740
 which is then doing later when 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.390
 do not want to sell and you come yes 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.120
 not even 50 percent of 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.420
 purchase price very annoying especially 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.860
 since I always try to start 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.240
 tried and radically one again 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.490
 but we will continue to watch how 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.800
 it looks like it goes on it with the 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.720
 Dutch central man Kevin 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.610
 Unfortunately, the strootmann not at the wm 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.590
 I was injured 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.200
 bet then would have a company 80s 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.370
 rating that has been set 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.410
 according to van gaal and the sole 6 becomes 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.630
 to meet a Dutchman as well 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.040
 nigel de jong is namely in the 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.540
 cadre of the Netherlands slipped in 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.650
 due to the injury of kevin 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.490
 if I'm right now 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.580
 so on the screen have a couple off 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.500
 Lower countries both active in the series 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.710
 the right defender information 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.210
 it will be tough to be tough on sporting 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.280
 a portuguese are most 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.240
 think now why and around that 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:29.080
 to get perfect chemistry with nani 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.510
 the midfield is completed by 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.910
 miralem pjanic as rom strong season 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.410
 anyway played the whole roma very much 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.120
 rose sharply in the rating 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.940
 because of this strong season we are 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.890
 second behind juven and on 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.290
 it goes with the defense nemanja 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.750
 vidic my god then has a break 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.960
 to record his rating last 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.430
 year, I still believe 86 87 maybe 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.980
 I do not even know 88 right now 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.640
 but is behind and only had 83 left 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.000
 is damn slow but I have 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.320
 heard or feel that this year 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.970
 especially position plays in the 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.410
 Home defense is extremely important 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.260
 because I've been such 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.760
 Looked at by other youtube and have 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.040
 all my god said so if you are one 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.900
 player puts down the 80 pace but has 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.550
 the positional game is grottig then 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.610
 then comes between little pas rhein 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.340
 the defenders and you have the salad 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.110
 hopefully that's the village too 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.510
 is very very slow 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.270
 the last player in the formation is 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.220
 toto the left-back from internal 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.520
 Silver player and now 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.639
 Of course, some think 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.620
 why de now fits even on the 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.270
 iaa there are no really good ones 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.220
 left-back the strongest in the 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.099
 evaluation are ashley cole and patrice 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.949
 evra too are by and large 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:49.740
 not good and this currently too expensive 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.860
 that's why we drive with dodo name 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.860
 program
