D<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.700> triple<00:00:36.059> d<00:00:36.180> or<00:00:36.480> whatever<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.649> to

D or triple d or whatever you have to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.709 
D or triple d or whatever you have to
actually<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> website<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.000> measure

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
actually go to the website and measure

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.220 
actually go to the website and measure
around<00:00:40.590> your<00:00:41.219> rib<00:00:41.670> cage<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.510> your<00:00:42.629> bustline

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
around your rib cage and your bustline

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.490 
around your rib cage and your bustline
and<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.340> will<00:00:44.460> determine<00:00:45.050> what<00:00:46.050> size

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and then it will determine what size

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.420 
and then it will determine what size
that<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.980> need

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that you need

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.869 
that you need
so<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> said<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> size<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.899> category<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
so I said it's a size one category and I

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.130 
so I said it's a size one category and I
really<00:00:52.129> like<00:00:53.129> these<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.780> kind<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
really like these because it's kind of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.720 
really like these because it's kind of
like<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> mini<00:00:55.590> straightjacket<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.579> your

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
like a mini straightjacket for your

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.880 
like a mini straightjacket for your
boobs<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.239> usually<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.930> wear<00:00:58.170> two<00:00:58.500> sports

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
boobs because usually I wear two sports

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.650 
boobs because usually I wear two sports
bras<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.579> time<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> bounce

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
bras at one time because of the bounce

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.959 
bras at one time because of the bounce
factor<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.350> mean<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.160> breasts<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
factor I mean your breasts are going to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
factor I mean your breasts are going to
bounce<00:01:03.149> regardless<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.769> keep<00:01:05.220> them

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
bounce regardless but these keep them

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
bounce regardless but these keep them
maintained<00:01:06.479> especially<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> do

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
