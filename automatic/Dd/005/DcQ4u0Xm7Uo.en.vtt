00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.710
 Welcome dear friends 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.360
 our derbytime series of love 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.910
 Patrick is sitting for the second time now 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.070
 this season as loser than derby 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.730
 loser next to me and what does that mean 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.509
 exactly 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.580
 The glorious FC Schalke 04 has both 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.000
 derbys decide this season for themselves 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.400
 can 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.119
 and because your suggestion last time so 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.119
 was cool 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.940
 I'm just looking forward to the 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.220
 Implementation I sit on glowing coals 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:47.370
 and therefore they can start here am 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.630
 I am neither too far 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.700
 that's what I'm about with me now 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.850
 but I have to do it then 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.630
 just speak the give and just like that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:06.720
 I stand by my word and even 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.930
 Do not wait, I'll leave you alone 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.930
 begin 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:47.880
 Money makes blue sacks of george 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.579
 think that's enough blue enough for me 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.810
 even a left ear 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.520
 I would say another 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.240
 task to do today is not true 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.240
 let's go out 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.870
 Not 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.360
 Oh, yes, patrick, that's what I like 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.360
 knows a lot better 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.770
 hope made station 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.770
 that's OK 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.240
 people we are live here in front of the fuldaer 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.850
 cathedral 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.070
 Patrick already in position we have for 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.660
 you chose an anti bvb song he did 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.740
 to the best she would come with 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.740
 no time lost 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.430
 beautiful camera smiling 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.459
 by giving a little thought support 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.719

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.380

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:21.950

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:30.430
 the enemy died 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:33.550
 then only with gravel the gravesite 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.550
 donated 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.820
 part two of the video still has 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.130

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.350

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.420
 best give back an anti bvb lies 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.390

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.270

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.650
 all right 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:21.380
 they wear black they wear are they 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.670
 dumbest festival 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.940
 they wear black the wearing ones they are 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.650
 the stupidest bands in the world yet again 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.810
 barely one more time 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.560
 singed twice more 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:40.690

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.810
 which kiss in the camera say proudly 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.960
 carried 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.960
 They are the best fans in the world 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.650

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.199

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:04.870
 learned because you can never enough bvb 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.680
 but are thought like a schalke 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.400
 should glorify the song already 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.970
 to be there 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.220

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.590
 Everything and I'm curious how you do that 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.230
 grab once in sour apple 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:32.430
 Do you know the myth of the Schalke mag ? 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:35.610

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:40.640

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.640
 a love that never ends 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:54.819

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.409

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:05.229
