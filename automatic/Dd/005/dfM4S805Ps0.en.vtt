00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
mine actually works I lucked out big

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.589 
mine actually works I lucked out big
time<00:03:52.019> there<00:03:52.500> I'm<00:03:52.950> pretty<00:03:53.400> happy<00:03:53.849> about<00:03:53.879> that

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
time there I'm pretty happy about that

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.229 
time there I'm pretty happy about that
a<00:03:54.659> little<00:03:55.379> homage<00:03:55.950> Toy<00:03:56.370> Story<00:03:56.760> right<00:03:57.000> there

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
a little homage Toy Story right there

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.979 
a little homage Toy Story right there
you<00:03:57.599> can<00:03:57.780> point<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.079> out<00:03:58.409> but<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:59.870> story<00:04:00.870> on

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
you can point that out but the story on

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.149 
you can point that out but the story on
this<00:04:01.139> truck<00:04:01.319> actually<00:04:01.560> bought<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:01.919> from<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
this truck actually bought it from the

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.830 
this truck actually bought it from the
original<00:04:02.189> owner<00:04:02.579> believe<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.060> or<00:04:03.120> not<00:04:03.269> he<00:04:03.750> had

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
original owner believe it or not he had

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.990 
original owner believe it or not he had
bought<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.799> was<00:04:04.829> an<00:04:04.980> Arizona<00:04:05.430> truck<00:04:05.760> for

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000

bought it it was an Arizona truck for
the<00:04:06.060> first<00:04:06.299> 10<00:04:06.689> or<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:06.959> years<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.349> its<00:04:07.500> life

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
the first 10 or so years of its life

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.000 
the first 10 or so years of its life
which<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.310> why<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.180> hasn't<00:04:09.510> completely<00:04:10.500> rusted

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
which is why it hasn't completely rusted

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.520 
which is why it hasn't completely rusted
away<00:04:11.280> but<00:04:11.700> I've<00:04:12.629> definitely<00:04:12.870> been<00:04:13.139> fighting

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
away but I've definitely been fighting

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.310 
away but I've definitely been fighting
some<00:04:13.709> rust<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.370> am<00:04:15.359> no<00:04:15.569> body<00:04:15.810> man

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
some rust I am no body man

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.949 
some rust I am no body man
I<00:04:16.349> will<00:04:16.590> admit<00:04:16.949> this<00:04:17.280> looks<00:04:17.489> pretty<00:04:17.699> bad<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:18.449> had

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
I will admit this looks pretty bad I had

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.719 
I will admit this looks pretty bad I had
two<00:04:19.139> days<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:19.470> get<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.680> through<00:04:19.829> inspection<00:04:20.400> so

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
two days to get it through inspection so

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.839 
two days to get it through inspection so
sanded<00:04:21.539> down<00:04:21.570> what<00:04:22.349> I<00:04:22.380> could<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.220> then<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.430> did

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
sanded down what I could and then I did

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.000 
sanded down what I could and then I did
the<00:04:24.000> bondo<00:04:24.510> fiberglass<00:04:25.050> get<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.560> rest

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
the bondo fiberglass get the rest

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.580 
the bondo fiberglass get the rest
eventually<00:04:26.970> in<00:04:27.360> time<00:04:27.599> I'm<00:04:27.930> hoping<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.349> source

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
eventually in time I'm hoping to source

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.770 
eventually in time I'm hoping to source
some<00:04:28.860> fenders<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> junkyard<00:04:29.849> that<00:04:30.090> aren't<00:04:30.630> like

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
some fenders a junkyard that aren't like

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.050 
some fenders a junkyard that aren't like
that<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.409> then<00:04:32.010> eventually<00:04:32.610> down<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.820> road

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
that and then eventually down the road

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.460 
that and then eventually down the road
see<00:04:33.210> what<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.330> can<00:04:33.510> do<00:04:33.630> for<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.870> quarters<00:04:34.289> but

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
see what I can do for the quarters but

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.810 
see what I can do for the quarters but
luckily<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:35.010> rockers<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.610> body

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
luckily the rockers and the body

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.360 
luckily the rockers and the body
underneath<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.630> pretty<00:04:37.320> solid<00:04:37.620> I'm<00:04:38.039> not<00:04:38.190> going

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
underneath a pretty solid I'm not going

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.760 
underneath a pretty solid I'm not going
to<00:04:38.430> worry<00:04:38.580> about<00:04:38.699> them<00:04:38.970> for<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.240> while<00:04:39.770> the

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
to worry about them for a while the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.310 
to worry about them for a while the
tires<00:04:41.010> on<00:04:41.220> them<00:04:41.340> have<00:04:41.460> good<00:04:41.639> tread<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
tires on them have good tread and

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.450 
tires on them have good tread and
all-in-all<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.500> was<00:04:43.590> 500<00:04:44.070> bucks<00:04:44.250> for

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
all-in-all it was 500 bucks for

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.980 
all-in-all it was 500 bucks for
something<00:04:44.639> that<00:04:44.849> I<00:04:44.880> can<00:04:45.090> walk<00:04:45.300> away<00:04:45.479> with<00:04:45.630> that

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
something that I can walk away with that

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.610 
something that I can walk away with that
day<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.680> drive<00:04:47.210> now<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.539> big<00:04:48.750> Achilles<00:04:49.349> heel

day and drive now the big Achilles heel
of<00:04:49.650> this<00:04:49.860> engine<00:04:50.310> there's<00:04:50.580> some<00:04:50.699> other

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
of this engine there's some other

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.370 
of this engine there's some other
YouTube<00:04:51.210> videos<00:04:51.240> about<00:04:51.810> this<00:04:52.110> that<00:04:52.289> are

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
YouTube videos about this that are

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.990 
YouTube videos about this that are
really<00:04:52.409> great<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:55.220> if<00:04:56.220> you're<00:04:56.400> not<00:04:56.430> up<00:04:56.849> on

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
really great is that if you're not up on

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 
really great is that if you're not up on
the<00:04:57.060> maintenance<00:04:57.449> it<00:04:58.020> gets<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.470> point<00:04:58.680> where

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
the maintenance it gets the point where

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.279 
the maintenance it gets the point where
if<00:04:59.789> your<00:04:59.940> timing<00:05:00.330> chain<00:05:00.599> starts<00:05:01.110> rubbing

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
if your timing chain starts rubbing

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.020 
if your timing chain starts rubbing
through<00:05:01.620> your<00:05:01.740> timing<00:05:02.010> chain<00:05:02.340> guides<00:05:02.580> which

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
through your timing chain guides which

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.339 
through your timing chain guides which
are<00:05:03.120> made<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.389> plastic<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.020> they're<00:05:04.139> made<00:05:04.260> for

are made of plastic and they're made for

are made of plastic and they're made for
plastic<00:05:04.740> for<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:04.979> reason<00:05:05.280> people<00:05:05.430> like<00:05:05.639> to<00:05:05.759> rant

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
plastic for a reason people like to rant

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.270 
plastic for a reason people like to rant
about<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.509> first<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:07.320> plastic<00:05:07.830> has<00:05:08.009> to<00:05:08.190> be

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
about that first the plastic has to be

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.180 
about that first the plastic has to be
the<00:05:08.430> fail<00:05:08.669> point<00:05:09.000> for<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.750> chain<00:05:10.020> anyway<00:05:10.800> the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
the fail point for the chain anyway the

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.370 
the fail point for the chain anyway the
chain<00:05:11.400> will<00:05:11.550> wear<00:05:11.699> through<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.090> guide<00:05:12.380> and

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
chain will wear through the guide and

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.510 
chain will wear through the guide and
then<00:05:13.680> it'll<00:05:13.830> start<00:05:14.009> whirring<00:05:14.310> through<00:05:14.430> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
then it'll start whirring through the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.040 
then it'll start whirring through the
timing<00:05:14.880> cover<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.360> then<00:05:15.449> it<00:05:15.539> can<00:05:15.659> puncture<00:05:15.930> a

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
timing cover and then it can puncture a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.629 
timing cover and then it can puncture a
water<00:05:16.349> jacket<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.070> then<00:05:17.190> you've<00:05:17.340> got

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
water jacket and then you've got

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.820 
water jacket and then you've got
well<00:05:19.630> when<00:05:20.199> I<00:05:20.229> bought<00:05:20.500> it

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
well when I bought it

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.860 
well when I bought it
the<00:05:21.010> reason<00:05:21.280> was<00:05:21.370> $500<00:05:22.150> even<00:05:22.419> though<00:05:22.540> in<00:05:22.720> my

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
the reason was $500 even though in my

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.710 
the reason was $500 even though in my
opinion<00:05:22.900> sin<00:05:23.530> quite<00:05:23.800> good<00:05:24.010> shape<00:05:24.479> the<00:05:25.479> motor

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
opinion sin quite good shape the motor

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.719 
opinion sin quite good shape the motor
says<00:05:25.990> all<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.290> engines<00:05:26.560> got<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.830> now<00:05:26.979> I<00:05:27.250> said

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
says all the engines got it now I said

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.340 
says all the engines got it now I said
you<00:05:27.820> know<00:05:27.910> what<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.360> think<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.020> know<00:05:29.110> what<00:05:29.260> that

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
you know what I think I know what that

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.890 
you know what I think I know what that
might<00:05:29.560> be<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:29.889> took<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.160> chance<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.810> I

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
might be and I took the chance and I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.210 
might be and I took the chance and I
pulled<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.290> valve<00:05:32.440> cover<00:05:32.800> and<00:05:32.949> I'll<00:05:33.010> show<00:05:33.130> you

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
pulled the valve cover and I'll show you

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.280 
pulled the valve cover and I'll show you
some<00:05:33.400> pictures<00:05:33.760> here<00:05:34.090> sure<00:05:34.840> enough<00:05:35.110> that

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
some pictures here sure enough that

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.930 
some pictures here sure enough that
driver's<00:05:35.710> side<00:05:35.860> timing<00:05:36.340> chain<00:05:36.550> guide<00:05:36.729> was

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
driver's side timing chain guide was

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.930 
driver's side timing chain guide was
loose<00:05:37.150> as<00:05:37.300> all<00:05:37.449> get-out<00:05:37.690> so<00:05:38.260> I<00:05:38.530> had<00:05:39.340> my<00:05:39.520> trusted

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
loose as all get-out so I had my trusted

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.640 
loose as all get-out so I had my trusted
mechanic<00:05:40.419> do<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:40.720> timing<00:05:41.080> chain<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.470> guides

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
mechanic do the timing chain and guides

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.760 
mechanic do the timing chain and guides
and<00:05:41.949> tensioner<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.550> all<00:05:42.639> that<00:05:42.820> jazz<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.770> it

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
and tensioner and all that jazz and it

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.230 
and tensioner and all that jazz and it
runs<00:05:44.979> a<00:05:45.100> lot<00:05:45.280> better<00:05:45.580> now

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
runs a lot better now

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.740 
runs a lot better now
and<00:05:46.690> I<00:05:46.840> feel<00:05:47.050> really<00:05:47.199> confident<00:05:47.710> about<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.750> the

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
and I feel really confident about it the

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.240 
and I feel really confident about it the
other<00:05:49.930> thing<00:05:50.229> is<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.380> well<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.830> clutch<00:05:51.070> is

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
other thing is that well the clutch is

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.550 
other thing is that well the clutch is
good<00:05:51.660> and<00:05:52.660> it<00:05:52.750> goes<00:05:52.900> through<00:05:53.080> all<00:05:53.169> the<00:05:53.289> gears

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
good and it goes through all the gears

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.279 
good and it goes through all the gears
and<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:53.949> doesn't<00:05:54.840> doesn't<00:05:55.840> slip<00:05:56.080> or<00:05:56.260> anything

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
and it doesn't doesn't slip or anything

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.290 
and it doesn't doesn't slip or anything
like<00:05:56.710> that<00:05:56.770> fifth<00:05:57.490> gear<00:05:57.729> is<00:05:57.880> pretty<00:05:58.150> much

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
like that fifth gear is pretty much

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.150 
like that fifth gear is pretty much
turned<00:05:59.169> into<00:05:59.320> another<00:05:59.500> neutral

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
turned into another neutral

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.920 
turned into another neutral
unfortunately<00:06:01.030> so<00:06:01.330> I'm<00:06:01.479> gonna<00:06:01.600> have<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.840> look

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
unfortunately so I'm gonna have to look

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.830 
unfortunately so I'm gonna have to look
into<00:06:02.260> getting<00:06:03.060> transmission<00:06:04.060> rebuilds<00:06:04.690> or

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
into getting transmission rebuilds or

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.200 
into getting transmission rebuilds or
maybe<00:06:05.020> just<00:06:05.320> the<00:06:05.470> fifth<00:06:05.710> gear<00:06:05.949> redone<00:06:06.400> I<00:06:06.699> have

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
maybe just the fifth gear redone I have

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.939 
maybe just the fifth gear redone I have
a<00:06:07.270> theory<00:06:07.539> that<00:06:07.780> fluid<00:06:08.139> leaked<00:06:08.350> out<00:06:08.560> in<00:06:08.740> fifth

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
a theory that fluid leaked out in fifth

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.379 
a theory that fluid leaked out in fifth
gear<00:06:09.100> is<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.310> highest<00:06:09.639> from<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:09.850> top<00:06:10.090> so<00:06:10.330> that

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
gear is the highest from the top so that

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.450 
gear is the highest from the top so that
was<00:06:10.570> able<00:06:10.780> to<00:06:10.870> eat<00:06:11.050> itself<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.500> bits<00:06:11.680> first<00:06:12.130> but

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
was able to eat itself to bits first but

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.000 
was able to eat itself to bits first but
we'll<00:06:12.760> see<00:06:13.050> but<00:06:14.050> all<00:06:14.139> in<00:06:14.320> all<00:06:14.410> even<00:06:14.470> with<00:06:14.860> the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
we'll see but all in all even with the

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.700 
we'll see but all in all even with the
4-speed<00:06:15.610> doing<00:06:16.330> 65<00:06:16.930> miles<00:06:17.199> an<00:06:17.320> hour<00:06:17.440> down<00:06:17.650> the

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
4-speed doing 65 miles an hour down the

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.890 
4-speed doing 65 miles an hour down the
highway<00:06:17.860> only<00:06:18.310> register<00:06:18.880> three<00:06:19.270> grand<00:06:19.600> which

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
highway only register three grand which

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.080 
highway only register three grand which
I<00:06:20.020> know<00:06:20.080> is<00:06:20.320> an<00:06:20.440> ideal<00:06:20.800> but<00:06:21.310> it's<00:06:21.910> good<00:06:22.060> enough

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
I know is an ideal but it's good enough

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.950 
I know is an ideal but it's good enough
for<00:06:22.450> now<00:06:22.570> so<00:06:23.080> I<00:06:23.760> love<00:06:24.760> these<00:06:24.940> friends<00:06:25.780> calling

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
for now so I love these friends calling

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.560 
for now so I love these friends calling
windows<00:06:26.740> but<00:06:27.039> angle<00:06:27.940> them<00:06:28.060> so<00:06:28.180> you<00:06:28.270> just<00:06:28.419> have

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
windows but angle them so you just have

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.300 
windows but angle them so you just have
air<00:06:28.750> coming<00:06:29.020> straight<00:06:29.349> into<00:06:29.530> your<00:06:29.680> face<00:06:29.950> I

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
air coming straight into your face I

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.620 
air coming straight into your face I
really<00:06:30.880> don't<00:06:31.060> even<00:06:31.120> need<00:06:31.360> the<00:06:31.510> air

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
really don't even need the air

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.680 
really don't even need the air
conditioning<00:06:32.169> though

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.450 

so<00:06:37.690> yeah<00:06:37.900> while<00:06:38.350> it's<00:06:38.560> not<00:06:38.740> exactly<00:06:39.160> something

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
so yeah while it's not exactly something

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.630 
so yeah while it's not exactly something
that<00:06:39.670> I'm<00:06:40.240> going<00:06:40.420> to<00:06:40.510> be<00:06:40.600> beating<00:06:40.990> on<00:06:41.110> it<00:06:41.320> is

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
that I'm going to be beating on it is

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.130 
that I'm going to be beating on it is
really<00:06:42.640> fun<00:06:42.820> to<00:06:42.940> be<00:06:43.060> up<00:06:43.090> nice<00:06:43.390> driving<00:06:43.810> a<00:06:43.870> truck

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
really fun to be up nice driving a truck

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.720 
really fun to be up nice driving a truck
and<00:06:44.350> having<00:06:44.950> something<00:06:45.190> that's<00:06:45.490> four

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
and having something that's four

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
cylinder so it's me a little bit better

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.180 
cylinder so it's me a little bit better
fuel<00:06:47.710> economy<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.460> I<00:06:49.230> put<00:06:50.230> called<00:06:50.770> many<00:06:51.100> a

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
extreme with this or if I ever decide to

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.200 
extreme with this or if I ever decide to
go<00:06:59.500> romp<00:07:00.040> around<00:07:00.130> the<00:07:00.460> woods<00:07:00.670> I'll<00:07:00.850> see<00:07:01.030> if<00:07:01.120> I

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
go romp around the woods I'll see if I

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.530 
go romp around the woods I'll see if I
can<00:07:01.330> get<00:07:01.450> some<00:07:01.600> footage<00:07:01.990> but<00:07:03.300> this<00:07:04.300> is<00:07:04.420> my
