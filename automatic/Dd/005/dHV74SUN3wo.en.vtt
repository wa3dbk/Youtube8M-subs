00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that was it that was a very tedious step

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
that was it that was a very tedious step
it<00:02:13.590> wasn't<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.920> difficult<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.430> accept<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:15.000> few

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it wasn't that difficult to accept a few

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.190 
it wasn't that difficult to accept a few
steps<00:02:15.689> on<00:02:15.870> each<00:02:15.989> side

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
steps on each side

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.140 
steps on each side
and<00:02:17.470> then<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> here<00:02:18.340> he<00:02:18.370> doesn't<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:18.940> that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
and then and here he doesn't like that

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.690 
and then and here he doesn't like that
the<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.230> ending<00:02:20.560> where<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.860> characters<00:02:21.310> like

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
the the ending where the characters like

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.460 
the the ending where the characters like
where<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.120> where<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:22.660> got<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.810> radio<00:02:23.260> or

where the where you got that radio or
that's<00:02:23.680> super<00:02:24.129> ending<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.519> thought<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.819> was

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
that's super ending I thought that was

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.369 
that's super ending I thought that was
kind<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.150> interesting<00:02:25.300> kind<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.019> interesting

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
kind of interesting kind of interesting
