I realized I should probably take off my
shield<00:01:18.180> um<00:01:18.710> kill<00:01:19.710> yourself<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.850> rocket

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
shield um kill yourself with a rocket

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.240 
shield um kill yourself with a rocket
launcher<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.600> something<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.200> you'll<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.130> back

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
up now this is kind of widespread on

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.130 
up now this is kind of widespread on
YouTube<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.360> didn't<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> very<00:01:27.750> good<00:01:27.990> job

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140

YouTube they didn't do a very good job
with<00:01:28.590> barriers<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.280> I'll<00:01:29.490> show<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:29.970> other

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
with barriers as I'll show with my other

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
with barriers as I'll show with my other
glitches<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.900> even<00:01:31.259> within<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.650> secret

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
glitches because even within the secret

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.510 
glitches because even within the secret
armory<00:01:32.100> there's<00:01:32.310> even<00:01:32.579> more<00:01:32.720> glitches<00:01:33.720> um<00:01:34.520> but

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
armory there's even more glitches um but

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
armory there's even more glitches um but
the<00:01:35.640> problem<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> once<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.689> die<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.320> to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
yourself because it does cost money

here's<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.310> one<00:03:38.459> glitch<00:03:38.700> i<00:03:38.850> don't<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.180> is

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
here's the one glitch i don't think is

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.880 
here's the one glitch i don't think is
on<00:03:39.420> youtube<00:03:39.780> i<00:03:39.930> found<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.230> way<00:03:40.319> back<00:03:40.530> into<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
on youtube i found a way back into the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.890 
on youtube i found a way back into the
lockers<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.519> figured<00:03:42.359> there'd<00:03:42.450> be<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.630> ton<00:03:42.870> of

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
lockers I figured there'd be a ton of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.750 
lockers I figured there'd be a ton of
lockers<00:03:43.109> open<00:03:43.440> i<00:03:43.620> get<00:03:43.799> like<00:03:43.920> unlimited<00:03:44.220> ammo

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
lockers open i get like unlimited ammo

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.300 
lockers open i get like unlimited ammo
from<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.450> everything's<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.739> hollow

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
from this but everything's just hollow

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.910 
from this but everything's just hollow
which<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.389> kind<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:49.019> disappointing<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.829> this

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
which is kind of disappointing and this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.830 
which is kind of disappointing and this
is<00:03:50.040> actually<00:03:50.220> i<00:03:50.609> was<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.450> screwing<00:03:51.660> around

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
is actually i was just screwing around

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.140 
is actually i was just screwing around
and<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.739> found<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.790> knew<00:03:54.000> you

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
and I found this because I knew you

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.729 
and I found this because I knew you
could<00:03:54.329> like<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.720> showed<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.350> can<00:03:55.530> see

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
could like I showed you you can see

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.110 
could like I showed you you can see
through<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.310> other<00:03:56.430> two<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.850> went<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.060> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
through the other two and I went to the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.009 
through the other two and I went to the
corner<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.420> see<00:03:57.600> if<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.840> do<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.959> same

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
corner to see if you can do the same

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.229 
corner to see if you can do the same
thing<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.530> walk<00:03:58.920> through<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.700> you

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
thing and I just walk through it so you

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.210 
thing and I just walk through it so you
can<00:04:00.389> do<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:00.660> both<00:04:00.780> corners<00:04:01.290> except<00:04:01.829> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
can do it in both corners except the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.789 
can do it in both corners except the
right<00:04:02.340> ones<00:04:02.579> a<00:04:02.639> little<00:04:02.700> bit<00:04:02.910> harder<00:04:03.500> but<00:04:04.500> you

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
right ones a little bit harder but you

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.860 
right ones a little bit harder but you
can<00:04:04.950> do<00:04:05.130> it<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.310> both<00:04:05.430> corners<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.600> all<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.780> got

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
can do it in both corners and all I got

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.120 
can do it in both corners and all I got
to<00:04:06.959> do<00:04:07.049> is<00:04:07.170> go<00:04:07.290> into<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.620> corner<00:04:07.889> of<00:04:07.920> it<00:04:08.040> and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
to do is go into the corner of it and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.559 
to do is go into the corner of it and
just<00:04:08.220> keep<00:04:08.459> walking<00:04:08.880> forward<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.359> wiggle

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
just keep walking forward and wiggle

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.879 
just keep walking forward and wiggle
around<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.049> should<00:04:10.200> break<00:04:10.560> through

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
around a bit you should break through

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.930 
around a bit you should break through
right<00:04:11.100> away<00:04:12.350> um<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:14.250> other<00:04:14.280> thing<00:04:14.430> that's<00:04:14.639> saw

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
in here obviously are the walls the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.930 
in here obviously are the walls the
barriers<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.769> there's<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.010> pipe<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
barriers and there's a pipe in the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.330 
barriers and there's a pipe in the
little<00:04:18.269> right<00:04:19.109> one<00:04:19.320> or<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.590> left<00:04:19.739> one<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.220> them

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
what I was talking about because

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.760 
what I was talking about because
apparently<00:06:15.690> I<00:06:15.810> was<00:06:16.050> wrong<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.440> can<00:06:16.560> only<00:06:16.650> do

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
apparently I was wrong you can only do

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.650 
apparently I was wrong you can only do
it<00:06:16.830> on<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.039> right<00:06:17.190> side<00:06:17.490> see<00:06:17.880> through<00:06:18.180> as<00:06:18.450> well

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
it on the right side see through as well

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.440 
it on the right side see through as well
but<00:06:19.169> then<00:06:19.410> we<00:06:19.560> go<00:06:19.680> into<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:20.190> thing<00:06:20.610> and<00:06:20.880> jump

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
but then we go into the thing and jump

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.620 
but then we go into the thing and jump
around<00:06:22.820> yeah<00:06:23.820> because<00:06:24.150> it<00:06:24.360> seems<00:06:24.539> like

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
around yeah because it seems like

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.060 
around yeah because it seems like
there's<00:06:24.930> be<00:06:25.080> a<00:06:25.110> lot<00:06:25.320> of<00:06:25.410> lockers<00:06:25.590> but<00:06:25.860> I<00:06:25.919> don't

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
there's be a lot of lockers but I don't

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.529 
there's be a lot of lockers but I don't
think<00:06:26.220> they<00:06:26.340> had<00:06:26.550> that<00:06:26.729> rip<00:06:27.000> barrier<00:06:27.360> ever

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
think they had that rip barrier ever

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.719 
think they had that rip barrier ever
goes<00:06:27.810> away<00:06:27.960> you<00:06:28.560> tell<00:06:28.890> I<00:06:29.070> don't<00:06:29.310> know<00:06:29.400> I<00:06:29.640> never

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
goes away you tell I don't know I never

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.880 
goes away you tell I don't know I never
really<00:06:29.970> checked<00:06:30.570> back<00:06:30.840> but<00:06:31.169> there<00:06:31.530> we<00:06:31.650> go<00:06:31.710> and

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
really checked back but there we go and

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.590 
really checked back but there we go and
see<00:06:32.100> it's<00:06:32.520> really<00:06:32.700> simple<00:06:32.940> you<00:06:33.240> just<00:06:33.360> walk

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
see it's really simple you just walk

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.740 
see it's really simple you just walk
through<00:06:33.630> I'd<00:06:34.200> rate<00:06:34.500> this<00:06:34.650> about<00:06:34.950> a<00:06:35.010> and<00:06:35.640> I<00:06:36.390> just

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
through I'd rate this about a and I just

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.390 
through I'd rate this about a and I just
call<00:06:36.990> it<00:06:37.020> both<00:06:37.349> of<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.650> glitches<00:06:37.890> probably

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
call it both of the glitches probably

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.519 
call it both of the glitches probably
the<00:06:38.760> first<00:06:38.970> the<00:06:39.270> one<00:06:39.750> where<00:06:40.289> you<00:06:40.349> get
