00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello everyone and today's video is a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.640
 video of helping the community has 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.910
 found with many videos with girls 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.340
 trying to fill 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.469
 and he has found me with disastrous things 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.049
 plastic that put them inside to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.180
 that does not stick that they fill it as if 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.039
 go sideways and try to shape 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.410
 and well I wanted to show you what the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 easiest way to fill them and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 they will also be pretty good for 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.359
 avoid all these confusions in this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
 video I'll show you the way 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.199
 correct to fill your uncles I'm going 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.199
 samantha 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.190
 to do is quite simple let's put 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.260
 some water to boil in the meantime 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.150
 Let's take our container from the USA 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.790
 with the help of a knife we ​​will see 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.210
 that here inside there is a separation what 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.210
 you can see 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.780
 we are going to put the knife and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.780
 let's lift 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.090
 and they will see that very easily this 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 part this is the bottom part and this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.340
 is the top part we're going to wash everything 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.799
 very well and once clean the part of 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.869
 down we're going to screw it in the part 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.460
 superior as if we were 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.009
 closing and now we are going to prepare 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 our balm for that we are going to put 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.930
 bain marie a spoonful of wax 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.930
 bee and two tablespoons of coconut oil 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.810
 and if you want to add color you can 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.430
 use crayons in this case I'm going to 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.680
 use the green I'm just going to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.530
 add half we give the cover of 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.300
 paper and we melted everything very well in 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.070
 our water bath since we melted 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.170
 all our ingredients in a bain marie 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.330
 let's take the empty processes 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.320
 we put in this way so that we do not know 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.720
 fall we take our mixture and now yes 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 let's take our mix and we're going 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.930
 to fill up to cover this piece of 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.930
 plastic so we went through 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.490
 with the other 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.120
 and have fingers or let it rest until 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.830
 to cool down or if you do not have time like 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.420
 I can put it in the freezer for 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.100
 half an hour and after having left them 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.020
 employ or have put them half an hour into 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.930
 our refrigerator we are going to take the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.260
 base we are going to fit it and we are going to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.260
 to tight 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.340
 and the same thing we do with the other 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.330
 we complete and ready they have some of them 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.700
 refilled again we can 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.950
 check it by opening it the way 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.530
 traditional will see that it is as if 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.240
 outside a new new 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.790
 we do the same with the other we open it 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.620
 and we see that there is no difference is a 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.600
 new again think the correct way to 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.980
 Fill your fingers and as you can see no 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.530
 you have to do nothing strange to put him 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.410
 plastic fill it as if it were a 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.330
 ice cream all that we saw on the internet 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.910

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.770
 please give this video like that I 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.870
 it helps a lot for youtube if you do not 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.850
 interact with my videos means that 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.340
 they do not like them and therefore they are going to 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.739
 start to see less and less in your line 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.590
 of time so they interact give like 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.360
