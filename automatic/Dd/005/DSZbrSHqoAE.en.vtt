00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.080
 toyota highlander car 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.800
 This is the third generation, but I would like to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.900
 a little bit 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.529

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.080
 why is this car 2014 occupied 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 first position in sales yes he would 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.050
 he was the most direct really rare 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.449
 my people have been waiting for him for half a year and just 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.600
 example of this car would like 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.350
 advantage advantage he has a lot 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.610
 compared to their competitors 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.649
 which are almost as such and not in 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.800
 Russia this car comes with 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.039
 motor like 2 and 7 is front-wheel drive 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 so and three and a half liter 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.980
 the engine that is most in demand 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.850
 enjoy because he has 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.829
 four-wheel drive so that for our all the same 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.339
 climatic conditions more acceptable 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.340
 having a power of 249 horsepower on this 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.680
 car up thanks to its immense 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.960
 the trunk and third-row seats could 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.900
 can and personally checked fit 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.430
 exactly 7 grown man is not easy 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.130
 children 7 adult and what 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.190
 comfortable enough to sit back and here it is 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.680
 there is another dog loaded there 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.670
 and go somewhere a journey that is but 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.830
 really a car like that 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.360
 opportunity gives you and most importantly i 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.360
 right now it's just that 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.630
 so here is the luggage compartment in 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.140
 this car is big enough 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.700
 and here it looks if 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.470
 we are the third row of seats yes not 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.180
 decompose departure 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.650
 if all the same to decompose it now I 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.730
 this show that's just 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.080
 laid out 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.420
 the third row of seats yes and it is clear that the place 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.270
 on the one hand a lot on the other 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.200
 the parties really manage to eat such 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.200
 clear advantage like 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.960
 the ability of the second row of seats up 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.720
 move back and forth so on a little bit 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.520
 reduce the seat in the second row of seats and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 so it remains like this 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.690
 big knife big to luggage 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.940
 branch where you can 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.710
 at least one large suitcase 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.730
 put the date and 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.410
 2 if it is a small income just 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660
 the third lane seat happens this way 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.000
 way that is this sitting date 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.880
 appears on the slider and here we are 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.060
 We appear on the third really 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.270
 Salon very much mean in conclusion 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.030
 I would like to give peace vat yes here 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.230
 this particular model 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.080
 really such a very, 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.890
 functional if you have a big family 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.750

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.570

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.290
 bike is a plus you there is a big family 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.380
 and here is an animal and the main thing is this 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.880
 car proved that all this 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.950
 functionality it has 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.170
 that is, despite the fact that it gives 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.710
 there would have been reliable to this 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.010
 security but 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.020
 how much there might be the second 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.340
 generation is not up to love inside the knees type 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.140

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.070
 quality that is all finishing 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.790
 materials 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:43.030
 here it all contributes just 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:46.689
