turning this bike has the head tube is a

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.109 
turning this bike has the head tube is a
little<00:00:25.949> bit<00:00:26.070> steeper<00:00:26.460> than<00:00:26.579> normal<00:00:26.909> bikes

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
really do make this bike really really

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.699 
really do make this bike really really
fun<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.679> easy<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.039> use<00:01:54.350> one<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.619> to

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
fun and easy to use one they like to

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.550 
fun and easy to use one they like to
point<00:01:55.889> out<00:01:56.039> for<00:01:56.399> new<00:01:56.729> users<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.990> maybe

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
point out for new users and if you maybe

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.989 
point out for new users and if you maybe
it's<00:01:58.799> your<00:01:58.920> first<00:01:59.039> time<00:01:59.310> you've<00:01:59.490> written<00:01:59.850> a

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
it's your first time you've written a

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's your first time you've written a
fixie<00:02:00.359> or<00:02:00.689> you've<00:02:01.259> written<00:02:01.409> pixies<00:02:01.799> before

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
fixie or you've written pixies before

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.370 
fixie or you've written pixies before
but<00:02:03.029> they've<00:02:03.149> always<00:02:03.299> had<00:02:03.509> both<00:02:03.990> front<00:02:04.289> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
but they've always had both front and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.249 
but they've always had both front and
rear<00:02:04.529> brakes<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:06.179> bike<00:02:06.450> these<00:02:06.810> 6k

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
rear brakes is that this bike these 6k

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.600 
rear brakes is that this bike these 6k
you<00:02:07.380> only<00:02:07.619> comes<00:02:07.889> with<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.159> front<00:02:08.459> brake

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you only comes with a front brake

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.789 
you only comes with a front brake
standard<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.479> front<00:02:10.019> brake<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.349> pretty<00:02:10.590> much

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
standard so front brake is pretty much

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.520 
standard so front brake is pretty much
what<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.280> mostly<00:02:11.849> need<00:02:11.939> to<00:02:12.269> stop<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
what you mostly need to stop but if you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.980 
what you mostly need to stop but if you
live<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.069> hilly<00:02:14.459> city<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.840> may

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
live in a very hilly city and you may

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.559 
live in a very hilly city and you may
need<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> use<00:02:16.319> your<00:02:16.470> break<00:02:16.860> for<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> long<00:02:17.670> time

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
need to use your break for a long time

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.059 
need to use your break for a long time
in<00:02:18.810> order<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.020> come<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.319> complete<00:02:19.620> stop<00:02:19.800> or

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
in order to come to a complete stop or

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.740 
in order to come to a complete stop or
just<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.280> avoid<00:02:20.490> going<00:02:20.640> really<00:02:20.819> fast<00:02:21.060> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
just to avoid going really fast you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.170 
just to avoid going really fast you
should<00:02:22.260> probably<00:02:22.500> consider<00:02:23.250> getting<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.910> back

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
should probably consider getting a back

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.870 
should probably consider getting a back
break<00:02:24.480> put<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.810> after<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.170> buy<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.350> bike

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
break put on after you buy this bike

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.730 
break put on after you buy this bike
it's<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.420> good<00:02:27.569> idea<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.560> said

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
it's a really good idea like I said

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.800 
it's a really good idea like I said
especially<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:29.220> hilly<00:02:29.400> cities<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.120> places

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
especially for hilly cities or places

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.350 
especially for hilly cities or places
where<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.080> get<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> lot<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> rain<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:33.180> don't

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
where you get a lot of rain you don't

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.199 
where you get a lot of rain you don't
want<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.590> risk<00:02:34.950> getting<00:02:35.850> injured

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
want to you know risk getting injured

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.800 
want to you know risk getting injured
just<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:37.680> save<00:02:38.520> weight<00:02:38.819> especially<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:39.690> you're

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
just to save weight especially if you're

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.059 
just to save weight especially if you're
just<00:02:39.930> commuting<00:02:40.290> around<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:40.620> something<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:40.950> it

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
just commuting around or something on it

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.710 
just commuting around or something on it
so<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.730> be<00:02:41.850> forewarned<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.420> comes<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:42.690> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
so just be forewarned it comes with a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.330 
so just be forewarned it comes with a
front<00:02:42.900> brake<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:43.800> all<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> comes<00:02:44.190> with

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
front brake but that's all it comes with

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.890 
front brake but that's all it comes with
so<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.880> might<00:02:45.000> want<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.150> get<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.360> back<00:02:45.570> okay

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
so you might want to get it back okay

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.030 
so you might want to get it back okay
one<00:02:46.230> other<00:02:46.380> thing<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:46.709> liked<00:02:46.950> about

one other thing I really liked about

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.770 
one other thing I really liked about

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
platform pedals are really nice because

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.750 
platform pedals are really nice because
they're<00:02:50.580> nice<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:50.880> wide<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:52.230> they<00:02:52.860> give<00:02:53.580> lots

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
they're nice and wide and they give lots

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.250 
they're nice and wide and they give lots

of room to get on and off the bike
simply<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.070> easily<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.910> they're<00:02:57.420> also<00:02:57.780> don't

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
simply and easily and they're also don't

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.600 
simply and easily and they're also don't
have<00:02:58.110> any<00:02:58.170> sharp<00:02:58.769> metal<00:02:58.980> edges<00:02:59.160> or<00:02:59.459> anything

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
have any sharp metal edges or anything

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.610 
have any sharp metal edges or anything
like<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.819> they're<00:03:00.090> plastic<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.810> if<00:03:01.470> you're

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
like that they're plastic so if you're

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.020 
like that they're plastic so if you're
writing<00:03:01.769> fix<00:03:02.069> gear<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.489> happen<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.850> brush

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
writing fix gear and happen to brush

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
writing fix gear and happen to brush
against<00:03:03.300> your<00:03:03.390> leg<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:03.989> to

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
against your leg it's not going to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.930 
against your leg it's not going to
scrape<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.560> or<00:03:04.860> cut<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.489> open

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
scrape you or cut you open

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.030 
scrape you or cut you open

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
so yeah this the platform pedals are

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.610 
so yeah this the platform pedals are
pretty<00:03:09.000> standard<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.420> newer<00:03:09.720> bikes<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.319> nicer

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
pretty standard on newer bikes and nicer

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.140 
pretty standard on newer bikes and nicer
bikes<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.000> comes

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
bikes but on this one that comes

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.000 
bikes but on this one that comes
standard<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.660> makes<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.319> really<00:03:13.650> good<00:03:13.860> writing

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
standard and makes a really good writing

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.440 
standard and makes a really good writing
experience<00:03:14.489> how<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.700> grips<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.300> bike

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
experience how the grips on this bike

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.210 
experience how the grips on this bike
are<00:03:15.630> really<00:03:15.810> nice<00:03:15.959> they're<00:03:16.350> out<00:03:16.590> regripped

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
are really nice they're out regripped

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.620 
are really nice they're out regripped
so<00:03:17.370> they<00:03:17.519> are<00:03:17.670> very<00:03:17.910> comfortable<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.420> ride

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
so they are very comfortable to ride

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.539 
so they are very comfortable to ride
with<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.110> they<00:03:19.799> don't<00:03:19.950> slide<00:03:20.190> off<00:03:20.250> or

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
with and they don't slide off or

with and they don't slide off or
anything<00:03:20.700> like<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.140> they're<00:03:22.140> high-quality

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
anything like that they're high-quality

speed<00:05:43.259> I've<00:05:43.469> maxed<00:05:43.919> this<00:05:44.009> bike<00:05:44.190> out<00:05:44.340> around<00:05:44.550> 28

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
speed I've maxed this bike out around 28

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.809 
speed I've maxed this bike out around 28
miles<00:05:45.270> per<00:05:45.509> hour<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:46.710> that's<00:05:47.159> writing<00:05:47.520> fixed

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:47.819 
miles per hour and that's writing fixed

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.850 
miles per hour and that's writing fixed
gear<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.630> can't<00:05:49.020> really<00:05:49.169> move<00:05:49.409> my<00:05:49.560> legs<00:05:49.740> a

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
gear so I can't really move my legs a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.260 
gear so I can't really move my legs a
whole<00:05:49.979> lot<00:05:50.099> faster<00:05:50.490> than<00:05:50.580> 30<00:05:50.759> miles<00:05:51.000> an<00:05:51.180> hour

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
whole lot faster than 30 miles an hour

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.559 
whole lot faster than 30 miles an hour
so<00:05:52.009> 28<00:05:53.009> is<00:05:53.159> pretty<00:05:53.370> much<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.699> fastest<00:05:54.479> I'm

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
so 28 is pretty much the fastest I'm

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.450 
so 28 is pretty much the fastest I'm
really<00:05:54.779> feel<00:05:55.110> safe<00:05:55.409> going<00:05:55.620> with<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.099> if<00:05:56.310> I'm

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
really feel safe going with and if I'm

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.939 
here usually I take my feet off the
pedals<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.449> just<00:06:00.900> let<00:06:01.080> momentum<00:06:01.500> take<00:06:01.710> me<00:06:01.830> to

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
pedals and just let momentum take me to

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.010

the bottom of the hill and rest my feet
on<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.469> frame<00:06:05.099> but<00:06:06.000> yeah<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.240> single<00:06:06.449> gear<00:06:06.599> is

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
on the frame but yeah the single gear is

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.930 
on the frame but yeah the single gear is
really<00:06:07.080> fun<00:06:07.319> and<00:06:07.680> it's<00:06:07.889> a<00:06:07.979> great<00:06:08.099> ratio<00:06:08.550> it's

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
really fun and it's a great ratio it's

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.269 
really fun and it's a great ratio it's
not<00:06:09.120> that<00:06:09.270> bad<00:06:09.389> going<00:06:09.659> up<00:06:09.750> hills<00:06:10.020> and<00:06:10.349> I<00:06:10.949> really

you about is the high ten steel frame
high<00:06:21.300> ten<00:06:21.539> steel<00:06:21.840> is<00:06:22.139> a<00:06:22.879> not<00:06:23.879> the<00:06:24.000> best<00:06:24.210> steel

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
high ten steel is a not the best steel
