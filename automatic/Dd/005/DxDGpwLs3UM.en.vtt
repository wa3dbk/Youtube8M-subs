 who got the bi cathy of all the computer drives 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.460
 system backup than it does 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.479
 all stern 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.770
 It's really good, it's programming itself. 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.039
 ansa 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:30.940
 after 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.759
 do this procedure 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.919
 who also highlights the entrance 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.229
 request 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.449
 caused this debut album 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.449
 This program is very good too. 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.620
 how i am 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.620
 I'm just going to put practically this one here. 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.539
 in a segment in 2h10 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.620
 next year 1 to 15 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.860
 this study here is the only one given this 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.439
 the campaign 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.580
 protectionism 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.729
 to take them off to geek to get injured in the case of tinga 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:06.770
 the coach 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.060
 only to everything 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.439
 consequence of practicing acts fragmentation the partition 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:14.180
 it is a criticism upon decision 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.749
 the theft he had 15 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.759
 injured check here in this seven jobs 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.789
 they argued that optimizing 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.580
 is the best 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.039
 then he will need a lot of revolt then pause and here it will take a lot 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.009
 this is already the room 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.719
 the idea was to get back on the real 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:37.729
 and farc nor 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:38.839
 toumba 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:43.829
 now everything is from the little church and that is why it feeds from the West more 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.159
 Here it goes 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.809
 load this one from there to load 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:50.529
 And how cool is it here? 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.509
 he was already sure everything cleaner sucker 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.210
 but the 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.749
 faster 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.619
 clearly faster 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.279
 and it's very good - program 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:02.729
 do these three steps 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.589
 wanted haiti cep crisis these programs 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:07.169
 bearer of stay 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.900
 like New 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.099
 the bath 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.099
 Hey, everyone! 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.379
 but it was another class entourage 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.139
 He hopes it's Joseph. 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.510
 and until next year the next video lesson was worth
