00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.370
 on this car qashqai double 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.769
 engine with early diagnosis was 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.280
 Candle wells observed 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.580
 when diagnosing candles oil 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.779
 therefore, the gasket should be replaced here. 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.349
 valve cover and candle wells 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:34.280
 it requires initially 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:38.899
 unscrew the engine cover as well 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.629
 required to unscrew the corrugation from the air 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.289
 filter which goes throttle 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.289
 dampers 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.130
 also required from the collector to understand 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.130
 all crankcase ventilation pipes 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.009
 and garden 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.850
 follow-up action is required to remove 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.430
 throttle is preferably not 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.070
 disconnecting an electronic chip from it 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.230
 throttle control not to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:09.649
 break up 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:12.350
 throttle parameters took away 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.390
 throttle aside we 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.110
 proceed directly to 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.880
 unscrewing the intake manifold 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.340
 the intake manifold fasteners are located 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.340
 on throttle times 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.610
 directly ahead 5 mounts and 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.660
 a little bit at the back 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.880
 unscrewing all mounts directly 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.880
 remove the intake manifold 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.170
 so we access the valve cover 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:24.170
 after removing the intake manifold we 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.070
 unscrew the coil of candles and free 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.820
 valve cover from all mounts right 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.540
 so that nothing would hinder us and 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.540
 take off 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.330
 we see a bobbin in oil 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.120
 what is the cause of skip valve 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.120
 covers 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.710
 new gasket set on landing 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.870
 places 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.870
 it is put only in one position 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.790
 clear the seat and set 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.790
 cover 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.800
 we clamp 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:07.400
 we clamp the center of the valve cover fix 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.400
 Apparently we clamp the edges diagonally. 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.710
 further assembly goes in reverse order 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.280
 replacing the valve cover gasket 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:31.590
 we have eliminated the flow of oil into the candle 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.590
 wells that could produce up to 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:38.669
 spoilage of candle tips as oil 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.739
 corrode and on hit 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:45.459
 What could be wrong? 

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:49.719
 candle work that affects 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:52.529
 engine build and increased 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.529
 fuel consumption
