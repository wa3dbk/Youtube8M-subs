00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
pretty cheap in my opinion and I can

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.410 
pretty cheap in my opinion and I can
afford<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.480> yeah<00:00:43.550> anyways<00:00:44.550> guys<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.030> usually

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
afford it so yeah anyways guys I usually

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
afford it so yeah anyways guys I usually
start<00:00:45.570> off<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.840> bare<00:00:45.989> rock<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.440> hit<00:00:46.680> my<00:00:46.860> first

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
start off on bare rock and hit my first

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.910 
start off on bare rock and hit my first
patch<00:00:48.090> which<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.600> right<00:00:48.899> next<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> barrack

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
patch which is right next to the barrack

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.600 
patch which is right next to the barrack
castle<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> reason<00:00:52.590> why<00:00:52.739> i<00:00:52.770> use<00:00:53.280> super

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
castle and the reason why i use super

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.900 
castle and the reason why i use super
combos<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.629> trees<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.789> you're

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
combos for my trees because when you're

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.080 
combos for my trees because when you're
doing<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.360> trees<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.780> least<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:59.430> payment

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
doing you trees at least on the payment

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.650 
doing you trees at least on the payment
is<00:01:00.239> way<00:01:00.899> too<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:02.190> price<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.789> i'm

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
is way too over like over price on i'm

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
is way too over like over price on i'm
pretty<00:01:03.899> sure<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> payment<00:01:04.559> itself<00:01:05.010> costs

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
pretty sure the payment itself costs

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.219 
pretty sure the payment itself costs
like<00:01:05.640> almost<00:01:06.030> twice<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.479> amount<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> yew

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
like almost twice the amount of the yew

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.630 
like almost twice the amount of the yew
tree

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
tree

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
tree
my<00:01:08.850> opinion<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.210> definitely<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.870> worth<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
my opinion is definitely not worth it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.170 
my opinion is definitely not worth it
because<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:11.159> don't<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> money<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.000> do

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
because I don't have the money to do

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.660 
because I don't have the money to do
that<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> super<00:01:13.590> combos<00:01:13.950> works<00:01:14.190> just<00:01:14.460> fine

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that and super combos works just fine

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.620 
that and super combos works just fine
