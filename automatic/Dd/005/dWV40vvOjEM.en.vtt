00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.460
 Gray 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.359
 Today I want to give you the new setup 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.429
 and gauge cola dialoge the child 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.010
 Imagine is the first tattoo 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.649
 meter on for the car repair 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.879
 automatic effects is that yourself 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.280
 here about a 3 angle gauges 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.640
 latest generation with one 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.019
 advanced LED lighting technology that the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.400
 touchscreen has one 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.769
 touchscreen display with 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.140
 self-explanatory icon on the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.170
 bottom are four contact 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.449
 finds that make sure that the measurement 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.970
 is carried out correctly further 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.619
 There is a rubber ring which prevents 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.059
 that when eating wrong light penetrates 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:06.310
 Basically, the color measurement with 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.830
 the order is accepted as clean 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.250
 polished smooth surfaces near 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.650
 the area of ​​damage becomes the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:19.329
 meter polished on the sucker 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:23.970
 surface and it will be three 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.970
 Measurements performed with the fax machine 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.390
 the advantage now in cosmopolitan is that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.090
 simultaneously with the shade measurement 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.090
 also the effect is measured 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.929
 so after completion of the measurement, the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.090
 data then played back to the pc and 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.969
 there evaluated in our software ci 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.950
 Plus after we do the measurement 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.350
 we have now connected this 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.740
 meter older scans again with 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.450
 our pc and evaluate the measurement 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.799
 with the ci plus and the spectrum module 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.080
 It is advantageous if the manufacturer 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.090
 and the color code of the vehicle is known 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.030
 in our example this is one 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.069
 volkswagen with the color code lc phoenix so 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.200
 Now we start the search for the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.209
 suitable shade to us the facto 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.880
 measuring device or the software 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.950
 offers for the new cola dialoge 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.099
 tascam was a new spectro 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.769
 software developed for ci + looks here 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.569
 a mask where all the information to 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.540
 ride and evaluation and fatum 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.849
 In addition to values, the results are listed 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.519
 which are specified by the pc as well 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.069
 At the same time listed as the hue 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.859
 consistency or the effect 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.200
 Consistency is still there 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.170
 possibility visually the result too 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.970
 See once by seeing the goal 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.760
 what has been measured in ours 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.590
 Example of the Volkswagen and the result 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.329
 what is displayed from the database 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.000
 this is a 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.200
 corrected formula 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.250
 furthermore , the user has the 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.370
 possibility then visually through the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.380
 to work through the best menu 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.720
 drivers for themselves 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.849
 after completion of these evaluations 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.010
 he the possibility again the 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.889
 coal information to see over shade 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.109
 Hue boat ride increase templates 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.419
 number or variant respectively 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.130
 you can see the formula 1 in which 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.440
 The formula has been corrected 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.150
 is the conclusion then the formula 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.150
 vaguely sent to me
