on<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> inside<00:00:10.290> we're<00:00:10.620> working<00:00:11.040> exactly<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
on the inside we're working exactly the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.629 
on the inside we're working exactly the
other<00:00:12.030> way<00:00:12.360> around<00:00:12.620> creating<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.769> French<00:00:14.160> seam

which<00:00:15.450> has<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> five<00:00:16.170> millimeter<00:00:16.529> seam

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
which has a five millimeter seam

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210 
which has a five millimeter seam
allowance<00:00:17.580> only<00:00:18.439> but<00:00:19.439> first<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
allowance only but first you want to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.029 
allowance only but first you want to
turn<00:00:20.520> up<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> hem<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> centimeter<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.439> iron<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
turn up the hem a centimeter and iron it

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.990 
turn up the hem a centimeter and iron it
and<00:00:23.420> then<00:00:24.420> construct<00:00:25.320> your<00:00:25.740> first<00:00:26.130> seam<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and then construct your first seam and

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.259 
and then construct your first seam and
you<00:00:27.529> can<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:28.920> quite<00:00:29.099> slim<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.029> we're

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
you can see it's quite slim and we're

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
you can see it's quite slim and we're
just<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> cut<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.170> back<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.040> get

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
just going to cut it back now so we get

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.959 
just going to cut it back now so we get
it<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.520> three<00:00:32.969> millimeters<00:00:34.460> then<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.760> can

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it to three millimeters then you can

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.720 
it to three millimeters then you can
turn<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.630> over<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.860> sides<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.550> now

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
turn this over right sides are now

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.670 
turn this over right sides are now
facing<00:00:39.420> each<00:00:39.540> other<00:00:39.750> again<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> could

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
facing each other again and you could

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.920 
facing each other again and you could
pin<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.640> could<00:00:41.790> simply<00:00:42.149> iron<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
pin this or you could simply iron it and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.290 
pin this or you could simply iron it and
then<00:00:43.170> stitch<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.670> seam<00:00:44.879> allowance

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
then stitch it and the seam allowance

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.930 
then stitch it and the seam allowance
again<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.750> 0.5<00:00:46.500> millimeter<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
again is 0.5 millimeter so you get the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.119 
again is 0.5 millimeter so you get the
centimeter<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> end<00:00:49.050> iron<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> seam

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
centimeter in the end iron the seam

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.229 
centimeter in the end iron the seam
towards<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> back<00:00:50.989> turn<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> hem<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.949> we

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
towards the back turn up the hem and we

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.900 
towards the back turn up the hem and we
are<00:00:54.239> ready<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.629> construct<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.379> cuff<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.879> cuff

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

visible<00:01:56.189> from<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> outside<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.659> need<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
visible from the outside so you need to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.709 
visible from the outside so you need to
do<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.619> tightly<00:01:59.299> put<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> underneath
