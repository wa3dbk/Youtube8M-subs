00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.660
 hi to all through this mine 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.960
 video review I want to present a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.440
 book dedicated to the entire film saga 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.800
 the godfather headed by francis ford 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:27.029
 coppola and the film are three in total 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 were played by marlon brando at 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.859
 which won the Oscar for best actor 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.340
 corleone 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.950
 keaton we find robert gibbs 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.379
 and finally james keene 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 let's start from the front cover that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.800
 we find in the portrait 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.699
 marlon brando sitting in his chair 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.760

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:06.979

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.020
 we turn the book we find at the first one 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.020
 liter cover 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:28.630
 book I wrote in English so 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.130
 why he was not as familiar as me 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.119
 take the words melis meaning 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.689
 because other books there are photos ad 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.140
 high resolution photo enlarged 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.270
 which is possible to pay book of the street 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.470
 some photos for what is written more 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.770
 what else are we refusing to what 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:58.109
 They are all beautiful 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:04.289
 jean with the Luciana dish e 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:08.090
 now I show you browse the pages vi 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.090
 I show like people 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.740
 quite large and that if not exactly 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:26.370
 therefore it is possible to admire them 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.370
 all its splendor 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.450
 the godfather part iii we find pointing to 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:46.069
 has a daughter of 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.410
 I don't know if her daughter should 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.150
 to be the daughter of francis ford coppola 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.150
 sofia coppola for future will resign 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150
 directors 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.480
 I promise you elegant 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.700
 for every jolt from the company Amazon 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:17.510
 let's keep it bought well I spent 40 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:20.390
 euro shop of sliced bari costa 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.660
 this euro company for which the council 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.660
 of 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.650
 changes them 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.670
 shops 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.950
 so I consider buying it directly here 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.950
 on the site of the club because the price 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.950
 cheap 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.829
 all friends 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.200
 those worthy of the film but also luck 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.160
 what better 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.160
 contract the actors 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.989
 we believe so 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.070
 directors are also behind the scenes 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.610
 how they are enough is enriched is 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.610
 very interesting 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.160
 are several pages for which I am 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.639
 show pages written mind 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.080
 daughter would be very long 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.560
 I flip quickly just to give you 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.960
 averages of how you book if you decide to 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:27.990
 buy it but I repeat it is remake 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:32.210
 naturally the films the godfather purchase 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.210
 obliged to say so from now 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:50.620
 if then this shows the following trick 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:55.080
 of makeup while being turned into 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.080
 task with corleone marlon brando 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.870
 marlon brando sitting and francis ford 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:07.439
 coppola that rests the hand on the seat 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.439
 by marlon brando 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:20.399
 this is a most famous scene and nothing 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.399
 a book that 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:37.969
 quite enriched with written photos 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.969
 for an Englishman so immediately for those who know 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:46.740
 because he speaks it like Italian 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.419
 English may not have any 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.080
 difficulty in understanding the 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.849
 meaning of terminologies but for 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.139
 those who, on the other hand, have difficulties 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:59.699
 it is content simply to browse 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.219
 the pages to see the photos that are 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:10.469
 however in high resolution and that 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:12.439
 however, they nevertheless satisfy the subject 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:18.389
 however it remains satisfied 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:20.250
 of purchase for those who decide to take 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.050
 in short, so I recommend you take it 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.969
 on the site of the bat I do not repeat the 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:30.000
 title the woodcutter family album 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:33.000
 edition pockets for all fans 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.599
 I repeat as I have already said purchase 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.599
 bound
