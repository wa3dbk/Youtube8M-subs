for<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> replacement<00:00:15.260> so<00:00:16.369> first<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.840> you

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
for a replacement so first of all you

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.300 
for a replacement so first of all you
definitely<00:00:19.289> want<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> string<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.100> yours

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
definitely want to get a string of yours

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.269 
definitely want to get a string of yours
if<00:00:20.490> you're<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> use<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.949> one<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.130> has

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
if you're going to use it one that has

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.179 
if you're going to use it one that has
like<00:00:23.550> eighteen<00:00:24.180> percent<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.930> more<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
like eighteen percent or more and the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.640 
like eighteen percent or more and the
reason<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.510> level<00:00:27.689> 52<00:00:28.170> item

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
reason for that is it's a level 52 item

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710 
reason for that is it's a level 52 item
all<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.580> other<00:00:29.699> stats<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
all the other stats on it are going to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.380 
all the other stats on it are going to
be<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.140> low<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:32.430> reason<00:00:32.880> why<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.059> build

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
be really low the reason why this build

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
be really low the reason why this build
is<00:00:33.480> good<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> reduced<00:00:34.800> damage

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
is good is because of the reduced damage

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.030 
is good is because of the reduced damage
from<00:00:35.340> melee<00:00:35.640> attacks<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:37.950> you

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
from melee attacks that so when do you

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.330 
from melee attacks that so when do you
want<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> belt<00:00:39.170> I<00:00:40.170> find<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> in

something like that it's not going to be

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.880 
something like that it's not going to be
because<00:01:15.080> there<00:01:16.080> were<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.290> too<00:01:16.500> many<00:01:16.530> moms

hitting me because they they just don't
hit<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> hard<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:23.009> replaced<00:01:23.400> my

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
hit that hard so I have replaced my

hit that hard so I have replaced my
string<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> years<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.170> you're<00:01:25.409> fighting

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
string of years but if you're fighting

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
string of years but if you're fighting
in<00:01:26.180> lower<00:01:27.180> gear<00:01:27.840> where<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.759> no<00:01:30.000> hope<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
in lower gear where you have no hope of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.030 
in lower gear where you have no hope of
killing<00:01:30.720> those<00:01:31.079> packs<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.890> those

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
killing those packs I have all those

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760 
killing those packs I have all those
effects<00:01:32.430> anyway<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.780> seeking<00:01:34.590> out

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
effects anyway and you're seeking out

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.130 
effects anyway and you're seeking out
the<00:01:35.220> melee<00:01:35.610> packs<00:01:35.880> are<00:01:36.210> relatively<00:01:36.689> easier

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the melee packs are relatively easier

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.810 
the melee packs are relatively easier
the<00:01:37.560> string<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.890> yours<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.250> help<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.549> defeat

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the string of yours will help you defeat

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.359 
the string of yours will help you defeat
those<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.070> idea<00:01:41.189> for

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
those so it's a it's a good idea for

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.780 
those so it's a it's a good idea for
that<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> i'm<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> show<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.159> why<00:01:44.759> i

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that so i'm going to show you now why i

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.149 
that so i'm going to show you now why i
have<00:01:45.090> replaced<00:01:45.390> my<00:01:45.780> string<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.079> years<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
have replaced my string of years and the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.850 
have replaced my string of years and the
reason<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.689> get<00:01:48.840> belts<00:01:49.259> later<00:01:49.680> on

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
reason is you can get belts later on

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.060 
reason is you can get belts later on
they're<00:01:50.159> much<00:01:50.549> better<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.119> terms<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:52.829> much

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
they're much better in terms of how much

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.840 
they're much better in terms of how much
protection<00:01:53.490> they're<00:01:54.000> giving<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> also

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
protection they're giving you and also

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:05.139 
protection they're giving you and also
other<00:01:56.850> stats<00:01:58.969> so<00:01:59.969> i<00:02:01.250> got<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> belt<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:03.840> some

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
other stats so i got this belt it's some

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.719

in fact I think I lose yeah I lose 3,000
dps<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.170> switch<00:02:49.410> back<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.460> huge

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
dps if I switch back that's a huge

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.090 
dps if I switch back that's a huge
amount<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.150> damage<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.560> focus<00:02:52.770> on

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
amount of damage now we have to focus on

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.690 
amount of damage now we have to focus on
doing<00:02:53.220> damage<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.960> definitely<00:02:55.710> definitely

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
doing damage so I definitely definitely

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.070 
doing damage so I definitely definitely
look<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.210> getting<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:58.190> belt<00:02:59.190> similar<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.760> this

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
look to getting a belt similar to this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.680 
look to getting a belt similar to this
when<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.200> can<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:03.120> other<00:03:03.270> reason<00:03:03.360> of

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
when you can and the other reason of

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.000 
when you can and the other reason of
course<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:04.020> it's<00:03:04.230> also<00:03:04.500> giving<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
course is it's also giving the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.100 
course is it's also giving the
resistance<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.700> all<00:03:05.880> elements<00:03:06.210> so<00:03:06.570> I'm<00:03:06.690> now

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
resistance to all elements so I'm now

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.830 
resistance to all elements so I'm now
much<00:03:07.410> better<00:03:07.440> protected<00:03:08.130> against<00:03:08.690> stuff<00:03:09.690> on

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
much better protected against stuff on

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.860 
much better protected against stuff on
the<00:03:09.930> ground<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:11.460> was<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:12.360> not<00:03:12.660> even

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
the ground and this was it's not even

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.980 
the ground and this was it's not even
close<00:03:13.080> it's<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.530> huge<00:03:13.950> upgrade<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:15.090> top<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
close it's a huge upgrade on top of the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
of people have trouble locating string

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.440 
of people have trouble locating string
of<00:03:43.020> yours<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.860> auction<00:03:43.980> house<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.730> the
