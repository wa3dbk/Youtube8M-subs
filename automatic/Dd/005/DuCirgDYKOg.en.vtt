things first things first here's the raw

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.209 
things first things first here's the raw
box<00:00:11.849> remote<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.870> charges<00:00:13.170> right<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
box remote it charges right here on the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.490 
box remote it charges right here on the
top<00:00:14.460> there's<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.880> little<00:00:15.000> USB<00:00:15.330> charger<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
top there's a little USB charger the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.400 
top there's a little USB charger the
on/off<00:00:16.920> switch<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> right<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:18.260> and<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
on/off switch is right here and the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.630 
on/off switch is right here and the
first<00:00:19.590> thing<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> open<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
first thing I do is going to open the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.790 
first thing I do is going to open the
back<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.029> remote<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.449> take<00:00:21.990> out<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.199> USB

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
back the remote and take out the USB

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.109 
back the remote and take out the USB
stick<00:00:23.039> inside<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.880> way

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
stick inside so what this is is the way

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.370 
stick inside so what this is is the way
that<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.510> remote<00:00:27.779> communicates<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
that the remote communicates with the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.140 
that the remote communicates with the
box<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.460> you're<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.849> take<00:00:29.970> this

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
box so you're just going to take this

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.690 
box so you're just going to take this
USB<00:00:30.510> sick<00:00:30.929> will<00:00:31.080> put<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> root<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.700> remote

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
USB sick will put the root the remote

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.280 
USB sick will put the root the remote
aside<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.210> you're<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.480> take<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.960> bag

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
aside and you're going to take the bag

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that came in with the raw box and inside

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
that came in with the raw box and inside
this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.920> USB<00:00:38.820> extender<00:00:39.300> cable<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> it's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this is a USB extender cable so it's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.069 
this is a USB extender cable so it's
pretty<00:00:41.940> straightforward<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.899> take

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
pretty straightforward you just take

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.229 
pretty straightforward you just take
this<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> there's<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> female<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
this and there's a female and here and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.799 
this and there's a female and here and
the<00:00:45.539> USB<00:00:46.200> connector<00:00:46.710> will<00:00:46.800> go<00:00:46.920> inside<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.430> that

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
the USB connector will go inside of that

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.479 
the USB connector will go inside of that
this<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.620> turn<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.860> plugged<00:00:50.309> into

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
this then will in turn be plugged into

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.990 
this then will in turn be plugged into
the<00:00:50.670> raw<00:00:50.820> box<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.660> we'll<00:00:52.350> open<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.000> box

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the raw box so we'll open up the box

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.319 
the raw box so we'll open up the box
here<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.170> pretty<00:00:55.440> straightforward<00:00:56.329> you're

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
power button for the raw box two places

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
power button for the raw box two places
for<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> antenna<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> take

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
each end you need these for Wi-Fi if

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.880 
each end you need these for Wi-Fi if
you're<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.900> you're<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> use<00:01:16.560> Wi-Fi

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you're if you're not going to use Wi-Fi

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.929 
you're if you're not going to use Wi-Fi
you<00:01:17.850> don't<00:01:18.180> require<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.810> antennas<00:01:19.320> okay<00:01:20.310> but

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
you don't require the antennas okay but

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
you don't require the antennas okay but
if<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> use<00:01:21.869> Wi-Fi<00:01:22.110> you're

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
if you are going to use Wi-Fi you're

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.620 
if you are going to use Wi-Fi you're
going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> require<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.220> antennas<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> connect

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
going to require the antennas to connect

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
going to require the antennas to connect
to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> signal<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> power

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
to the signal and you just have a power

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.310 
to the signal and you just have a power
cable<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.360> which<00:01:28.320> plugs<00:01:28.770> into<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
cable here which plugs into here and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
cable here which plugs into here and
you'll<00:01:31.320> plug<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.680> end<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.460> wall<00:01:32.970> into

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you'll plug that end into the wall into

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.600 
you'll plug that end into the wall into
the<00:01:33.810> plug-in<00:01:34.259> obviously<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the plug-in obviously and then this

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.109 
the plug-in obviously and then this
plugs<00:01:35.909> into<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> DC<00:01:36.450> open<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
plugs into the DC open so that's it

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.719 
plugs into the DC open so that's it
there<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.740> optional<00:01:40.740> wall<00:01:41.220> mount<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
there is a optional wall mount for the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.499 
there is a optional wall mount for the
raw<00:01:42.210> box<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.829> there<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.299> charger<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
raw box and there is the charger for the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
raw box and there is the charger for the
remote<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.890> also<00:01:47.009> take<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.909> you
