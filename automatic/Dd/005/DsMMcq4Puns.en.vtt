00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 very good guys how are you in this new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.250
 video let's see two ways of the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.290
 which we can do a kind of 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.269
 home speakers which are going to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.130
 allow us to hear enough 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.139
 higher our phone 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.420
 All this is done in a very 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.390
 simple and with materials that we have 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.859
 at home so I would not spend 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.480
 absolutely nothing so nothing if 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.740
 you want to know how to do it you know what 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.949
 what do you have to do cause here in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.949
 android 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.640
 good guys before you start 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.620
 I just wanted to tell you that if you 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.239
 you like this kind of videos you support us 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.730
 with a like so that we keep going up 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.890
 content a few days ago we upload the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.450
 first live action video which 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.160
 we went up different life hacks in the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.320
 technological field and the truth is that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.309
 this video you liked a lot is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.680
 that's why we 're going to continue doing 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.150
 videos of this subject and if quiet 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.760
 we will also have the next episode 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.220
 of live hacks very soon so I've 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.980
 that said we started for the first 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.739
 way, the only thing we need will be a 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.770
 bowl that has this shape you can use 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.420
 a glass a bowl or any other 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.130
 but I think that the one 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.770
 you are watching right now on screen 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.350
 would have the perfect shape would not be 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.570
 very closed nor would it be very open 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.789
 and some guys like that we would complete the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.770
 first form has been easy truth what 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.170
 The only thing we have left is to play the music 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.910
 introduce it inside the bowl what 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.130
 let's do is put so much music 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.030
 outside like music inside so you can 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.030
 appreciate the difference 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.009
 and good the explanation behind that is 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.049
 pretty simple we simply 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.520
 we put the smartphone in this bowl and 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.650
 the sound what is bouncing 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.930
 between all the walls and everything would come out 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.340
 in this direction however with the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.560
 speaker is only our smartphone 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.180
 would come out in all directions and from 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 this way we would see it lower for 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.000
 this second way is also going to be very 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.340
 simple but in this case we will avoid 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.560
 some instruments to dry or two glasses 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.290
 plastic of these from the bottle already 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.940
 you know later we need a tube here 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.830
 of these cardboard paper 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.209
 kitchen could also be done with 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.160
 toilet paper but good 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.620
 preferably this since it is something more 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.959
 elongated and then scissors and a 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.670
 good felt tipper let's start and what 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.010
 first thing we have to do is catch 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.620
 the cardboard tube and place our 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.120
 smartphone more or less in the middle one 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.069
 once we have it simply with the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.140
 marker we are going to mark the contour of 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.360
 our phone since after that there will be 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.549
 the place where we put our 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.019
 phone once you have already 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.090
 marked does not need to be 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.170
 Exactly you can do it a little bit to the eye 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.190
 take the scissors and remember that part 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.260
 when we have done that simply 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.430
 we take the two plastic cups and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.400
 we place 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.920
 on one of the sides we again take 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.189
 the marker and we mark the outline and 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.989
 that we also have to cut those pieces 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.700
 in this case I would not have a cutter but 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.890
 if you have it use it since it would be 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.930
 pretty better but just like me 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.930
 you can do it with scissors without problems 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.250
 well once we've done this in 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.990
 both glasses and we only have to put the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.750
 cardboard tube for each of the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.010
 holes that we have cut in the glasses 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.980
 letting the cut that we have made in 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.870
 the cardboard is pointing up and 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.520
 ready guys we would have here our 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.500
 home speakers the truth is that 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.150
 they are a little bit ugly clandestine 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.250
 the fact here a little faster since 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.980
 I'm not very handy but then this 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.470
 could we decorate paint or what 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.970
 you want 6 so nothing guys 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.970
 we only have to prove it 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.540
 good guys up here the video today 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.459
 I would love the comments 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.959
 You put your opinions about 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.330
 this kind of new videos that other 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.470
 people in the channel who are a bit 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.060
 different what you are used to do not 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.650
 are applications are not games are not 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.030
 mobile is closely related to the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.130
 technology and I think I can contribute 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.049
 much this content to the channel so 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.580
 I do not expect so much your like if it has 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.630
 liked the video like you 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.100
 comments 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.820
