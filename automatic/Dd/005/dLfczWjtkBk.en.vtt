00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 educate tina the education sign number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.429
 one of Latin America let's solve the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.000
 next combined operation if first 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.880
 we separate in terms we're going to see that the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.180
 first term is a great product by 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.010
 what we are going to realize the property 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.840
 distributive that is root of 12 per 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.600
 root of 3 + root of 12 by 1 - root of 3 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.160
 by root of three you give me root of 3 by 1 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.930
 therefore we have root of 2 x root of 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.450
 3 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.740
 plus 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.740
 following 12 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.899
 - root of 3 x root of 3 - root of 3 very 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.540
 well then the second term what 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.630
 we could do is 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.380
 put together the two roots we have two roots 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.800
 square 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.400
 this could be equal to the square root 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.430
 of 8 by 2 and the last term for now 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.940
 and just for now we're going to leave it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.940
 what is 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.729
 What we are going to do now is put together the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.729
 rest of the roots that contain a 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.590
 same index for example root of 12 root 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.289
 square of 12 by square root of 3 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.149
 can be equal to the root root square 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:28.189
 clear state of 12 by 3 + square root 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.110
 of 12 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.819
 here we have the same less root 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.690
 square of 3 by 3 minus square root 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.570
 of 3 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:45.210
 more here we can go solving the root 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:48.150
 square of 16 minus one fifth of root 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 square of 75 let's leave there for 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.790
 now 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.190
 well let's solve what we can what 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.130
 it is within the roots 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.590
 we have a square root of 12 times three 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.480
 36 plus square root of 12 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.740
 - square root of 9 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:14.050
 - square root of 3 + square root of 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:18.420
 16 minus one fifth of the square root 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.950
 of 75 what we can do now is go 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.340
 solving some roots that we can 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.650
 for example the square root of 36 that 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.440
 is 6 the square root of 9 which is 3 in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.880
 this case minus 3 cabestany and the root 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.270
 square of 16 that the 4 the rest of the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.270
 roots let's factor their values 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.120
 that are inside therefore to 2 what 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.520
 let's write as 2 squared by 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.740
 3 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:56.690
 let's consider the same root of 3 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:02.819
 4 - one fifth and 75 we are going to 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:05.069
 consider as 5 squared by 3 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.310
 already in this part we are much more 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.150
 advanced well 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:17.400
 we extract the factors that we can 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:24.080
 let's have 6 + 2 square root of 3 - 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:29.280
 3 - square root of 34 minus one fifth 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:33.250
 by 5 the square root of 3 well here 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.550
 we can simplify this 5 with this 5 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.320
 and we will be finally or not 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:45.190
 finally but in a more advanced step 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:50.680
 6 bass 2 root of 3 - 3 - root of 3 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.810
 4 - root of 3 well now we group 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.470
 those terms that contain the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.470
 root of 3 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.960
 separated from those terms that do not 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.340
 contain the root of three we are going to 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:09.600
 have then two root of three less 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.550
 root of three less root of three root 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.790
 square always if not clear spoke of 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.870
 a square root then we have more 6 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.709
 minus 3 4 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.530
 well let's look at we have 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.000
 two roots of three to which we are going to 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.050
 remove one we would have 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.690
 a single root of 3 a root of 3 less 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.320
 a root of 3 are zero roots of 3 is 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:42.110
 say they cancel well 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:49.730
 therefore we would have 0 roots of 3 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:52.700
 more 63 is 347 finally this as well 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.240
 I said it is annulled and the final result is going to 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.630
 be 7 notice then observe as of 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.540
 a somewhat complex expression because 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.960
 it was not simple well until we have 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.360
 here at the beginning 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:14.520
 we come from this expression we come to 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.520
 that all this is equal to the simple number 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.520
 7 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.900
 to see the continuation of this topic 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.710
 educationally I recommend that you see the 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.710
