00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.792
 Have you ever been overwhelmed by the need to face problems? 

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:20.959
 Well, if you feel trapped by negative thoughts and frustration, 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.796
 I feel that the intestines are knotted and overwhelmed. 

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:28.266
 Just like I am now; 

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.846
 Sometimes, you may feel that you are falling into the trap. 

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:32.776
 Or like a wall in front of you, 

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:35.256
 This is a very real feeling, 

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:40.696
 And the difficulties I want to overcome, 

00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:42.396
 It is also very real. 

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:45.772
 What do you think of when you hear rock climbers? 

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:47.932
 Maybe someone like this, 

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:52.292
 A muscular, unkempt man? 

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:54.012
 (laughter) 

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:57.682
 When people know that I am climbing, they will be surprised, 

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.412
 Because I am so small, 

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:02.589
 They will think, "Are you climbing?" 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.709
 The answer is "Yes, I am climbing!" 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.969
 And it’s been a long time, 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.129
 It’s about seven years, more than the time I spent most of my life, 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.719
 (laughter) 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.090
 Well, the first rock climbing was in Central Park, New York City. 

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:22.792
 This person's name is Yuki, and he told me the rules of entry for rock climbing. 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800
 He told me to enjoy rock climbing, you only need 

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.599
 A pair of rock climbing shoes and a bag of powder bags. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.159
 Also told me that the route of rock climbing is called "problem". 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.821
 There is also difficulty rating. 

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:41.626
 The letter V is written on the left and the number is on the right. 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.168
 It’s that simple, 

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.338
 The smaller the number, the lower the difficulty. 

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:50.618
 For example, V0 is like climbing a ladder. 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.070
 But the V16 is close to an impossible task. 

00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:59.600
 One of the reasons I like rock climbing is that no matter what your body size is, 

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:04.059
 Whether you are small, big, light, heavy, 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.469
 The route will not change. 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.469
 But you can challenge it in different ways. 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.718
 In the past, my body was smaller than the rock climbers beside me. 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:19.610
 So I have to master the skills of placing my hands and feet. 

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:24.750
 I like to think of it as a puzzle, and I like to make puzzles. 

00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.170
 (laughter) 

00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:29.791
 Rock climbing has become my interest, 

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.670
 Gradually, it allowed me to travel around the world, 

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:38.050
 Well, do you know where this is? Someone guessed it? 

00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:39.360
 No, OK. 

00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.321
 Well, actually this is in New York, 

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:44.940
 At that time, I was still very small. 

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.381
 (laughter) 

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.627
 I also traveled to Spain. 

00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:55.342
 But the last time I went to the Republic of South Africa, 

00:02:55.343 --> 00:03:00.229
 My goal there is to improve women's rock climbing standards. 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.680
 Challenge the route of difficulty V14. 

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:08.293
 (cheers, applause) 

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:17.743
 Only another woman and a few men 

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:20.164
 Reach this level. 

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:24.221
 I challenged the first day of the Golden Shadow route. 

00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:27.081
 I decided to divide it into several paragraphs. 

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:31.482
 So I can test myself, 

00:03:31.484 --> 00:03:34.636
 See if I can succeed in the end. 

00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:39.827
 Even though I was surprised that I could complete all the paragraphs, 

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:43.203
 There is still an impossible task left 

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:46.194
 That is to go all the way at once. 

00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:52.572
 Well, in the next few days, I climbed from sunrise to sunset. 

00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:56.206
 Even later, climb with the headlights, 

00:03:57.256 --> 00:04:02.959
 I kept climbing until my hands were bleeding and my eyes were tearful. 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.973
 I really want success, I am stubborn. 

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:13.659
 I went down again and again but every time I got up and started again. 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.500
 Then I asked myself whether it was the hand or the foot or the body's center of gravity? 

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:26.215
 Finally, my father suggested that I change my target. 

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:30.359
 Because he thinks this route is beyond my ability, 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.494
 But I know that I have to try again at least, 

00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:38.954
 So I said: Why not try the last time? 

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:42.424
 So I put on my shoes again and put on climbing powder. 

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.705
 Then I succeeded! I don't know how I did it, 

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:50.665
 I just climbed the wall and continued to move. 

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:55.586
 I realized my dream; I stood on the highest point of the big rock, 

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:03.013
 Then I understand that the rock climbing has a 99% chance of falling down. 

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:06.144
 You may think that is a failure, 

00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:10.613
 Means that I dropped it again and again, 

00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:14.056
 And success, only 1% is possible. 

00:05:15.236 --> 00:05:18.965
 This is worth it! In the end it is really worth it! 

00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:21.878
 I agree with Bill Gates: 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.878
 "Success is a bad teacher." 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.772
 This is also closely related to my daily life. 

00:05:30.362 --> 00:05:33.610
 I have always had difficulty completing my homework. 

00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:38.541
 Because I have a very tight schedule, 

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:42.917
 I get up at 6 o'clock every morning and go to school. 

00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:46.360
 After school, I trained in the climbing hall for about four hours. 

00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:51.600
 When I got home, it was about half past ten. 

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.864
 Then I started doing my homework. 

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:58.732
 For me, my homework is also my V14. 

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.832
 (laughter) 

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:04.543
 The extent of my struggle with them is so high. 

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:10.203
 When your phone is in your pocket, it’s really easy to be distracted. 

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:16.812
 On social networking sites, like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, 

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.925
 Everyone only shares happy things, 

00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:26.155
 Like eating, I often share this kind of content. 

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:28.255
 (Laughter) Right. 

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:30.475
 Or like traveling, 

00:06:30.476 --> 00:06:36.685
 Everyone only saw me playing and rock climbing. 

00:06:36.686 --> 00:06:40.862
 But this is more like my real life, 

00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:42.802
 Yes, (Laughter) 

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:44.362
 I am super annoying! 

00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:45.643
 (laughter) 

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:51.018
 But from rock climbing, 

00:06:51.758 --> 00:06:58.537
 I learned that after class, I practice 99% of my success. 

00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:04.355
 Also know that anything worthwhile is not easy to accomplish. 

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:09.452
 But the effort will eventually pay off. 

00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:16.448
 I think it is very important to endure and climb the problems that are faced. 

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:20.156
 Because failure is a very important part of success, 

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:26.065
 You don't need to be a rock climber to understand this. 

00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:31.637
 I like to think of everyone in the lecture hall as a rock climber. 

00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:34.299
 Think about it, what is your V14? 

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:39.748
 Because after all, we have a rock climber in our hearts. 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:40.909
 Thank you! 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.530
 (cheers, applause)
