00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.430
 monsters dance to 50 you are in number 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.619
 I go through all and then comes 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.120
 something else to surprise you before 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.800
 maybe there will be times between 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.809
 videos a different tips and tricks 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.420
 video to another student and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 leisure activities collectibles or 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.020
 Whatever lets you surprise 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.550
 yes we are in the weinort hills here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.550
 with a bulli t and it is something 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 different 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.620
 Let's go the first monster 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.960
 stood at the I do now that 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:13.080
 is the handle on the hills it is 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 the Galileo observatory the ride 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 practically from the galileo observatory here 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.570
 the small sandweg highly tuned here where 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.550
 horse trails stands us a trail i 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.640
 get a quick look at the map 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.220
 Here 's a better overview 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.820
 So downtown is clear and here it is 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.130
 the observatory that part and then 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.490
 here's about this little bridge where 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.170
 the crotch is coming because her son 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.729
 down a slope a sand path and here 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 Down the street is the monster 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.270
 stood then together with the so to speak about the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.610
 Road and landed on the way here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.610
 I would say over there 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.220
 what's important is you need everyone 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.530
 case a fast car as well as this one 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.120
 without it's difficult as possible 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.550
 to get what he wants is at the 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.229
 monster forward in the crotch not 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.750
 turn left but right away 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.610
 just down you can do it yourself 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.310
 so a little bit on that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.620
 measure water storage and because 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.950
 here just down the hill 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.950
 I hope I can do it 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.520
 Soccer 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:38.630
 just stay on the street if possible 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:41.600
 police nice and do not forget yours 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.860
 Check the vehicle in the air with 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.620
 the left stick is unrealistic 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.630
 I know well for motorcycles makes sense 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.340
 it would make sense but for cars 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.280
 unrealistic but with that you can as 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.420
 eureka check that they are not here 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.250
 turns over and explodes to 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:06.590
 example yes as I said on the possible 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:10.459
 stay here on the brown way extra 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.980
 slomo that is super good I can see 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.910
 I hope I pack it, I do not pack it far 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.910
 this fight 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.630
 yes 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:34.390
 not mine at all is complete 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.580
 49 still remain about people I would 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.800
 say, see you next time 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.690
 Monster was at the next video 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.030
 I think I will be so every day 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.440
 maybe a tricks video one 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.320
 to publish tips and tricks video 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.320
 about monster stars or other stuff 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.460
 I can experience the off the story story 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.460
 would say pure skin 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.040
 O
