00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
you play this game a bit or the first

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.980 
you play this game a bit or the first
thing<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.910> draws<00:05:09.090> my<00:05:09.360> attention<00:05:09.390> was

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
thing that draws my attention was

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.790 
thing that draws my attention was
there's<00:05:10.950> no<00:05:11.250> number<00:05:11.580> next<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.030> square<00:05:12.330> and

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
there's no number next to the square and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.220 
there's no number next to the square and
as<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:13.950> can<00:05:14.100> see<00:05:14.130> there's<00:05:14.460> no<00:05:14.580> number<00:05:14.910> there

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
as you can see there's no number there

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.500 
as you can see there's no number there
so<00:05:16.230> I<00:05:16.890> don't<00:05:17.520> really<00:05:17.670> think<00:05:17.790> that<00:05:18.000> matters<00:05:18.210> oh

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
so I don't really think that matters oh

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.060 
so I don't really think that matters oh
because<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:19.140> know<00:05:19.260> you've<00:05:19.440> got<00:05:19.470> two<00:05:19.830> hundred

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
because you know you've got two hundred

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.460 
because you know you've got two hundred
fifty<00:05:20.430> five<00:05:20.760> pieces<00:05:21.060> of<00:05:21.270> whatever<00:05:22.170> you've<00:05:22.440> got

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
fifty five pieces of whatever you've got

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.640 
fifty five pieces of whatever you've got
or<00:05:23.160> how<00:05:23.400> many<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:24.030> you've<00:05:24.150> got<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:27.650> I'm

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
or how many of it you've got and and I'm

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.200 
or how many of it you've got and and I'm
sure<00:05:28.890> whatever<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.400> doing<00:05:29.670> isn't<00:05:29.820> that<00:05:30.030> big

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
sure whatever you doing isn't that big

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.470 
sure whatever you doing isn't that big
that<00:05:30.390> you'll<00:05:30.570> run<00:05:30.780> out<00:05:30.930> but<00:05:32.000> all<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.180> need<00:05:33.360> to

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
that you'll run out but all you need to

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.270 
that you'll run out but all you need to
do<00:05:33.630> our<00:05:33.660> guess<00:05:34.110> is<00:05:34.140> just<00:05:34.620> keep<00:05:34.830> close<00:05:35.070> you'd

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
do our guess is just keep close you'd

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.430 
do our guess is just keep close you'd
like<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:36.120> save<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.510> Walden<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:37.050> just<00:05:37.260> keep

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
like to save the Walden and just keep

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.380 
like to save the Walden and just keep
putting<00:05:37.620> more<00:05:37.920> in<00:05:38.160> over<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:39.060> want<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.300> put

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
putting more in over you want to put

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.690 
putting more in over you want to put
like<00:05:39.540> a<00:05:39.570> whole<00:05:39.780> Road<00:05:40.080> 255<00:05:41.070> I<00:05:41.220> guess<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:41.520> could

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
like a whole Road 255 I guess you could

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.120 
like a whole Road 255 I guess you could
but<00:05:41.870> it<00:05:42.870> depends<00:05:43.170> how<00:05:43.230> big<00:05:43.470> your<00:05:43.620> project<00:05:43.980> is
