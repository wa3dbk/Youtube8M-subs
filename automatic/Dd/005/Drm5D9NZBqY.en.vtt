00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 one of the pigs wanted to exchange his safe vecai for it 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.590
 piece of wasteland in the city, even with a wonderful broker it wasn't 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.399
 to smoke 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.509
 while motels are enjoying the fresh grasses, the artists are 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.779
 displeased about the threshold to get the legs that you stepped with 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.109
 a car from another animal afterwards 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.499
 having taken some more time which went very carefully step by step 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.360
 but in the end they both hope for it 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.360
 the city gets it good 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.010
 there is not much to eat and you can see it 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.860
 they are enjoying themselves nothing and trendy just the initiative and it is one big 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.170
 party sven emotion indulge in all the goodies on a new it 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.890
 eventually a residential destination the pigs stay on it for a month 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.630
 wasteland between the new road and the eastern canal in the city 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.429
 the thought is that we are going 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.449
 we want people to realize where it comes from 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.450
 and in this way that will only be 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.290
 for these pigs that 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.340
 will be eaten in a month by the people they are now 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.890
 take care of the land 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.799
 so that's actually what we want to show 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.659
 In addition, the artists are not afraid that people are too focused on the 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:15.670
 norwegian 9 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.240
 and that he then rebel when there are new friends to the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.340
 get started I think it's going to happen but I'm here 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.910
 not afraid of that 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.250
 and that is correct 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.590
 meat does not have that much value and if you are 8 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.260
 He realizes that it is one 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
 are more intelligent than a hundred pigs 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.810
 yes if you get a ball with it then 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.570
 and you still want to eat then the meat becomes very valuable 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.729
 and then you don't think he wants me to and if you do 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 how often because all that is quite a bit 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.250
 yet the residents and shares must 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.110
 well I think the theater pig and others to know well of course all meat 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.370
 and make things like that more 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.050
 yes i do think so 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.070
 yes if you see it that way you take over later 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.270
 he is always suspected of having an offspring than a yearling torwood worker 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.129
 somewhat more difficult 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.409
 this time and trial 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.319
 yes indeed those years well the worries that baker is not recognizable as 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.010
 a 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.829
 if it happens often or or whatever 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.829
 so that the then again what yes word 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.969
 and that is exactly what the artists want to make clear with the project 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.529
 about a month before the voiceless was taken to the butcher in paterswolde after that 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.120
 There is a big pig tasting before the fair
