00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
it was all sort of symbolic and I looked

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.859 
it was all sort of symbolic and I looked
at<00:01:09.470> I<00:01:09.860> was<00:01:10.040> trying<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.580> find<00:01:11.150> out<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:11.479> best<00:01:11.659> way

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
at I was trying to find out the best way

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.789 
at I was trying to find out the best way
of<00:01:12.170> making<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.830> computer<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:14.799> started

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
of making a computer and I started

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.800 
of making a computer and I started
thinking<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.310> artists<00:01:16.729> had<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.600> best

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
thinking that artists had the best

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.779 
thinking that artists had the best
relationship<00:01:18.560> artists<00:01:18.859> musicians<00:01:19.130> had<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
relationship artists musicians had the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.410 
relationship artists musicians had the
best<00:01:19.969> relationships<00:01:20.659> with<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.960> tools<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:21.649> I

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
best relationships with the tools so I

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.990 
best relationships with the tools so I
started<00:01:24.039> thinking<00:01:25.039> about<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.460> arts<00:01:25.759> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
started thinking about the arts and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.469 
started thinking about the arts and
taught<00:01:26.179> a<00:01:26.210> class<00:01:26.390> for<00:01:26.719> artists<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:29.119> use<00:01:29.149> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
taught a class for artists to use the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.569 
taught a class for artists to use the
computer<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:32.350> then<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.469> just<00:01:33.679> started<00:01:34.340> getting

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
computer and then I just started getting

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.380 
computer and then I just started getting
more<00:01:34.729> interested<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.479> not<00:01:36.380> teaching<00:01:37.390> anything

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
more interested in not teaching anything

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.230 
more interested in not teaching anything
in<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.810> normal<00:01:39.140> sense<00:01:39.439> but<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.460> communicating

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
in the normal sense but in communicating

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.319 
in the normal sense but in communicating
the<00:01:41.689> essence<00:01:42.109> of<00:01:42.579> computers<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:43.819> trying<00:01:44.240> to

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
the essence of computers and trying to

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.819 
the essence of computers and trying to
make<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.049> would<00:01:45.170> experience<00:01:45.499> a

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
make it so that you would experience a

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.880 
make it so that you would experience a
computer<00:01:46.280> rather<00:01:46.579> than<00:01:46.909> learn<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.049> use<00:01:48.229> one<00:01:48.560> or

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
computer rather than learn to use one or

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.930 
computer rather than learn to use one or
learn<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.280> do<00:01:49.429> something<00:01:49.819> efficient<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:50.390> it

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
learn to do something efficient with it

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.680 
learn to do something efficient with it
and<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.100> is<00:01:53.100> essentially<00:01:53.730> the<00:01:53.790> role<00:01:53.970> of

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
and that that is essentially the role of

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.290 
and that that is essentially the role of
an<00:01:54.840> artist<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.650> express<00:01:56.040> something<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.120> was

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
an artist to express something and I was

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.720 
an artist to express something and I was
thinking<00:01:57.690> almost<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:58.290> expressing<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
thinking almost of expressing the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.500 
thinking almost of expressing the
computer<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.300> same<00:02:00.540> way<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:02.510> religious

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
computer the same way that the religious

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.040 
computer the same way that the religious
painters<00:02:03.900> would<00:02:04.140> express<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> scripture<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
painters would express the scripture I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.650 
painters would express the scripture I
technological<00:02:07.050> positive<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.710> love<00:02:08.010> the

technological positive I love the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.730 
technological positive I love the
possibilities<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> technology<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:10.410> didn't

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
possibilities of technology I didn't

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.090 
possibilities of technology I didn't
love<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> fact<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.820> what<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.470> in<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.860> first

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100

we invented a medium so it by accident

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.240 
we invented a medium so it by accident
occurred<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.140> they<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.890> day<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.100> was

we<00:03:12.050> just<00:03:13.050> discovered<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.800> there<00:03:14.459> was<00:03:14.520> this

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
we just discovered that there was this

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.240 
we just discovered that there was this
very<00:03:14.730> natural<00:03:15.510> desire<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.930> identify<00:03:16.560> with<00:03:17.130> the

very natural desire to identify with the
image<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.030> screen<00:03:18.150> their<00:03:18.900> image<00:03:19.290> was<00:03:20.130> them

image on the screen their image was them

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.840 
image on the screen their image was them
and<00:03:21.350> they<00:03:22.350> expected<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.190> things<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and they expected it to do things in the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.729

people if this is a live image is that

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.740 
people if this is a live image is that
we<00:05:28.130> are<00:05:28.190> now<00:05:28.340> interacting<00:05:28.790> in<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.240> way<00:05:29.390> that

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
we are now interacting in a way that

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.160 
we are now interacting in a way that
humans<00:05:30.260> have<00:05:30.470> never<00:05:30.650> never<00:05:31.520> could<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.300> now

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
humans have never never could and now

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.210 
humans have never never could and now
what<00:05:33.440> is<00:05:33.560> that<00:05:34.360> what<00:05:35.360> does<00:05:35.480> that<00:05:35.510> suggest

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
what is that what does that suggest

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.880 
what is that what does that suggest
simple<00:05:37.220> as<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.790> is<00:05:38.060> it<00:05:38.780> starts<00:05:39.230> to<00:05:39.440> suggest

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
simple as this is it starts to suggest

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.800 
simple as this is it starts to suggest
the<00:05:40.160> kinds<00:05:40.520> of<00:05:40.580> things<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:41.090> we'll<00:05:41.300> be<00:05:41.690> able

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
the kinds of things that we'll be able

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.659 
the kinds of things that we'll be able
to<00:05:42.050> do

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.850 

so<00:05:46.240> what<00:05:46.479> I've<00:05:46.599> done<00:05:46.780> is<00:05:46.840> or<00:05:47.229> peddle<00:05:47.830> my

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
so what I've done is or peddle my

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.770 
so what I've done is or peddle my
technical<00:05:48.400> skills<00:05:49.020> doing<00:05:50.250> computer<00:05:51.250> graphics

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
technical skills doing computer graphics

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.909 
technical skills doing computer graphics
for<00:05:54.270> companies<00:05:55.270> like<00:05:55.419> Pratt<00:05:56.259> &amp;<00:05:56.409> Whitney<00:05:56.650> this

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
for companies like Pratt &amp; Whitney this

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.469 
for companies like Pratt &amp; Whitney this
particular<00:05:57.460> effect<00:05:57.759> as<00:05:57.939> a<00:05:57.969> matter<00:05:58.180> of<00:05:58.240> fact

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
particular effect as a matter of fact

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.920 
particular effect as a matter of fact
I've<00:05:58.719> applied<00:05:58.990> to<00:05:59.139> the<00:05:59.590> flow<00:05:59.860> of<00:06:00.659> gas<00:06:01.659> through

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
I've applied to the flow of gas through

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.200 
I've applied to the flow of gas through
jet<00:06:02.169> engines<00:06:02.590> and<00:06:02.849> applied<00:06:03.849> to

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
jet engines and applied to

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.600 
jet engines and applied to
mathematically<00:06:05.020> model<00:06:05.050> data<00:06:05.560> so<00:06:05.979> you<00:06:06.039> can<00:06:06.219> see

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
mathematically model data so you can see

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.029 
mathematically model data so you can see
this<00:06:07.300> follow<00:06:07.659> and<00:06:08.050> know<00:06:08.229> that<00:06:08.439> all<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.800> paths

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
this follow and know that all the paths

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.580 
this follow and know that all the paths
being<00:06:09.430> taken<00:06:09.819> are<00:06:10.319> scientifically<00:06:11.319> correct

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
being taken are scientifically correct

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.320 
being taken are scientifically correct
so<00:06:12.099> you're<00:06:12.250> looking<00:06:12.520> at<00:06:12.669> it's<00:06:13.030> a<00:06:13.120> way<00:06:13.300> of

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
so you're looking at it's a way of

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.709 
so you're looking at it's a way of
visualizing<00:06:14.340> scientific<00:06:15.340> information<00:06:15.719> since

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
visualizing scientific information since

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.890 
visualizing scientific information since

84 Catherine Henrickson is over here

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.820 
84 Catherine Henrickson is over here
he's<00:06:20.020> been<00:06:20.169> working<00:06:20.560> with<00:06:20.740> me<00:06:20.919> and<00:06:21.270> has<00:06:22.270> done

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
he's been working with me and has done

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.629 
he's been working with me and has done
much<00:06:23.830> of<00:06:23.860> a<00:06:24.069> technical<00:06:24.520> work<00:06:24.699> and<00:06:25.139> she's<00:06:26.139> been

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
much of a technical work and she's been

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.159 
much of a technical work and she's been
responsible<00:06:27.639> for<00:06:27.909> a<00:06:28.120> lot<00:06:28.509> of<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:28.659> advances

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
responsible for a lot of the advances

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.399 
responsible for a lot of the advances
that<00:06:29.199> we<00:06:29.529> had<00:06:30.490> in<00:06:30.759> the<00:06:30.879> way<00:06:30.969> of<00:06:31.259> hardware<00:06:32.259> and

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
that we had in the way of hardware and

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.830 
that we had in the way of hardware and
software<00:06:32.469> especially<00:06:33.069> in<00:06:33.430> the<00:06:34.270> perception

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
software especially in the perception

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.100 
software especially in the perception
end<00:06:34.990> and<00:06:35.430> so<00:06:36.430> this<00:06:36.699> is<00:06:36.939> it's<00:06:37.569> always<00:06:37.779> been<00:06:38.080> a

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
end and so this is it's always been a

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.990 
end and so this is it's always been a
little<00:06:38.379> bit<00:06:38.680> like<00:06:38.860> making<00:06:39.159> a<00:06:39.340> movie<00:06:39.490> if<00:06:39.849> you

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
little bit like making a movie if you

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.309 
little bit like making a movie if you
think<00:06:40.240> about<00:06:40.479> what<00:06:40.689> the<00:06:40.840> ultimate<00:06:40.960> ambition

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
think about what the ultimate ambition

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.439 
think about what the ultimate ambition
here<00:06:41.979> is<00:06:42.189> is<00:06:42.520> something<00:06:42.789> that<00:06:42.969> is<00:06:43.680> would<00:06:44.680> have

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
here is is something that is would have

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.740 
here is is something that is would have
interactive<00:06:47.400> animation<00:06:48.400> not<00:06:48.849> animation<00:06:49.569> but

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
interactive animation not animation but

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.930 
interactive animation not animation but
interactive<00:06:50.349> animation<00:06:50.979> that<00:06:51.190> was<00:06:51.339> sensitive

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
interactive animation that was sensitive

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.600 
interactive animation that was sensitive
to<00:06:52.210> what<00:06:52.449> not<00:06:53.349> just<00:06:53.379> what<00:06:53.800> was<00:06:53.949> going<00:06:54.009> on<00:06:54.400> in

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
to what not just what was going on in

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.879 
to what not just what was going on in
the<00:06:54.699> environment<00:06:55.270> but<00:06:55.449> what<00:06:55.719> in<00:06:56.349> a<00:06:56.500> static

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
the environment but what in a static

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.860 
the environment but what in a static
sense<00:06:57.159> but<00:06:58.349> what<00:06:59.349> was<00:06:59.560> going<00:06:59.740> on<00:07:00.599> say<00:07:01.599> in<00:07:01.779> a

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
sense but what was going on say in a

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.230 
sense but what was going on say in a
person<00:07:02.289> responding<00:07:03.129> to<00:07:03.219> a<00:07:03.250> person<00:07:03.699> as<00:07:03.849> drain

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
person responding to a person as drain

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.050 
person responding to a person as drain
instant<00:07:04.990> by<00:07:05.139> instant<00:07:05.789> so<00:07:06.789> you're<00:07:06.940> really

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
instant by instant so you're really

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.159 
instant by instant so you're really
talking<00:07:07.300> almost<00:07:07.599> about<00:07:07.990> AI<00:07:08.139> and<00:07:09.690> in<00:07:10.690> fact<00:07:10.960> it

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:11.169 
talking almost about AI and in fact it
