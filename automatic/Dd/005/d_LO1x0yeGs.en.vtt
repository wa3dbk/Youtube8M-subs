00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.470
 this is marta 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.470
 marta's uncle gave him a bike 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.110
 Marta was very fond of bikes 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:12.829
 and if nobody did anything in the future 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.349
 a large cloud of smoke could cover the city and now all that smoke from the 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 cars 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.089
 I was heating the earth 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.890
 it could also happen that there were so many cars 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.939
 that did not fit in the streets 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.149
 her mother told her that when she was little the children played in the street 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.709
 they went alone to school or to play and run errands because there was no danger 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.550
 and that made him envious so he said he wanted to go to school by bike 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.150
 and his father told him it could not be because many cars were going 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.710
 and it was dangerous 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.490
 marta context that they were the ones who were driving and created the danger their 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.690
 father replied 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.690
 that after taking her to school she had to go to work 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.760
 and Marta suggested that he also go to work on a bike 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.260
 so heavy he got that they decided to try it for a week 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.420
 some marten's dad's mates 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.050
 they were surprised to see him arrive by bike 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.350
 but he told them that since he came by bike he would save money he would arrive earlier 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 and he felt much better 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.240
 seeing him so happy 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.150
 some comrades thought 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.060
 that maybe it will be right 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.780
 to the companions of marta 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.340
 They also liked to see her arrive by bike 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.030
 and many got as heavy as her and started going to school by bike 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.260
 or have giving those who lived closer 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.570
 the entrance to the school became more cured and cheerful 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.369
 after a week the daddy of marten 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.500
 I did not want to go back to the car 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 and they got a car to go to the market 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100
 as there were fewer cars 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.130
 at marta's dad's factory 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.720
 they painted a football field in the parking lot and played a game at the 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.160
 sandwich time 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.530
 soon in each factory there was a small field 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 and a championship was organized in the polygon 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.700
 one day the mayor 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.930
 visited the school 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.160
 and Martha explained that the children wanted to be able to play in the streets and go 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 from one place to another alone without anything happening to them 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:19.549
 the mayor promised that there would be streets where cars could not 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.549
 circular and that they could reach anywhere 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:28.999
 suddenly not only children but also grandparents and everyone 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.999
 he started going down those streets 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.849
 Many people also returned to catch their bikes 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.049
 and the city was again for the whole world 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.749
 not only for cars 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.369
 people continued to have clear car 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.369
 but they only used it when they really needed 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:54.129
 one day the mayor decided to give a prize to Marta for what she had done 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.059
 to improve the city 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.549
 and gave him a new bicycle 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.349
 Marta gave her old bike to her cousin TomÃ¡s 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.359
 who lived in another town 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.639
 he also told him what he had to do if he wanted everything to improve
