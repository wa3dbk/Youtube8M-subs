it's<00:02:02.189> not<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.579> for<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.000> only<00:02:03.090> going

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
it's not going to be for it's only going

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.480 
it's not going to be for it's only going
to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> three<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> them

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
to be three because one of them

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.620 
to be three because one of them
apparently<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> don't<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.450> die

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
apparently I don't know if they just die

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.109 
apparently I don't know if they just die
or<00:02:06.689> they<00:02:06.869> sacrifice<00:02:07.590> himself<00:02:07.849> but<00:02:08.849> I'm

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
or they sacrifice himself but I'm

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.880 
or they sacrifice himself but I'm
guessing<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.080> Louis<00:02:10.470> because

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
guessing it's going to be Louis because

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.500 
guessing it's going to be Louis because
the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.170 
the
like<00:02:11.599> I<00:02:11.780> always<00:02:11.810> has<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.379> die<00:02:12.560> or<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.909> could<00:02:14.150> be

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
like I always has to die or it could be

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.330 
like I always has to die or it could be
Billy<00:02:14.629> could<00:02:14.989> go<00:02:15.170> off<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.470> deep<00:02:15.650> end<00:02:15.829> I<00:02:16.069> mean

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
Billy could go off the deep end I mean

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.949 
Billy could go off the deep end I mean
considering<00:02:16.819> he<00:02:16.909> was<00:02:16.939> a<00:02:17.060> war<00:02:17.329> vet<00:02:17.599> just

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
considering he was a war vet just

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.960 
considering he was a war vet just
hearing<00:02:18.290> choppers<00:02:18.739> all<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:18.980> time<00:02:19.189> in<00:02:19.400> asleep
