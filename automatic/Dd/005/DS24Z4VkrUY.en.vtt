00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.749 
bit of a pain to get I had to team up
with<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.960> friend<00:01:46.290> skate<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.799> over<00:01:46.979> 40<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.610> went

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
with a friend skate for over 40 we went

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.190 
with a friend skate for over 40 we went
out<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> wilderness<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.509> we<00:01:48.840> took<00:01:49.049> down

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
out to the wilderness and we took down

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.679 
out to the wilderness and we took down
some<00:01:49.439> red<00:01:49.590> dragons<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.159> multi<00:01:50.430> combat<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.240> was

a<00:01:51.829> surprisingly<00:01:52.829> difficult<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.030> were

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
a surprisingly difficult I think we were

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.560 
a surprisingly difficult I think we were
both<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:55.189> blue<00:01:56.189> d'hide<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.450> like

50-something range and he was 60 and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.100 
50-something range and he was 60 and
still<00:01:59.579> took<00:01:59.759> quite<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> few<00:02:00.240> billables<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.930> kill

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
