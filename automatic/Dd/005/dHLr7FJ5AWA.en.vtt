00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
hi there it's Mike and I've managed to

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.959 
hi there it's Mike and I've managed to
set<00:00:08.629> up<00:00:08.750> the<00:00:09.020> multi-touch<00:00:09.950> box<00:00:10.340> with<00:00:10.730> the

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
set up the multi-touch box with the

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.180 
set up the multi-touch box with the
glass<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:13.869> camcorder<00:00:14.869> in<00:00:15.139> sight<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:15.650> I

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
glass and the camcorder in sight and I

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.269 
glass and the camcorder in sight and I
must<00:00:16.640> say<00:00:16.760> that<00:00:16.789> it's<00:00:17.090> pretty<00:00:17.600> amazing<00:00:18.019> it<00:00:18.740> can

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
must say that it's pretty amazing it can

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.859 
must say that it's pretty amazing it can
track<00:00:19.609> fingers<00:00:20.119> on<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.990> glass<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:22.480> do<00:00:23.480> more

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
track fingers on the glass and do more

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.409 
track fingers on the glass and do more
than<00:00:23.929> one<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.679> can<00:00:24.890> do<00:00:25.849> quite<00:00:26.089> a<00:00:26.119> few<00:00:26.300> the

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
than one you can do quite a few the

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.720 
than one you can do quite a few the
problem<00:00:26.689> I'm<00:00:26.810> having<00:00:26.990> is<00:00:27.259> that<00:00:27.429> it<00:00:28.429> can't

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
problem I'm having is that it can't

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.770 
problem I'm having is that it can't
track<00:00:28.999> it<00:00:29.179> beyond<00:00:29.720> a<00:00:29.839> certain<00:00:29.990> point<00:00:30.169> and<00:00:31.780> it's

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
track it beyond a certain point and it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.990 
track it beyond a certain point and it's
got<00:00:33.020> pretty<00:00:33.800> poor<00:00:34.640> frame<00:00:35.090> rates<00:00:36.850> with<00:00:37.850> the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
got pretty poor frame rates with the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.229 
got pretty poor frame rates with the
tracking<00:00:38.270> but<00:00:38.600> for<00:00:39.469> something<00:00:39.800> free<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.340> very

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
tracking but for something free and very

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.630 
tracking but for something free and very
quick<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.629> set<00:00:41.809> up<00:00:41.980> I'll<00:00:42.980> say<00:00:43.190> it's<00:00:43.370> pretty

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
quick to set up I'll say it's pretty

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.270 
quick to set up I'll say it's pretty
cool<00:00:43.879> I<00:00:47.350> must<00:00:48.350> admit<00:00:48.500> that<00:00:48.649> the<00:00:48.920> problem<00:00:49.250> that

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
cool I must admit that the problem that

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.090 
cool I must admit that the problem that
I'm<00:00:49.550> having<00:00:49.789> with<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.149> is<00:00:50.269> that<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:50.840> it<00:00:51.800> crushes

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
I'm having with it is that so it crushes

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.259 
I'm having with it is that so it crushes
quite<00:00:52.460> often<00:00:53.469> this<00:00:54.469> demo<00:00:54.739> here<00:00:55.039> is<00:00:55.250> as<00:00:55.879> fire

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
quite often this demo here is as fire

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.270 
quite often this demo here is as fire
and<00:00:56.859> it's<00:00:57.859> not<00:00:58.010> too<00:00:58.250> bad<00:00:58.460> but<00:00:59.800> again<00:01:00.800> I've<00:01:01.010> got

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
and it's not too bad but again I've got

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.829 
and it's not too bad but again I've got
the<00:01:01.370> problem<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.760> not<00:01:02.030> being<00:01:02.210> able<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.570> get

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
the problem of not being able to get

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:09.300 
the problem of not being able to get
beyond<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.289> certain<00:01:03.440> point<00:01:04.150> on<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.449> screen

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.560 

now<00:01:10.310> this<00:01:10.610> one<00:01:10.760> is<00:01:10.790> another<00:01:11.090> one<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.450> it's

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
now this one is another one and it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.609 
now this one is another one and it's
great<00:01:11.960> it's<00:01:12.229> it's<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:13.040> panic

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.069 

and<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> problem<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.930> don't<00:01:18.930> know

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
and the problem is that I don't know

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.719 
and the problem is that I don't know
where<00:01:19.290> I'm<00:01:19.439> hitting<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.760 

you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:23.880> move<00:01:24.000> around<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.600> stuff<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you can move around and stuff like I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.940 
you can move around and stuff like I
unintentionally<00:01:26.130> tender

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
unintentionally tender

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:36.749 
unintentionally tender
you<00:01:28.520> all<00:01:28.789> say<00:01:30.039> zoom<00:01:31.039> in<00:01:31.219> and<00:01:31.340> out<00:01:34.810> make<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.020> a

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
you all say zoom in and out make that a

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.770 
you all say zoom in and out make that a
bit<00:01:37.759> like<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.500> iPod<00:01:39.729> Touch<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:43.159> iPhone

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
bit like the iPod Touch and the iPhone

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.139 
bit like the iPod Touch and the iPhone
but<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.950> very<00:01:46.720> unstable<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:49.700> have<00:01:49.909> no

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
but it's very unstable and I have no

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.910 
but it's very unstable and I have no
idea<00:01:50.179> how<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.600> use<00:01:50.899> it

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.310 

this<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.310> fantastic<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.869> gives<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
this one is fantastic it gives you the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.849 
this one is fantastic it gives you the
ability<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.740> move<00:02:01.979> around<00:02:02.039> photos<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:06.859> still

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
ability to move around photos I still

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.790 
ability to move around photos I still
have<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> problem<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.789> being<00:02:08.970> able<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
have the problem of not being able to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.680 
have the problem of not being able to
touch<00:02:10.800> certain<00:02:11.190> parts<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.269> bottom<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
touch certain parts like the bottom that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.000 
touch certain parts like the bottom that
I<00:02:12.750> can't<00:02:13.280> get<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.519> bottom<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:14.910> but<00:02:16.010> it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
I can't get to the bottom but but it's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.430 
I can't get to the bottom but but it's
quite<00:02:17.280> clever<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:19.560> believe<00:02:20.299> yep<00:02:21.299> I<00:02:21.569> can<00:02:22.200> do

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
quite clever and I believe yep I can do

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.460 
quite clever and I believe yep I can do
the<00:02:22.620> zooming<00:02:22.920> thing<00:02:23.069> again<00:02:23.959> which<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.200> pretty

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
the zooming thing again which is pretty

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.020 
the zooming thing again which is pretty
good<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.310> another<00:02:26.700> way<00:02:26.910> of

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
good because it's another way of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.160 
good because it's another way of
interacting<00:02:27.830> with<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.930> load<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.079> rubbish

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
interacting with a load of rubbish

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.009 
interacting with a load of rubbish
really<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.940> suppose<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.390> theory<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.750> could

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
really and I suppose in theory I could

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.380 
really and I suppose in theory I could
just<00:02:34.260> change<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.769> photos<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:36.030> ones<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.360> I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
just change the photos to ones that I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.930 
just change the photos to ones that I
actually<00:02:36.630> want<00:02:37.489> which<00:02:38.489> would<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.730> quite

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
actually want which would be quite

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.780 
actually want which would be quite
clever<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.190> again<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.579> quite

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
clever this this one again is quite

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.569 
clever this this one again is quite
amazing<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.720> tracks<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.590> fingers<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.069> place

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
amazing it tracks the fingers and place

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.699 
amazing it tracks the fingers and place
palm<00:02:45.049> although<00:02:46.879> this<00:02:47.879> is<00:02:48.120> where<00:02:48.299> my<00:02:48.709> problem

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
palm although this is where my problem

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.770 
palm although this is where my problem
of<00:02:49.860> not<00:02:50.129> being<00:02:50.160> able<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.640> move<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.750> a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
of not being able to move it to a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.380 
of not being able to move it to a
certain<00:02:52.170> place<00:02:52.379> really<00:02:53.190> comes<00:02:53.400> into<00:02:53.579> play<00:02:53.819> and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
certain place really comes into play and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.140 
certain place really comes into play and
is<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> problem<00:02:55.140> because<00:02:55.519> it<00:02:56.519> means<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.849> keep<00:02:57.000> on

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
is a problem because it means I keep on

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.340 
is a problem because it means I keep on
losing<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:58.400> idea<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.579> to<00:03:00.090> get<00:03:00.390> into<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.139> blue

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
losing the idea is to get into the blue

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.720 
losing the idea is to get into the blue
zone<00:03:01.650> for<00:03:02.430> me<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.799> use<00:03:04.799> my<00:03:05.069> wall<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:07.530> D<00:03:07.739> defect

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
zone for me and use my wall to D defect

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.890 
zone for me and use my wall to D defect
it<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:10.079> not<00:03:10.489> not<00:03:11.489> too<00:03:11.700> easy<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.660> can

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
it and that's not not too easy you can

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.400 
it and that's not not too easy you can
use<00:03:13.170> three<00:03:13.590> points<00:03:14.010> or<00:03:14.940> suppose<00:03:15.480> ya<00:03:16.139> you<00:03:16.200> can

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
use three points or suppose ya you can

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.250 
use three points or suppose ya you can
use<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.739> as<00:03:16.859> well<00:03:17.010> which<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.760> very<00:03:18.120> clever

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
use for as well which is very clever

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.259 
use for as well which is very clever
that<00:03:20.890> means<00:03:21.330> almost<00:03:22.330> impossible<00:03:24.000> very<00:03:25.000> very

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
that means almost impossible very very

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.350 
that means almost impossible very very
difficult<00:03:28.349> so<00:03:29.349> open<00:03:30.220> mic<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.670> I've<00:03:31.060> shown<00:03:31.330> you

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
difficult so open mic and I've shown you

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.759 
difficult so open mic and I've shown you
the<00:03:31.750> multi-touch<00:03:32.620> box<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.250> how<00:03:34.440> how<00:03:35.440> pretty

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
the multi-touch box and how how pretty

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.130 
the multi-touch box and how how pretty
good<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:38.340> nothing<00:03:39.340> amazing<00:03:39.549> but<00:03:40.110> for<00:03:41.110> a

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
good it is nothing amazing but for a

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.589 
good it is nothing amazing but for a
couple<00:03:41.349> of<00:03:41.500> minutes<00:03:41.650> work<00:03:41.980> it's<00:03:42.819> pretty<00:03:43.269> fun

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
couple of minutes work it's pretty fun

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:50.699 
couple of minutes work it's pretty fun
and<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:46.030> could<00:03:46.209> go<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.390> long<00:03:46.660> way<00:03:49.590> as<00:03:50.590> long

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
and I think could go a long way as long

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.229 
and I think could go a long way as long
as<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.040> get<00:03:51.220> through<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.640> books<00:03:51.879> and<00:03:52.120> not

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
as you get through the books and not

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.610 
as you get through the books and not
being<00:03:52.480> able<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.690> touch<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.079> certain<00:03:53.349> parts

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
being able to touch the certain parts

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.989 
being able to touch the certain parts
that<00:03:54.400> is<00:03:54.989> why
