to<00:01:47.310> Facebook<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.939> quick<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
to Facebook really quick but when I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.240 
to Facebook really quick but when I
start<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> brand<00:01:49.290> new<00:01:49.409> social<00:01:49.740> network<00:01:50.040> it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980 
start a brand new social network it's
super<00:01:50.790> slow<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
super slow so you can see the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.999 
super slow so you can see the
implications<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.590> would<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
implications this would have on a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
implications this would have on a
smaller<00:01:53.549> startup<00:01:54.270> company<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
smaller startup company and for the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.780 
smaller startup company and for the
individual<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.649> home<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.250> creates<00:01:56.579> this

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
individual at home it just creates this

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.639 
individual at home it just creates this
bottleneck<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.659> oh<00:01:57.840> yeah<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.219
