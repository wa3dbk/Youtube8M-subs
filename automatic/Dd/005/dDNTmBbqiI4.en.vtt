00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello friends them alájar and if I give them the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 welcome to my lucrecia of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.620
 chapter 26 videogames and good as such 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.870
 if we start this edition with a little 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.870
 of law not cell specifically the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.440
 legend of zelda the wind waker 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.690
 specifically about the enemies 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.609
 called mutts that appear inside the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.320
 game what happens is that when you 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.900
 you hit the characters these are left 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 as somewhat varied and emit a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.570
 pretty strange sound that seems to be 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.570
 a rare middle voice 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.320
 Well, that sound is really a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 voice the voice of two people indeed yes 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 one takes the audio file does not give 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.570
 turn and then slow it down to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.520
 listen well what they say can be given 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.900
 realize that they are the voices of two 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.900
 Japanese men arguing 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.100
 some sources indicate that within the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.900
 discussion one of the men accuses the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.030
 another that he is going bald but 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.470
 I have no idea what the rest is and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.210
 that we are talking about games of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.850
 nintendo because we're not going to talk about 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 mario kart wii good as everyone should 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.600
 Know in Mario Kart Wii can be played 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 online make careers with other people 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.750
 around the whole world and for this 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.520
 same reason there is a name that is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.930
 restricted if they want to play games 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.910
 online to prevent the reason to the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.460
 they see it and that name is hitler 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.229
 that's how Mario Kart of Win can not be 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.470
 play online games if the name of your 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.030
 departure is hitler quite curious and already 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.590
 that we are talking about mario because no 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.610
 let's talk about his brother luigi in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.990
 luigi's mansion 2 dark moon for 3ds 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.970
 well, in the first part of the game 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.420
 it is possible to meet one of the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.479
 bus 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.070
 this bus is called computer obviously 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.350
 a reference to the word computer in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.119
 English but the funny thing is that when speaking 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.220
 with this guy does not say anything really 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.920
 in English or Spanish in some language 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.570
 but it tells you in a binary code 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 this binary code you take to a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 translator you will realize that what 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.330
 actually said in binary code is 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.740
 very very clever but it's not the only 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.869
 hidden message that can be found 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 within this game within the game 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.349
 there is a collection of five characters 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.910
 which are the teachers these are 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.739
 the phantom bosses that you should 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.540
 face you inside the game and each one 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.190
 has its specific name but what happens 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.239
 is that if they take the first letter of each 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.000
 one of the names of the professors 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.769
 can they form the word coast these 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.099
 teachers are graus and teacher is 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.860
 teacher or berset teacher being a professor 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.319
 and soft teacher of those left as 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.670
 tongue twister and the same thing happens if you take 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.230
 all the initials of the five 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.040
 mansions that can be used throughout the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.590
 game 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.080
 these are blooming manon hunter towers 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.330
 out loud 'works secret mind and grace 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.000
 jones mansion and now as a little 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.260
 trivia cuts the kinect device or more 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.970
 expensive of the world costs thousand 242 dollars and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.519
 is embedded with different stones 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.959
 beautiful of four different colors 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.400
 good since we're talking about the 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.459
 xbox because we're not going to see the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.440
 curiosities of halo 3 in two levels of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.110
 halo 3 called the storm 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.690
 gates you can find some posters 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.000
 of a lost person the photo and the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.090
 name indicate a person named Jason 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.190
 jones jason jones being the co-founder 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.900
 from the company James Bond who were 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.270
 those who developed the first three 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
 halo games but this is not even 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.170
 close the first time jason jones has 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.510
 made an appearance within any of 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.660
 the halo games take for example in 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.580
 the game halo 2 in halo 2 in one of the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.950
 missions called grave main is possible 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.650
 find an image of jason jones in 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.050
 a scene but you can see very little and 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.340
 is far away and is on screen 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.790
 very little time so it's pretty 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.490
 difficult to see him but if he's there and it's a 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.710
 somewhat disturbing picture as it is 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.440
 only in boxers with his hands 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.760
 behind the head and kneeling like this 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.550
 who does not understand why they would want 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.220
 keep it hidden but it just stopped 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.720
 put it in halo 3 so it's because it's 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.420
 exactly the same image can be 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.010
 find inside halo 3 except that 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.220
 this time you can find it up close and 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.490
 you can see it much better so if that 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.170
 it's a bit disturbing but that 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.300
 about halo we also have a small 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.970
 secret that can be found in 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.340
 halo 3 in the game at the level of 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.080
 covenant it is possible to enter a part 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.670
 somewhat hidden in which you can 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.650
 go up to a part of made of 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.750
 cement where there is a pillar and when doing 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.500
 this can be discovered a small 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.500
 hidden song 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.360
 Y 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.600

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.790
 madrigal or the siege of madrigal was 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.290
 composed by martín or donnell and is a 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.900
 of the songs that appear in the 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.060
 mid game which was one of the games 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.610
