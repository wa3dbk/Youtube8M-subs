00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
comes with a screen shield so this is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.940 
comes with a screen shield so this is
essentially<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> hybrid<00:00:45.629> style<00:00:45.809> case<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.829> it's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
essentially a hybrid style case but it's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.100
