00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.230
 While making the book we sometimes have those situations where photos 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.129
 overlap 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.660
 Here we have a whole make every solution for putting this on it 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.039
 perhaps just to create but also to of course 10 about doping on 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.399
 to lift I now have you in the picture as his situation 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.099
 some large pictures half past 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.519
 both partners stretched out a photo on top of that and also a photo that 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.200
 year 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.290
 and that photo you see below is that I do not want just like your photo well beside 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.140
 have over it 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 what can i solve by putting you at the top of the bar 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.969
 after selecting the relevant photo 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.230
 in the bar above to go to this one 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.570
 Knobper and the software is intelligence in the sense that the software sees which 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.320
 put a photo on camp 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.610
 and now have to see this as the layer photo I now have 2 layer photo the photo that 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.920
 responder and the large photo that is over it 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.830
 I once had two days of photo and not two layers of big cartoons to make me sick 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.890
 from place 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460
 and I do that with these two buttons 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.329
 the photos or punished photo book software is now sitting 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.560
 that this photo can only be moved upwards so 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.420
 and therefore also indicates this photo can be a lower forward and if I then on this 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 click button then you are that that photo immediately comes forward same can 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.130
 of course also with a photo after 8 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.580
 for example, I want this photo backwards then click back 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.330
 a layer after in the back and that sees then that photo is therefore after eight 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.880
 and this way it is very easy to blend photos with each other 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.630
 walk over each other 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.110
 and therefore that order 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.900
 exchange exactly as out 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.640
 like to have
