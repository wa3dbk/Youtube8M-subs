00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.820 
full prepared carrying capacity and that
is<00:02:44.590> its<00:02:45.040> producing<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.850> lot<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.620> now<00:02:47.620> because

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
is its producing a lot more now because

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.979 
is its producing a lot more now because
it's<00:02:48.220> producing<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.850> lot<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
it's producing a lot more you have to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.710 
it's producing a lot more you have to
put<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> little<00:02:50.350> bit<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.069> well<00:02:51.569> but<00:02:52.569> i'm

not talking about hard anthony i'm just
talking<00:02:55.330> about<00:02:55.380> compost<00:02:56.380> what<00:02:57.040> we're<00:02:57.190> going

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
talking about compost what we're going

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.330 
talking about compost what we're going
to<00:02:57.400> try<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:57.670> do<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.510> set<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.959> system<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.310> that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
to try to do is set up a system so that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.069 
to try to do is set up a system so that
when<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.730> bring<00:03:00.940> nutrients<00:03:01.480> into<00:03:01.810> your<00:03:01.930> life

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
when you bring nutrients into your life

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.670 
when you bring nutrients into your life
it<00:03:02.739> kept<00:03:03.100> them<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.489> your<00:03:04.030> system<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.380> put

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
it kept them in your system and you put

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.050 
it kept them in your system and you put
them<00:03:05.769> into<00:03:05.950> your<00:03:06.130> garden<00:03:06.280> through<00:03:06.850> your

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
them into your garden through your

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.780 
them into your garden through your
composting<00:03:07.660> system<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:09.160> then<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.400> eat<00:03:09.579> them

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
composting system and then you eat them

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.650 
composting system and then you eat them
your<00:03:10.390> EP<00:03:10.780> our<00:03:10.959> plans<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.620> then<00:03:12.519> anyways<00:03:13.329> goes

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
your EP our plans and then anyways goes

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.240 
your EP our plans and then anyways goes
back<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.049> your<00:03:14.140> comments<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.040> you're<00:03:15.160> getting

back to your comments so you're getting

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.930 
back to your comments so you're getting
a<00:03:15.430> nice<00:03:15.609> nutrient<00:03:16.239> flow<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.230> cycling

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
a nice nutrient flow and I cycling

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.030 
a nice nutrient flow and I cycling
now<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.209> traditional<00:03:20.870> garden<00:03:21.290> what<00:03:22.010> I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
now we're the traditional garden what I

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.490 
now we're the traditional garden what I
want<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.819> find<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:23.420> when<00:03:23.450> these<00:03:23.900> empty<00:03:24.290> nice

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
want to find is when these empty nice

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.190 
want to find is when these empty nice
faces<00:03:24.860> get<00:03:25.550> filled<00:03:25.879> with<00:03:26.060> weeds<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.780> first

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
faces get filled with weeds the first

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.320 
faces get filled with weeds the first
thing<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.650> traditional<00:03:28.220> gardener<00:03:28.670> does<00:03:28.849> is

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
thing the traditional gardener does is

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.410 
thing the traditional gardener does is
deep<00:03:29.690> those<00:03:29.930> weeds<00:03:30.230> over<00:03:30.970> now<00:03:31.970> there's<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.209> few

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
deep those weeds over now there's a few

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.059 
deep those weeds over now there's a few
problems<00:03:32.569> with<00:03:32.900> doing<00:03:33.140> that<00:03:33.410> what<00:03:33.860> they're

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
problems with doing that what they're

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.360 
problems with doing that what they're
doing<00:03:34.099> is<00:03:34.610> they're<00:03:34.900> taking<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.379> dry<00:03:36.680> crusty

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.640 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty
structureless<00:03:37.940> soil<00:03:38.420> that's<00:03:38.930> lying<00:03:39.379> on<00:03:39.560> the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
structureless soil that's lying on the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.350 
structureless soil that's lying on the
top<00:03:39.860> and<00:03:40.129> they're<00:03:40.549> turning<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.000> over<00:03:41.090> and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
top and they're turning it over and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.479 
top and they're turning it over and
putting<00:03:41.599> it<00:03:41.690> underneath<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:43.220> soil

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
putting it underneath and that soil

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.729 
putting it underneath and that soil
underneath<00:03:43.819> has<00:03:44.150> got<00:03:44.360> good<00:03:44.599> structure<00:03:45.080> but

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
underneath has got good structure but

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.289 
underneath has got good structure but
now<00:03:45.890> you're<00:03:46.040> put<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:46.459> top<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:46.970> it's<00:03:47.060> going

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
now you're put it on top and it's going

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.000 
now you're put it on top and it's going
to<00:03:47.360> dry<00:03:47.629> out<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.140> can<00:03:48.170> lose<00:03:48.650> its

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
to dry out and you can lose its

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.960 
to dry out and you can lose its
structure<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.810> problem<00:03:51.380> was<00:03:51.590> ways<00:03:51.920> but<00:03:52.700> now

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
structure the problem was ways but now

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.539 
structure the problem was ways but now
you've<00:03:53.360> created<00:03:53.599> a<00:03:53.930> new<00:03:54.140> problem<00:03:54.410> we<00:03:55.160> created

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
you've created a new problem we created

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.640 
you've created a new problem we created
the<00:03:55.670> problem<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:56.150> having<00:03:56.360> structureless<00:03:57.079> soil

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the problem of having structureless soil

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.009 
the problem of having structureless soil
now<00:03:58.340> structuralist<00:03:58.970> soil<00:03:59.329> has<00:03:59.569> its<00:03:59.840> own

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
now structuralist soil has its own

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.890 
now structuralist soil has its own
problems<00:04:00.560> firstly<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.579> can't<00:04:01.880> hold<00:04:02.120> water<00:04:02.269> as

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
problems firstly it can't hold water as

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.770 
problems firstly it can't hold water as
well<00:04:03.470> as<00:04:03.739> good<00:04:04.310> structured<00:04:04.910> soil<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:05.690> you're

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
well as good structured soil so you're

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.330 
well as good structured soil so you're
going<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.930> have<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.140> put<00:04:06.290> more<00:04:06.470> water<00:04:06.739> into

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
going to have to put more water into

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.940 
going to have to put more water into
your<00:04:07.610> garden<00:04:07.930> now<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.019> other<00:04:09.319> problem<00:04:09.920> that

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
your garden now the other problem that

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.030 
your garden now the other problem that
causes<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:11.329> can't<00:04:11.660> pass<00:04:11.959> on<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.440> nutrients

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
causes is it can't pass on the nutrients

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.650 
causes is it can't pass on the nutrients
to<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.190> plans<00:04:13.549> as<00:04:14.230> effectively<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:17.510> we

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
to the plans as effectively so we

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.810 
to the plans as effectively so we
started<00:04:18.109> out<00:04:18.289> with<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.470> weed<00:04:18.769> problem<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.579> now

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
started out with a weed problem and now

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.330 
started out with a weed problem and now
we've<00:04:20.000> got<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.359> problem<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.989> soil<00:04:21.859> that

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
we've got the problem of soil that

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.060 
we've got the problem of soil that
doesn't<00:04:22.700> hold<00:04:22.850> water<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.650> we've<00:04:24.650> also<00:04:24.830> got

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
doesn't hold water and we've also got

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.430 
doesn't hold water and we've also got
the<00:04:25.190> problem<00:04:25.430> of<00:04:25.729> soil<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.539> doesn't<00:04:26.900> pass<00:04:27.229> on

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
the problem of soil that doesn't pass on

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.190 
the problem of soil that doesn't pass on
its<00:04:27.590> nutrients<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:28.580> now<00:04:28.760> we<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.090> add

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
its nutrients so now we have to add

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.350 
its nutrients so now we have to add
inorganic<00:04:30.200> fertilizers<00:04:31.100> now<00:04:31.910> when<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.210> do

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
inorganic fertilizers now when you do

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.390 
inorganic fertilizers now when you do
that<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:33.020> start<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.380> kill<00:04:33.620> all<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.950> all<00:04:34.340> the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
that you start to kill all the all the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.760 
that you start to kill all the all the
biological<00:04:35.389> life<00:04:35.630> that's<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.200> soil<00:04:36.530> and

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
biological life that's in the soil and

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.890 
biological life that's in the soil and
that<00:04:37.419> biological<00:04:38.419> life<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:38.780> actually

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
that biological life is actually

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
important to actually build structure so

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.040 
important to actually build structure so
you'll<00:04:43.760> end<00:04:43.910> up<00:04:44.030> with<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.270> really<00:04:44.630> good

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
you'll end up with a really good

wealth method the most important thing

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.310 
wealth method the most important thing
to<00:04:52.169> remember<00:04:52.289> is<00:04:52.830> look<00:04:53.340> after<00:04:53.789> your<00:04:53.910> soil

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
to remember is look after your soil

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.840 
to remember is look after your soil
because<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.440> feels<00:04:55.590> oil<00:04:56.009> is<00:04:56.310> well<00:04:56.610> looked

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
because it feels oil is well looked

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.330 
because it feels oil is well looked
after<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.419> will<00:04:57.539> look<00:04:57.720> after<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.190> way

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
after it will look after you and the way

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.020 
after it will look after you and the way
we<00:04:59.490> look<00:04:59.610> after<00:04:59.820> is<00:05:00.270> we<00:05:00.780> don't<00:05:01.050> touch<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:02.030> we

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
we look after is we don't touch it we

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.469 
we look after is we don't touch it we
let<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.419> lie<00:05:03.630> underneath<00:05:04.820> we<00:05:05.820> don't<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.210> dig

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
let it lie underneath we don't you dig

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.200 
let it lie underneath we don't you dig
it<00:05:06.509> we<00:05:06.960> don't<00:05:07.110> turn<00:05:07.500> we<00:05:08.310> want<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.580> retain

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
it we don't turn we want it to retain

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.240 
it we don't turn we want it to retain
that<00:05:09.479> beautiful<00:05:10.020> structure<00:05:10.410> so<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:10.800> can<00:05:10.979> hold

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
that beautiful structure so it can hold

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.640 
that beautiful structure so it can hold
nutrients<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.300> pass<00:05:12.840> them<00:05:13.050> under<00:05:13.289> the<00:05:13.380> plans

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
nutrients and pass them under the plans

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.140 
nutrients and pass them under the plans
they<00:05:14.220> can<00:05:14.370> hold<00:05:14.610> water<00:05:15.830> so<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.039> number<00:05:18.030> one

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
they can hold water so the number one

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.159 
they can hold water so the number one
rule<00:05:18.449> with<00:05:18.870> this<00:05:19.080> method<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:19.770> no<00:05:20.190> digging<00:05:21.169> the

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
rule with this method is no digging the

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.710 
rule with this method is no digging the
only<00:05:22.620> way<00:05:22.830> we<00:05:23.070> work<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.490> soil<00:05:23.729> is<00:05:24.060> we<00:05:24.539> add

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
only way we work the soil is we add

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.439 
only way we work the soil is we add
layers<00:05:25.139> of<00:05:25.470> compost<00:05:26.099> on<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.970> top<00:05:27.180> as<00:05:27.389> a

layers of compost on the top as a

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.150 
layers of compost on the top as a

like to get my bare patches covered the

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.610 
like to get my bare patches covered the
same<00:05:35.370> day<00:05:35.639> if<00:05:35.849> possible<00:05:36.030> I<00:05:36.599> just<00:05:37.199> want<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.470> keep

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
mostly just mix everything up there's a

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.630 
mostly just mix everything up there's a
good<00:05:58.120> reason<00:05:58.390> for<00:05:58.600> doing<00:05:58.840> this<00:05:59.110> firstly<00:05:59.950> it

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
good reason for doing this firstly it

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.500 
good reason for doing this firstly it
gives<00:06:00.970> you<00:06:01.090> much<00:06:01.420> better<00:06:01.780> pest<00:06:02.530> protection

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
gives you much better pest protection

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.860 
gives you much better pest protection
now<00:06:04.680> pests<00:06:05.680> who<00:06:05.920> eat<00:06:06.100> your<00:06:06.490> crops<00:06:06.870> usually

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
now pests who eat your crops usually

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.850 
now pests who eat your crops usually
identify<00:06:08.530> them<00:06:08.830> by<00:06:09.040> sight<00:06:09.700> or<00:06:09.730> smell<00:06:10.650> now<00:06:11.650> when

identify them by sight or smell now when

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.650 
identify them by sight or smell now when
you've<00:06:11.980> got<00:06:12.130> everything<00:06:12.580> mixed<00:06:12.820> up<00:06:13.150> it<00:06:13.420> is

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
you've got everything mixed up it is

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.190 
you've got everything mixed up it is
very<00:06:14.050> hard<00:06:14.500> for<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:15.010> pests<00:06:15.400> to<00:06:16.030> actually<00:06:16.720> see

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
very hard for the pests to actually see

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.760 
very hard for the pests to actually see
the<00:06:18.010> specific<00:06:18.640> plan<00:06:19.000> that<00:06:19.270> they<00:06:19.420> like<00:06:19.690> it<00:06:20.470> just

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
the specific plan that they like it just

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.520 
the specific plan that they like it just
looks<00:06:20.980> like<00:06:21.070> a<00:06:21.160> jumbled<00:06:21.940> mess<00:06:21.940> and<00:06:22.660> it's

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
looks like a jumbled mess and it's

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.040 
looks like a jumbled mess and it's
impossible<00:06:24.160> for<00:06:24.220> them<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.430> smell<00:06:24.940> it<00:06:25.050> because

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
impossible for them to smell it because

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.840 
impossible for them to smell it because
there's<00:06:26.470> too<00:06:26.770> many<00:06:26.920> different<00:06:27.490> conflicting

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
there's too many different conflicting

there's too many different conflicting
smooth<00:06:29.610> but<00:06:30.610> I've<00:06:30.760> done<00:06:31.060> all<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.660> hard<00:06:31.840> work

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
smooth but I've done all the hard work
