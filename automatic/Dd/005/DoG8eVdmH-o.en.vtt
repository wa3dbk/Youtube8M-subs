00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.710
 invite you to meet 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.610
 video card Andy radeon r9 290 from 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.730
 powercolor 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.470
 a slightly overclocked version as you can 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.460
 after all on a logo dispersal to 9 185 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 megahertz nominal 9 150 to 25 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.019
 megahertz of all memory on the card 4 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 gigabyte 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.480
 gddr5 frequency 5 gigahertz 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.800
 at the heart of the video card or did the chip talk 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.200
 about slightly trimmed it is produced by 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.020
 28 nanometer process technology 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.629
 has six billion 200 million 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.910
 transistors and an area of 400 38 square 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.460
 millimeters 2560 stream processors 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.329
 160 texture units sixty four 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:03.390
 Rasterization unit power consumption up to 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 250 watts go to the video card as 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.720
 see she is used as reference 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.010
 reference 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 centrifugal turbine cooler 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.830
 there are pros and cons pros its 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 is that hot air 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.979
 blown out of the system unit 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:33.689
 through this grid, the truth is not so because 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:36.750
 in the housing there are also slots minus it in 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.869
 the fact that little effective for small 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.570
 rpm but very noisy at high 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.140
 Revs though i am very efficient 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:52.820
 therefore it is seriously raised 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:56.040
 for permanent work it is better to replace 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.520
 other cooling for example from arctic 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.079
 cooling extreme3 ​​and twin turbo 2 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.909
 any of this especially this 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.489
 important if you use a video card 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.759
 for mining but back on to 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.709
 video card 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:20.000
 on it 8 + 6 pins of the connector 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.329
 extra power and plug and 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.329
 output 29 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:28.159
 dima and displayport 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.560
 video card interface write express 30 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.069
 it is also reported that the video card 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.040
 supports 4k displays and 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.870
 I want to pay attention to the connector and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.079
 crossfire here they are not, unlike 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.169
 for example hd 6950 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:54.669
 The same reference point is that 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:57.590
 starting with r9 290 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:03:00.739
 crossfire is implemented without bridges 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.930
 through the interface write express express good 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.590
 bandwidth pisya express 30 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.849
 their 16 is all high enough not to 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.319
 reduce work efficiency in 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.030
 numerous brothers back side 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.319
 memory is devoid of memory chips that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.909
 really interesting since on 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.720
 video card and x 16 pieces for 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.010
 512 and bit bus respectively 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.180
 multilayer PCB used 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.349
 expensive to manufacture and complicated what 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.449
 certainly affects the price 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:41.620
 the video card itself also want a little bit 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:44.840
 talk about why powercolor 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.329
 Well, firstly these are references and they 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.479
 seemingly all the same all references 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.659
 sapphire companies are made 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:56.629
 but there is such an interesting point 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:00.560
 Western forum posts only 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:04.400
 some powercolor graphics cards and some 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.540
 xfx of is equipped with a chip from the older 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.859
 radeon r9 290x versions 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.009
 which works at high frequencies 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:17.719
 has a greater number of streaming 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:21.550
 processors and texture blocks for 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:23.810
 texture processing so here 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.389
 for this reason was chosen 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.960
 powercolor 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.810
 I want to hope that it will be equipped 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.880
 just that chip which will allow 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.050
 unlock video card in the older 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.680
 version of this we will talk next 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.770
 video 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.319
 in one of the following videos because 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.560
 the next video will be about parsing 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:51.199
 video cards as the replacement plans 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.190
 cooling systems for arctic cooling 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.349
 twin turbo 2 means the next video 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.440
 will be exactly parsing the video card after 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:03.370
 this installation video 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.280
 arctic cooling twin turbo 2 and 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.919
 final video about unlocking 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.270
 I'll try to make a guide 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:16.669
 detailing the whole process and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.210
 i hope i'm lucky worst she 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.500
 simply 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.900
 will work like r9 290 blocks not 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.889
 activated so there is nothing to lose 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:31.610
 the video card is equipped with double bellos as 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:34.880
 and all other references from 6950 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.349
 which you too could see here 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.870
 switch on the first position 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:44.479
 worth factory bios which is impossible 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.460
 flash locked and 2 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.800
 custom which can be changed by 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.060
 on your own 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:56.570
 actually exactly the way it is implemented 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.750
 flashing to version r9 290x 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.630
 thanks for watching subscribe to 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.930
 channel and see you in the next video up 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.930
 new meetings
