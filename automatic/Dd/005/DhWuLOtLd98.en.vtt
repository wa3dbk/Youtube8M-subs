00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hi I'm Pete and this is a brief update

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.059 
hi I'm Pete and this is a brief update
on<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.589> 2x2<00:00:05.400> megaminx<00:00:06.120> from<00:00:07.080> weight<00:00:07.589> eaten

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
on the 2x2 megaminx from weight eaten

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.040 
on the 2x2 megaminx from weight eaten
that<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.370> showed<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.849> my<00:00:08.880> unboxing<00:00:09.300> recently

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
that I showed in my unboxing recently

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.820 
that I showed in my unboxing recently
and<00:00:10.610> at<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> time<00:00:12.000> when<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.750> took<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.049> out<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.320> had

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
and at the time when I took it out I had

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.320 
and at the time when I took it out I had
quite<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> bit<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.370> difficulty<00:00:14.700> turning<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
quite a bit of difficulty turning of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.510 
quite a bit of difficulty turning of
phases<00:00:15.780> I've<00:00:16.650> been<00:00:17.480> working<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.680> just

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
phases I've been working on it and just

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.910 
phases I've been working on it and just
I<00:00:20.609> put<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.119> bit<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.359> loop<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.920> basically

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
I put a little bit of loop and basically

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.580 
I put a little bit of loop and basically
just<00:00:23.160> broke<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.750> seems<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.170> okay

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
just broke it in and it seems to be okay

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.300 
just broke it in and it seems to be okay
I<00:00:25.980> call<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.910> turning<00:00:27.240> possible<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.920> quite

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I call it turning possible it is quite

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.830 
I call it turning possible it is quite
catchy<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.109> far<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.890> seems<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.850> just

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
catchy but so far it seems to be just

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.270 
catchy but so far it seems to be just
just<00:00:34.170> okay<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.969> able<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> scramble<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
just okay I was able to scramble it and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.430 
just okay I was able to scramble it and
it<00:00:38.280> does<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> little<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.180> more<00:00:40.079> catchy

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it does get a little bit more catchy

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
it does get a little bit more catchy
when<00:00:40.829> you're<00:00:41.010> when<00:00:41.520> you're<00:00:41.550> doing<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.450> lot<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
when you're when you're doing a lot of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.350 
when you're when you're doing a lot of
scrambling<00:00:43.440> turns<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:44.360> alignment

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
scrambling turns because alignment

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600 
scrambling turns because alignment
becomes<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:46.020> issue<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:47.100> sort<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> see

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
becomes an issue so you can sort of see

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
becomes an issue so you can sort of see
them<00:00:47.700> having<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.660> trouble<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:49.110> moving

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
them having a little trouble now moving

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.600 
them having a little trouble now moving
that<00:00:50.100> face

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that face

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.590 
that face
but<00:00:51.140> overall<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.120> seems<00:00:54.390> like

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
but overall it's you know it seems like

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.830 
but overall it's you know it seems like
it's<00:00:55.050> worth<00:00:55.649> trying<00:00:55.949> anyway<00:00:56.640> -<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.420> solve<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's worth trying anyway - to solve the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.260 
it's worth trying anyway - to solve the
puzzle<00:00:58.199> now<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> process<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.030> scrambling

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
puzzle now in the process of scrambling

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.680 
puzzle now in the process of scrambling
and<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.719> got<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.320> how<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:03.090> works<00:01:03.390> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and I got to see just how it works it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
and I got to see just how it works it's
a<00:01:03.809> fascinating<00:01:04.260> puzzle<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.640> innocent

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
a fascinating puzzle and it's innocent

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.910 
a fascinating puzzle and it's innocent
in<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> way<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> shame<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.229> doesn't<00:01:07.350> work<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
in a way it's a shame it doesn't work a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520 
in a way it's a shame it doesn't work a
little<00:01:08.070> better<00:01:08.450> because<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> would

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
little better because I think it would

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
little better because I think it would
have<00:01:10.619> been<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.159> popular<00:01:11.460> puzzle<00:01:12.090> had<00:01:12.240> had

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have been a very popular puzzle had had

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.700 
have been a very popular puzzle had had
it<00:01:12.960> been<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.439> bit<00:01:13.619> more<00:01:14.900> easy<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.170> turn<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
it been just a bit more easy to turn and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.899 
it been just a bit more easy to turn and
a<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.100> more<00:01:17.280> stable

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
a bit more stable

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.660 
a bit more stable
my<00:01:18.780> main<00:01:19.080> complaint<00:01:19.740> though<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.549> isn't

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
my main complaint though really isn't

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
my main complaint though really isn't
the<00:01:20.909> turning<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.689> say<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> turning<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the turning as I say the turning is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.370 
the turning as I say the turning is
probably<00:01:22.979> possible<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:24.990> stickering

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
probably possible but there stickering

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.249 
probably possible but there stickering
on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.009> stickered<00:01:26.850> version<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.509> atrocious

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
on the stickered version is atrocious

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.399 
on the stickered version is atrocious
it's<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.579> quality<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> stickers<00:01:30.810> is

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's the quality of the stickers is

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
it's the quality of the stickers is
quite<00:01:31.799> quite<00:01:32.490> low<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.490> application<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
quite quite low and the application of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.240 
quite quite low and the application of
the<00:01:36.420> stickers<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.079> terrible<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:37.740> moved<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the stickers is terrible I've moved a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.240 
the stickers is terrible I've moved a
few<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> stickers<00:01:39.320> already<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.070> see

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
few of the stickers already but you see

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.719 
few of the stickers already but you see
they're<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.150> aligned<00:01:42.630> properly

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
they're just not aligned properly

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.100 
they're just not aligned properly
they're<00:01:44.729> off<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> side<00:01:45.570> some<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
they're off to the side some of the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.050 
they're off to the side some of the
stickers<00:01:46.320> were<00:01:46.470> getting<00:01:46.920> damaged<00:01:47.310> here's<00:01:47.850> one

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
stickers were getting damaged here's one

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.389 
stickers were getting damaged here's one
that's<00:01:48.210> off<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> side<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:50.189> don't

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that's off to the side and I don't

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.050 
that's off to the side and I don't
actually<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:52.310> move<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.640> Benny<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.939> don't

want<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> use<00:01:54.540> glue<00:01:54.930> when<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.229> move<00:01:55.530> them

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
want to use glue when I move them

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.149 
want to use glue when I move them
because<00:01:56.270> really<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.439> at<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.710> point<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.070> gonna

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
because really I at some point I'm gonna

have to reach sticker this which brings
up<00:02:02.070> another<00:02:02.189> point<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.869> we'd<00:02:04.320> even

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
up another point because the we'd even

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.560 
up another point because the we'd even
released<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> stickerless<00:02:05.640> version<00:02:06.240> first

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
released the stickerless version first

released the stickerless version first
and<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.740> puzzle<00:02:08.039> wasn't<00:02:08.399> well-received<00:02:08.610> by

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the time the sticker version came along

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.660 
the time the sticker version came along
I<00:02:11.160> don't<00:02:11.310> think<00:02:11.520> they<00:02:11.670> sold<00:02:11.879> very<00:02:12.120> many<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
I don't think they sold very many of the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.110 
I don't think they sold very many of the
I<00:02:13.140> don't<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.470> stickers<00:02:15.220> for<00:02:15.430> sale<00:02:15.640> anywhere

I don't see stickers for sale anywhere

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.410 
I don't see stickers for sale anywhere
so<00:02:17.020> I'm<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> little<00:02:17.590> bummed<00:02:17.709> about<00:02:17.950> that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
so I'm a little bummed about that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.940 
so I'm a little bummed about that
finally<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.550> stick<00:02:22.349> design<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.560> stickers

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
finally the stick design of the stickers

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.150 
finally the stick design of the stickers
isn't<00:02:24.280> very<00:02:24.459> good<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.770> points<00:02:26.770> are<00:02:26.920> way<00:02:27.099> too

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
isn't very good the points are way too

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.190 
isn't very good the points are way too
pointy<00:02:27.849> they<00:02:28.000> should<00:02:28.180> be<00:02:28.270> slightly<00:02:28.840> rounded

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
pointy they should be slightly rounded

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.809 
pointy they should be slightly rounded
not<00:02:29.350> super<00:02:29.770> rounded<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.250> slightly<00:02:30.520> rounded

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
not super rounded is slightly rounded

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.300 
not super rounded is slightly rounded
and<00:02:31.209> these<00:02:31.750> edge<00:02:32.020> pieces<00:02:32.380> don't<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.040> all<00:02:33.220> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
and these edge pieces don't go all the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.040 
and these edge pieces don't go all the
way<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.640> end<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.000> actually<00:02:34.540> looks<00:02:34.810> like

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
way to the end it actually looks like

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.740 
way to the end it actually looks like
someone<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:36.280> looks<00:02:36.730> like<00:02:36.970> they<00:02:37.150> were<00:02:37.209> really

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
someone it looks like they were really

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.630 
someone it looks like they were really
playing<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.410> someone<00:02:38.860> just<00:02:38.890> chopped<00:02:39.400> them

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
playing and someone just chopped them

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.759 
playing and someone just chopped them
and<00:02:40.480> now<00:02:40.690> they're<00:02:40.930> really<00:02:41.050> short<00:02:41.410> but<00:02:41.680> they

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
and now they're really short but they

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.550 
and now they're really short but they
should<00:02:41.980> be<00:02:42.099> rounded<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.810> know<00:02:43.930> all<00:02:44.200> around

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
should be rounded you know all around

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.970 
should be rounded you know all around
and<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.160> be<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.489> better<00:02:46.300> design<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:47.680> know<00:02:47.769> this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and and be a better design you know this

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.610 
and and be a better design you know this
is<00:02:48.130> something<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.850> when<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.660> puzzle<00:02:50.200> companies

they<00:02:57.549> can't<00:02:57.819> do<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> really<00:02:58.930> excellent<00:02:59.440> job<00:02:59.620> of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
they can't do a really excellent job of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.009 
they can't do a really excellent job of
lining<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:00.940> stickers<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.569> getting<00:03:01.810> them<00:03:01.930> all

lining the stickers and getting them all
in<00:03:02.140> there<00:03:02.319> then<00:03:02.950> ia<00:03:03.220> would<00:03:03.580> really<00:03:04.030> prefer

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
in there then ia would really prefer

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.180 
in there then ia would really prefer

I<00:03:25.150> looked<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.620> bag<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.980> puzzle<00:03:27.160> was

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
I looked the the bag of puzzle was

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.140 
I looked the the bag of puzzle was
wrapped<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.880> it's<00:03:28.359> not<00:03:28.600> in<00:03:28.810> my<00:03:29.340> work<00:03:30.340> area<00:03:30.549> here

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
wrapped in it's not in my work area here

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.770 
wrapped in it's not in my work area here
my<00:03:31.959> puzzle<00:03:32.230> tore<00:03:32.680> iam<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:34.060> really<00:03:34.630> don't

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
my puzzle tore iam so I really don't

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.199 
my puzzle tore iam so I really don't
know<00:03:35.019> where<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.440> sticker<00:03:35.799> went<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.489> suppose

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
know where that sticker went I suppose

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.750 
know where that sticker went I suppose
it's<00:03:37.359> possible<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:38.560> fell<00:03:38.890> on<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.070> floor<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
it's possible it fell on the floor but I

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.470 
it's possible it fell on the floor but I
suspect<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:41.049> just<00:03:41.200> was<00:03:41.380> never<00:03:41.530> on<00:03:41.829> there<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:43.239> I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
suspect it just was never on there so I

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.270 
suspect it just was never on there so I
don't<00:03:43.690> know<00:03:43.750> what<00:03:43.900> color<00:03:44.109> is<00:03:44.350> once<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.040> figure
