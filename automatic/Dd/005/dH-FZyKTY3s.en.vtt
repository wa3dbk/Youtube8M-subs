00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
half highway to test out which one gets

the<00:00:26.039> best<00:00:26.430> real-world<00:00:27.359> fuel<00:00:27.660> economy

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.880 

now<00:00:53.749> there<00:00:53.899> really<00:00:53.989> isn't<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.379> whole<00:00:54.559> lot<00:00:54.589> about

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
now there really isn't a whole lot about

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.009 
now there really isn't a whole lot about
either<00:00:55.159> of<00:00:55.370> these<00:00:55.579> cars<00:00:55.909> to<00:00:56.210> distinguish<00:00:56.839> the

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
either of these cars to distinguish the

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.590 
either of these cars to distinguish the
fact<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:57.379> they<00:00:57.679> use<00:00:57.980> diesel<00:00:58.280> engines<00:00:58.820> except

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
fact that they use diesel engines except

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.719 
fact that they use diesel engines except
for<00:00:59.749> the<00:00:59.839> noise<00:01:00.019> that<00:01:00.050> they<00:01:00.409> make<00:01:00.620> at<00:01:00.829> idle<00:01:01.429> and

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
for the noise that they make at idle and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.929 
for the noise that they make at idle and
the<00:01:02.000> badges<00:01:02.479> that<00:01:02.510> they<00:01:02.659> wear<00:01:02.929> on<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.469> outside

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
the badges that they wear on the outside

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.850 
the badges that they wear on the outside
now<00:01:04.939> General<00:01:05.509> Motors<00:01:05.689> wants<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.590> feel

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
now General Motors wants this to feel

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.910 
now General Motors wants this to feel
like<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.490> German<00:01:07.939> car<00:01:08.149> and<00:01:08.420> funny<00:01:09.020> enough<00:01:09.110> it

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
like a German car and funny enough it

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.920 
like a German car and funny enough it
sort<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.369> is<00:01:10.490> because<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:11.420> engine<00:01:11.720> that<00:01:11.810> it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
sort of is because the engine that it

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.450 
sort of is because the engine that it
uses<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.289> actually<00:01:12.619> borrowed<00:01:12.920> from<00:01:13.070> GM's

brand<00:04:53.010> new<00:04:53.190> Jetta<00:04:53.460> won't<00:04:53.759> feel<00:04:53.970> as<00:04:54.090> rough<00:04:54.330> as

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
brand new Jetta won't feel as rough as

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.640 
Cruze takes up a huge part of the trunk
and<00:04:59.639> that's<00:05:00.030> why<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.630> Jetta<00:05:00.900> has<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.139> far

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
and that's why the Jetta has a far

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.760 
and that's why the Jetta has a far
bigger<00:05:02.070> cargo<00:05:02.580> space<00:05:03.110> now<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.169> Cruze<00:05:04.470> has

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
bigger cargo space now the Cruze has

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.760 
bigger cargo space now the Cruze has
better<00:05:05.130> seats<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:06.449> Jetta<00:05:06.770> altogether

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
better seats and the Jetta altogether

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
is how the tires tend to squeal even in

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.600 
is how the tires tend to squeal even in
moderate<00:05:42.449> speed<00:05:42.840> turns<00:05:43.289> I<00:05:43.590> chalk<00:05:44.310> that<00:05:44.340> up<00:05:44.520> to

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
moderate speed turns I chalk that up to

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.980 
moderate speed turns I chalk that up to
the<00:05:44.760> fact<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:45.030> Chevy<00:05:45.360> also<00:05:45.630> uses

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
the fact that Chevy also uses

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.379 
the fact that Chevy also uses
low-rolling-resistance<00:05:46.620> tires<00:05:46.789> and<00:05:47.789> while

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
low-rolling-resistance tires and while

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.850 
low-rolling-resistance tires and while
that's<00:05:48.599> probably<00:05:49.110> saving<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.470> little<00:05:49.680> bit<00:05:49.770> of

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
that's probably saving a little bit of

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.770 
that's probably saving a little bit of
fuel<00:05:50.190> it's<00:05:50.699> also<00:05:50.940> slightly<00:05:51.330> disconcerting

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
fuel it's also slightly disconcerting

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.830 
fuel it's also slightly disconcerting
because<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:53.039> combined<00:05:53.520> with<00:05:53.729> what<00:05:54.030> boils

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
because that combined with what boils

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.730 
because that combined with what boils
down<00:05:54.900> to<00:05:55.050> sort<00:05:55.199> of<00:05:55.260> a<00:05:55.349> vague

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
down to sort of a vague

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.189 
down to sort of a vague
steering<00:05:56.130> feel<00:05:56.310> means<00:05:56.940> that<00:05:57.210> cornering<00:05:58.020> feels

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
steering feel means that cornering feels

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.290 
steering feel means that cornering feels
a<00:05:58.289> little<00:05:58.500> bit<00:05:58.620> imprecise<00:05:59.099> and<00:05:59.310> I'm<00:05:59.759> just<00:06:00.120> not

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
a little bit imprecise and I'm just not

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.180 
a little bit imprecise and I'm just not
in<00:06:00.449> love<00:06:00.660> with<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:01.169> feeling<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.740> have<00:06:01.889> going

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
in love with the feeling you have going

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.409 
in love with the feeling you have going
through<00:06:02.400> corners<00:06:02.970> because<00:06:03.120> you're<00:06:03.300> not

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
through corners because you're not

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.529 
through corners because you're not
really<00:06:03.690> sure<00:06:03.870> how<00:06:04.560> much<00:06:04.740> traction<00:06:05.069> you<00:06:05.310> have

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
really sure how much traction you have

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.430 
really sure how much traction you have
don't<00:06:06.539> get<00:06:06.660> me<00:06:06.750> wrong<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:07.020> don't<00:06:07.169> mean<00:06:07.259> to<00:06:07.349> get

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
don't get me wrong I don't mean to get

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.779 
don't get me wrong I don't mean to get
down<00:06:07.650> on<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.919> crews<00:06:08.099> completely<00:06:08.639> it

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
down on the crews completely it

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.640 
down on the crews completely it
certainly<00:06:09.150> has<00:06:09.360> advantages<00:06:09.870> of<00:06:10.020> its<00:06:10.169> own<00:06:10.349> for

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
certainly has advantages of its own for

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.379 
certainly has advantages of its own for
example<00:06:10.979> the<00:06:11.190> engine<00:06:11.460> has<00:06:11.639> more<00:06:11.669> torque<00:06:12.150> and

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
example the engine has more torque and

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.390 
example the engine has more torque and
in<00:06:12.720> all<00:06:13.319> cases<00:06:13.560> that's<00:06:14.009> going<00:06:14.190> to<00:06:14.250> make<00:06:14.370> it

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
in all cases that's going to make it

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.760 
in all cases that's going to make it
feel<00:06:14.639> more<00:06:14.970> powerful<00:06:15.330> also<00:06:15.900> the<00:06:16.319> brake<00:06:16.530> feel

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
feel more powerful also the brake feel

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.260 
feel more powerful also the brake feel
is<00:06:16.919> much<00:06:17.280> better<00:06:17.580> you<00:06:17.729> get<00:06:17.910> an<00:06:18.030> instant

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
is much better you get an instant

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.150 
is much better you get an instant
response<00:06:18.569> when<00:06:18.870> you<00:06:18.900> touch<00:06:19.139> the<00:06:19.319> pedal<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:19.770> as

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
response when you touch the pedal and as

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.219 
response when you touch the pedal and as
you<00:06:20.400> progressively<00:06:20.819> push<00:06:21.330> you<00:06:21.720> feel<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.110> car

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
you progressively push you feel the car

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.260 
you progressively push you feel the car
slowing<00:06:22.680> down<00:06:22.800> which<00:06:23.039> is<00:06:23.220> just<00:06:23.550> not<00:06:23.729> true<00:06:24.090> of

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
slowing down which is just not true of

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.860 
slowing down which is just not true of
the<00:06:24.389> Jettas<00:06:24.690> brakes<00:06:24.930> at<00:06:25.080> least<00:06:25.229> in<00:06:25.380> this<00:06:25.800> case
