00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899 

all<00:00:00.690> right<00:00:00.840> um<00:00:01.439> here<00:00:02.340> we're<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.790> be

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
all right um here we're going to be

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.960 
all right um here we're going to be
evaluating<00:00:03.600> each<00:00:04.170> expression<00:00:04.759> which<00:00:05.759> is

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
evaluating each expression which is

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.620 
evaluating each expression which is
originally<00:00:06.569> found<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.960> scientific<00:00:07.319> notation

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
originally found in scientific notation

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.560 
originally found in scientific notation
looking<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:10.920> problem<00:00:11.150> we<00:00:12.150> see<00:00:12.389> here

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
looking at the first problem we see here

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.330 
looking at the first problem we see here
we<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.840> seven<00:00:13.170> point<00:00:13.380> two<00:00:13.440> times<00:00:13.889> ten<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
we have seven point two times ten to the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.570 
we have seven point two times ten to the
minus<00:00:14.400> five<00:00:14.880> times<00:00:15.480> four<00:00:16.470> point<00:00:16.830> five<00:00:17.070> times

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
minus five times four point five times

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.510 
minus five times four point five times
ten<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.119> third<00:00:18.619> my<00:00:19.619> strategy<00:00:20.160> for

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
ten to the third my strategy for

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.790 
ten to the third my strategy for
simplifying<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:22.199> take<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> two

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
simplifying this is to take the two

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.080 
simplifying this is to take the two
numbers<00:00:24.710> seven<00:00:25.710> point<00:00:25.980> two<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.279> four<00:00:26.550> point

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
numbers seven point two and four point

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.029 
numbers seven point two and four point
five<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.630> multiply<00:00:28.140> those<00:00:28.410> two<00:00:28.800> together

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
five and multiply those two together

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.400 
five and multiply those two together
first<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:31.099> multiplying<00:00:32.099> seven<00:00:32.550> point<00:00:32.880> two

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
first so multiplying seven point two

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.430 
first so multiplying seven point two
times<00:00:34.410> four<00:00:35.280> point<00:00:35.640> five<00:00:36.170> four<00:00:37.170> point<00:00:37.309> five<00:00:38.309> I

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
times four point five four point five I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.920 
times four point five four point five I
get<00:00:40.440> 32<00:00:40.920> point<00:00:41.280> four<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.610> 32<00:00:44.930> point

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
get 32 point four so we have 32 point

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.010 
get 32 point four so we have 32 point
four<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.539> 10<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
four and now I'm going to take the 10 to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.860 
four and now I'm going to take the 10 to
the<00:00:49.110> minus<00:00:49.440> 5<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.820> 10<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.239> third<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the minus 5 and the 10 to the third and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.619 
the minus 5 and the 10 to the third and
multiply<00:00:52.379> those<00:00:52.620> together<00:00:52.969> when<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> bases

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
multiply those together when the bases

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.319 
multiply those together when the bases
are<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.079> same<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.829> multiply<00:00:56.460> each<00:00:56.640> other<00:00:56.850> we

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
are the same and multiply each other we

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.520 
are the same and multiply each other we
add<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.870> exponents<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.219> becomes<00:00:59.789> 10<00:01:00.530> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
add the exponents so this becomes 10 to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.250 
add the exponents so this becomes 10 to
the<00:01:01.620> -5<00:01:02.280> plus<00:01:03.090> 3<00:01:04.640> which<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.820> turn<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:07.020> get

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the -5 plus 3 which in turn now we get

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.800 
the -5 plus 3 which in turn now we get
32<00:01:07.680> point<00:01:08.220> four<00:01:08.990> times<00:01:10.159> 10<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.150> negative<00:01:12.360> 2

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
32 point four times 10 to the negative 2

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.789 
32 point four times 10 to the negative 2
and<00:01:13.520> scientific<00:01:14.520> notation<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.320> number

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
and scientific notation the number

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.880 
and scientific notation the number
that's<00:01:16.920> multiplying<00:01:17.610> 10<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.150> some<00:01:18.330> power

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
that's multiplying 10 to some power

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.999 
that's multiplying 10 to some power
which<00:01:19.890> we'll<00:01:20.100> call<00:01:20.340> X<00:01:20.900> this<00:01:21.900> number<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.920> be

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
which we'll call X this number has to be

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
which we'll call X this number has to be
less<00:01:23.280> than<00:01:23.310> 10<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> greater<00:01:24.930> than<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.350> equal

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
less than 10 and greater than or equal

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.999 
less than 10 and greater than or equal
to<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.710> does

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to one we can see here that this does

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.999 
to one we can see here that this does
not<00:01:29.189> meet<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> criterion<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.890> we're

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
not meet that criterion so what we're

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.730 
not meet that criterion so what we're
going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> we're<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> rewrite

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
going to do is we're going to rewrite

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.929 
going to do is we're going to rewrite
32.4<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:37.250> 3.24<00:01:38.689> times<00:01:39.689> 10<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> first<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
32.4 as 3.24 times 10 to the first if I

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.469 
32.4 as 3.24 times 10 to the first if I
were<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.570> 3<00:01:43.200> point<00:01:43.770> 2<00:01:44.070> 4<00:01:44.549> times<00:01:45.509> 10<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:47.000> get<00:01:48.000> 32

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
were to go 3 point 2 4 times 10 I get 32

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.190 
were to go 3 point 2 4 times 10 I get 32
point<00:01:48.810> four<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.990> actually<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
point four so this is actually just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
point four so this is actually just
taking<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.649> number<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.159> rewriting<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.939> so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
taking this number and rewriting it so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
taking this number and rewriting it so
that<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:55.170> number<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.310> number<00:01:56.700> between

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
that the number here is a number between

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.780 
that the number here is a number between
1<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.270> 10<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.740> we'll<00:01:58.979> bring<00:01:59.189> down<00:01:59.250> our

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
1 and 10 and now we'll bring down our

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.709 
1 and 10 and now we'll bring down our
times<00:02:00.180> 10<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.719> minus<00:02:01.079> 2<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.600> we

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
times 10 to the minus 2 and just like we

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.600 
times 10 to the minus 2 and just like we
did<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.380> we're<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> multiply

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
did up here we're going to multiply

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.600 
did up here we're going to multiply
these<00:02:06.060> 2<00:02:07.310> bases<00:02:08.599> together<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.129> by<00:02:11.129> doing<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
these 2 bases together and by doing that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.870 
these 2 bases together and by doing that
we're<00:02:11.940> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> add<00:02:12.390> there

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
we're going to add there

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.140 
we're going to add there
exponent<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:13.990> we<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.440> three<00:02:15.370> point<00:02:15.820> two

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
exponent so here we have three point two

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.230 
exponent so here we have three point two
four<00:02:16.800> times<00:02:17.800> ten<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.360> one<00:02:20.820> plus<00:02:21.820> negative

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
four times ten to the one plus negative

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.450 
four times ten to the one plus negative
two<00:02:23.100> which<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.340> three<00:02:24.370> point<00:02:25.240> two<00:02:25.690> four<00:02:26.460> times

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
two which is three point two four times

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.090 
two which is three point two four times
ten<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.230> minus<00:02:29.320> one

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
ten to the minus one

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.600 
ten to the minus one
that's<00:02:30.760> our<00:02:31.150> simplification<00:02:31.690> for<00:02:32.610> evaluation

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
that's our simplification for evaluation

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.870 
that's our simplification for evaluation
of<00:02:33.850> our<00:02:34.270> first<00:02:34.990> expression<00:02:35.550> all<00:02:36.550> right

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
of our first expression all right

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.720 
of our first expression all right
so<00:02:37.210> going<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.840> our<00:02:37.990> second<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:38.640> let<00:02:39.640> me<00:02:39.670> go

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
so going to our second one let me go

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.750 
so going to our second one let me go
ahead<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.980> draw<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> line<00:02:42.430> here<00:02:42.700> to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
ahead and draw a line here to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.980 
ahead and draw a line here to
distinguish<00:02:43.360> between<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.840> two<00:02:48.480> okay<00:02:49.480> so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
distinguish between the two okay so

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.930 
distinguish between the two okay so
going<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.380> our<00:02:50.470> second<00:02:50.950> one<00:02:53.520> here<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.550> have<00:02:54.730> one

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
going to our second one here I have one

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.630 
going to our second one here I have one
point<00:02:55.240> seven<00:02:55.630> times<00:02:55.810> ten<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.320> fifth

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
point seven times ten to the fifth

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
point seven times ten to the fifth
divided<00:02:57.640> by<00:02:57.910> three<00:02:58.240> point<00:02:58.540> four<00:02:58.750> times<00:02:59.050> ten<00:02:59.230> to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
divided by three point four times ten to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.650 
divided by three point four times ten to
the<00:02:59.590> ninth<00:02:59.850> well<00:03:00.850> I'm<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.240> look<00:03:01.420> at

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the ninth well I'm going to look at

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.310 
the ninth well I'm going to look at
basically<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:03.300> first<00:03:04.300> of<00:03:04.450> all<00:03:04.540> working<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.080> one

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
basically is first of all working on one

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.490 
basically is first of all working on one
point<00:03:05.590> seven<00:03:05.950> divided<00:03:06.190> by<00:03:06.340> three<00:03:06.640> point<00:03:06.910> four

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
point seven divided by three point four

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.060 
point seven divided by three point four
so<00:03:08.500> doing<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.070> have<00:03:09.340> one<00:03:09.610> point<00:03:10.270> seven

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
so doing that I have one point seven

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
so doing that I have one point seven
divided<00:03:12.070> by<00:03:12.220> three<00:03:13.030> point<00:03:13.540> 4<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:15.460> I<00:03:15.520> get<00:03:15.580> point

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
divided by three point 4 and I get point

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.940 
divided by three point 4 and I get point
five<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.470> zero<00:03:17.950> point<00:03:18.430> five<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.440> now<00:03:20.440> I'm

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
five so zero point five and now I'm

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.350 
five so zero point five and now I'm
gonna<00:03:21.160> look<00:03:21.460> at<00:03:21.730> dividing<00:03:22.770> these<00:03:23.770> two<00:03:24.360> bases

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
gonna look at dividing these two bases

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.840 
gonna look at dividing these two bases
of<00:03:25.510> ten<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.170> when<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.160> bases<00:03:27.550> are<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.700> same

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
of ten and when the bases are the same

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.440 
of ten and when the bases are the same
and<00:03:28.120> dividing<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:29.440> subtract<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.640> lower<00:03:31.120> at

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
and dividing we subtract the lower at

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.210 
and dividing we subtract the lower at
the<00:03:31.660> exponent<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.440> denominator<00:03:32.470> from<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the exponent of the denominator from the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.890 
the exponent of the denominator from the
exponent<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.880> numerator<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.870> this

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
exponent of the numerator so this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.200 
exponent of the numerator so this
becomes<00:03:35.470> 10<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:36.490> the<00:03:36.610> 5<00:03:36.820> minus<00:03:37.270> 9<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.910> I<00:03:39.940> have

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
becomes 10 to the 5 minus 9 so I have

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.610 
becomes 10 to the 5 minus 9 so I have
0.5<00:03:41.610> times<00:03:42.610> 10<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.250> negative<00:03:45.459> 4

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
0.5 times 10 to the negative 4

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.250 
0.5 times 10 to the negative 4
now<00:03:48.930> just<00:03:49.930> as<00:03:50.110> before<00:03:51.270> you<00:03:52.270> noticed<00:03:52.600> here<00:03:52.930> when

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
now just as before you noticed here when

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.850 
now just as before you noticed here when
I<00:03:53.290> moved<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:55.660> decimal<00:03:55.870> one<00:03:56.260> place<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.830> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
I moved the decimal one place to the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.740 
I moved the decimal one place to the
left

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
left

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.320 
left
this<00:03:58.750> created<00:03:59.140> 10<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.740> the<00:03:59.830> 1<00:04:00.010> here<00:04:00.790> I'm<00:04:01.000> going

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
this created 10 to the 1 here I'm going

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.730 
this created 10 to the 1 here I'm going
to<00:04:01.420> move<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.720> decimal<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.320> right<00:04:02.410> one

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
to move the decimal to the right one

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.180 
to move the decimal to the right one
place<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.360> becomes<00:04:04.870> 5<00:04:05.350> times<00:04:07.950> 10<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.160> the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
place so this becomes 5 times 10 to the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.490 
place so this becomes 5 times 10 to the
minus<00:04:09.580> 1<00:04:10.140> times<00:04:11.140> 10<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.860> minus<00:04:12.280> 4<00:04:12.930> okay<00:04:13.930> so

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
minus 1 times 10 to the minus 4 okay so

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.430 
minus 1 times 10 to the minus 4 okay so
on<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.650> prove<00:04:14.920> my<00:04:15.070> point<00:04:15.310> if<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:15.910> were<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.150> go<00:04:16.440> 5

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
on to prove my point if I were to go 5

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.560 
on to prove my point if I were to go 5
times<00:04:18.180> 10<00:04:19.919> with<00:04:20.919> an<00:04:21.070> exponent<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.790> negative<00:04:21.850> 1

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
times 10 with an exponent of negative 1

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.879 
times 10 with an exponent of negative 1
I<00:04:23.550> get<00:04:24.550> 0.5<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:26.080> this<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.470> simple

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
I get 0.5 so this is simple

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.989 
I get 0.5 so this is simple
rewriting<00:04:27.749> 0.5<00:04:28.749> so<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.650> meets<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.159> definition

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:30.999 
rewriting 0.5 so it meets the definition

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.089 
rewriting 0.5 so it meets the definition
of<00:04:31.599> scientific<00:04:32.139> notation<00:04:32.259> where<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:32.889> number

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
of scientific notation where this number

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.730 
of scientific notation where this number
has<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.580> be<00:04:33.639> a<00:04:33.699> number<00:04:33.879> between<00:04:34.259> that's<00:04:35.259> less

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
has to be a number between that's less

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.320 
has to be a number between that's less
than<00:04:35.919> 10<00:04:36.159> and<00:04:36.189> greater<00:04:36.580> than<00:04:36.669> or<00:04:36.819> equal<00:04:36.939> to<00:04:37.180> 1

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
than 10 and greater than or equal to 1

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.629 
than 10 and greater than or equal to 1
and<00:04:37.539> now<00:04:38.379> I'm<00:04:38.529> going<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.860> go<00:04:39.039> ahead<00:04:39.159> and

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
and now I'm going to go ahead and

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.580 
and now I'm going to go ahead and
multiply<00:04:40.090> these<00:04:40.870> two<00:04:41.610> powers<00:04:43.050> with<00:04:44.050> bases<00:04:44.439> of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
multiply these two powers with bases of

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.519 
multiply these two powers with bases of
10<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.400> add<00:04:45.669> these<00:04:45.969> exponents<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:47.020> my<00:04:47.139> final

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:47.529 
10 so I add these exponents and my final

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.659 
10 so I add these exponents and my final
answer<00:04:47.680> here<00:04:48.039> is<00:04:48.189> going<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.370> be<00:04:48.460> 5<00:04:48.699> times<00:04:49.710> 10<00:04:50.710> to

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
answer here is going to be 5 times 10 to

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.589 
answer here is going to be 5 times 10 to
the<00:04:51.699> negative<00:04:51.909> 1<00:04:52.650> plus<00:04:53.650> negative<00:04:53.770> 4<00:04:54.569> which<00:04:55.569> is

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
the negative 1 plus negative 4 which is

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.510 
the negative 1 plus negative 4 which is
5<00:04:56.110> times<00:04:56.879> 10<00:04:57.879> to<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.210> minus<00:04:58.629> 5<00:04:59.189> so<00:05:00.189> that's<00:05:00.279> my

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
5 times 10 to the minus 5 so that's my

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.740 
5 times 10 to the minus 5 so that's my
answer<00:05:00.729> for<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.449> second<00:05:02.409> expression

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
answer for the second expression

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.719 
answer for the second expression
evaluating<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:04.930> should<00:05:05.139> say<00:05:05.379> okay<00:05:06.159> let's

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
evaluating and I should say okay let's

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.450 
evaluating and I should say okay let's
do<00:05:06.909> another<00:05:06.939> line<00:05:07.449> of<00:05:07.719> separation<00:05:07.990> here<00:05:11.460> all

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
do another line of separation here all

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.809 
do another line of separation here all
right

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
right

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.950 
right
and<00:05:12.990> now<00:05:13.990> going<00:05:14.319> to<00:05:14.409> the<00:05:14.529> third<00:05:15.689> here<00:05:16.689> I<00:05:16.719> have

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
and now going to the third here I have

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.300 
and now going to the third here I have
7.8<00:05:17.949> times<00:05:18.550> 10<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:18.939> the<00:05:18.969> eighth<00:05:19.210> times<00:05:20.310> 2.8

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
7.8 times 10 to the eighth times 2.8

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.610 
7.8 times 10 to the eighth times 2.8
times<00:05:21.520> 10<00:05:21.819> to<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.000> 11th<00:05:22.389> so<00:05:23.289> we're<00:05:23.469> going<00:05:23.560> to

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
times 10 to the 11th so we're going to

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.469 
times 10 to the 11th so we're going to
do<00:05:23.800> just<00:05:24.250> as<00:05:24.370> we<00:05:24.520> did<00:05:24.669> in<00:05:24.729> the<00:05:25.029> first

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
do just as we did in the first

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.980 
do just as we did in the first
expression<00:05:26.460> we're<00:05:27.460> going<00:05:27.699> to<00:05:27.930> multiply<00:05:28.930> these

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
expression we're going to multiply these

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:38.269 
expression we're going to multiply these
two<00:05:29.379> together<00:05:29.879> so<00:05:30.879> I<00:05:30.909> have<00:05:31.060> 7.8<00:05:33.089> times<00:05:34.830> 2.8<00:05:35.830> and

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.240 

I<00:05:39.279> get<00:05:39.460> 21<00:05:39.789> point<00:05:40.240> eight<00:05:40.449> for<00:05:41.219> twenty<00:05:42.219> one

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
I get 21 point eight for twenty one

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.839 
I get 21 point eight for twenty one
point<00:05:43.029> eight<00:05:43.330> four<00:05:43.899> and<00:05:44.339> now<00:05:45.339> I'm<00:05:45.460> going<00:05:45.699> to

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
point eight four and now I'm going to

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.480 
point eight four and now I'm going to
multiply<00:05:46.289> 10<00:05:47.289> to<00:05:47.409> the<00:05:47.529> eighth<00:05:47.649> times<00:05:48.069> 10<00:05:48.370> to

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
multiply 10 to the eighth times 10 to

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.860 
multiply 10 to the eighth times 10 to
the<00:05:48.550> eleventh<00:05:50.159> and<00:05:51.240> again<00:05:52.240> when<00:05:52.419> the<00:05:52.509> bases

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
the eleventh and again when the bases

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.779 
the eleventh and again when the bases
are<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.169> same<00:05:53.199> and<00:05:53.589> multiplying<00:05:54.099> we<00:05:54.339> add<00:05:54.520> the

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
are the same and multiplying we add the

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.209 
are the same and multiplying we add the
exponents<00:05:54.939> so<00:05:55.599> 8<00:05:56.379> plus<00:05:56.800> 11<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:59.050> this<00:05:59.319> is<00:05:59.500> 21

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
exponents so 8 plus 11 so this is 21

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:08.969 
exponents so 8 plus 11 so this is 21
point<00:06:00.729> 8<00:06:01.120> 4<00:06:02.789> times<00:06:04.469> 10<00:06:05.469> to<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.860> 19th<00:06:07.620> I'm<00:06:08.620> going

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
point 8 4 times 10 to the 19th I'm going

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.809 
point 8 4 times 10 to the 19th I'm going
to<00:06:09.069> take<00:06:09.310> this<00:06:09.759> 21<00:06:10.750> point<00:06:11.050> 8<00:06:11.169> 4<00:06:11.439> and<00:06:11.800> write<00:06:12.550> this

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
to take this 21 point 8 4 and write this

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.290 
to take this 21 point 8 4 and write this
in<00:06:13.000> scientific<00:06:13.210> notation<00:06:14.169> so<00:06:14.199> this<00:06:14.620> is<00:06:15.719> 2.18<00:06:16.949> 4

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
in scientific notation so this is 2.18 4

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.059 
in scientific notation so this is 2.18 4
times<00:06:19.300> 10<00:06:19.870> to<00:06:20.139> the<00:06:20.199> first<00:06:21.509> ok<00:06:22.509> and<00:06:22.779> then<00:06:23.589> I<00:06:23.620> add

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
times 10 to the first ok and then I add

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.769 
times 10 to the first ok and then I add
on<00:06:24.339> the<00:06:24.639> 10<00:06:25.060> to<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.240> 19th<00:06:27.060> so<00:06:28.060> now<00:06:28.210> my<00:06:28.419> numbers

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:28.779 
on the 10 to the 19th so now my numbers

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.809 
on the 10 to the 19th so now my numbers
between<00:06:29.050> my<00:06:29.469> first<00:06:29.680> number<00:06:30.039> is<00:06:30.129> between<00:06:30.460> 1<00:06:30.669> and

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
between my first number is between 1 and

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.360 
between my first number is between 1 and
10<00:06:31.000> and<00:06:31.240> now<00:06:32.020> I'm<00:06:32.259> going<00:06:32.560> to<00:06:32.620> go<00:06:32.830> ahead<00:06:32.919> and

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
10 and now I'm going to go ahead and

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.909 
10 and now I'm going to go ahead and
multiply<00:06:33.879> 10<00:06:34.659> to<00:06:34.779> the<00:06:34.870> first<00:06:35.110> times<00:06:35.440> 10<00:06:35.709> to<00:06:35.860> the

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
multiply 10 to the first times 10 to the

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.500 
multiply 10 to the first times 10 to the
19<00:06:36.959> so<00:06:37.959> I<00:06:37.990> have<00:06:39.029> 2.18

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
19 so I have 2.18

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:47.310 
19 so I have 2.18
or<00:06:41.010> times<00:06:42.570> 10<00:06:43.570> to<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.410> 1<00:06:44.500> plus<00:06:44.980> 19<00:06:46.050> to<00:06:47.050> arrive

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
or times 10 to the 1 plus 19 to arrive

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:54.900 
or times 10 to the 1 plus 19 to arrive
at<00:06:47.610> 2.1<00:06:48.610> 84<00:06:49.620> times<00:06:50.620> 10<00:06:51.420> to<00:06:52.420> the<00:06:52.540> 20th
