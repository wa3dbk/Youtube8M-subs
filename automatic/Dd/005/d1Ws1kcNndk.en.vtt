00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.649 

this<00:01:17.220> would<00:01:17.400> eliminate<00:01:17.580> all<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.360> right

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this would eliminate all of this right

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.490 
this would eliminate all of this right
here<00:01:18.689> except<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> quarter

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
here except for right here the quarter

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.990 
here except for right here the quarter
would<00:01:25.650> come<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:25.979> wrap<00:01:26.549> into<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.060> seam<00:01:27.390> here

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
would come up wrap into the seam here

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:39.560 
would come up wrap into the seam here
this<00:01:30.000> little<00:01:30.270> piece

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.270 

and<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.659> feel<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.020> next<00:01:41.259> one<00:01:41.409> down<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.799> move

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
and you feel the next one down you move

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:56.760 
and you feel the next one down you move
that<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.729> then<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:56.259> I'm<00:01:56.350> doing<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.649> getting

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
that and then what I'm doing is getting

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.230 
that and then what I'm doing is getting
behind<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.340> I'm<00:01:57.399> lifting<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:57.880> towards

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
behind it and I'm lifting it towards

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.410 
behind it and I'm lifting it towards
look<00:01:58.390> at<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.569> windshield<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.590> that<00:01:59.799> hooks<00:02:00.130> in

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
look at the windshield and that hooks in

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.270 
look at the windshield and that hooks in
the<00:02:01.420> edge<00:02:01.569> there<00:02:01.929> and<00:02:02.229> it's<00:02:02.770> like<00:02:02.829> that<00:02:03.100> all

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
the edge there and it's like that all

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.729
