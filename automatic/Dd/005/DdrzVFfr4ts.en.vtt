00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
recommended weapons the first one we

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.609 
recommended weapons the first one we
have<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.220> 5<00:01:14.640> g<00:01:14.939> 5<00:01:15.270> v<00:01:15.540> 3<00:01:15.930> which<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.229> good

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
have here is the 5 g 5 v 3 which is good

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.820 
have here is the 5 g 5 v 3 which is good
for<00:01:16.979> short<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.030> medium<00:01:18.150> range<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> while<00:01:19.650> my

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
for short and medium range and while my

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
for short and medium range and while my
other<00:01:19.860> recommendation<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.479> m16a3

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
other recommendation here is the m16a3

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
other recommendation here is the m16a3
which<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.340> good<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.820> pretty<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.570> both

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
which is good for pretty much for both

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
which is good for pretty much for both
the<00:01:25.140> short<00:01:25.439> mid<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.220> course<00:01:26.430> long<00:01:26.700> range

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the short mid and of course long range

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030 
the short mid and of course long range
and<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.600> course<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> take<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> look<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and of course if you take a look at the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
and of course if you take a look at the
statics<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.060> pretty<00:01:30.240> much<00:01:30.390> towards<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
statics which is pretty much towards the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
statics which is pretty much towards the
middle<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> screen<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.250> will<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
middle of the screen you will see that

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
middle of the screen you will see that
comparing<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.140> between<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.430> slight

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
comparing this one between just a slight

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
comparing this one between just a slight
upgrade<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> has<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
upgrade you will see that this has a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
upgrade you will see that this has a
much<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.220> improved<00:01:38.640> accuracy<00:01:39.030> control<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
much more improved accuracy control and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.440 
much more improved accuracy control and
damage<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.430> comparing<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.119> something

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
damage but comparing it with something

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.660 
damage but comparing it with something
like<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.770> only<00:01:44.009> downside<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> this

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
like this one the only downside of this

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.039 
like this one the only downside of this
one<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.420> doesn't<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.750> much

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
one is that this one doesn't have much

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
one is that this one doesn't have much
control<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> definitely<00:01:47.159> benefits<00:01:47.820> with

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
control but it definitely benefits with

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
control but it definitely benefits with
a<00:01:48.030> range<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.810> you're<00:01:48.990> able<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.470> control

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
a range so if you're able to get control

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350 
a range so if you're able to get control
of<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.009> weapon<00:01:50.250> by<00:01:50.729> using<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
of this weapon by using some of the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030 
of this weapon by using some of the
attachments<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.320> you're<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:52.710> much<00:01:52.799> good

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
attachments then you're pretty much good

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.289 
attachments then you're pretty much good
to<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.780> now<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> second<00:01:55.710> thing<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
to go now the second thing is

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.700 
to go now the second thing is
attachments<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.450> your<00:01:57.570> weapons<00:01:57.960> now<00:01:58.170> for

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
attachments for your weapons now for

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
attachments for your weapons now for
attachments<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.909> about<00:02:00.240> your

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
attachments it's really all about your

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.940 
attachments it's really all about your
personal<00:02:00.990> preference<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.560> can't<00:02:01.799> really

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
personal preference I can't really

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.580 
personal preference I can't really
recommend<00:02:02.340> specific<00:02:03.329> ones<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> ones<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
recommend specific ones but the ones I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.780 
recommend specific ones but the ones I
could<00:02:04.649> easily<00:02:04.920> recommend<00:02:05.369> which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
could easily recommend which is a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910

no-brainer<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.630> having<00:02:07.110> some<00:02:07.290> type<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.649> grip

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
no-brainer is having some type of grip

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.770 
no-brainer is having some type of grip
and<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.520> grips<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.879> could<00:02:09.030> choose<00:02:09.209> from<00:02:09.390> is

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
to have something with a slight increase

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.369 
to have something with a slight increase
for<00:02:11.760> your<00:02:11.879> accuracy<00:02:12.239> or<00:02:12.569> control<00:02:12.989> depending

on

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.620 
on
and<00:02:13.920> you're<00:02:14.010> using<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.940> for<00:02:15.150> example<00:02:15.540> if

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and you're using so for example if

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.290 
and you're using so for example if
you're<00:02:15.780> using<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.260> secondary<00:02:16.740> recomm

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
you're using the secondary recomm

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.190 
you're using the secondary recomm
recommendation<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.450> terms<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.840> weapon

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
recommendation in terms of the weapon

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800 
recommendation in terms of the weapon
and<00:02:19.350> by<00:02:20.010> adding<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.520> angle<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.060> grip<00:02:21.270> this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
and by adding the angle to grip this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.900 
and by adding the angle to grip this
will<00:02:22.170> pretty<00:02:22.380> much<00:02:22.470> max<00:02:22.950> out<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> control<00:02:23.700> for

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
will pretty much max out the control for

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.160 
will pretty much max out the control for
the<00:02:23.940> weapon<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.510> you're<00:02:24.660> pretty<00:02:24.780> much<00:02:24.900> good<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the weapon so you're pretty much good to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.590 
the weapon so you're pretty much good to
go<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.340> said<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.850> muzzles<00:02:27.180> it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
go and like I said for the muzzles it's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.450 
go and like I said for the muzzles it's
really<00:02:27.930> personal<00:02:28.200> preference<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.950> me<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.130> like

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
really personal preference for me I like

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.640 
really personal preference for me I like
to<00:02:29.610> use<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> suppressor<00:02:30.750> even<00:02:31.110> though<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.410> does

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
to use a suppressor even though it does

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.280 
to use a suppressor even though it does
reduce<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.100> range<00:02:32.580> but<00:02:33.540> usually<00:02:33.960> depending

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
reduce the range but usually depending

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.750 
reduce the range but usually depending
on<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> circumstances<00:02:35.190> sometimes<00:02:35.580> I'll

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
on the circumstances sometimes I'll

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.250 
on the circumstances sometimes I'll
switch<00:02:35.970> between<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.450> heavy<00:02:36.690> barrel<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
switch between a heavy barrel and

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.560 
switch between a heavy barrel and
suppressor<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.490> that's<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:38.820> my<00:02:39.120> personal

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
suppressor but that's just my personal

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.540 
suppressor but that's just my personal
preference<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.740> course<00:02:41.010> other

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
pistol then you definitely want to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.740 
pistol then you definitely want to
upgrade<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.570> p226<00:02:56.270> however<00:02:57.270> if<00:02:57.600> you're

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
upgrade to the p226 however if you're

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.090 
upgrade to the p226 however if you're
going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:58.050> going<00:02:58.380> for<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> close<00:02:58.800> quarter

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
going to be going for a close quarter

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.610

combat or playing something like Hotwire

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.920 
combat or playing something like Hotwire
and<00:03:01.890> then<00:03:02.430> my<00:03:02.610> recommendation<00:03:02.760> here<00:03:03.540> would<00:03:03.690> be

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
and then my recommendation here would be

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.750 
and then my recommendation here would be
the<00:03:04.170> tracking<00:03:04.500> dart<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:05.160> they'll<00:03:05.340> help

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the tracking dart because they'll help

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.820 
the tracking dart because they'll help
out<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.210> locking<00:03:06.690> with<00:03:06.870> rocket<00:03:07.470> launchers

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
out with locking with rocket launchers

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.030 
out with locking with rocket launchers
and<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.580> other<00:03:08.730> one<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:10.320> common

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and the other one this is a common

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.680 
and the other one this is a common
weapon<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.520> people<00:03:11.820> tend<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> use<00:03:12.210> but<00:03:12.540> not

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
weapon that people tend to use but not

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.480 
weapon that people tend to use but not
too<00:03:12.930> often<00:03:13.170> due<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.770> fact<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.310> has<00:03:14.460> a

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
too often due to the fact that it has a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.790 
too often due to the fact that it has a
pretty<00:03:14.910> bad<00:03:15.150> arranged<00:03:15.570> but<00:03:16.170> at<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.320> same<00:03:16.530> time

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
pretty bad arranged but at the same time

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.410 
pretty bad arranged but at the same time
it<00:03:16.920> does<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.100> lot<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.370> damage<00:03:17.700> really<00:03:18.150> get

accuracy<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.170> control<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.520> pretty

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
accuracy and control and that is pretty

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.460 
accuracy and control and that is pretty
much<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.150> Taser<00:03:21.480> were<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.930> able<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.230> take

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
the side of all these increases you do

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.179 
the side of all these increases you do
have<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.389> decrease<00:05:21.990> within<00:05:22.199> range<00:05:22.529> but<00:05:23.099> if

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
have a decrease within range but if

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.769 
have a decrease within range but if
you're<00:05:23.310> more<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.550> a<00:05:23.789> mid-range<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.569> close

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
you're more of a mid-range to close

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.809 
you're more of a mid-range to close
quarter<00:05:25.110> combat<00:05:25.139> type<00:05:25.620> of<00:05:25.800> user<00:05:26.009> then<00:05:26.580> this<00:05:26.699> is

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
increase in damage accuracy range but at

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.929 
increase in damage accuracy range but at

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
you look if you like a suppressor use

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.860 
you look if you like a suppressor use
the<00:05:50.250> suppressor<00:05:50.789> if<00:05:50.939> you<00:05:51.060> like<00:05:51.210> heavy<00:05:51.419> barrows

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
the suppressor if you like heavy barrows

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.570 
the suppressor if you like heavy barrows
use<00:05:52.229> that<00:05:52.669> next<00:05:53.669> up<00:05:53.849> is<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.300> secondary<00:05:54.870> weapon

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
use that next up is the secondary weapon

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.029 
use that next up is the secondary weapon
I'm<00:05:56.580> here<00:05:57.149> it's<00:05:57.689> um<00:05:58.050> there's<00:05:58.529> not<00:05:58.680> really<00:05:58.889> a

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
I'm here it's um there's not really a

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.339 
I'm here it's um there's not really a
major<00:05:59.520> increase<00:06:00.000> here<00:06:00.509> to<00:06:00.689> be<00:06:00.779> honest<00:06:01.110> because

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
major increase here to be honest because

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.879 
major increase here to be honest because
the<00:06:01.919> cz-75<00:06:02.849> it<00:06:03.479> basically<00:06:04.199> reduces<00:06:04.800> the

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
the cz-75 it basically reduces the

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.290 
the cz-75 it basically reduces the
control<00:06:05.339> but<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:05.639> have<00:06:05.789> a<00:06:05.819> slight<00:06:06.149> increase

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
control but you have a slight increase

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.050 
control but you have a slight increase
in<00:06:06.539> accuracy<00:06:07.050> so<00:06:07.740> for<00:06:07.979> this<00:06:08.129> one<00:06:08.399> I<00:06:08.430> recommend

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
in accuracy so for this one I recommend

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.939 
in accuracy so for this one I recommend
sticking<00:06:09.270> with<00:06:09.599> the<00:06:09.719> default<00:06:10.020> pistol<00:06:10.500> however

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
sticking with the default pistol however

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.040 
sticking with the default pistol however
if<00:06:11.339> you<00:06:11.490> want<00:06:11.669> to<00:06:11.729> switch<00:06:11.909> it<00:06:12.029> up<00:06:12.120> a<00:06:12.270> bit<00:06:12.300> again

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
if you want to switch it up a bit again

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.899 
if you want to switch it up a bit again
you<00:06:13.289> also<00:06:13.500> have<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:13.889> Taser<00:06:14.129> and<00:06:14.310> tracking

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
you also have the Taser and tracking

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.610 
you also have the Taser and tracking
Dart<00:06:15.060> depending<00:06:15.449> on<00:06:15.539> you<00:06:15.659> situation<00:06:16.169> and

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
Dart depending on you situation and

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.249 
Dart depending on you situation and
again<00:06:17.399> this<00:06:17.789> is<00:06:17.969> also<00:06:18.149> the<00:06:18.449> team's<00:06:18.659> medic<00:06:19.050> so

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
again this is also the team's medic so

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.779 
again this is also the team's medic so
you're<00:06:19.500> gonna<00:06:19.589> get<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.889> first-aid<00:06:20.219> kit<00:06:20.370> which

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
you're gonna get the first-aid kit which

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.550 
you're gonna get the first-aid kit which
is<00:06:20.939> definitely<00:06:21.330> recommended<00:06:21.449> to<00:06:21.930> keep<00:06:22.139> and

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
is definitely recommended to keep and

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.809 
is definitely recommended to keep and
the<00:06:22.770> second<00:06:23.069> one<00:06:23.189> you<00:06:23.310> want<00:06:23.550> you<00:06:23.610> don't<00:06:23.729> have

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
the second one you want you don't have

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.029 
the second one you want you don't have
the<00:06:23.969> defib<00:06:24.240> utt<00:06:24.750> you<00:06:24.839> do<00:06:24.960> have<00:06:25.199> this<00:06:25.379> ver<00:06:25.800> bias

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
the defib utt you do have this ver bias

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.189 
the defib utt you do have this ver bias
range<00:06:26.490> but<00:06:27.000> it<00:06:27.089> works<00:06:27.270> just<00:06:27.539> the<00:06:27.659> same<00:06:27.930> way<00:06:28.139> so

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
range but it works just the same way so

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.409 
range but it works just the same way so
obviously<00:06:28.949> these<00:06:29.129> are<00:06:29.430> definitely<00:06:30.120> to<00:06:30.330> you

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
obviously these are definitely to you
