00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
overly tempted to because these things

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.880 
overly tempted to because these things
were<00:02:08.009> tight<00:02:08.390> okay<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.440> results

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
were tight okay so this is the results

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.330 
were tight okay so this is the results
with<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.450> two<00:02:12.450> strand<00:02:12.810> twists<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.220> can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
with the two strand twists and you can

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.310 
with the two strand twists and you can
see<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> ones<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.910> back<00:02:15.150> aren't<00:02:15.450> as<00:02:15.750> curly

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
see the ones in the back aren't as curly

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.190 
see the ones in the back aren't as curly
and<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.220> ones<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> front<00:02:17.910> but<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.990> far

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and the ones in the front but so far

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.740 
and the ones in the front but so far
these<00:02:19.440> also<00:02:19.680> pretty<00:02:20.070> good<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.610> am<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.540> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
these also pretty good I am going to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.350 
these also pretty good I am going to
take<00:02:21.930> them<00:02:22.140> completely<00:02:22.650> down<00:02:23.040> I'm<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.270> to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
take them completely down I'm going to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.449 
take them completely down I'm going to
take<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.110> two<00:02:25.590> strand<00:02:25.860> twists<00:02:26.160> as<00:02:26.250> well

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
take out the two strand twists as well

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.770 
take out the two strand twists as well
just<00:02:26.670> want<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> see<00:02:27.209> how<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.480> look<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
just want you to see how it look the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.770 
just want you to see how it look the
Midway<00:02:28.110> before<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> took<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.180> twist<00:02:30.480> so

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
Midway before I took out of the twist so

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.600 
Midway before I took out of the twist so
this<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.520> what<00:02:32.520> I'm<00:02:32.700> working<00:02:32.940> with<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.600> far<00:02:33.930> and

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
this is what I'm working with so far and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.750 
this is what I'm working with so far and
I've<00:02:35.610> been<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> little<00:02:36.030> medusa-like

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
I've been a little medusa-like

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.010 
I've been a little medusa-like
but<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:39.180> after<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.510> take<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> twist<00:02:40.260> down

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
but I think after I take the twist down

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.210 
but I think after I take the twist down
hopefully<00:02:43.020> I'll<00:02:43.110> have<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.470> look<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.800> want

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
hopefully I'll have the look I want

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.930 
hopefully I'll have the look I want
I<00:02:44.340> will<00:02:44.580> be<00:02:44.730> back<00:02:45.000> with<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.450> final<00:02:46.940> results

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
I will be back with the final results

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.680 
I will be back with the final results
final<00:02:48.360> results<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.930> took<00:02:49.200> out<00:02:49.380> all<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.760> two

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
final results I took out all the two

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.199 
final results I took out all the two
strand<00:02:52.080> twists<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.799> these<00:02:53.519> are<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.790> results

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
strand twists and these are the results

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.970 
strand twists and these are the results
I'm<00:02:54.330> left<00:02:54.600> with<00:02:54.810> unfortunately<00:02:55.500> some<00:02:55.799> were

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
I'm left with unfortunately some were

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.310 
I'm left with unfortunately some were
still<00:02:56.310> wet<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.390> will<00:02:57.570> see<00:02:57.810> something<00:02:58.290> a

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
still wet so you will see something a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.710 
still wet so you will see something a
bit<00:02:58.560> loose<00:02:58.830> but<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.489> think<00:03:00.330> they<00:03:01.580> be<00:03:02.580> final<00:03:03.030> he's

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
bit loose but I think they be final he's

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.090 
bit loose but I think they be final he's
also<00:03:03.870> pretty<00:03:04.200> interesting<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:06.920> don't<00:03:07.920> know

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
also pretty interesting I don't know

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.430 
also pretty interesting I don't know
