00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.879
 even in the face of this municipal drama 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.509
 I feel like I'm not being so fast. 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.509

 I do not know what 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.969
 So I think this is a better mandate. 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:53.969
 the statement 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.879
 during all day long 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.879

 I know how he tells us that if he gets disconnected from the world and I have a song 

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:31.849
 pretty depressing 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:34.849
 somehow this is not enough 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.919
