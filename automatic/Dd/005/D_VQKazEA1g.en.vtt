00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 how 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.870
 sun and could not miss in this mobile 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.549
 world congress 2015 and although many 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.740
 We expected to see the experience 4 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.660
 finally it could not be like that 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.789
 we are satisfied this time with your experience 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.670
 4 tablet that has a design and 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.770
 polished together with a resolution 2 k and 10 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.390
 diagonal inches are and leaves by 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.000
 end the resolution full hd the tir 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.220
 inches betting on the 2k along with 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.810
 an ultra-thin design apart this 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.210
 last one that does not come to revolutionize the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.620
 teams of the Japanese a reduction 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.429
 significant weight being created 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.710
 only at 392 grams 396 for the 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.749
 4g model greater use of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.550
 screen and a polished finish on your 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:48.219
 edges is what stands out the most 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.479
 to the design of the zeta 4 materials 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.670
 are the ones that characterize 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.710
 sony using crystal combinations 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.179
 and metal chassis which it transmits that 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.339
 premium finish that we like so much 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.319
 although its back has been 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.239
 made of plastic which favors the 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.670
 weight but subtracts whole at the time of 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.080
 keep that design so refined these 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.210
 manufacturing materials have 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.920
 contributed to that we can wet it and be 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.610
 Dust resistant counting 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.830
 ip68 certification 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.840
 we are surprised by the fact that connectors 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.700
 like the headphones and usb are at 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.560
 discovered and do not have tapas 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.650
 protective as is the case of the slot 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.150
 micro usb 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.220
 the hardware is always a section 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.890
 important and as expected in his 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.200
 interior sports a mushroom dragon 810 with 3 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.000
 gigas of ram combination very common in 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.590
 the flagship teams 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.150
 there is no doubt that this 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.520
 combination was totally necessary 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.530
 walk the resolution of your screen this 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.360
 last is of lcd type with ips technology 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.970
 but we know if you have 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.530
 gorilla glass protection this powerful 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.050
 hardware is in charge of working with 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.850
 android 5.0 lollipop that as it comes 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.610
 being habitual in the rudders account 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.660
 with a layer of customization xperia 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.490
 few aesthetic changes are those 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.810
 we appreciate all of them in order to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.640
 keep the identity sign of the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.590
 POSCO brand side bar 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.110
 notification yes that is characterized 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 for having material design the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.590
 battery is 6000 milliamps a 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.330
 identical amount to that of the two zeta 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.120
 tablets but like samsung says 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.980
 with your s 6's battery and it promises 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.720
 greater consumption optimization for 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.820
 lengthen autonomy despite the greater 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.170
 screen consumption the tablets do not 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.090
 their outstanding feature is their 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 cameras and is that the manufacturers put 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.340
 all your efforts on smartphones 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.590
 tablets the z4 incorporates two cameras one 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.780
 rear of 8 megapixels and the front of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.780
 5 with autofocus image stabilization 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.459
 and manual focus 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.590
 highlights the presence during his 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.970
 presentation of a bluetooth keyboard that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.220
 once connected to experience 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.840
 tablet will modify the rom showing a 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.000
 launch bar with shortcuts 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.590
 this keyboard incorporates a battery 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.150
 additional and once we have it 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.980
 handled has seemed a bit 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.470
 flimsy since it has been completely 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.930
 made of plastic this keyboard 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.880
 incorporates a touch pad we do not know yet 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.500
 the prices for this equipment but given 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.480
 the benefits and something that has us 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.270
 accustomed from the brand would not be 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.739
 wonder that he did not lose 500 euros 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.780
 will be available in wi fi versions and 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.400
 wi fÃ­ masseret to what you have to add 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.070
 that his memory will be expandable even in 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.820
 32 traditional gigas is available to 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.820
