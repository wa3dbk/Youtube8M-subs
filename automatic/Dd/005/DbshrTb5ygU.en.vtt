with this in that the coastline is no

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.940 
with this in that the coastline is no
longer<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.119> this<00:01:46.240> shape<00:01:46.569> and<00:01:46.810> actually<00:01:47.679> comes

longer of this shape and actually comes

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.580 
longer of this shape and actually comes
