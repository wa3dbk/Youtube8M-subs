without having respect for the ocean and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.670 
without having respect for the ocean and
obviously<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.720> environment<00:02:48.200> we're<00:02:48.320> working

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
obviously the environment we're working

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.320 
obviously the environment we're working
because<00:02:48.800> that's<00:02:49.250> what<00:02:49.460> we<00:02:49.790> make<00:02:49.940> our<00:02:50.120> living

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
because that's what we make our living

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.030 
because that's what we make our living
from<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.290> we<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.710> look<00:02:51.860> after

from so you know we have to look after

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.920 
from so you know we have to look after
it<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.400> just<00:02:52.550> goes<00:02:52.970> without<00:02:53.120> saying<00:02:53.510> if<00:02:53.660> we

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
it it's just goes without saying if we

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.360 
it it's just goes without saying if we
wreck<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.440> then<00:02:54.560> we've<00:02:54.890> wrecked<00:02:55.100> our<00:02:55.220> own

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
