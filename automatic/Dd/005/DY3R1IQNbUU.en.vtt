because in the olden days they came with
a<00:01:11.570> four<00:01:12.570> cell<00:01:12.930> battery<00:01:13.770> charger<00:01:14.159> II<00:01:14.220> had<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a four cell battery charger II had to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
a four cell battery charger II had to
put<00:01:14.580> four<00:01:14.820> double<00:01:15.150> A<00:01:15.330> batteries<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.049> and

put four double A batteries in it and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.590 
put four double A batteries in it and
that<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.460> stupid<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:18.180> far<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.479> I'm

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

concerned and you know it would waste

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.230 
concerned and you know it would waste
batteries<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.860> USB<00:01:23.280> charger<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> much

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
batteries and this USB charger is a much

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.039 
batteries and this USB charger is a much
better<00:01:24.420> idea<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> battery

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.690 
first okay you know it's time you turn
it<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.930> later<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.560> you're<00:02:07.680> gonna<00:02:07.770> bind<00:02:08.069> but

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it on later is if you're gonna bind but

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880 
it on later is if you're gonna bind but
now<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.539> bound<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.050> paired<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.709> don't

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
now that it's bound and paired you don't

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.280 
now that it's bound and paired you don't
need<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.180> radio<00:02:12.480> goes<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.870> for

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
need to do that so the radio goes on for

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.399 
need to do that so the radio goes on for
then<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.980> plug<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.310> helicopter<00:02:14.819> in<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:16.230> set

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
then you plug the helicopter in you set

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.709 
then you plug the helicopter in you set
it<00:02:16.500> down<00:02:17.180> you're<00:02:18.180> not<00:02:18.269> gonna<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.480> able<00:02:18.540> see

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
it down you're not gonna be able see

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.949 
it down you're not gonna be able see
that<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.000> wait<00:02:21.120> till<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.659> light<00:02:21.930> turns

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
that and you wait till the light turns

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.330 
that and you wait till the light turns
blue<00:02:22.349> which<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.859> did<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:24.590> now<00:02:25.590> this

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
blue which it just did and now this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
blue which it just did and now this
little<00:02:26.489> heli<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.939> ready<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.239> fly<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.560> other

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
little heli is ready to fly the other

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.160 
little heli is ready to fly the other
thing<00:02:28.920> too<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.099> when<00:02:29.400> you're<00:02:29.549> turning<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:29.939> on

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
thing too is when you're turning it on

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.460 
thing too is when you're turning it on
make<00:02:31.170> sure<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.299> keep<00:02:33.299> your<00:02:33.750> stick<00:02:34.319> all

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
make sure that you keep your stick all

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.809 
make sure that you keep your stick all
the<00:02:34.590> way<00:02:34.620> down<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.129> don't<00:02:35.220> want<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.489> up<00:02:35.700> or

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
the way down you don't want this up or

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.789 
the way down you don't want this up or
you're<00:02:35.939> not<00:02:36.079> now<00:02:37.079> it<00:02:37.200> shouldn't<00:02:37.560> start

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
you're not now it shouldn't start

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.440 
you're not now it shouldn't start
usually<00:02:37.980> what'll<00:02:38.250> happen<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.670> you'll<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.359> an

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
usually what'll happen is you'll see an

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.970 
usually what'll happen is you'll see an
error<00:02:39.629> code<00:02:39.810> flashing<00:02:40.319> in<00:02:40.409> here<00:02:40.680> if<00:02:40.829> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
error code flashing in here if the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.729 
error code flashing in here if the
throttle<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.459> up<00:02:41.609> so<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:43.049> know<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.349> won't<00:02:43.530> go

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
throttle is up so you know it won't go

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.039 
throttle is up so you know it won't go
on<00:02:43.859> its<00:02:44.010> own<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:44.420> make<00:02:45.420> sure<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.689> throttles

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
on its own but make sure the throttles

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.179 
on its own but make sure the throttles
down<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.439> for<00:02:46.560> safety<00:02:46.829> that's<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.040> good

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
down just for safety that's a good

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.160 
down just for safety that's a good
practice<00:02:47.579> anyway<00:02:47.879> whenever<00:02:48.659> you<00:02:48.780> start<00:02:49.019> any

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
practice anyway whenever you start any

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.530 
practice anyway whenever you start any
roll<00:02:49.680> control<00:02:49.920> vehicle<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.970> throttle<00:02:51.359> should

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
roll control vehicle the throttle should

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.500 
roll control vehicle the throttle should
be<00:02:51.629> all<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.780> way<00:02:51.959> down<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:54.180> other<00:02:54.329> thing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
be all the way down so the other thing

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.610 
be all the way down so the other thing
that<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.720> wanted<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.019> point<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.739> these

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
that I wanted to point out is that these

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.679 
that I wanted to point out is that these
lithium<00:02:58.620> polymer<00:02:58.769> batteries<00:02:59.459> need<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.299> keep<00:03:00.599> a

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
lithium polymer batteries need to keep a

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.920 
lithium polymer batteries need to keep a
constant<00:03:00.959> charge<00:03:01.669> if<00:03:02.669> you<00:03:02.970> see<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.720> light

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
constant charge if you see the light

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.710 
constant charge if you see the light
when<00:03:04.819> this<00:03:05.819> has<00:03:06.000> what's<00:03:06.269> called<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.540> low

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
when this has what's called a low

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.699 
when this has what's called a low
voltage<00:03:06.959> cutoff<00:03:07.760> when<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.849> battery<00:03:09.180> gets<00:03:09.299> low

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
voltage cutoff when the battery gets low

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.229 
voltage cutoff when the battery gets low
you'll<00:03:10.709> see<00:03:10.919> a<00:03:10.950> red<00:03:11.189> lights<00:03:11.430> are<00:03:11.700> flashing<00:03:11.939> and

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
you'll see a red lights are flashing and

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.170 
you'll see a red lights are flashing and
flash<00:03:12.599> red<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.019> blue<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:15.030> your

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
flash red and blue so that is your

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.610 
flash red and blue so that is your
warning<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.750> helicopter<00:03:16.230> will<00:03:16.349> drop

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
warning and the helicopter will drop

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.229 
warning and the helicopter will drop
it's<00:03:16.859> gonna<00:03:16.980> shut<00:03:17.250> itself<00:03:17.519> off<00:03:17.729> so<00:03:17.790> you'll

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
it's gonna shut itself off so you'll

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.659 
it's gonna shut itself off so you'll
know<00:03:18.419> it<00:03:18.930> landed<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.680> lights<00:03:19.889> fat<00:03:20.129> flashing

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
know it landed the lights fat flashing

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.759 
know it landed the lights fat flashing
red-and-blue<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:21.840> means<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> flight

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
red-and-blue that means that the flight

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.009 
red-and-blue that means that the flight
is<00:03:22.919> over<00:03:23.269> disconnect<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.359> battery<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.959> put

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
is over disconnect the battery and put

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:25.670 
is over disconnect the battery and put
it<00:03:25.500> away

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
it away

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.250 
it away
don't<00:03:26.280> try<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.639> keep<00:03:26.879> flying<00:03:27.180> if<00:03:27.479> you<00:03:27.930> run<00:03:28.139> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
don't try to keep flying if you run the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.080 
don't try to keep flying if you run the
battery<00:03:28.379> down<00:03:28.650> further<00:03:29.159> than<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.669> that

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
battery down further than that that

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.180 
battery down further than that that
emergency<00:03:30.479> signal<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.530> will<00:03:31.680> ruin<00:03:31.979> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
emergency signal you will ruin the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.159 
emergency signal you will ruin the
battery<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.639> it'll<00:03:32.819> never<00:03:33.000> work<00:03:33.150> again<00:03:33.419> so

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
battery and it'll never work again so

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.339 
battery and it'll never work again so
you<00:03:34.680> get<00:03:34.799> one<00:03:35.099> shot<00:03:35.340> at<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.760> if<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
you get one shot at that if you

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.899 
you get one shot at that if you
discharge<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.530> battery<00:03:37.560> past<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.459> warning

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
discharge the battery past that warning

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.759 
discharge the battery past that warning
you're<00:03:39.569> gonna<00:03:39.659> ruin<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.079> battery<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.590> it'll

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
you're gonna ruin the battery and it'll

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.830 
you're gonna ruin the battery and it'll
never<00:03:40.889> work<00:03:41.010> again<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.849> these<00:03:42.419> light<00:03:42.659> poles

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
never work again so these light poles

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.119 
never work again so these light poles
are<00:03:42.959> sensitive<00:03:43.319> you<00:03:43.440> have<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.769> careful

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
are sensitive you have to be careful

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.460 
are sensitive you have to be careful

just keeps flying there's no issues with
it<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.440> since<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:33.010> doesn't<00:05:33.160> have<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.970> know

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
it and since it doesn't have you know

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.230 
it and since it doesn't have you know
the<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.919> fly<00:05:36.160> bars<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.729> all<00:05:36.820> that<00:05:37.000> stuff

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
as a good trainer it will tangle in

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.670
