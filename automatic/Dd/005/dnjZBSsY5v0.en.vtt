00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.559
 hello today we will do some 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.940
 shortbreads for the Parmesan aperitif 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.160
 I let you discover the ingredients 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.490
 right now and we find ourselves in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.490
 cooked 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.320
 for this recipe is nothing simpler 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.190
 we just have to mix all the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.190
 ingredients together 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.090
 and I add now more afraid 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.650
 here I am getting a dough that is supportive 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.980
 although I will be able to roll into a ball 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.210
 I have little balls that I'm going 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 arrange on a baking sheet 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.890
 the important thing is to make 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.840
 balls of the same size like that the leather 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.190
 have the same time and me for the sets 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.690
 and I just flatten them 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.690
 slightly with a fork 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.900
 the cooking time varies between 5 and 10 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.390
 minutes in effect indeed small 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.680
 or big sands and the trick is 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.990
 that they have to be slightly 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.610
 golden on the top the shortbreads are 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.920
 ready the hardest is the form they 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.330
 cool down before swallowing them up to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.330
