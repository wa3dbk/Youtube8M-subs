00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
pretty simple I'm playing this on

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
pretty simple I'm playing this on
recruit<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.379> my<00:00:52.469> first<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.860> through<00:00:52.890> just

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
recruit for my first go through just

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.560 
recruit for my first go through just
because<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.579> makes<00:00:53.730> things<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.329> faster

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
because it makes things go a lot faster

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.619 
because it makes things go a lot faster
but<00:00:55.379> you're<00:00:55.500> gonna<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.770> five<00:00:56.539> places<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
but you're gonna have five places to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
but you're gonna have five places to
clear<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.260> find<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.309> every

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
clear out and find and I think every

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.279 
clear out and find and I think every
single<00:01:00.180> time<00:01:00.329> she's<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> last<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.199> no

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
single time she's in the last one no

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.640 
single time she's in the last one no
matter<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.680> order<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
matter what order you do it in and so I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.690 
matter what order you do it in and so I
found<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.250> best

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
found it best

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.130 
found it best

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
since AI in this game are pretty miss to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
since AI in this game are pretty miss to
hit<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> plays<00:01:11.100> her<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> plus<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.570> you're

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.440 
but once you've completed this one after
about<00:01:49.250> another<00:01:49.490> mission<00:01:50.060> or<00:01:50.180> two<00:01:50.300> you're

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
about another mission or two you're

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.300 
about another mission or two you're
going<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.630> get<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.870> dispatch<00:01:51.350> Strikeforce

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
going to get the dispatch Strikeforce

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.090 
going to get the dispatch Strikeforce
mission<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.710> you're<00:01:54.710> going<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:54.860> need<00:01:55.010> this

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
mission and you're going to need this

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.020 
mission and you're going to need this
one<00:01:55.160> for<00:01:56.830> that<00:01:57.830> one<00:01:58.010> was<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.310> for<00:01:58.400> good<00:01:58.640> karma

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
one for that one was just for good karma

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.260 
one for that one was just for good karma
this<00:01:59.570> one<00:01:59.810> is<00:02:00.020> for<00:02:00.320> shipshape<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.270> it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
this one is for shipshape and it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.890 
this one is for shipshape and it
requires<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:02.930> assassinate<00:02:03.940> skin<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.570> I

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
requires you to assassinate skin so I

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.240 
requires you to assassinate skin so I
think<00:02:06.020> that's<00:02:06.500> how<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.620> pronounce<00:02:06.740> it

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
think that's how you pronounce it

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.950 
think that's how you pronounce it
pretty<00:02:07.970> much<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.270> should<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.480> to<00:02:08.600> run<00:02:08.780> to

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
pretty much you should have to run to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.080 
pretty much you should have to run to
this<00:02:09.110> back<00:02:09.320> base<00:02:09.560> plan<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.100> beacon<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:10.610> wait

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
this back base plan to beacon and wait

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.450 
this back base plan to beacon and wait
until<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:11.870> thing<00:02:12.110> opens<00:02:12.440> up<00:02:12.560> once<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.310> does

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
until this thing opens up once it does

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.420 
until this thing opens up once it does
it's<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:14.060> simple<00:02:14.450> shot<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> chest<00:02:15.110> and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
it's just a simple shot to the chest and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.100 
it's just a simple shot to the chest and
who<00:02:16.430> means<00:02:16.730> assassinated<00:02:17.330> really<00:02:17.600> simple<00:02:17.930> and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
who means assassinated really simple and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.220 
who means assassinated really simple and
after<00:02:21.110> we've<00:02:21.260> done<00:02:21.290> all<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:22.870> there<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.200> a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
after we've done all of that there is a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.220 
after we've done all of that there is a
