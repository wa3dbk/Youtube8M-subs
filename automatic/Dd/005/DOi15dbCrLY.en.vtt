00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.690 
time you don't have a lot of movement in
here<00:02:15.610> because<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.830> door<00:02:17.830> handle<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.400> still

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
here because the door handle is still

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.330 
here because the door handle is still
connected<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> door<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.890> if<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.100> just

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
connected to the door but if you just

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.030 
connected to the door but if you just
slide<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.760> back<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.940> little<00:02:22.090> bit<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.810> then<00:02:23.470> lift

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
slide it back a little bit and then lift

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.300 
slide it back a little bit and then lift
up<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:24.970> it'll<00:02:25.209> break<00:02:25.330> free<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.860> right<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
up then it'll break free all right the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.449 
up then it'll break free all right the
next<00:02:27.520> step<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:28.270> going<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.750> be<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.740> release<00:02:30.250> I

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
next step is going to be to release I

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.760 
next step is going to be to release I
like<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.820> release<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.330> electronics<00:02:32.020> first<00:02:32.380> so

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
like to release the electronics first so

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.090 
like to release the electronics first so
you've<00:02:32.920> got<00:02:33.130> one<00:02:33.400> clip<00:02:33.670> there<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:35.100> it's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
you've got one clip there that it's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.440 
you've got one clip there that it's
going<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.459> bit<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.760> challenge<00:02:37.209> but<00:02:37.360> you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
going to be a bit of a challenge but you

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.170 
going to be a bit of a challenge but you
can<00:02:37.600> just<00:02:37.780> push<00:02:38.020> on<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:39.310> lever<00:02:39.820> right<00:02:40.120> there

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
can just push on that lever right there

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.110 
can just push on that lever right there
and<00:02:40.630> then<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> one<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.200> top<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.739> just<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.880> same

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and then the one on top is just the same

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.060 
and then the one on top is just the same
just<00:02:43.720> push<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.110> wiggle<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> back<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.830> forth

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
just push that wiggle it back and forth

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.960 
just push that wiggle it back and forth
it's<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.550> tight<00:02:45.790> fit<00:02:45.820> but<00:02:46.750> give<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:46.959> some<00:02:47.080> time

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
it's a tight fit but give it some time

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.970 
it's a tight fit but give it some time
then<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.510> after<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.200> get<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> bit<00:02:50.800> more

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
then the after that I get a bit more

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.540 
then the after that I get a bit more
movement<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.390> Dorf<00:02:53.019> panel<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.980> I'll

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
movement out of the Dorf panel and I'll

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.000 
movement out of the Dorf panel and I'll
come<00:02:54.700> over<00:02:54.730> here<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.269> this<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.320> door

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
come over here and this is the door

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.880 
come over here and this is the door
handle<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:58.180> has<00:02:58.330> two<00:02:58.690> plastic<00:02:59.350> clips<00:02:59.650> that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
handle and it has two plastic clips that

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.300 
handle and it has two plastic clips that
go<00:03:00.070> around<00:03:00.310> these<00:03:01.090> metal<00:03:02.080> bars<00:03:02.110> you<00:03:03.040> need<00:03:03.190> to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
go around these metal bars you need to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.420 
go around these metal bars you need to
pop<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.640> plastic<00:03:04.390> out<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:05.110> then<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.100> metal

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
pop a plastic out and then the metal

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.100 
pop a plastic out and then the metal
will<00:03:06.550> just<00:03:06.760> slide<00:03:07.060> down<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.810> one<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
will just slide down and the one on the

pop the plastic out in the middle slide
up<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:11.260> will<00:03:11.350> release<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.709> panel

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
up and that will release the panel

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.220 
up and that will release the panel
alright<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.090> way<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.900> pry<00:03:14.170> these

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
alright the way that I like to pry these

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.430 
alright the way that I like to pry these
out<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:14.950> with<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> flathead<00:03:15.910> screwdriver<00:03:16.440> that

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
out is with a flathead screwdriver that

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.840 
out is with a flathead screwdriver that
just<00:03:17.680> gives<00:03:17.829> me<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> little<00:03:18.250> bit<00:03:18.430> extra

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
just gives me a little bit extra

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.580 
just gives me a little bit extra
leverage<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.540> can't<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:20.019> with<00:03:20.140> my<00:03:20.290> hand

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
leverage that I can't get with my hand

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.319 
leverage that I can't get with my hand
because<00:03:21.070> it's<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:23.650> very<00:03:23.850> not<00:03:24.850> very<00:03:25.060> thick

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
because it's not very not very thick

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.350 
because it's not very not very thick
alright<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.410> there<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:27.130> one<00:03:27.310> came<00:03:27.549> off<00:03:27.579> and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
alright so there that one came off and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.970 
alright so there that one came off and
you<00:03:28.660> can<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:28.930> now<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.530> push<00:03:29.769> that

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
you can see now that I can push that

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.000 
you can see now that I can push that
metal<00:03:30.910> down<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.690> pops<00:03:31.720> right<00:03:32.049> out<00:03:32.230> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
metal down and it pops right out the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.710 
metal down and it pops right out the
same<00:03:33.250> thing<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:33.670> true<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.090> bottom<00:03:34.510> piece

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
same thing is true that bottom piece

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.120 
same thing is true that bottom piece
I'll<00:03:35.079> see<00:03:35.230> if<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.709> do<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.860> with<00:03:35.920> my

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
I'll see if I can just do it with my

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.830 
I'll see if I can just do it with my
thumb<00:03:37.410> got<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.799> now<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:40.030> metal<00:03:40.570> pops

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
thumb got it and now the the metal pops

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.800 
thumb got it and now the the metal pops
up<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.590> one<00:03:42.269> give<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> little<00:03:43.570> bit<00:03:43.720> of

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
up on this one give it a little bit of

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.699 
up on this one give it a little bit of
movement<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:45.420> now<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.480> door<00:03:46.840> panel<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.470> fully

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
movement and now the door panel is fully

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.289 
movement and now the door panel is fully
disconnected<00:03:51.120> alright

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
disconnected alright

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.319 
disconnected alright
so<00:03:52.840> it's<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.110> pretty<00:03:53.380> simple<00:03:53.680> job<00:03:54.070> I'm<00:03:54.910> really

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
so it's a pretty simple job I'm really

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.970 
so it's a pretty simple job I'm really
something<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.989> if<00:03:56.320> you<00:03:56.470> need<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.680> get<00:03:56.799> done
