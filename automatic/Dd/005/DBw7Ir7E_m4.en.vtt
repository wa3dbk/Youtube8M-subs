00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
know it's a different angle just putting

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.790 
know it's a different angle just putting
it<00:02:21.300> outside<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.720> elbows<00:02:21.990> really<00:02:22.500> getting<00:02:22.770> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
it outside the elbows really getting a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800 
it outside the elbows really getting a
good<00:02:22.980> squeeze<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.670> find<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.600> works

really<00:02:25.020> well<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.800> lot<00:02:25.950> less

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
really well I think it's a lot less

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.890 
really well I think it's a lot less
