00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.370
 short can not choose a pack to 30 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:13.830
 minutes half of matches sales not like 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 someone and when the team is not completely 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.990
 ready there is a man playing ours today 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.940
 ok as i always said our 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.940
 commanded a strong cupcake scour 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.080
 I agree probably with colleagues because 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.420
 a lot of minority I don't know if 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.430
 it will be throughout the season but 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.910
 probably we can adapt to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.460
 some kind of interpretation of the rules because 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.760
 that our team also has a family of 25 minutes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 there was a removal of a minority but generally by 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.059
 the game 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.399
 probably the first ten minutes guys still in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.070
 skated up to 1 game excitement somewhere like that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.920
 there was stiffness in principle after 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.469
 scored puck probably all the same to us 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.469
 could deal with the excitement 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.350
 it showed high speeds 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.869
 aggressive play 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.249
 perhaps even a little turned 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:19.319
 please question you say what 

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:22.259
 today it is still the type of chosen method 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:31.819
 the difference between masonry game goalkeeper 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:35.189
 sorokin quality beans on karey like 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.469
 lines are tacasto inviolability because 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.950
 that we will understand their own all their 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.159
 family 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.590
 so I'm a young couple first game in khl 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.729
 so maybe it is not of course a bath 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.869
 and I will be full stands 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.919
 I'm close to you in clean hemp no 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.279
 the husband is hard on this output is seasonal 

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:58.859
 guild's wort headphones 

00:01:55.279 --> 00:02:02.579
 but basically how would we count it 3 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:05.309
 second for the spoon before the season right behind 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.169
 got injured a week before the seasons 

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:09.169
 so the invasion just don't have to choose 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:26.640
 for you personally khl and how it 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.980
 It means that the beginning of the journey to the first 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.030
 step we took 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.950
 Of course it's pretty successful. 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.799
 go ahead get ready next game i 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.629
 I think after three days we meet for 5 with 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.930
 metallurgist year we are there quite different 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.120
 the game will be today so tomorrow we will 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.930
 is preparing as follows 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.060
 you are sitting portal compare 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.129
 first threw eyes and survive them us 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.250
 it is nothing other time 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:01.859
 above the middle part the defenders matured but 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.370
 we have Igor Ozhiganov and Maxim Ignatovich 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.659
 in 6 defenders they will in any case 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.659
 go out and will play
