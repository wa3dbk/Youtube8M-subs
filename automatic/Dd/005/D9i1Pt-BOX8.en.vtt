 track attention to detail and filing the game in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.339
 the whole gameplay is built around

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.790
 very short is often 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.490
 puzzles in which you need 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.350

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.490
 short distance if you lose 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.079
 if you fall you will tear or crush you 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 don't have to start the level again 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.780
 the game only moves you a few 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.579
 steps back 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.799
 settings, you can select the type of control 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.049
 and quality graphics but choose 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.780
 fantastic only if you have at least 1 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.640
 gigabytes of ram very rarely 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.039
 when developers put their soul into 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.619
 creating a game but the type rider is 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.600
 that case on mobile platforms such 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.159
 games are worth their weight in gold and it's great that they 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.159
 though rarely but still go 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.250
 Crocodile Swoopy 2 finally 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100

 two or even three ways up 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.690
 the level is turned upside down and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.849
 fluid flows upwards 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.099
 the drillers need to break through the stone 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.620
 without activating switches but not 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.420
 touching and cannot collect u so there is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.519
 separate mode kopaev club where needed 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.470

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.569
 noticeably prettier rollers low 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.069
 permissions but this is most likely done 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.930
 to reduce the volume 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.299
 Physics, too, now corrected all 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.640
 fluid minutes yourself more naturally but 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.040
 with all the advantages of improvements there is a huge 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.170
 minus this is given first of all this 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.599
 tips that makes it easy to collect so 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.340
 but without them, you can completely do without 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.650
 players guaranteed money invested 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.599
 added to all the hated energy 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.610
 systems and wait or pay 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.650
 but if you wait, you don't want that at all 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.290
 for only 500 rubles this very 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.299
 energy can be made endless first 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.000

 developer came a million dollars but 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.859
 apparently greed turned out to be much 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.069
 stronger but generally good continuation 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.069

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.910
 important objects will disturb you 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.280
 numerous enemy forces at the beginning 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.780
 these are ordinary soldiers with machine guns but 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.300
 when you fly homing 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.550
 rocket sideways aims from the mortar bottom 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.229

 control is implemented as a joystick 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.530
 which is quite convenient the helicopter can 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.570
 rotate not only left and right 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.610
 but also facing the player 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.290
 complicates the passage initially 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.570
 only normal difficulty is available 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.860

 simply no cost of the game 164 rubles 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.110
 which is all the more justified when
