00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
come even sooner yeah assuming of course

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
come even sooner yeah assuming of course
that<00:00:59.340> he<00:00:59.609> does<00:00:59.820> get<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.480> he<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that he does get I think he will get it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.139 
that he does get I think he will get it
because<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.100> position<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> road<00:01:02.969> is

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
because the position that the road is

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
because the position that the road is
currently<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.719> mean<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:03.989> only<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
currently and I mean it's only what a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.890 
currently and I mean it's only what a
third<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.390> still<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
third of the way is still got like a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.810 
third of the way is still got like a
third<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> way<00:01:07.380> left<00:01:07.740> plus<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> little<00:01:08.610> bit

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
third of the way left plus a little bit

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.160 
third of the way left plus a little bit
of<00:01:08.909> turnaround<00:01:09.180> time<00:01:09.920> if<00:01:10.920> he<00:01:11.100> does<00:01:11.369> end<00:01:11.790> up

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
of turnaround time if he does end up

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.539 
of turnaround time if he does end up
missing<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.500> though<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> has<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> bit<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
missing that though that it has a bit of

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
missing that though that it has a bit of
a<00:01:14.729> big<00:01:14.970> mistake<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.960> would<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> big

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
a big mistake that would be a big

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.410 
a big mistake that would be a big
mistake<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> pays<00:01:18.210> off

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
mistake but if you know if it pays off

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
mistake but if you know if it pays off
