up<00:00:26.760> because<00:00:26.939> recycling<00:00:27.930> should<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
up because recycling should be a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
up because recycling should be a
priority<00:00:28.890> i<00:00:29.699> guess<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.880> product<00:00:32.880> itself

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
priority i guess so the product itself

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.740 
priority i guess so the product itself
it<00:00:33.690> comes<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.649> bottle<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.910> 125

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it comes in a bottle like this it's 125

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.440 
it comes in a bottle like this it's 125
million<00:00:37.110> litre<00:00:37.410> bottle<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> before<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.059> know

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
million litre bottle and before you know

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020 
million litre bottle and before you know
anything<00:00:39.809> else<00:00:40.050> i<00:00:40.140> should<00:00:40.170> say<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.030> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
anything else i should say this and the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
anything else i should say this and the
people<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.570> simple<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.530> specialize<00:00:44.219> in

people are simple they specialize in
sensitive<00:00:45.180> skin<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.510> if<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.899> sensitive

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
sensitive skin so if you have sensitive

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.889 
sensitive skin so if you have sensitive
skin<00:00:46.440> simple<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.940> perfect<00:00:48.329> brand<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and because they specialize in sensitive

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
and because they specialize in sensitive
skin<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.600> use<00:00:52.320> quite<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> lot<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.070> natural
