00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.729
 string3 the television more to shit 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.650
 because the delicious pasta with poblano 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.360
 with a very easy chipotle sauce 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.160
 do in less than 30 minutes we already know 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.269
 as we need to know the pasta the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.670
 pasta is cooked in boiling water 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.619
 he was always always boiling with 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.210
 esther these curious bubbles we are going to 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.949
 add the pasta and two types of pasta 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.289
 pasta cut and long pasta in this 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.300
 I will use a screw or rifle and 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.170
 what is this redondita pasta like 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.279
 spirals this is short pasta and 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.079
 depending on the quality of peace is 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.699
 the cooking time that I need 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.030
 I only say many times the flight say 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.950
 again it is not necessary to put anything 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.970
 more than being in the water where we are going to 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.309
 Cook pasta 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.670
 avoid onion laurel leaf 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.200
 garlic does not need it without sausages 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.820
 because you can are partizan it gives you so much 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.649
 taste nothing but very little 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.770
 remember that before I told you that my 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.170
 grandfather always said that you had to put 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.250
 to cook the pasta as if it were in the sea 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.559
 Mediterranean 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.910
 very very salty then me with this 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.309
 part that we have to start taking care of 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.449
 especially low down talk the sodium that 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.180
 it's the salt 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.490
 I decided that my life everything went down salt 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.500
 so if I add so much salt to myself, 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.539
 of pasta and necessary 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.670
 depending on the forgiveness of the 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.500
 quality of the pasta are the minutes that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.750
 we need for example the short pasta 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.789
 suddenly in this 7 to 10 minutes the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.310
 long pasta maybe a little more and 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.020
 it is very important to never break the pasta 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.460
 long for that are the spaghetti 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.350
 spaces are long and should be 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.569
 preserve as such let's start with 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.659
 to be our poblanos in a 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:38.869
 comal need have very well 70 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.310
 burned well as immediately it 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.350
 they start to catch I say sorry until issues 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.960
 I need you to be very well taken 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.310
 why because then I'm going to put them to 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.290
 I'll get put in a bag 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.060
 plastic that I'm going to talk to right now 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.829
 personally and he's not an engineer 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.409
 that I have after setting this 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.250
 pasta from how to recycle and that 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.060
 we need to stop resist the appetite 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.250
 allegedly these plastic bags 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.780
 because now its use a lot and at best 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.869
 pollute a lot I already have brakes 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.390
 onion I already have a pepper that I'm going to 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.780
 start slicing julienne because in 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.630
 julianas because I have rifle and rifle 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.540
 it's long I do not think it's a good idea to have 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.319
 long pasta I say have the peppers in 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.319
 juliana form 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.650
 houston I will not despise anything of the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.650
 pepper 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.500
 this part do not use but this part if you 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.500
 will occupy 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.830
 to use it all 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.650
 I have my poblano peppers here already 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.659
 is burning 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.489
 but I already have some here already 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.340
 cured and previously of seed two and 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.439
 everything and will do the same I 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.180
 to cut them in julienne the slices in 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.250
 Julian 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.930
 but this will put an end to them 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.670
 I'm going to say because they already have a cooking 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.980
 I put them from now on I'm 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.709
 starting to use to frying the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.049
 Pepper, the safest thing is that I'm going 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.049
 undo we are going to cut in julienne 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.120
 seen more as what we need if 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.670
 so much we would have been ready with this 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.680
 I have coriander and I have cream and I have 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.890
 chipotle that I'm going to liquefy in this 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.890
 instant 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.569
 I'm going to put so much oil I feel like I 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.760
 it takes little oil as it gets 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.880
 the oil when one is already frying 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.760
 something by his side the ingredients and by the 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.880
 little shore of the oil I say of those of the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.010
 one vessel is dropping oil 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.680
 and that's because it's for him to leave 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.100
 heating up with when it is already falling 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.100
 it's hot 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.860
 now we already started to mix all 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.860
 the ingredients 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.790
 It is very important to cook with very 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.400
 little fat is not necessary, let's 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.790
 put the pasta once you are in 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.790
 foot be 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.970
 combine with the flavors 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 I like the flavors to feel 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.990
 and that they do not seem overcooked is very 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.880
 important 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.590
 is not this pasta as you can see not the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.289
 I have stuck it did not stick absolutely 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.539
 nothing because when it came out of the known 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.210
 half sun of cold water and that 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.160
 immediately pass a container 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.289
 and I put a lot of oil on it 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.289
 put our cream now 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.319
 cream 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.249
 being city cream of which we have 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:52.959
 at home it can always be low in fat 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:54.189
 we are already with the carbohydrate the 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.889
 pasta carbohydrate this 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:05:00.309
 we need to also go down to the 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.629
 hosting the sirex I have chipotle and you 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.629
 will put a drop of salt 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.030
 I love the roast 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.030
 migrant 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.960
 I do not want to go on television anymore 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.960
 She said that she was not enough 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.590
 and he knows very well 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.620
 It is very complete 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:41.670
 let's see it was perfect it puts me a 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:44.190
 onion 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.470
 perfect that is fine onion well 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.470
 here we are going to put the poblano 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.380
 let's mix against the stick here 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.320
 is the metric man but good not 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.060
 import 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.940
 let's mix 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.610
 and t 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.830
 so father the colors I liked now 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.500
 So far we have a pasta already 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.870
 we have a saucer that if you like 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.450
 put the chipotle the cream with 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.490
 chipotle or know that some fajitas 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.710
 chicken also already previously fried 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.910
 would be spectacular let's put 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.910
 the chipotle cream 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.340
 we are ready and nothing more what a delight 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:33.350
 easy to do 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.350
 always a pasta is very good common 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.930
 I love the taste I find 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.449
 very rich a little bit past 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.030
 carbohydrate and fats and tantito but 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.129
 is once the best here because it was the 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:53.249
 chicken lady and we have the saucer 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:55.019
 of the day we do not need more 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:58.799
 we are ready let's leave all this 

00:06:55.019 --> 00:07:01.219
 say this that is here and we are 

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.219

 that you and I do the same procedure 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.290
 I have to decorate coriander and nuggets 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.830
 when I am ready to serve me 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:20.410

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.050
