00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.849
 hey guys you are today 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.070
 let's talk about updates from marvel but because 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 that this week they came out well decent 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.690
 First, I can only mention you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.529
 know the thought of all cutting three significant 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.090
 generally 3 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.039
 In general, the night gothic black delight 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.480
 widow because it draws the first 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.730
 Essentially this is oningoing about a black widow 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.510
 which is written by an unknown person draws 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.090
 the artist who thrust thunderbolt f1 wounds 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.520
 and fil note 1 person I do not know honestly 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.860
 google it laziness in general 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 represents this action I will try 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 Briefly tell I will not say a word 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 what was I really waiting for if you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 listen again podcast from Nevsky 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.289
 Doctors write themselves first we are there 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.410
 enough 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.030
 popularly explained why we are waiting there 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.920
 Rene wait some advings so here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 I have seen the clouds 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.329
 I do not remember what he said on the key 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.010
 but I was waiting for this series because I 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.470
 it seemed not to do something like hulk and 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.939
 at least that 's somehow in the war 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 head it all lined up so that 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.080
 Natasha Romanova can and well such 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.740
 female version of hawkai and not for so 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.710
 it would look 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.520
 that the floor finally came out and is such 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.850
 agent special agent who is naive 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.400
 mercenary but mercenary correct that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.950
 lizok explain it that is she does 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.020
 things well, that is, she is there to save the good 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.640
 guys say bad and so on like that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.650
 the right mercenaries are hiring on the fact that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.939
 him and bad people and protect the good ones 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.180
 Basically, I can not say that it is bad 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.650
 I can say it's a bad idea, but here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.479
 depends on how I will not develop 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.630
 because bye well first issue 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.159
 it's quite ok ok ok i mean i 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 I can imagine that it will somehow 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.970
 to function and that this self will 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.430
 represent on the other hand whether 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.649
 such a departure from this topic 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.719
 new shield agents and so forth well then 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.950
 There is the, that Natasha one consider style and 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.079
 so on still assassin 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.290
 it says on the cover of the spender 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.509
 assassin legend in my opinion is also not clear 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.830
 will there be all these three and they will 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.980
 be respected or not have you seen one 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.570
 the fact that she is an assassin and agent may not 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.940
 I know most likely no, let's see how 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.800
 will be further in fact I personally am waiting 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.110
 a large number of crossovers, I think 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.880
 what exactly will natasha be able to leave 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.980
 Well, probably Krasovskaya at least come 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.440
 because soon the movie is there or is it 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.880
 much love line called like they 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.530
 it will all pull out most likely 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.500
 no you have them because but steve 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.570
 rogers a little different relationship in 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.160
 the universe of marvel nau and u natasha 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.990
 the example is unknown for all 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.630
 even a cat can't cook in 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.810
 Basically, I can say that the start is given 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.090
 start given is not a good views that tried 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.030
 somehow carrion first start traditions 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.070
 such spyware fighters and for me personally it 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.050
 reminded more of this born 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.740
 but a little bit well, that is, the regiment is not right 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.840
 what's the style of what's going on 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.180
 cool action about this whole spy 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.040
 It works because it is clearly not the bond 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.650
 ubuntu little bit still a different character 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.420
 for some reason I have a national team near the soul 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.860
 The option that born is completely different 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.900
 character and completely different type 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 personality however it turned out that 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.840
 they are pretty similar so i hope to 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.760
 what he 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.620
 socializing will gain popularity and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.500
 continue to really tit very 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.600
 good but it is not yet clear inside 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.880
 the villain is his natasha because if on 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.739
 throughout all issues on will 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 tell stories about some 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.970
 politicians who saves 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.920
 or kills it will be pam strange all 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.480
 marvel however they tried 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880
 say realistic supervillains tu 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.860
 need someone to fight Natasha I honestly 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.019
 I do not know the possibility even Russian villain 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.310
 here it will be very cool hope but 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.709
 bye impression reissue 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 positive about the picture i don't 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.690
 really like phil moto 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.310
 he is not a bad artist not bad but they are not 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.019
 said that he was somehow attracted to me 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.209
 when he drew a thunderbolt he saw 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.459
 was a good linker and a good colorist 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.810
 who completed his work 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.900
 It was really excellent 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.600
 qualitatively good here is something a little bit 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.160
 strange because as for me drawing 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.739
 This style is made somewhat 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.470
 unfinished then there are any 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.120
 traces like sketches that are forgotten 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.920
 erase i understand it is a style yes i 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.750
 I understand what it's like trying so 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.520
 make but just imagine the line 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.190
 straight line which goes this line 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.799
 you quench 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.070
 no, and that will be the characterâ€™s hand but 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.330
 then it may be just two strokes and 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.620
 here is this pseudo carelessness here it is 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.050
 stylization vigorously still stylization 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.430
 she personally strains me a little because 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.830
 that I was hoping for something more 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.850
 interesting in on something more 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.560
 quality because what I see 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.200
 this kind of conversation is flawed drawings 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.820
 pseudo hipster inversions hipster 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.310
 because to the level there it is already necessary 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.810
 his hook he never falls short 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.630
 I need to change the picture drawing 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.100
 pain detailed more clear now 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.110
 sma looks blurry a few 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.630
 a little bit of wayne and basically I hope that 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.670
 this will not happen again and will be able to 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.680
 do something optimal something 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.360
 I wonder how much I hope others 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.820
 This is although I repeat it completely 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.500
 imagine an artist but secondly while the series 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.110
 keeps on such good 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.080
 he has a good start this is average 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.840
 The average plot is so entertaining 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.740
 read so interesting until the end read 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.419
 difference from the other but wang marvel we're in 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.600
 again, according to the drawing, quite good 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.280
 such a series of points I think to 6 10 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.980
 well at least for now this issue has 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.230
 the horse, Iâ€™m sure their price is 6 10 because well 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.690
 and what is not quite myself 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.910
 if you can read anything at all 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.890
 business thank you so much for listening 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.350
 first podcast of the series 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.330
 several reviews on boeing margo i 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.130
 decided to divide this time we will see how 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.060
 get a big thank you all for 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.100
 Attention 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.100
 I myself was to see you soon I hope
