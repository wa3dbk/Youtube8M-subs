00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.400
Hi. Today I will show you
how to make bouquet made from Kinder Surprise.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.600
This movie is inspired by one of my viewers.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.800
We need:

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.640
...Kinder Eggs...

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.680
...Crepe paper (2 colors)...

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.200
...scissors...

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.220
...ribbon (narrow)...

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.400
...ribbon (wide)...

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.879
...wooden skewers...

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.460
...and glue gun.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.360
Cut a strip from crepe paper
(about 6 cm width and 15 cm length).

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.720
Stretch it a little.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.360
Crease the edge.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.400
Apply the glue on the egg.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.900
Wrap it in crepe paper.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.060
Press it strongly.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.480
Smear the glue on the end of crepe paper.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.740
Glue the wooden skewer.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.840
Wrap the connection by using crepe paper strip.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.880
Secure it by using glue.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.960
Do the same with the other eggs.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.280
When the eggs are done,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.980
cut a piece from crepe paper.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.600
Stretch it a little.
Crease the edge.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.400
Wrap the bouquet.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.560
Secure it by using glue.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.400
Cut a strip from crepe paper.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.460
Wrap the bouquet handle.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.100
Cut some pieces of narrow ribbon.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.400
Curl them by using scissors.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.660
Glue them between the eggs.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.660
And finally, make a bow on a handle.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.600
And it's done.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.860
Kids will love this bouquet.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.980
It's wonderful gift for Children's Day, First Holy Communion, birthday etc.
