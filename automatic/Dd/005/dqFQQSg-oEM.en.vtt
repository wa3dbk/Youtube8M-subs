00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.660
 when looking at our bodies the color of the pro eyes of our hair is 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.660
 inevitable ask us the next question 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.539
 because we are how we are 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.029
 at birth our mothers always look for the similarities that can be 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.349
 us with them because that's what the inheritance is about 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.519
 is the transmission of physiological or other anatomical features 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.519
 unveiled living beings to their descendants 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.540
 our characteristics are given thanks to a large set of characters 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.630
 transmissible that are in the genes of our organism 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.570
 these will determine our characteristics mainly the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.440
 physical 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 that are recognized at a glance 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.750
 as I said everything we are we owe it to the genes these are found 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.690
 in the chromosomes 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.130
 for example humans possess 23 chromosomes in each cell of our 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.040
 body within these chromosomes is the one of irene is what allows 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 essentially the genetic inheritance 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.470
 the genotype is the set of transmissible characters that determine our 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.620
 characteristics 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.189
 both physical and anatomical 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.619
 For example, a person has green eyes because in his genotype he 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.619
 information determines that your eyes are green 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.300
 logically, the genotype is not visible to humans and possibly 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 no living being 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.360
 the phenotype is technically the visible representation of the genotype is 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.580
 technically say our appearance 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.410
 if we are tall oba cobos also if we have brown hair 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.980
 putting up 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.790
 imagine that you write a text that describes an object 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.100
 the information that you enter by letters that he genotype then you make a 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.730
 image with the characteristics of what you wrote the drawing would be him 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
 phenotype 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.709
 the inheritance are the characteristics that we obtain from our parents 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.760
 to have a much clearer idea about what the word inheritance means 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.429
 we have consulted an expert 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.149
 cedar 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.199
 what they do as a dog 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.999
 those resources of dogs we do not know each other but do not smoke 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.589
 these two centers 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.679
 by the way this Tuesday to several cities the ability to make copies 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.079
 approximate 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.860
 more than oneself min martins of weights reported since then as he said 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.799
 to the density of genetics 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.169
 is perfect because they promise data protection after their two stars 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.169
 your part of your products with us 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.529
 now we will talk about the media 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:11.389
 a fundamental process in the creation of information for each individual 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.779
 This is because in order to be able to transmit the janissary descendants 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.980
 an identical reproduction must be carried out that results in a replica 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.789
 from each of them 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.529
 this is the function of meiosis 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:29.209
 during the process using a cell vitro and four times can be generated 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.819
 ap cells london thanks to that during the phenomenon you experience two 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.819
 successive divisions 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.560
 - to the different varieties of a gene for a character 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.799
 for example we have a gene that determines green eyes and another gene that 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.089
 determines blue eyes 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.219
 these two genes are called 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.019
 genís eaves 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.930
 now cyclone three individuals have in their cells two sets of 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.299
 homologous chromosomes one has contributed by the father and the other by the mother 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:08.569
 so for each character the individual will have two genes for example 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.229
 the color of hair 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:15.229
 that of the mother will be brown and that of the father will be black in this case the 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:20.719
 alleles are different then we will say that the individual zygote skewers for 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:21.949
 that character 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.349
 but if the two eaves were equal that is 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.889
 both parents had the same color hair it would be called 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.889
 homozygotes 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.699
 now we will talk about the dominant and recessive genes 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.810
 the dominant wake of what manifests as phenotype and the recessive 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.040
 is the allele faith is unable to manifest itself in the presence of the agent 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.659
 dominant 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.069
 the dominant is represented with a capital letter while the recessive with 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.009
 one lower case letter 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.749
 However 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:59.759
 for example we have two genes for the color of the eyes 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.639
 the dominant is black and the recessive is celestial 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.090
 for a person to have celestial eyes he needs both parents to have the gene 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.370
 recessive 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.470
 but most likely he has black eyes because there is an allele 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.470
 dominant 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.539
 Gregor Mendel was a Catholic monk and naturalist born there to you 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:26.180
 already 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.469
 now we will explain in a very brief way each one of Mendel's laws 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.800
 first law of Mendez 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.690
 establishes that if two pure races are crossed for a certain character, 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.120
 descendants of the first generation will all be equal between sun to one of 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.620
 The parents 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.900
 this depends on the dominant gene second law of mendel 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.870
 This law establishes that during the formation of the canal gametes of a 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.530
 pair is separated from the other member to determine the genetic makeup 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.319
 of the filial diameter 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.819
 in this case there is a possibility that the rat has brown fur 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.199
 Mendel's third law 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.009
 Mendel concluded that different traits are inherited independently from 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.759
 others there is no relationship between them therefore the inheritance pattern of a 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.249
 trace will not affect the inheritance pattern of another 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:22.849
 good this has been the work 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.599
 bred by alexander ulloa yonatan market and víctor salgado 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:32.489
 it was just a very basic review about the inheritance where we could understand the 

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:38.409
 meanings of them to the phenotype genotype peloteros y coto homozygotes 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.989
 means inspires among others 

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:45.299
 besides understanding that the genetic inheritance is simply the transmission 

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:48.299
 of genetic material from parents to descendants 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:50.270
 a greeting 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.910
 goodbye
