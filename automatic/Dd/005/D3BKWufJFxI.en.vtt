is about 4.5 inches away to the right
you<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> CTS<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.460> one

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you will see that the CTS is about one

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.330 
you will see that the CTS is about one
to<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> half<00:01:12.570> inches<00:01:13.140> away<00:01:13.340> for

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.499 
the standard working distance model
where<00:01:25.740> 92<00:01:26.250> times<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> magnification<00:01:26.970> will

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
where 92 times the magnification will

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
where 92 times the magnification will
come<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.500> focus<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.430> zero

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
come in to focus when you are zero

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.109 
come in to focus when you are zero
working<00:01:30.270> distance<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.900> touching<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> object

are set at 80 times a magnification you
will<00:02:21.280> notice<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.910> longer<00:02:22.450> working

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870

distance model the L series is a little
bit<00:02:25.750> further<00:02:26.050> away<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.100> if<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.430> do<00:02:27.640> need<00:02:27.880> space

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
bit further away so if you do need space

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.630
