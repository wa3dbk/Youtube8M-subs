 You can choose anything you like 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.489
 everything from I just let the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.020
 Olive still makes extra many 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.220
 shopping news clear 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.680
 you know that capsaicin I know 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.260
 not at all if you are in cala pi news 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.299
 Crime in any case look nice 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.740
 the metabolism is stimulated 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.200
 olive I leave now in the fall away 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 so that I can address the fat ones 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.860
 I have to take care of the pants 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.490
 definitely recommend you instead of 2 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 once 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:36.520
 the suite rolling stones or the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.770
 bahamas animations- I will this 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.539
 choose 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.320
 yes and it was all I 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.539
 show later I'll show you 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.189
 then the nutrition table in like me 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:55.840
 gave exactly 1 fdp 1 and if it was 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.780
 I'll be great again 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.509
 part 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.429
 as you said you have to be careful with the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.019
 song selection here has my fat friend 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.920
 now made in mistake he just has 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.500
 the turtles are taken out of viscose because 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.110
 the then community has chilli sauce 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.090
 normal chili sauce has no 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 fat but this every capital away 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 has 43 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.660
 so in no case does she choose the woman 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.290
 they all have four times as many calories 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.340
 the other 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.200
 Now I'll show you as well as that gave 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.470
 It looks like I am here 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:42.150
 indicated four times on so I have 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.150
 now 700 calories 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.799
 then this whole thing has 13 grams of fat 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.299
 clearly because the front is now six 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.900
 gram but that's always half 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.510
 based 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.959
 there is still the sauce I have come 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.560
 me to 310 grams 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.560
 Now I'll show you 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.360
 as you enter the whole here then 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.959
 just the sandwich and has 550 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.599
 calorie 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:22.170
 that's exactly what you have to do that way 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:26.790
 specify fdp not find now this 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.680
 it is this ticket rest with bread 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.599
 and I have the trouble more times 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.530
 made and everything counted 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.950
 we just need 80 grams extra 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.160
 Add 400 calories to the sandwich 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.519
 more and then adjusts it by 50 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.980
 So calorie whose two servings is 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.310
 a portion is always half 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.609
 withdrawn 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.720
 that's why you get 50 again 150 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:02.489
 calorie premier says back again 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:06.269
 Here you see the whole one given 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:11.790
 I have the abba soloists with me 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:15.209
 her poppig times extra video on fdp then 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.120
 i can show you what i like here 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.609
 park tips and tricks i just go 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.019
 it that everything was saved when 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.039
 I just have to give it to the list 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.020
 still add 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.400
 then I do not need everything anymore 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.400
 select individual 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.150
 So people who are so what you want so 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.400
 what you often see 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.140
 I do not have any goals at all 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.590
 The tent's problem is not everything at all 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.590
 crooked 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.100
 So I can not remember 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.560
 when was the last time I was there but 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.150
 I think it can exist 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.330
 probably also a two products 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.130
 which one can choose the then 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.320
 Of course, that's just how it fits in well 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.320
 but it is 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:09.089
 just send me new items there such a thing 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.089
 see if through this video can has 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.580
 you already know that 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:25.979
 I think that clearly that is the core of 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.460
 interview forced me here 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:32.520
 he has not said anything about subway 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.560
 forced me to go is again 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.949
 something why did you now the fed so 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.009
 selected and I need you will 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.370
 load fat again so do not stop 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.690
 the weak head the interview you have 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.070
 probably already seen because of this 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.840
 video is then after the interview 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:54.150
 So people appear pure 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.979
 I am back again he has 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.590
 seen that were 13 grams for there 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.020
 Here you the number exactly as the 13 came 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.970
 ever come about 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.479
 that means the honey master at home two 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.750
 Serve together so five grams 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.750
 as if you were the tomb two and a half grams 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.620
 and that six-gram whole set became 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.199
 Tobe offered 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:24.300

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:27.659

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.250

 I see it almost the same way I do that 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.280
 really only if it really quite 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.740

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.510
