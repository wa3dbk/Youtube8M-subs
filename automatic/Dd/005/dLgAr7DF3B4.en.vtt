00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.220
 hey guys microphone zuber i 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.750
 I start a series of vidyashek where simple and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.869
 clearly tell you about some 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 the mechanics of our game and the first series 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.099
 let's talk about the system behind the track 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.500
 and the tower uses similar to potatoes 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 the system in the squad so which is built 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 on several parameters such as 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.739
 radius of view 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 stealth coefficient timing calculation 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.400
 visibility and availability of various 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 obstacles or vegetation between 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.760
 two tanks 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.769
 also in the game there are used 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.980
 those tools and skills that affect 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.410
 the light will go over the points radius 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.960
 review but radius it and in africa radius 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.040
 this is the maximum distance you tank 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.129
 which you can own 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.899
 to light the enemy if the pies are enemies 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.440
 and decided to equalize the maximum view on 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.809
 high low 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.149
 In general, the developers are flat here 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.250
 come up more flexible and radius of view 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.070
 varies greatly depending on 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.350
 cool characteristics of machines on the radius 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.610
 affects the perk of the commander who gives plus 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 10 percent reviews 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.820
 but not the fact that he is now also working 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.400
 two modules affect the viewing radius 1 this 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.020
 Improved sight pump this module 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.860
 which is on some tanks 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.320
 for example on t-62 t-64 bmp-2 leopard 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.320
 first sight increases visibility 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.350
 ten percent movement story 2 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.229
 module improves visibility is bnr device 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.240
 surveillance and intelligence dnr increase 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.100
 25 percent distance and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.550
 are pre-installed module 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.640
 some bb 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.680
 such as sweepfire was visit bmd-1 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.180
 bmd-2 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.860
 BNR in contrast to the splinter sight 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.090
 triggered only after a few 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.760
 seconds after stopping 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.900
 which is a nice bonus by and not earlier falls 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.570
 if you turn back 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.250
 tank left and right plus 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.810
 with light tools all now 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.520
 go to m masking coefficients 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.140
 the edges of the value that determines your 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.230
 ability to resist someone else 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.570
 lit up and go unnoticed this 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.640
 the coefficient varies from 500 akhun and 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.220
 taller and bigger about this up 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.590
 four tenths qbm 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.290
 the higher it is, the greater the number of topics 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.830
 more inconspicuous than the most easily detected 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.520
 the car 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.090
 this experiences me and arton go further and ted 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.520
 then lt and the most inconspicuous is just pb 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.920
 but this classification is somewhat 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.250
 conditional because the fork values ​​of the coefficient 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.020
 masking inside a class is very wide 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.660
 for example there is experience and coefficient 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.680
 masking only 5 acres and there are with whole 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.980
 17 acres 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.160
 which is three and a half times more 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.320
 too gadget their other eyes 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.450
 singing helps a lot if you 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.220
 are in the bushes enough 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.380
 mediocre if you're on the open 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.360
 terrain when fired your coefficient 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.910
 stealth tends to zero 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.580
 if you are in a circle with a trace 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.770
 another tank even if you are standing in 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.490
 bushes you will very likely light up and 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.710
 in rowing 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.600
 well, or at least the commander of coffee on 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.350
 Trousers dissolve as it is necessary to bring down 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.790
 position again I repeat the FFT even started 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.820
 shoot glow like new year 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.260
 light bulb if you're in the circle of someone else's light 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.730
 surely they will find you and note now 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.700
 let's talk different obstacles on 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.460
 line of sight these same obstacles in 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.370
 the form of building stone walls and other things with 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.580
 success blocking the view but if the building 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.980
 there is a hole or a window and the tank is opposite 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.830
 her work will be lit up circle 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.370
 detecting the enemy now the bushes and 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.920
 trees 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.860
 bushes properly perform their role 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.230
 perfectly disguise your pepelats sometimes he 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.990
 doesn't see ppm stuck in vegetation 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.390
 literally 50 and 70 meters naturally 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.040
 if i shoot but what about 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.680
 I have big trees 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.600
 doubts whether they really fulfill 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.720
 masking function also successfully 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.209
 cabbage I honestly do not remember but 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.459
 X-ray X-ray is here and in my 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.680
 look it work closer than potatoes 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.530
 not 50 meters on the meters in 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.260
 twenty to thirty 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.150
 The fourth component of the light system is 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.760
 counting visually on the server 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.350
 I certainly do not Wang but I dare to assume 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.680
 that visibility is calculated by 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.760
 dimensional points on the tower and the hull and 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.310
 processed by distance 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.870
 the closer the more often the farther away the less 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.760
 let's say at distances of 500 meters 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.130
 the system calculates the visibility of the tanks 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.520
 relative each other once a second a 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.650
 melee 5 10 1 second exactly 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.050
 so I noticed sometimes failures and 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.650
 strangeness in the light, but all this 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.080
 only my thoughts are not supported 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.300
 practical calculations and last on 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 Today the item is brownies grenade and 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.120
 ppm ability to label by color 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.010
 haze is an extremely useful thing allowing 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.919
 set out viewable 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.590
 curtain sector about 45 degrees in front 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.200
 tank when setting fumes you instantly 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.200
 and emphasize instantly disappears from 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.330
 review of those who disappeared from behind the smoke but 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.910
 There are also disadvantages to these grenades if you 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.770
 someone shines on the side or on top of that to whom 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.160
 does not interfere with the veil you stay 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.770
 illuminated and thought does not help you 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.260
 but also for a unique buyout and 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.570
 the backlight label is placed on someone else's equipment 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.720
 by pressing the hold button 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.360
 wheel alignment on for three seconds 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.100
 then about 15 seconds adversary 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.789
 receive maximum damage from all 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.830
 of sources 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.850
 and its masking coefficient takes 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.950
 minimum value 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.680
 I mean, you shine like a New Year 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.240
 lamp 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.550
 but you learned the main features 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.330
 armored systems reviews and masking 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.310
 warfare picture I repeat to you theses 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.940
 review the more the better with disguise 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.979
 also 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.650
 the greater the coefficient of masking those 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.020
 kosher bnr extremely powerful tool 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.139
 use it when 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.419
 can if you shoot being in 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.070
 enemy radius get ready 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.669
 golden little tungsten or 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.710
 cumulative jet and then how lucky 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.580
 bushes very well adds disguise 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.440
 but only when you do not shoot 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.210
 smoke grenades overhaul 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.460
 when it is necessary to disappear from the light of one 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.979
 directions but will not help if you are 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.110
 from immediately 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:37.990
 If you have a light mark, do not climb out of 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.349
 for your shelter to m is minimal and you immediately 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.030
 same shine well and that's all for all 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.639
 Thanks for attention 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.810
 video made for you zuber and go 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.810
 will still be interesting 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.760
 god and
