that's just a little tip for you if
you're<00:01:51.969> working<00:01:52.329> on<00:01:52.509> food<00:01:52.780> plots<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.439> put

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
you're working on food plots and you put

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.359 
you're working on food plots and you put
in<00:01:53.859> a<00:01:53.979> summer<00:01:54.340> forwards<00:01:54.939> like<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.329> soybeans<00:01:56.369> or

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
in a summer forwards like a soybeans or

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.669 
in a summer forwards like a soybeans or
some<00:01:57.700> other<00:01:57.850> kind<00:01:58.509> of<00:01:58.630> summer<00:01:58.840> spring<00:01:59.350> blend

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
some other kind of summer spring blend

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.969 
some other kind of summer spring blend
and<00:01:59.920> it's<00:02:00.399> been<00:02:00.639> hammered<00:02:01.090> by<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.240> deer<00:02:01.659> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and it's been hammered by the deer I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
and it's been hammered by the deer I
think<00:02:02.979> you're<00:02:03.100> better<00:02:03.249> off<00:02:03.369> making<00:02:03.729> the

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
think you're better off making the

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.510 
think you're better off making the
decision<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.509> replant<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.530> fall<00:02:06.369> blend

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
decision to replant a fall blend

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.960 
decision to replant a fall blend
it<00:02:08.360> does<00:02:08.569> take<00:02:08.840> more<00:02:08.869> work<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.619> more<00:02:10.550> effort

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
it does take more work and more effort

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.040 
it does take more work and more effort
but<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:12.140> results<00:02:12.620> can<00:02:12.739> really<00:02:13.069> pay<00:02:13.280> off<00:02:14.050> and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
but the results can really pay off and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.160 
but the results can really pay off and
I'm<00:02:15.290> hoping<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:16.819> have<00:02:17.090> some<00:02:17.330> great<00:02:17.540> encounters

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.680 
I'm hoping to have some great encounters
with<00:02:18.709> deer<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.090> hopefully<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.330> couple

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
with deer and hopefully get a couple
