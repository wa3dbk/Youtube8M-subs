guitar let's go come down to the the
different<00:02:49.360> sound<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.960> this<00:02:50.530> one<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.100> t100

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
different sound on this one the t100

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.300 
different sound on this one the t100
this<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.720> jump<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> series<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:53.800> watch

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
this is the jump in the series you watch

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.500 
this is the jump in the series you watch
the<00:02:54.550> video<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:54.910> covers<00:02:55.180> all<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
the video that covers all the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.900 
the video that covers all the
differences<00:02:56.020> between<00:02:56.200> these<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:56.790> look<00:02:57.790> at

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
differences between these but look at

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.790 
differences between these but look at
this<00:02:58.270> we<00:02:58.390> got<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.630> studio<00:02:58.930> lag<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.680> this

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
this we got the studio lag in it so this

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.790 
this we got the studio lag in it so this
is<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.980> second<00:03:00.459> level<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.030> preamp<00:03:02.050> in<00:03:02.140> and

the like sirs are there and there are
specific<00:03:04.570> proprietary<00:03:05.320> preamps<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.420> one

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630

thing<00:03:07.780> specific<00:03:08.230> about<00:03:08.320> this<00:03:08.530> one<00:03:08.730> we're

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
thing specific about this one we're

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.770 
thing specific about this one we're
gonna<00:03:09.820> cover<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.120> different<00:03:10.360> sounds<00:03:10.630> in<00:03:10.720> a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.470 
dummies pretty easy to use and those are
5<00:03:16.930> presets<00:03:17.500> specifically<00:03:18.190> made<00:03:18.400> we're<00:03:19.330> going

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
5 presets specifically made we're going

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.520 
5 presets specifically made we're going
to<00:03:19.540> go<00:03:19.600> through<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.870> different<00:03:20.140> ones<00:03:20.260> in<00:03:20.410> in

to go through the different ones in in

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.440 
to go through the different ones in in
just<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.800> second<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.220> then<00:03:21.280> 10<00:03:21.610> 10<00:03:21.880> tens<00:03:22.330> a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
just a second and then 10 10 tens a

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.449 
just a second and then 10 10 tens a
10-point<00:03:22.930> volume<00:03:23.200> here<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.500> let's<00:03:24.190> go<00:03:24.280> through

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
10-point volume here so let's go through

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.850 
10-point volume here so let's go through
and<00:03:24.610> listen<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.060> okay<00:03:25.239> so<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.200> natural

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
and listen to it okay so the natural

and listen to it okay so the natural
folks<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.400> boost<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.060> up<00:03:28.180> here<00:03:28.420> give<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> little

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
folks a boost it up here give a little

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.800 
folks a boost it up here give a little
make<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.260> sound<00:03:29.410> here<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.730> first<00:03:31.209> one<00:03:31.480> is

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
make it sound here so the first one is

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.670 
make it sound here so the first one is
in<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:31.989> kind<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.739> natural<00:03:33.459> folk<00:03:34.300> sound

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.069 

ever<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.159> equalizers<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:40.970> zero<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:41.959> it's

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
ever the equalizers on zero so it's

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.170 
ever the equalizers on zero so it's
pretty<00:03:42.260> much<00:03:42.379> it's<00:03:43.280> not<00:03:43.310> emphasizing<00:03:43.579> too

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
pretty much it's not emphasizing too

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.070 
pretty much it's not emphasizing too
much<00:03:44.299> anything

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.560 

and<00:03:47.260> then<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:47.800> go<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:47.980> number<00:03:48.340> two<00:03:48.570> okay

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
and then you go to number two okay

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.240 
and then you go to number two okay
number<00:03:49.870> two<00:03:50.080> what<00:03:50.230> does<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.350> do<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:51.040> is

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
number two what does that do this is

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.830 
number two what does that do this is
going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.550> more<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.000> bluesy<00:03:52.360> stuff<00:03:52.630> so

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
going to be more of the bluesy stuff so

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.120 
going to be more of the bluesy stuff so

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
we're going to have more of this kind of

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:04.230 
we're going to have more of this kind of
stuff<00:04:01.050> right<00:04:02.080> what's<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:02.860> three<00:04:03.100> got<00:04:03.280> free

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
stuff right what's the three got free

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.880 
stuff right what's the three got free
the<00:04:04.690> three<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.020> going<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.200> go<00:04:05.290> ahead<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.590> cut

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
the three is going to go ahead and cut

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.460 
the three is going to go ahead and cut
the<00:04:06.130> mid<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.700> mid<00:04:07.510> frequencies<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.290> can
