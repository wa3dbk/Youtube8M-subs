00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.520
 Hello, Kevin! 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.160
 Hello, how are you? 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.040
 well. 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.240
 Where are you going? 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.120
 Please go to Roland Garros Stadium 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.920
 Hello, Kevin! 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.440
 Kevin? 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.440
 Hello! Ah, hello! Are you ok? 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.400
 Are you ok? 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.120
 Fine thanks! I do not understand 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.680
 Where did this sound come from! 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.440
 I am a car! 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.600
 have you seen 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.880
 Talking car? 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.640
 I’ve seen a little bit of it. 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.640
 But you can say that without you. 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.640
 Thank you! 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.120
 You are very good. 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.600
 Kevin, you are 2.07 meters tall. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 right? That's right 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.120
 You feel tall 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.800
 What is the most inconvenient? 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.080
 I think 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.880
 The most inconvenient is to fly to Europe. 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.920
 8 hours flight 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.760
 I only slept for 20 minutes. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.360
 Very hard 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.440
 Hotel bed aspect 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.640
 I'm used to it 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.320
 In my car? 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.200
 Do you feel comfortable? 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.040
 Very comfortable, thank you! 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.960
 Is there a place for your legs? 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.080
 Yes, that’s good. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.080
 You are so tall 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 What is the biggest advantage? 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.200
 I think the biggest benefit is 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.080
 Concerts and tennis matches 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.040
 My vision is very good 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.360
 This is very helpful for my game. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.960
 But I don't think I am very tall. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 I feel it myself... Do you feel normal? 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.080
 I feel normal to myself. 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.440
 But when I see my photo 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.120
 I will realize that I am very good, maybe I am really tall. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.400
 You have a lot of serve 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.240
 Have you hurt others? 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.560
 No never 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.960
 Ah, I remember it wrong! Once there 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.400
 Memphis this year 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.800
 I played against Samuel Gross. 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.240
 He stood 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.040
 I have a little longer distance 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.120
 The ball spins for a while 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.520
 Then hit him 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.640
 Just hit the man's most sensitive place 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.800
 He squatted on the ground for 15 or 20 minutes. 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.040
 I still feel very guilty now. 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.680
 We will take this joke when we meet. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.160
 This is a more interesting accident 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400
 Should you give him a flower condolence? 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.240
 of course 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.760
 We have arrived 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.640
 Kevin 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.880
 Can you give me a hug? 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.240
 of course can 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.240
 Thank you for carrying me here! 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520
 Thank you for knowing you. 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.200
 me too
