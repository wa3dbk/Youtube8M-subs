and<00:01:26.880> maybe<00:01:27.210> asking<00:01:27.689> why<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.049> using<00:01:28.290> glass

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and maybe asking why now using glass

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.490 
and maybe asking why now using glass
panes<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.450> reason<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> deep<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
panes for this is the reason is deep the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.590 
panes for this is the reason is deep the
little<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.070> drops<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.670> stuck<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> little

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
little the drops get stuck on the little

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.100 
little the drops get stuck on the little
non<00:01:34.500> watery<00:01:35.040> side<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> glass<00:01:35.640> pane<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.360> some

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
non watery side of glass pane and some

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.649 
non watery side of glass pane and some
of<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.290> get<00:01:37.350> stuck<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.210> why<00:01:39.479> I'm

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
of them get stuck so that's why I'm

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.600

here it's quite easy to make what's turn
lever<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.270> its<00:02:43.780> original<00:02:44.140> tortilla<00:02:44.380> activates

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
lever on its original tortilla activates

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.090 
lever on its original tortilla activates
and<00:02:45.040> sends<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:46.480> rapid<00:02:46.870> pulses<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
and sends out really rapid pulses and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.010 
and sends out really rapid pulses and
yes<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.460> one<00:02:48.640> does<00:02:48.790> also<00:02:48.970> player<00:02:49.240> for<00:02:49.930> the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
yes this one does also player for the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
yes this one does also player for the
most<00:02:50.170> part<00:02:50.410> quite<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> few<00:02:51.460> eggs<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.770> fires

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
most part quite a few eggs but it fires

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.460 
most part quite a few eggs but it fires
them<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.610> little<00:02:54.910> furnace<00:02:55.660> they

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
them it's the little furnace they

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.229 
them it's the little furnace they
automatically<00:02:57.070> get<00:02:57.250> caught<00:02:57.490> on<00:02:57.640> player<00:02:57.940> and

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
automatically get caught on player and

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.330 
automatically get caught on player and
they<00:02:58.660> fall<00:02:58.900> fly<00:02:59.320> down<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.830> peacefully<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
they fall fly down and peacefully in the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.600 
they fall fly down and peacefully in the
canal<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.670> burn<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.430> hard
