analysis we are assuming that the parts
are<00:02:06.630> bonded<00:02:07.109> this<00:02:07.770> helps<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.250> simplify<00:02:08.489> the

deflection of 1.25 millimetres before we

deflected<00:02:47.280> only<00:02:47.609> 0.2<00:02:48.569> millimeters<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.769> it

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
deflected only 0.2 millimeters so it

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.440 
deflected only 0.2 millimeters so it
looks<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.220> we<00:02:50.519> could<00:02:50.700> work<00:02:50.910> with<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.180> thinner

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450

material<00:02:52.400> let's<00:02:53.400> run<00:02:53.609> another<00:02:53.730> study<00:02:54.269> with

material let's run another study with
thinner<00:02:54.810> material<00:02:55.440> since<00:02:56.250> most<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.280 
parameters we are using in our new study
are<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.160> same<00:02:59.370> as<00:02:59.519> in<00:02:59.639> the<00:02:59.730> first<00:02:59.880> one

SolidWorks<00:03:01.290> Simulation<00:03:01.530> lets<00:03:02.340> us<00:03:02.519> copy<00:03:02.790> it

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.550 

this<00:03:24.770> time<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.250> deflected<00:03:25.930> 1.14<00:03:26.930> millimeters

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
this time it deflected 1.14 millimeters

this time it deflected 1.14 millimeters
which<00:03:28.099> is<00:03:28.250> within<00:03:28.459> our<00:03:28.700> limit<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.660> we<00:03:29.780> can

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
which is within our limit so we can

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.360 
which is within our limit so we can
safely<00:03:30.230> use<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.500> thinner<00:03:30.980> material<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:34.250> have

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360
