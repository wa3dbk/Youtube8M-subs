00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.029
 Hi, I'm who, but in this episode of the series, 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.659
 Canoe puppies I learn everything about the proper way to feed 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.260
 your puppies including the correct portions and schedules today accompany me 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.700
 machin kilic one of the most famous experts in races of iu that groups that 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.659
 will help me with some details in which I'm not very clearly good with 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.909
 many details hello martín slopes over there the pleasure to see you is good to be 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.109
 here who thinks that it is the first thing I have to take into account when feeding my 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:51.970
 dog 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.690
 well I suppose the most important thing besides the quality of the food and that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.220
 on that occasion going is the size of your puppies of course the puppy of 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.689
 medium and large small breeds though of the users 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.220
 when should I feed and puppy 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.890
 people should feed their puppies when it's comfortable 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.909
 certain point 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.570
 they adapt to your schedules the dogs are very adaptable where possible I like 

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.619
 feed my puppies at the same time we eat early 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.909
 tomorrow night and probably during lunch pb adapt to your 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.820
 family to make three meals 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
 3com and exhorted them no doubt when I change that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.310
 the general depending on the dog around 4 months later you can 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.770
 start reducing salt two meals a day 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.770
 I prefer early in the morning and then at the end of the afternoon 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.890
 what happened if you have a big puppy huge babies fed as much 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.160
 continued 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.250
 1 depends on what you want to say comma followed by the little ones there 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.990
 feed them more times in other words yet but small of less than 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.840
 five kilos 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.979
 maybe if you want small amounts four or five times a day because your 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.740
 body can not with more and that compared to the size of the portions so how much 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.189
 the bigger the dog the bigger the portion 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.009
 look at the feeding table in dukan bag grape has a very good idea 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.060
 for the portions but there is one thing remember where it says 8 ounces is not weights 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.230
 they are pocho ounces in a house to measure it is easy enough to make that mistake 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.280
 the work now that is of the people who are changing from another brand there 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.929
 you place 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:29.400
 do it in stages it's easy to alter a puppy's stomach 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.970
 although many creators use in cannons unfortunately not all of them 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.770
 do I know that I have changed the food to a can to several puppies there is no 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.770
 that change at once has to be done in stages 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.400
 the first day to three quarters of the food the dog ate and a quarter 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.229
 of utan grape the second day half and half the third a quarter of the food 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.669
 from the creator and three quarters of utan grape and then the fourth day we are again 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.950
 on the way you would recommend dry food for the bundled I know that asked 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:02.149
 probably south that many times 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.139
 you suffer a lot of time 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.779
 I prefer dry foods I must say but khan grape well a food 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:13.239
 wonderful canning if it's hard to make the dog eat sometimes it took 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.569
 a spoonful ap a little sauce and mixed it something like that 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.839
 so the dog's teeth are coming out if the gums hurt or such 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.840
 once you have little water add the water in the sauce 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.940
 and it's sensational is very healthy for the picky is perfect 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.059
 last question important plastic dish 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:35.549
 stainless steel paco 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.010
 I must say that he used both put plastic and use stainless steel 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.990
 I use plastic floor when I travel using stainless steel at home 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.040
 the 0 days are easier to wash and clean that the main thing are more 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.529
 Lasting dogs can not chew so many 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.049
 fantastic dead and many phrases again with classmates and share your 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.099
 knowledge 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.839
 a pleasure when every car that was too much information to digest well 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.079
 that we summarize with the five stars of the lyric there was no on the 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.539
 feeding your puppy year to pedro but first I will feed the 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.449
 small Genoese 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.449
 hence in that role 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.969
 we talk too truth 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:22.009
 rule number one shoot an everything is about a routine feeding mothers to 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.759
 which has made me establish a meal schedule for your puppy and 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.729
 fulfill not every day 2 spain does 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.860
 feed your puppy three times a day for the first four months 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.889
 the correbous that the foods arturo saldaña

 3 today that when I change from the creative food of a never to carol steps 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.559
 little ones 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.559
 do it slowly over a period of four days 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.370
 there is a healthy diet for your puppy in the bag the canned food is 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.370
 well but it should be used strictly as a complement 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.939
 and 5 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.300
 nole of leftovers 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.009
