00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.800 

this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.080> matrix<00:00:04.759> access<00:00:05.759> from<00:00:06.299> Adria

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
this is the matrix access from Adria

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.049 
this is the matrix access from Adria
it's<00:00:07.290> one<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.560> four<00:00:07.859> models<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> Matrix

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
it's one of four models in the Matrix

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.879 
it's one of four models in the Matrix
range<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> smallest<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.410> all<00:00:10.500> four

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
range and this is a smallest of all four

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.249 
range and this is a smallest of all four
as<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.790> can<00:00:11.969> see<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.480> really<00:00:12.599> strange

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
as you can see it's a really strange

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.919 
as you can see it's a really strange
shape<00:00:13.769> from<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.219> angle<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:14.730> almost<00:00:14.940> cube

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
shape from this angle it's almost cube

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.140 
shape from this angle it's almost cube
shaped<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:17.250> fact<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.789> looks<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.119> though

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
shaped in fact it looks as though

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.429 
shaped in fact it looks as though
there's<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:18.510> not<00:00:18.720> very<00:00:18.750> much<00:00:18.930> room<00:00:19.289> inside

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
there's really not very much room inside

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.519 
there's really not very much room inside
at<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.150> but<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.240> you'll<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:22.050> surprised

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
at all but I think you'll be surprised

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.390 
at all but I think you'll be surprised
what<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> outside<00:00:24.359> though

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
what about the outside though

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.089 
what about the outside though
well<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:27.750> don't<00:00:27.869> often<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> garage<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
well you don't often see a garage in a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.730 
well you don't often see a garage in a
Motorhome<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.970> smaller<00:00:30.330> perhaps<00:00:30.590> garage<00:00:31.590> is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
Motorhome this smaller perhaps garage is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370 
Motorhome this smaller perhaps garage is
a<00:00:31.769> bit<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.309> an<00:00:32.430> exaggeration<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.570> might<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
a bit of an exaggeration you might get a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.930 
a bit of an exaggeration you might get a
couple<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.739> children's<00:00:35.190> bikes<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:35.760> but

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
couple of children's bikes in there but

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.479 
couple of children's bikes in there but
even<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.649> decent<00:00:37.980> sized

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
even so this is a really decent sized

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.830 
even so this is a really decent sized
space<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> small<00:00:40.170> motor<00:00:40.800> home<00:00:41.450> now<00:00:42.450> then

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
space for a small motor home now then

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.709 
space for a small motor home now then
adrià<00:00:43.800> refer<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.520> being<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.760> crossover

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
adrià refer to this as being a crossover

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.630 
adrià refer to this as being a crossover
and<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.320> mean<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.160> kind

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and what they mean is that it's a kind

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
and what they mean is that it's a kind
of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> combination<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> coach<00:00:49.469> built

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
of a combination of a coach built

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
of a combination of a coach built
motorhome<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:51.059> low<00:00:51.239> profile<00:00:51.930> motorhome

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
motorhome and a low profile motorhome

motorhome and a low profile motorhome
and<00:00:52.829> from<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> outside<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.510> say<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.750> looks<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and from the outside as I say it looks a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.970 
and from the outside as I say it looks a
bit<00:00:55.079> odd<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.190> sign<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:57.260> we<00:00:58.260> still<00:00:58.530> looks<00:00:58.739> odd

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
bit odd but sign on we still looks odd

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.020 
bit odd but sign on we still looks odd

it's always good let's go around this
side<00:01:15.530> gotcha<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.970> side

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
side gotcha right now on this side

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
side gotcha right now on this side
there's<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.659> awful<00:01:18.810> lot<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.560> there's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
there's not an awful lot to see there's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.090 
there's not an awful lot to see there's
a<00:01:19.770> big<00:01:20.270> tinted<00:01:21.270> window<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.890> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a big tinted window but look at this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.990 
a big tinted window but look at this
there<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.460> two<00:01:24.049> vents<00:01:25.159> Dometic<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.700> means

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there are two vents Dometic which means

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
they're big as well what's that about

quite<00:05:59.030> nimble<00:05:59.830> but<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:00.979> lightness<00:06:01.490> actually

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
quite nimble but the lightness actually

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.339 
quite nimble but the lightness actually
is<00:06:02.930> very<00:06:03.410> noticeable<00:06:03.740> in<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.819> steering<00:06:05.539> just

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
is very noticeable in the steering just

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.610 
is very noticeable in the steering just
the<00:06:06.530> slightest<00:06:07.840> fingertip<00:06:08.840> touch<00:06:09.169> and<00:06:09.470> we're

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
the slightest fingertip touch and we're

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.640 
the slightest fingertip touch and we're
veering<00:06:10.610> off<00:06:11.030> port<00:06:11.449> I<00:06:11.840> think<00:06:12.349> that<00:06:12.470> would

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
veering off port I think that would

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.360 
veering off port I think that would
change<00:06:12.680> once<00:06:13.250> we<00:06:13.400> had<00:06:13.580> some<00:06:14.050> stuff<00:06:15.050> on<00:06:15.919> board

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
change once we had some stuff on board

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.689 
change once we had some stuff on board
that<00:06:16.729> right<00:06:16.940> now<00:06:17.150> it's<00:06:17.360> so<00:06:17.720> light<00:06:18.340> it's<00:06:19.340> good

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
that right now it's so light it's good

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.890 
that right now it's so light it's good
but<00:06:20.060> it's<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.509> little<00:06:20.930> bit<00:06:21.050> disconcerting

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
but it's a little bit disconcerting

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.080 
but it's a little bit disconcerting
it's<00:06:23.900> very<00:06:24.169> nippy<00:06:24.470> and<00:06:25.430> because<00:06:25.699> it's<00:06:25.849> less

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
it's very nippy and because it's less

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.050 
it's very nippy and because it's less
