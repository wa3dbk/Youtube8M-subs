00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.360
 in this corner we have iPhone 6 at 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.949
 another side the samsung galaxy s 6 and for 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 last the beats are the same 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.960
 m9 the battle of high phones 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.790
 range has started what about friends the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.250
 they were greeting is giving movie regatta in 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.400
 Spanish and today we are going to compare these 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.430
 three badge phones let's start 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.530
 with the physical the one tm 9 is made of 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.570
 a single piece of aluminum with edges on 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.730
 another tone while the iphone has 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.550
 Aluminum at the back and glass at 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 front and samsung abandoned the plastic in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.559
 his galaxy s 6 and he covered it with glass 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
 metal edges the bad thing is that this 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.879
 glass gets dirty easily 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.339
 that metal seems to delight if it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.489
 Keeps it cleaner even if it scratches more 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.949
 fast and is the heaviest of the three the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 s6 is a bit lighter while 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 the iphone is the lightest and so they 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.549
 I count that in this category I 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.489
 they made it difficult because all three are 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.480
 good looking and they are already looking more and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 plus 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 on the deck and the bottom of the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 16 and the iphone are almost identical and so 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.060
 we put them to compete with the s 6 x then 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.250
 It would be another story but between the three 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 there is a definite winner but what is 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.990
 it's easy this competition is in the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.570
 screen and is that the s 6 is 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.790
 truly beautiful is the greatest 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.280
 of 5.1 inches and the one that better 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.080
 resolution has in quad hd of 1440 x 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.080
 2560 pixels in terms of the number of 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.200
 pixels is followed by one m 9 in full 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.060
 5 inch stick but it does not look so 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.420
 well lit like the iphone with 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 retina screen that comes to be 750 x 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.620
 thousand 334 pixels of 4.7 inches so 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.290
 let's continue with the functions and in this 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.780
 category is behind the one m 9 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.970
 because both the galaxy s 6 and the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.220
 iphone 6 come with fingerprint sensor 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.710
 digital to unlock the screen and 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.320
 confirm purchases the main camera 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.790
 of the one m 9 has the highest number of 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.849
 megapixels but the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.489
 6's frontal wins with 5 megapixels 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.829
 although these figures do not translate into 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.870
 better photos and you'll have to see our 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.900
 complete comparison of the cameras in 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.730
 cinema in Spanish and to finish let's see 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.519
 that the three of us bring 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.359
 phones the ix and xiv one m 9 and the 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.599
 galaxy s 6 come with android lollipop 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:39.239
 5.0 and their respective interfaces sense 7 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.750
 of hites and tot samsung suite while 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.459
 that the iphone 6 comes with ios 8 of apo and 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.500
 Well the winner depends on your 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.629
 personal preferences regarding the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.930
 operating system all three have 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.359
 ultra-fast 64-bit engines the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.260
 galaxy s 6 has a success of 8 cores 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.540
 and the one m 91 snapdragon 810 also from 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.700
 8 cores while the iphone has 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.159
 one chip to 8 the battery life 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.840
 it is also difficult to compare because 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.510
 It depends on many factors 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.639
 the stage and one in 9 surpasses it in 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.370
 about the number of milliamps now 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:18.270
 of the battery then the galaxy s follows 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.820
 6 and finally the iphone with 1810 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.970
 milliamps now but actually note 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.190
 that was the galaxy s 6 the most load 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.800
 had at the end of the day but in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.840
 storage the one m 9 wins the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.420
 competition since it is the only one with 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.270
 expandable memory the basic model of 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.940
 iphone 6 comes with just 16 gigabytes 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.500
 of internal storage and the s6 comes 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.690
 with 32 both reach up to 128 and for 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.450
 conclude there was no definitive winner in 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.920
 this round but maybe the s6 managed 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.930
 connect more hits 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.240
 remember that we have the analyzes 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.760
 complete of the three phones in theaters 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.760
 dotcom diagonal s until the next
