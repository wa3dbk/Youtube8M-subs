00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
podium here soon and and just work

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
podium here soon and and just work

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
towards a common goal of winning races

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
towards a common goal of winning races
and<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.530> by<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> end<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> season<00:01:11.130> will

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and think by the end of the season will

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.429 
and think by the end of the season will
be<00:01:11.520> good<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.540> noticed<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.049> think

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
be good something I noticed that I think

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.440 
be good something I noticed that I think
maybe<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.920> improve<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
maybe you can improve on it is that the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
maybe you can improve on it is that the
whole<00:01:16.350> shot<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> spike<00:01:16.920> hole<00:01:17.250> shot<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.580> paste

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
whole shot that spike hole shot or paste

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
whole shot that spike hole shot or paste
$1,500<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:19.590> extra

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
$1,500 if you get that that's an extra

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
$1,500 if you get that that's an extra
1500<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> would<00:01:21.299> help<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.659> as

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
1500 but I think that would help you as
far<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.170> knowing<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> pace<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.549> front
