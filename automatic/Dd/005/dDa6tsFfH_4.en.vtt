00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 - Hi, this is George again. And today with us Niko. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.949
 - Hello. 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.859
 Hi, Niko. Today we will talk about the means of 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.220
 hair care. Niko, let's talk about you. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.230
 I see that you have rather dry and damaged hair. 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.919
 What means do you use? 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.120
 - Basically shampoo and hair balm. 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.820
 - Good, because thanks to the balm, the hair is better combed, 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.579
 but in your case you need deep nutrition. For this 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.039
 we have several options. But first you need 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.399
 wash your hair Are you ready? 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.739
 - Yes. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.399
 - Here are 3 options. Their choice depends on how much 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.660
 you have time. If you're in a hurry, then great 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.710
 The solution will be an indelible SHINE BOOST spray gloss from SYOSS. 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.280
 It is very easy to use. 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.939
 Dry your hair with a towel. Then carefully 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.200
 spray it all over your head. Spray applicator finely sprays 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.710
 means so that you can be sure of its uniform 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.720
 hair distribution. And now we begin laying. 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.009
 We blow-dry our hair and get excellent nourishing care. 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.049
 - Want to try? 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:26.979
 - Yes. 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.560
 - Hold on. Just apply from root to tip. Do not worry. 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.920
 It will make your hair really silky. 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 For better distribution, comb the hair 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.229
 over the entire length. Now you can be sure of the beautiful 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.590
 hair nutrition. 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.229
 For more intense nutrition there is a wonderful 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.880
 option - a 2-minute mask. We just squeeze out the necessary 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.820
 quantity on hand and apply on hair, starting from the middle 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.950
 and to the ends of the hair. Do not put on the roots, because 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.289
 that it could make your hair heavier. Leave the mask 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.510
 for 2 minutes and then just wash it away. 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.070
 And for deep nutrition, we have a 1-minute regenerating 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.580
 mask. And that's how it should be applied. Take the necessary 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.610
 number of masks and put it from the middle to the tips 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.610
 hair, without affecting the roots, twist the hair up. 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.910
 Leave for 1 minute and then carefully wash large. 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.810
 amount of water. And one more tip. If you have 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.980
 there is a little more time you can leave the mask 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.610
 for 10 minutes. Then use a hairdryer. 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.920
 Heat will allow the nutritional ingredients to penetrate deep. 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.080
 in the hair. If you have dyed hair, for them there are special 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.350
 anti-hair coloring agents like Syoss Color Protect. 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.060
 I recommend using one mask, and preferably two. 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.590
 times a week. So now we are ready to wash off the mask. Wow 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.800
 what a terrific result. Your hair shines and looks 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.520
 well maintained 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.020
 - Yes, they are so soft. 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.870
 - Thank. Want more tips, see 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.140
