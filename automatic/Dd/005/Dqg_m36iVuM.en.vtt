00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
the area has been graded out down below

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.300 
the area has been graded out down below
now<00:02:22.660> they've<00:02:22.840> actually<00:02:23.019> got<00:02:23.380> some<00:02:23.799> usable

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
now they've actually got some usable

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.190 
now they've actually got some usable
space<00:02:24.459> some<00:02:24.910> useable<00:02:25.450> lawn<00:02:25.660> down<00:02:25.930> here

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
space some useable lawn down here

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.780 
space some useable lawn down here
that'll<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.530> mobile<00:02:26.980> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.339 

the<00:02:31.299> wall<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.689> considerably<00:02:32.260> more<00:02:32.470> upright

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
the wall is considerably more upright

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.960 
the wall is considerably more upright
then<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.500> last<00:02:35.680> one<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:35.950> saw<00:02:36.189> the<00:02:36.250> mesh

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
behind it of course that'll keep erosion

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.750 
behind it of course that'll keep erosion
from<00:02:41.019> happening<00:02:41.500> keep<00:02:42.189> plants<00:02:43.060> trees

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
from happening keep plants trees

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.100 
from happening keep plants trees
hopefully<00:02:45.760> chipmunks<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.689> wall<00:02:46.870> as

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110
