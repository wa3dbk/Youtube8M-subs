00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.430
 moin together so is not a direct one 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.680
 Test drive is the car of my brother 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.290
 But I did not want to withhold 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.759
 we can see vw scirocco their new 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.799
 Model was new a few years ago 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.360
 The very up-to-date 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.650
 version from 2013 and 2013 but yours and 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.020
 Daytime running lights already switched on 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.120
 we can hear this is 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.900
 Accordingly, nothing for me because of me 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.780
 have gasoline in the blood and here 18 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.910
 zÃ¶ller from vw ex works a sport version 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 it turbines style and look at ourselves times 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.079
 a little bit the interior at four 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.769
 frameless doors of course that's great 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.899
 hot 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.510
 you see how long this door alone 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.030
 So it's really strong when we are 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.710
 with the are also in the scirocco r no 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.379
 version in the sport version the same 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.339
 sit in this sports seats with teilleder in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.620
 this version 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.050
 and see here can also 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.030
 sport steering wheel what flattened below 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.870
 really cool there is really easy 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.090
 Feeling up and not much here 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.710
 Run 14,000 kilometers and big 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.850
 Navigation system live here with it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.630
 Also see here again 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.490
 I hope the map switched exactly 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.860
 radio was the media center 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 So here it is really not 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.660
 Saved on equipment and 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.280
 We can open our boot here and 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:32.550
 Look at it ten times 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.020
 closed exactly 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.500
 and luggage space makes the most it 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 thanks, we can not see sirokov 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.900
 but not the biggest trunk 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.000
 the smallest and therefore here so 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 pretty deep and therefore straight 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.960
 a big travel case in it 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.680
 and yes there is quite a few purely that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.150
 is already so far quite alright 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.560
 Let's do it despite these though 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.810
 is also a bit outbreak here 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.740
 Sound must also come out something 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740
 from the diesel engine 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.150
 then look and say that 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.820
 heart to the engine a bit 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.080
 Weird we can see here now 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.450
 have no automatic dampers here 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.130
 I should now here almost the lever 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.780
 Manually raise I have now but 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.820
 not the camera has to get one 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.070
 a little weird that here at this 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.170
 was saved 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:39.910
 otherwise here 140 ps diesel engine 2 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.650
 liter and is so nice a bit 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.880
 fun driving a bit is enough 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.880
 So dare
