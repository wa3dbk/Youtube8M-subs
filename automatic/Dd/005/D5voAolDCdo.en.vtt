it and then go back to the arrow and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.830 
it and then go back to the arrow and
that's<00:03:00.989> our<00:03:01.200> layer<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:02.370> half<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.910> screen<00:03:03.120> we

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
that's our layer to half the screen we

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.140 
that's our layer to half the screen we
want<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.050> change<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.410> opacity<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:05.340> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
want to change the opacity now to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.660 
want to change the opacity now to
whatever<00:03:06.750> looks<00:03:07.440> good<00:03:07.560> at<00:03:08.040> basically<00:03:08.430> on<00:03:08.640> the

whatever looks good at basically on the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.460 
whatever looks good at basically on the
screen<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.360> for<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.690> we're<00:03:10.050> going<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.230> select

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
screen so for this we're going to select

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.699 
screen so for this we're going to select
20<00:03:11.570> again<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.900> use<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.140> arrow<00:03:13.320> keys<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
20 again you can use the arrow keys to

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.860 
20 again you can use the arrow keys to
move<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.459> layer<00:03:14.760> up<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.270> down<00:03:15.420> as<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.750> can

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
move the layer up and down as you can

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.660 
move the layer up and down as you can
see<00:03:16.110> or<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.680> drag<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:16.980> up<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.489> down

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
see or you can just drag it up and down

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.490 
see or you can just drag it up and down
and<00:03:18.390> in<00:03:18.480> case<00:03:18.630> you've<00:03:18.840> kind<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.049> got<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> glass

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
and in case you've kind of got a glass

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.289 
and in case you've kind of got a glass
effect<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.160> make<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.730> stronger<00:03:21.120> glass

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
effect we can make this a stronger glass

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.780 
effect we can make this a stronger glass
effect<00:03:21.450> change<00:03:21.959> 30<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.430> go<00:03:23.519> that's<00:03:23.700> how

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
effect change 30 there you go that's how

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.270 
effect change 30 there you go that's how
glass<00:03:24.180> effect<00:03:24.450> reposition<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.500> how<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:26.040> like

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
glass effect reposition it how you like

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.800 
glass effect reposition it how you like
now<00:03:26.549> as<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.790> see<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.269> straight

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
now as you can see this is a straight

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.890 
now as you can see this is a straight
cut<00:03:28.590> glass<00:03:29.100> effect<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:30.360> can<00:03:30.510> change<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.870> a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
cut glass effect we can change it to a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.870 
cut glass effect we can change it to a
curved<00:03:31.230> glass<00:03:31.440> effect<00:03:31.709> all<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.400> need<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.580> do<00:03:32.760> is

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
curved glass effect all we need to do is

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.539 
curved glass effect all we need to do is
right<00:03:33.090> click<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.600> delete<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:34.410> layer<00:03:34.549> are
