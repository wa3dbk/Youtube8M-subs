00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.529
 today's issue of the theory of internal combustion engines is dedicated 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:24.009
 practice as i like to say practice 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:27.519
 criterion of truth engine BMW 1 ie 12 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:30.670
 and 5 head on which I repaired in 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.699
 the video will be in the description we have this 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.920
 assembled engine did 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:43.190
 passed 58,000 who do not 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.190
 then six months at the same time can be absent 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.940
 here's the oil poured my house my 40 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.940
 year-round fuel consumption 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.750
 by the participants 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.350
 and now we'll show it to bortovik 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.350
 passageway 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 practice 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.479
 send garibi to her masters in half 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.049
 engine passed last mode 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.369
 distance from Kaluga to the city of Kiev 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.119
 motor ran eight hundred thirty 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.119
 four kilometers 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:41.659
 does that mean we already have this lena 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.289
 so the average fuel consumption was 8 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.720
 liters per 100 kilometers is the route 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.950
 mode and plus half an hour in the city of Kiev is 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.520
 after repair another proof 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.179
 that engine 2 and 5 are 190 cases 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.299
 tire strength 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.220
 pathos and can fit quite 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.979
 acceptable fuel consumption drove without 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.390
 cruise control is always on manual mode 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:14.350
 here is the engine mileage 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.350
 that 18 thousand kilometers is common 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.000
 here is an example ok 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.650
 assembled and made engines all 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.180
 vehicle matching options 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.910
 which you just saw with 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.570
 BMW engine 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.020
 m50 b20 5 but this is an engine with hair 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.040
 so on the bill there is a video where i am 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.320
 did the head 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.270
 It is on this engine to the children themselves 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.300
 I came from the city of Kaluga 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.300
 Russian Federation, that 's me then 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.620
 someone wrote in the comments that a little 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.360
 is it worth it to go somewhere else 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.250
 country to make a head how well 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.620
 practice shows how you saw 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.900
 consumption but you drove more than 50,000 then 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.540
 there is up getting it turns out well i 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.350
 Of course I think that in Russia there is 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.570
 experts are ok who can 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.850
 make the head no worse 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.200
 I really didn't do anything 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.240
 supernatural i mean i just 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.680
 withstand factory requirements width 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.700
 chamfering installation clearance valve 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.620
 guides ie everything is normal 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.510
 itâ€™s a matter of airtightness 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.720
 the parameters here are nothing supernatural 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.630
 but the engine works exclusively 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.790
 okay okay by the way guys 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.320
 came to me here this year later 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.590
 roughly speaking, they brought me 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:43.810
 BMW M44 engine head on the same 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.320
 repair of what the video should be later 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.300
 also we want to make a video more 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.600
 in detail and I talked to the owner 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.040
 the car 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.660
 that is, we want to make a video more 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.400
 detail of this plan there are photos of 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.200
 he has how he engine was going and 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.000
 the thing is he will tell he should 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.459
 come and have more details he 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.959
 prepare to tell what he did 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.769
 that here is a good example of what 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.630
 fine 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.209
 made engines that is and his 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.790
 his system and fuel consumption are normal 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.859
 and oil he does not live that is, here I am 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.479
 just tired of me arguing a 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.310
 explain to people that is, they are with whom 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.470
 never arguing just here explaining 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.200
 what are the tanks and what bmw 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.130
 should eat butter bmw eat butter if 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.310
 they burned the engine that is 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.630
 no running there further afterburner great 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.300
 this oil is poured 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.340
 the bad thing that stuck the courses there yes 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.080
 there really will be oil consumption so 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.690
 engine oil flow 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.120
 should not have a normal engine that 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.510
 BMW that Lada the whole thing is how 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.630
 collected on this all thank you for 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.630
 Attention
