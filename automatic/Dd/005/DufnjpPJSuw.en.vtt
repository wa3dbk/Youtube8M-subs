hi<00:00:01.560> welcome<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.250> science<00:00:02.610> today<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.300> today

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hi welcome to science today and today

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.910 
hi welcome to science today and today
we're<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.959> be<00:00:04.140> learning<00:00:04.290> about<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
we're going to be learning about the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.460 
we're going to be learning about the
reactivity<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.700> metals<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.450> first<00:00:07.230> roller

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
reactivity of metals and first roller

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.680 
reactivity of metals and first roller
with<00:00:07.950> me<00:00:08.250> here<00:00:08.719> potassium<00:00:09.719> hydride<00:00:11.059> so<00:00:12.059> kind

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
with me here potassium hydride so kind

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.080 
with me here potassium hydride so kind
of<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> little<00:00:13.049> bit<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.410> yourself<00:00:13.820> well<00:00:15.230> well

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
of a little bit about yourself well well

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.810 
of a little bit about yourself well well
on<00:00:18.090> top<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.439> reactivity<00:00:20.100> series<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.490> metal

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
on top of the reactivity series of metal

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.160 
on top of the reactivity series of metal
which<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.390> believe<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.840> we're<00:00:21.990> testing

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
which I believe is what we're testing

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.550 
which I believe is what we're testing
today<00:00:24.289> quiet<00:00:25.289> joy<00:00:25.529> skiing<00:00:29.570> I'm<00:00:30.570> into<00:00:31.019> also<00:00:31.500> to

hobbies<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.739> third<00:00:35.219> watching<00:00:36.649> um<00:00:37.649> well<00:00:38.550> as

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
hobbies is third watching um well as

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.860 
hobbies is third watching um well as
much<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.739> me<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.920> myself<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> collect<00:00:42.000> over

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
much to me as myself and collect over

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.220 
much to me as myself and collect over
away<00:00:43.110> magazines<00:00:43.850> right<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:45.930> been

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
away magazines right and it has been

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
away magazines right and it has been
learned<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.860> reaction<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.700> quite

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
learned that your reaction can be quite

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
learned that your reaction can be quite
dangerous<00:00:48.329> really<00:00:49.079> oh<00:00:49.460> yeah<00:00:51.530> I<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.829> quite

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
dangerous really oh yeah I don't quite

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.840 
dangerous really oh yeah I don't quite
know<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:54.030> well<00:00:55.160> after<00:00:56.160> having<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.460> high<00:00:56.579> tree

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
know like well after having a high tree

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.299 
know like well after having a high tree
activity<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.230> sometimes<00:00:58.920> they're<00:00:59.129> quite

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
activity so sometimes they're quite

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
activity so sometimes they're quite
dangerous<00:00:59.579> in<00:01:00.090> fact<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:02.840> listen<00:01:03.840> like

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
dangerous in fact and just listen like

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.280 
dangerous in fact and just listen like
make<00:01:04.860> certain<00:01:05.220> things<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.110> quite

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
make certain things it can be quite

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.950 
make certain things it can be quite
reactive<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> basically<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.780> you're

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
reactive yeah so basically if you're

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
reactive yeah so basically if you're
going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.260> react<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
going to react will know about it you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.149 
going to react will know about it you
can<00:01:12.299> definitely<00:01:12.630> hear<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:13.439> earlier<00:01:13.920> we

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
can definitely hear it now earlier we

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340 
can definitely hear it now earlier we
tested<00:01:14.729> potassium's<00:01:15.330> reaction<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
tested potassium's reaction is here and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:44.620 
tested potassium's reaction is here and
this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.729> happened

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.120 

well<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.500> extensive

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
well that was a pretty extensive

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.270 
well that was a pretty extensive
reaction<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.060> from<00:01:48.270> calcium<00:01:49.040> next<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.250> we

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
reaction there from calcium next here we

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.140 
reaction there from calcium next here we
have<00:01:50.550> magnesium<00:01:51.260> magnesium<00:01:52.260> OMG<00:01:53.160> i<00:01:53.460> pray

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
have magnesium magnesium OMG i pray

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.620 
have magnesium magnesium OMG i pray
today<00:01:54.300> boy<00:01:54.570> practices<00:01:55.500> hey<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.060> dig<00:01:57.300> much

some<00:02:02.430> stuff<00:02:02.910> demon<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.720> reactivity<00:02:04.229> series

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
some stuff demon the reactivity series

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.859 
some stuff demon the reactivity series
so<00:02:04.800> to<00:02:05.400> hit<00:02:05.700> me<00:02:05.850> expecting<00:02:06.300> another<00:02:06.390> ordeal

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
so to hit me expecting another ordeal

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.120 
so to hit me expecting another ordeal
like<00:02:07.050> that<00:02:07.490> you're<00:02:08.490> quite<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.910> right<00:02:08.940> there

seen you at birth I mean they set off
taught<00:02:26.520> them<00:02:26.700> straight<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.300> cross<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
taught them straight out to cross the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.870 
taught them straight out to cross the
road<00:02:28.700> not<00:02:29.700> my<00:02:29.820> problem<00:02:30.620> okay<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.130> your

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
road not my problem okay so your

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.310 
road not my problem okay so your
reaction<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.630> not<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.140> see<00:02:34.290> a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
reaction it's not going to see a

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.920 
reaction it's not going to see a
scientist<00:02:35.070> attack<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.670> not<00:02:35.880> as<00:02:36.209> far<00:02:36.570> as<00:02:36.630> know

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
scientist attack you not as far as know

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.570 
scientist attack you not as far as know
it<00:02:38.269> that's<00:02:39.269> got<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:39.980> I'm<00:02:40.980> telling<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.489> you

it that's got like I'm telling that you
kind<00:02:41.820> of<00:02:41.910> things<00:02:42.980> located<00:02:43.980> yeah<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.120> am

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
kind of things located yeah I am

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.090 
kind of things located yeah I am
absolutely<00:02:46.290> totally<00:02:46.530> cut<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> scene

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
absolutely totally cut the scene

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.050 
absolutely totally cut the scene
chemistry<00:02:47.640> then<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.650> yes<00:02:49.830> sir<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.850> not<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
chemistry then but yes sir it's not a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
chemistry then but yes sir it's not a
violent<00:02:51.480> attack<00:02:51.690> him<00:02:52.440> though<00:02:53.180> okay<00:02:54.180> well<00:02:55.170> now

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
violent attack him though okay well now

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.259 
violent attack him though okay well now
we're<00:02:55.830> going<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.070> take<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.310> look<00:02:56.640> at<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
we're going to take a look at the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:11.090 
we're going to take a look at the
reactions<00:02:57.870> from<00:02:58.110> making

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.560 

when<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.250> spin<00:03:12.520> up<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.670> ringing<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.150> my<00:03:13.180> ears

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
when I spin up the ringing in my ears

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.080 
when I spin up the ringing in my ears
now<00:03:14.430> okay<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.540> thank<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.260> yeah<00:03:17.680> I

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
now okay so this is thank you yeah I

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.690 
now okay so this is thank you yeah I
think<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.450> would<00:03:20.410> think<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.680> little<00:03:21.130> bit<00:03:21.370> about

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
think I would think a little bit about

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.230 
think I would think a little bit about
the<00:03:22.030> metal<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.600> are<00:03:22.900> well<00:03:23.700> I'm<00:03:24.700> he's

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
the metal that you are well I'm he's

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.480 
the metal that you are well I'm he's
quite<00:03:25.450> frequently<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.410> be<00:03:26.740> made<00:03:26.920> into<00:03:27.130> the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
quite frequently to be made into the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.640 
quite frequently to be made into the
developed<00:03:28.000> as<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> flight<00:03:28.450> from<00:03:28.600> such<00:03:29.080> replica

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
developed as a flight from such replica

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.910 
developed as a flight from such replica
Burns's<00:03:30.130> air<00:03:30.550> rifles<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.380> little<00:03:32.650> ball

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
Burns's air rifles and the little ball

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.220 
Burns's air rifles and the little ball
bearing<00:03:33.310> pistols<00:03:33.790> them<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.510> fact<00:03:34.810> one<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.050> my

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
bearing pistols them in fact one of my

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.920 
bearing pistols them in fact one of my
favorite<00:03:35.770> pastimes<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.790> be<00:03:36.940> fired<00:03:37.660> out

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
favorite pastimes is to be fired out

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.810 
favorite pastimes is to be fired out
quite<00:03:38.640> rapidly<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.970> very<00:03:40.840> air<00:03:41.410> rifle<00:03:41.890> into<00:03:42.730> the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
quite rapidly a very air rifle into the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.340 
quite rapidly a very air rifle into the
head<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.270> little<00:03:43.900> innocent<00:03:44.680> animal<00:03:46.350> right

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
head of a little innocent animal right

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.729 
head of a little innocent animal right
very<00:03:48.130> interesting<00:03:48.640> view<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.000> offer<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.560> say

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
very interesting view you offer you say

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.670 
very interesting view you offer you say
you're<00:03:50.890> an<00:03:51.010> important<00:03:51.640> metal<00:03:52.030> well<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.750> wanted

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
you're an important metal well I wanted

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.160 
you're an important metal well I wanted
a<00:03:53.860> lesser<00:03:54.580> reactive<00:03:55.090> one<00:03:55.300> so<00:03:55.570> I<00:03:55.810> think<00:03:55.930> you're

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
a lesser reactive one so I think you're

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.440 
a lesser reactive one so I think you're
going<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.380> be<00:03:56.530> all<00:03:56.560> right<00:03:56.650> with<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.130> okay<00:03:58.060> well

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
going to be all right with you okay well

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:14.610 
going to be all right with you okay well
let's<00:03:58.780> see<00:03:59.050> how<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.320> goes<00:04:13.049> well<00:04:14.049> that<00:04:14.350> was<00:04:14.590> a

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
let's see how it goes well that was a

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.620 
let's see how it goes well that was a
slow<00:04:15.070> reaction<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:15.790> think<00:04:16.209> we<00:04:16.390> found

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
slow reaction but I think we found

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.349 
slow reaction but I think we found
someone<00:04:17.109> even<00:04:17.500> slower<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.250> their<00:04:18.519> gold<00:04:18.820> oh<00:04:19.150> I

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
someone even slower and their gold oh I

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.820 
someone even slower and their gold oh I
guess<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.109> am<00:04:20.680> gold<00:04:22.140> shall<00:04:23.140> we<00:04:23.169> take<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> look<00:04:23.710> at

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
guess I am gold shall we take a look at

00:04:23.830 --> 00:05:06.560 
guess I am gold shall we take a look at
your<00:04:23.979> reaction<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.700> think<00:04:25.180> we<00:04:25.270> should<00:04:25.300> yes<00:04:25.690> okay

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.879 

well<00:05:07.570> that<00:05:07.870> was<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.050> particularly<00:05:08.500> slow

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
well that was a particularly slow

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.980 
well that was a particularly slow
reaction<00:05:09.400> from<00:05:09.520> gold<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:10.360> that's<00:05:10.720> all<00:05:10.900> we

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
reaction from gold and that's all we

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.110 
reaction from gold and that's all we
have<00:05:11.110> time<00:05:11.320> for<00:05:11.380> on<00:05:11.650> site<00:05:12.010> today<00:05:12.460> I<00:05:12.669> hope

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
have time for on site today I hope

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.580 
have time for on site today I hope
you've<00:05:13.330> enjoyed<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.720> program<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.260> then<00:05:14.470> the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
you've enjoyed the program and then the

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.140 
you've enjoyed the program and then the
last<00:05:14.710> about<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.100> reactivity<00:05:15.700> of<00:05:15.730> metals

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
last about the reactivity of metals

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.010 
last about the reactivity of metals
until<00:05:16.810> next<00:05:16.990> time<00:05:17.260> see<00:05:17.830> ya
