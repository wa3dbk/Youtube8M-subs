Felipe Melo is a very very all-rounded
but<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> mean<00:01:51.299> 76<00:01:51.750> pace<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:52.200> I've<00:01:52.259> notice<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
but I mean 76 pace more I've notice the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
but I mean 76 pace more I've notice the
last<00:01:52.680> couple<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.979> days<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.939> gameplay

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
last couple of days and the gameplay

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700 
last couple of days and the gameplay
seems<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:54.899> slow<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.409> head<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
seems to be really slow like head to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
seems to be really slow like head to
head<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.340> cooks<00:01:56.759> maybe<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.299> boring

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
head so it cooks maybe a bit boring

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
head so it cooks maybe a bit boring
because<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.200> can't<00:01:58.530> play<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.799> football<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.219> want

Mexico<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.629> carlos<00:02:10.020> berlocq

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
Mexico as a I think it's carlos berlocq

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.020 
Mexico as a I think it's carlos berlocq
so<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.039> pretty<00:02:11.280> cool<00:02:11.459> little<00:02:11.610> fat
