and I have a lot of time in makeup and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
and I have a lot of time in makeup and
that's<00:00:38.130> sort<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.670> where<00:00:39.320> most<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.620> scar<00:00:41.550> starts

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that's sort of where most of scar starts

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.389 
that's sort of where most of scar starts
to<00:00:42.180> happen<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.899> face<00:00:43.170> disappears<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> as

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
to happen as my face disappears and as

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950 
to happen as my face disappears and as

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
soon as that permanent sneer appears

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.209 
soon as that permanent sneer appears
then<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.950> feel<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.430> I've<00:00:48.420> become<00:00:48.719> him<00:00:49.219> the

transformation<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.359> never<00:01:03.570> made<00:01:04.410> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
transformation and I never made the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.860 
transformation and I never made the
difference<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> sometimes<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.450> that

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
difference to you sometimes I think that

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.800 
difference to you sometimes I think that
scar<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.950> best<00:01:08.190> villain<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.000> he<00:01:09.630> has

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
scar is the best villain because he has

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.020 
scar is the best villain because he has
the<00:01:09.990> best<00:01:10.140> one-liners<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.550> think<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the best one-liners and I think that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
the best one-liners and I think that
probably<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.780> best<00:01:13.260> one-liner<00:01:13.740> he<00:01:13.890> has<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.370> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
probably the best one-liner he has is of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.390 
probably the best one-liner he has is of
