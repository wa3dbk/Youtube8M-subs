00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
way building codes are put together so

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.690 
way building codes are put together so
everybody<00:00:45.739> for<00:00:46.739> us<00:00:46.860> we're<00:00:47.100> kind<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.340> selfish

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to respond to it fires have changed

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.050 
to respond to it fires have changed
dramatically<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.810> unfortunately<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.820> fire

dramatically and unfortunately the fire

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.350 
dramatically and unfortunately the fire
services<00:01:27.689> steeped<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.170> tradition<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
tactics that were born out of the 70s

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.050 
tactics that were born out of the 70s
that<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.689> served<00:01:33.960> us<00:01:34.170> extremely<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:35.060> as

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that have served us extremely well as

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
that have served us extremely well as
far<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.780> ventilation<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.770> effects<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
far as ventilation the effects of

far as ventilation the effects of
ventilation<00:01:38.820> how<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.360> ventilate<00:01:39.810> when<00:01:40.170> we

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
ventilation how we ventilate when we

ventilation how we ventilate when we
ventilate<00:01:41.000> they<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.150> still<00:01:42.479> being<00:01:42.950> carried

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
ventilate they are still being carried

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.520 
ventilate they are still being carried
out<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.340> fire<00:01:44.549> ground<00:01:44.850> today

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
out on the fire ground today

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.450 
out on the fire ground today
unfortunately<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> environment<00:01:47.340> has

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
unfortunately the environment has

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.240 
unfortunately the environment has
changed<00:01:47.490> around<00:01:48.270> us<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:49.439> times<00:01:49.770> our

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
changed around us and at times our

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.539 
changed around us and at times our
tactics<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:52.020> assist<00:01:52.350> us<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
tactics don't assist us in the in the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.580 
tactics don't assist us in the in the
ways<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:53.909> they're<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
ways we think they're going to the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
ways we think they're going to the
challenge<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.549> still<00:01:56.820> working<00:01:57.000> right

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
challenge is is it still working right

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
challenge is is it still working right
if<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> environment<00:01:58.770> changes<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> rules

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
if the environment changes if the rules

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.219 
if the environment changes if the rules
of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> game<00:02:00.360> changes<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> built

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
of the game changes if the built

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
of the game changes if the built
environment<00:02:01.829> has<00:02:01.950> changed<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.490> much<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.030> we

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
environment has changed so much and we

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.580 
environment has changed so much and we
continue<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:03.899> things<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> way<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.560> always

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
continue to do things the way we always

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
continue to do things the way we always
did<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:05.939> we'll<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.240> ourselves<00:02:06.360> in

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
did it then we'll get ourselves in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.449 
did it then we'll get ourselves in
trouble<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.619> name<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> game<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
trouble the name of the game is to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.219 
trouble the name of the game is to
figure<00:02:08.700> out<00:02:08.789> when<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.270> old<00:02:09.539> stuff<00:02:09.959> still

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
figure out when that old stuff still

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.500 
figure out when that old stuff still
applies<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.009> when<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
applies and when it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.390 
applies and when it
and<00:02:12.019> you<00:02:12.140> need<00:02:12.319> data<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:12.980> able<00:02:13.129> to<00:02:13.220> make

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
things that we're doing with these tests

things that we're doing with these tests
are<00:02:33.760> proving<00:02:34.760> or<00:02:34.910> disproving<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.629> some<00:02:36.080> of

are proving or disproving that some of

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
those tactics were correct like for

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.880 
those tactics were correct like for
years<00:02:38.750> we've<00:02:38.989> taught<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.470> four<00:02:39.709> by<00:02:39.860> four

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
years we've taught that a four by four

years we've taught that a four by four
ventilation<00:02:40.790> hole<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.450> perfect<00:02:41.840> size

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
ventilation hole is the perfect size

ventilation hole is the perfect size
well<00:02:42.769> now<00:02:42.950> we're<00:02:43.190> trying<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.790> put<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.120> science

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
well now we're trying to put the science

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.080 
well now we're trying to put the science
to<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.019> determine<00:02:45.500> maybe<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.400> maybe

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
to that to determine maybe it is maybe

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.630 
to that to determine maybe it is maybe
the<00:02:47.629> information<00:02:48.260> was<00:02:48.410> correct<00:02:48.590> all<00:02:48.950> along<00:02:49.220> or

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
the information was correct all along or

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.089 
the information was correct all along or
maybe<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.239> only<00:02:50.470> applicable<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.739> certain

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
maybe it's only applicable in certain

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.670 
maybe it's only applicable in certain
situations<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.940> we<00:02:53.150> need<00:02:53.329> bigger<00:02:53.599> holes<00:02:53.870> for

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
situations and we need bigger holes for

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.150 
situations and we need bigger holes for
newer<00:02:55.430> fire<00:02:55.700> loads<00:02:56.030> or<00:02:56.359> what<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.750> so

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
newer fire loads or what have you so

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.369 
newer fire loads or what have you so
it's<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.670> proving<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.989> some<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.290> the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
it's it's proving that some of the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.780 
it's it's proving that some of the
things<00:03:00.590> we're<00:03:00.829> doing<00:03:00.859> is<00:03:01.250> correct

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
things we're doing is correct

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.339 
things we're doing is correct
and<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.150> also<00:03:02.329> giving<00:03:02.810> us<00:03:02.870> new<00:03:03.170> information

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
and it's also giving us new information

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.180 
and it's also giving us new information
to<00:03:04.040> expand<00:03:04.519> our<00:03:04.700> tactics<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.890> always

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
to expand our tactics you always

lessons I'm conveying today in the
classroom<00:03:18.049> without<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.919> information<00:03:19.180> my

classroom without this information my

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.030 
classroom without this information my
experience<00:03:20.900> didn't<00:03:21.290> teach<00:03:21.560> me<00:03:21.590> what<00:03:21.950> I'm

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
experience didn't teach me what I'm

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.349 
experience didn't teach me what I'm
learning<00:03:22.160> here<00:03:22.459> today<00:03:22.519> this<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> only

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
learning here today this is the only

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.569 
learning here today this is the only
place<00:03:23.569> I<00:03:23.720> can<00:03:23.780> learn<00:03:24.049> this<00:03:24.169> I<00:03:24.560> can't<00:03:25.400> go<00:03:25.519> to

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
place I can learn this I can't go to

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.759 
place I can learn this I can't go to
enough<00:03:25.849> fires<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.540> learn<00:03:26.720> this<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.109> just<00:03:27.440> can't

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
enough fires to learn this I just can't

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.099 
enough fires to learn this I just can't
and<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.910> if<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.090> don't<00:03:29.269> come<00:03:29.450> here<00:03:29.660> if<00:03:29.840> we<00:03:29.930> don't

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
and so if I don't come here if we don't

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.360 
and so if I don't come here if we don't
have<00:03:30.200> access<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:30.829> kind<00:03:30.889> of<00:03:31.099> information

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.309 
have access to this kind of information
we<00:03:32.120> don't<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.389> it<00:03:32.510> packaged<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.109> way<00:03:33.200> it's

we don't have it packaged the way it's

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.170 
we don't have it packaged the way it's
packaged<00:03:33.739> then<00:03:34.400> we<00:03:34.519> can't<00:03:34.760> we<00:03:34.849> can't<00:03:35.060> learn

knowledge<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.459> fire<00:04:19.669> service<00:04:20.060> benefits

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509 
knowledge but the fire service benefits

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.210 
knowledge but the fire service benefits
when<00:04:20.630> we<00:04:20.660> can<00:04:20.870> get<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.169> knowledge<00:04:21.620> out<00:04:21.799> to

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
when we can get that knowledge out to

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.980 
when we can get that knowledge out to
the<00:04:22.310> fire<00:04:22.520> service<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.720> think<00:04:23.930> an

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
the fire service and I think an

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.600 
the fire service and I think an
important<00:04:24.410> role<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:24.710> ul<00:04:25.070> has<00:04:25.250> done<00:04:25.490> is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
important role that ul has done is

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.540 
important role that ul has done is
creating<00:04:26.000> educational<00:04:26.750> pieces<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.280> UL

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
creating educational pieces on the UL

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.390 
creating educational pieces on the UL
website<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.360> our<00:04:29.509> fire<00:04:29.780> companies<00:04:30.289> can<00:04:30.889> go<00:04:31.070> and

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
website so our fire companies can go and

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.670 
website so our fire companies can go and
watch<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.240> at<00:04:32.360> their<00:04:32.479> own<00:04:32.630> pace<00:04:32.870> start<00:04:33.560> to

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
watch it at their own pace start to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.290 
watch it at their own pace start to
learn<00:04:33.860> what<00:04:34.070> their<00:04:34.220> work<00:04:34.370> environment<00:04:34.940> is<00:04:35.120> and

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
learn what their work environment is and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.210 
learn what their work environment is and
how<00:04:35.389> it's<00:04:35.539> going<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.750> perform<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:36.530> then<00:04:37.039> also

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
how it's going to perform and then also

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.379 
how it's going to perform and then also
they've<00:04:37.490> done<00:04:37.669> an<00:04:37.789> important<00:04:38.180> role<00:04:38.300> of

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
they've done an important role of

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.999 
they've done an important role of
getting<00:04:38.690> their<00:04:38.870> members<00:04:39.199> out<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.800> fire

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
getting their members out to the fire

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.779 
getting their members out to the fire
service<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.639> at<00:04:41.270> different<00:04:42.520> functions<00:04:43.520> to

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
deliver that message and deliver the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.920 
deliver that message and deliver the
data<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.669> they're<00:04:46.820> collecting<00:04:47.060> because

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
data that they're collecting because

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.170 
data that they're collecting because
we're<00:04:48.139> seeing<00:04:48.349> that<00:04:48.500> our<00:04:48.860> tactics<00:04:49.430> are<00:04:49.940> going

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
we're seeing that our tactics are going

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.089 
we're seeing that our tactics are going
to<00:04:50.240> have<00:04:50.419> to<00:04:50.570> change<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:51.710> we're<00:04:51.860> gonna<00:04:51.979> have

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
to have to change that we're gonna have

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.529 
to have to change that we're gonna have
to<00:04:52.190> make<00:04:52.340> informed<00:04:52.699> decisions<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:53.389> that

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
to make informed decisions and that

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.230 
to make informed decisions and that
information<00:04:53.930> has<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.530> come<00:04:54.740> from<00:04:55.400> data<00:04:55.729> dated

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
information has to come from data dated

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.180 
information has to come from data dated
it's<00:04:56.419> research<00:04:56.840> driven<00:04:57.199> and<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.740> think<00:04:57.979> that's

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
it's research driven and I think that's

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.080 
it's research driven and I think that's
going<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.430> make<00:04:58.490> our<00:04:58.849> members<00:05:00.699> they<00:05:01.699> give<00:05:01.940> them

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
going to make our members they give them

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.240 
going to make our members they give them
the<00:05:02.210> ability<00:05:02.570> to<00:05:02.599> make<00:05:02.690> good<00:05:03.620> decisions<00:05:03.650> on

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
the ability to make good decisions on

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.610 
the ability to make good decisions on
the<00:05:04.370> fire<00:05:04.580> ground
