well<00:01:57.840> across<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> coasters<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.130> hoping

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
well across the coasters I was hoping

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.550 
well across the coasters I was hoping
that<00:01:59.429> would<00:01:59.609> speed<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.659> Aquajet<00:02:01.049> goes<00:02:01.229> first

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that would speed but Aquajet goes first

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.849 
that would speed but Aquajet goes first
it<00:02:01.649> kicks<00:02:01.859> out<00:02:02.069> why<00:02:02.840> my<00:02:03.840> name<00:02:03.990> fails<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.649> this

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
it kicks out why my name fails at this

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.349 
it kicks out why my name fails at this
point<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.219> late<00:02:05.340> right<00:02:05.490> there's<00:02:05.969> nothing<00:02:06.149> I

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359

can<00:02:06.539> do<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.799> I'm<00:02:08.129> guessing<00:02:08.549> he's<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.910> got

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
can do so and I'm guessing he's just got

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.759 
can do so and I'm guessing he's just got
physical<00:02:09.690> attacks<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> send<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.649> my

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
that rocky helmet takes up a big chunk I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.020 
that rocky helmet takes up a big chunk I
think<00:02:28.049> that<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.349> really<00:02:29.040> unfair<00:02:29.489> though<00:02:29.760> I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
think that is really unfair though I

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.390 
think that is really unfair though I
don't<00:02:30.480> know<00:02:30.569> rocky<00:02:30.989> helmet<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.010> much<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.340> I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
don't know rocky helmet so much so I

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.160 
don't know rocky helmet so much so I
lose<00:02:32.610> my<00:02:33.360> Ferrothorn<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.879> into<00:02:36.120> he<00:02:36.989> goes

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
lose my Ferrothorn and I go into he goes

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.289 
lose my Ferrothorn and I go into he goes
into<00:02:37.349> his<00:02:37.560> early

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
into his early

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.640 
into his early
he's<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.329> greninja<00:02:39.720> which<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> really<00:02:40.470> big

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
he's a greninja which is a really big

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.530 
he's a greninja which is a really big
threat<00:02:40.980> actually<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.790> didn't<00:02:42.060> expect<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
threat actually I didn't expect it to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.289 
threat actually I didn't expect it to
outspeed<00:02:43.140> my<00:02:43.290> SP<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.769> but<00:02:44.340> obviously<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
outspeed my SP on but obviously it's a

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.050 
outspeed my SP on but obviously it's a
speed<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.079> special<00:02:46.470> attack<00:02:46.799> I've<00:02:47.069> completely

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
speed and special attack I've completely

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.300 
speed and special attack I've completely
set<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.290> he<00:02:49.530> does<00:02:49.709> dark<00:02:49.980> pulse

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
set so he does dark pulse

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.150 
set so he does dark pulse
and<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:51.030> managed<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.569> survive<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.410> think<00:02:52.829> my

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and I just managed to survive I think my

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.229 
and I just managed to survive I think my
SP<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.549> is<00:02:53.700> full<00:02:54.180> maxed<00:02:54.599> out<00:02:54.690> HP<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.500> speed<00:02:56.370> so

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
SP on is full maxed out HP on speed so

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.410 
SP on is full maxed out HP on speed so
my<00:02:57.870> experience<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.620> screen<00:02:59.579> set<00:02:59.879> so<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> get

I have a surface by E that recovers it

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.220 
I have a surface by E that recovers it
and<00:03:35.609> because<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.359> hidden<00:03:36.599> ability<00:03:36.989> of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
and because of the hidden ability of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.770 
and because of the hidden ability of
slurpuff<00:03:37.769> which<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.130> unburden<00:03:38.819> once<00:03:39.359> I<00:03:39.450> use<00:03:39.630> my

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
slurpuff which is unburden once I use my

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.750 
slurpuff which is unburden once I use my
item<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.349> basically<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.160> fastest<00:03:41.489> thing<00:03:41.639> out

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
item and basically the fastest thing out

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.640 
item and basically the fastest thing out
there<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.329> I'm<00:03:42.450> thinking<00:03:42.810> right<00:03:43.049> I've<00:03:43.380> got

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
there so I'm thinking right I've got

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.530 
there so I'm thinking right I've got
this<00:03:43.919> I<00:03:44.130> couldn't<00:03:44.669> just<00:03:44.730> take<00:03:45.030> him<00:03:45.180> out<00:03:45.269> but

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
this I couldn't just take him out but

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.770 
this I couldn't just take him out but
surprisingly<00:03:46.319> he<00:03:46.530> how<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.709> speeds<00:03:47.040> me<00:03:47.280> again

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
surprisingly he how it speeds me again

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.809 
surprisingly he how it speeds me again
so<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:49.169> have<00:03:49.560> no<00:03:49.709> idea<00:03:49.950> what

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
so I have no idea what

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.319 
so I have no idea what
but<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.329> just<00:03:52.189> managed<00:03:53.189> to<00:03:53.310> survive<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.730> hydro

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
but I just managed to survive a hydro

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.080 
but I just managed to survive a hydro
pump<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.840> start<00:03:55.109> by<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.319> pond<00:03:55.730> so<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.760> go<00:03:56.969> for

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
pump and start by the pond so I go for

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.259 
pump and start by the pond so I go for
the<00:03:57.180> play<00:03:57.329> Rosco<00:03:57.719> sees<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> dark<00:03:58.139> side<00:03:59.269> or

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
the play Rosco sees a dark side or

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.959 
the play Rosco sees a dark side or
whatever<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.930> thought<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.409> was<00:04:01.499> like<00:04:02.430> anyway

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
whatever I thought it was like anyway

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.959 
whatever I thought it was like anyway
goddamn<00:04:03.659> yeah<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.920> takes<00:04:05.189> him<00:04:05.430> out<00:04:05.519> completely

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:05.969 
goddamn yeah it takes him out completely

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.119 
goddamn yeah it takes him out completely
his<00:04:06.299> gang<00:04:06.540> go<00:04:06.689> is<00:04:06.840> actually<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.290> substitute<00:04:07.889> set

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
his gang go is actually a substitute set

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.979 
his gang go is actually a substitute set
so<00:04:08.310> if<00:04:08.430> he<00:04:08.549> said<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.790> was<00:04:08.969> Ganga<00:04:09.389> I<00:04:09.629> would<00:04:09.900> have

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
so if he said I was Ganga I would have

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.259 
so if he said I was Ganga I would have
been<00:04:10.079> screwed<00:04:10.349> completely<00:04:10.889> but<00:04:11.579> I'm<00:04:12.060> gonna

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
been screwed completely but I'm gonna

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.020 
been screwed completely but I'm gonna
run<00:04:12.659> through<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.079> Ganga<00:04:13.530> no<00:04:13.859> matter<00:04:14.069> of

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
run through that Ganga no matter of

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.270 
run through that Ganga no matter of
resistance<00:04:15.629> I<00:04:15.780> got<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.380> critical<00:04:19.190> but<00:04:20.190> at

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
resistance I got the critical but at

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.009 
resistance I got the critical but at
this<00:04:20.400> point<00:04:20.639> I<00:04:20.849> think<00:04:20.970> I've<00:04:21.449> got<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
this point I think I've got this in the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.490 
this point I think I've got this in the
bag

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
bag

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.339 
bag
senses<00:04:22.949> mandibles<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.490> that's<00:04:23.669> gonna<00:04:23.880> be

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
senses mandibles and that's gonna be

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.860 
senses mandibles and that's gonna be
incredibly<00:04:25.349> bulky<00:04:25.860> even<00:04:26.849> still<00:04:27.090> I<00:04:27.389> got<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
incredibly bulky even still I got the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.400 
incredibly bulky even still I got the
times<00:04:28.080> too<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.729> it's<00:04:29.729> gonna<00:04:29.940> take<00:04:30.599> now<00:04:31.380> I

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
times too and it's gonna take now I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.920 
times too and it's gonna take now I
didn't<00:04:31.770> realize<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:33.120> course<00:04:33.419> Toronto's

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
didn't realize and of course Toronto's

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.350 
didn't realize and of course Toronto's
ability<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:34.590> Sunstream<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.430> feat<00:04:35.820> sentence<00:04:36.210> out

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
ability is Sunstream a feat sentence out

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.140 
ability is Sunstream a feat sentence out
at<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.720> start<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.349> think<00:04:37.560> sandstorm<00:04:38.400> would've

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
at the start I think sandstorm would've

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.589 
at the start I think sandstorm would've
slowly<00:04:39.810> killed<00:04:40.320> me<00:04:40.880> but<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:41.910> don't<00:04:42.389> think<00:04:42.539> he

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
slowly killed me but I don't think he

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.700 
slowly killed me but I don't think he
realized<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.639> now<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:45.150> take<00:04:45.930> out<00:04:46.320> his<00:04:46.410> time

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
realized that now I take out his time

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.950 
realized that now I take out his time
easy<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.639> just<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.940> complete<00:04:48.360> sweep<00:04:48.720> I

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
easy and this is just a complete sweep I

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.600 
easy and this is just a complete sweep I
came<00:04:49.289> back<00:04:49.440> from<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.740> brink<00:04:49.949> and<00:04:50.190> I'm<00:04:50.310> just

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
came back from the brink and I'm just

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.920 
came back from the brink and I'm just
I'm<00:04:51.570> so<00:04:51.900> lucky<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:53.240> there<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.300> go<00:04:54.419> son<00:04:54.630> storm<00:04:54.870> I

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
I'm so lucky so there you go son storm I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.210 
I'm so lucky so there you go son storm I
think<00:04:55.139> with<00:04:55.259> two<00:04:55.440> or<00:04:55.590> three<00:04:55.770> more<00:04:55.919> hits<00:04:56.099> it

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
think with two or three more hits it

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.860 
think with two or three more hits it
would've<00:04:56.520> actually<00:04:56.789> kill<00:04:56.940> me<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.509> he<00:04:57.570> sends<00:04:57.780> us

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
would've actually kill me so he sends us

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.360 
would've actually kill me so he sends us
Garchomp<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.560> don't<00:04:58.800> know<00:04:58.860> if<00:04:58.919> it's<00:04:59.039> ability

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
Garchomp I don't know if it's ability

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.170 
Garchomp I don't know if it's ability
San<00:04:59.639> veil<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.210> boosters<00:05:00.750> evasive<00:05:01.110> Ness<00:05:02.180> so

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
San veil so boosters evasive Ness so

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.760 
San veil so boosters evasive Ness so
maybe<00:05:03.360> that's<00:05:03.570> why<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:03.780> send<00:05:04.139> out<00:05:04.259> a<00:05:04.289> second

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
maybe that's why you send out a second

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.219 
maybe that's why you send out a second
but<00:05:05.550> he<00:05:05.699> goes<00:05:05.880> into<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.180> mega<00:05:06.449> I<00:05:06.810> don't<00:05:07.139> know

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
but he goes into a mega I don't know

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.540 
but he goes into a mega I don't know
what<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.409> start<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.770> think<00:05:07.919> it<00:05:08.220> was

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
what to start so I think it was

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.210 
what to start so I think it was
incredibly<00:05:09.259> strong<00:05:10.259> this<00:05:10.680> guy<00:05:10.889> knew<00:05:11.070> what<00:05:11.099> he

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
incredibly strong this guy knew what he

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.969 
incredibly strong this guy knew what he
was<00:05:11.310> doing<00:05:11.550> but<00:05:11.970> even<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:13.110> can't<00:05:13.500> stand<00:05:13.740> a

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
was doing but even it can't stand a

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.149 
was doing but even it can't stand a
slope<00:05:14.490> us<00:05:14.699> pulling<00:05:15.539> up<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.990> that's<00:05:16.830> gonna<00:05:17.039> be

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
slope us pulling up and that's gonna be

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.839 
slope us pulling up and that's gonna be
the<00:05:17.190> game

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
the game

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.120 
the game
I<00:05:18.020> did<00:05:19.020> actually<00:05:19.169> fight<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:19.620> guy<00:05:19.830> again

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
I did actually fight this guy again

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.499 
I did actually fight this guy again
because<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.639> thought<00:05:20.820> he<00:05:20.970> just<00:05:21.030> wanted<00:05:21.389> to

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
because I thought he just wanted to

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.210 
because I thought he just wanted to
rematch<00:05:21.870> he<00:05:22.289> thought<00:05:22.530> he<00:05:22.620> could<00:05:22.830> do<00:05:23.009> better

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
rematch he thought he could do better

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.390 
rematch he thought he could do better
and<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:24.389> did<00:05:24.659> do<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.900> rematch<00:05:25.169> but<00:05:25.949> he<00:05:26.099> changed

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
and I did do the rematch but he changed

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.730 
and I did do the rematch but he changed
his<00:05:26.490> team<00:05:26.729> to<00:05:27.060> completely<00:05:27.870> counter<00:05:28.349> my<00:05:28.500> team

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
his team to completely counter my team

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.029 
his team to completely counter my team
so<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.610> did<00:05:30.120> get<00:05:30.300> me<00:05:30.479> by<00:05:30.690> him<00:05:30.930> but<00:05:31.229> I<00:05:31.530> thought<00:05:31.949> it

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
so I did get me by him but I thought it

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.439 
so I did get me by him but I thought it
was<00:05:32.130> just<00:05:32.220> very<00:05:32.370> much<00:05:32.639> I<00:05:32.940> thought<00:05:33.240> it<00:05:33.330> was<00:05:33.419> a

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
was just very much I thought it was a

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.510 
was just very much I thought it was a
bit<00:05:33.570> sly<00:05:33.840> on<00:05:34.020> him<00:05:34.139> changing<00:05:34.590> because<00:05:34.740> Pokemon

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
bit sly on him changing because Pokemon

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.249 
bit sly on him changing because Pokemon
is<00:05:35.699> all<00:05:35.880> about<00:05:36.090> look<00:05:36.389> really<00:05:36.780> who<00:05:37.080> you're<00:05:37.229> up

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
is all about look really who you're up

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.740 
is all about look really who you're up
against<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:37.889> where<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.430> attacks<00:05:38.849> hit<00:05:39.060> but<00:05:39.659> if
