is a how to contour video and I know

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.760 
is a how to contour video and I know
there's<00:00:18.480> hundreds<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.990> them<00:00:19.110> out<00:00:19.320> there<00:00:19.529> I'm

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
there's hundreds of them out there I'm

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.530 
there's hundreds of them out there I'm
obsessed<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.340> watching<00:00:20.700> all<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.270> them<00:00:21.419> I

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
obsessed with watching all of them I

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.479 
obsessed with watching all of them I
love<00:00:21.779> watching<00:00:21.989> the<00:00:22.290> transformation<00:00:22.950> but

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:23.489 
love watching the transformation but

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.100 
love watching the transformation but
sometimes<00:00:23.849> I<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.119> can't<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.809> technique

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
sometimes I just can't get the technique

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.990 
sometimes I just can't get the technique
down<00:00:25.169> because<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.950> just<00:00:26.189> way<00:00:26.520> too<00:00:26.550> elaborate

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
down because it's just way too elaborate

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.269 
down because it's just way too elaborate
so<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.899> is<00:00:28.020> my<00:00:28.200> rendition<00:00:28.559> of<00:00:28.919> how<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
contour it's a little bit more basic and

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.080

I'm<00:01:14.010> still<00:01:14.220> fairly<00:01:14.430> new<00:01:14.730> to<00:01:14.940> contouring<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.780> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I'm still fairly new to contouring so I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.360 
I'm still fairly new to contouring so I
haven't<00:01:16.020> quite<00:01:16.230> decided<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.040> creams

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
haven't quite decided if I like creams

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.220 
haven't quite decided if I like creams
or<00:01:17.550> shadows<00:01:17.910> but<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.630> definitely<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.200> think

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
or shadows but I definitely do think

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.010 
or shadows but I definitely do think
creams<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.190> more<00:01:20.670> natural<00:01:21.030> looking<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.540> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
creams are more natural looking and it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
creams are more natural looking and it
is<00:01:22.200> easier<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> maneuver<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.640> let's<00:01:23.850> get

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
is easier to maneuver so let's get

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.490 
is easier to maneuver so let's get
