Skinner with and if stop skinny you make

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.870 
Skinner with and if stop skinny you make

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
sure that the subject put 50% of his

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:38.540 
sure that the subject put 50% of his
weight<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.180> each<00:01:24.540> foot<00:01:35.360> always<00:01:37.490> keeping<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
weight on each foot always keeping the

00:01:38.550 --> 00:02:03.890 
weight on each foot always keeping the
foot<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.090> center

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:16.620 

always

ignore<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.080> little<00:02:18.550> dot<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.790> see<00:02:19.940> here

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.069 

that's<00:02:48.030> where<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.019> can<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:50.220> lighter<00:02:50.489> is

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
that's where you can see the lighter is

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.789 
that's where you can see the lighter is
is<00:02:52.079> useful<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:53.120> when<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.269> keep<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.799> we

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
is useful because when you keep this we

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.449 
is useful because when you keep this we
don't<00:02:56.010> know<00:02:56.250> later<00:02:56.549> how<00:02:56.939> much<00:02:57.269> our<00:02:57.900> minis

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
don't know later how much our minis

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.270 
don't know later how much our minis
millimeters<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.700> need<00:02:59.849> to<00:02:59.970> add<00:03:00.150> another<00:03:00.420> foot

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
millimeters we need to add another foot

millimeters we need to add another foot
in<00:03:02.280> order<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.700> reach<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.209> actual<00:03:03.720> food<00:03:03.930> size

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
in order to reach the actual food size

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:19.510 
in order to reach the actual food size
so<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.629> just<00:03:06.930> click<00:03:07.200> solid<00:03:07.560> pie

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
and sense automatically fill it to space

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.180 
and sense automatically fill it to space
under<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.400> foot<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.900> fit<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:30.830> if<00:03:31.040> I

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
under the foot and just fit so if I
