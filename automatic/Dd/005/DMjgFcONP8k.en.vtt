nice hopefully to get some aftermarket
rims<00:00:21.900> eventually<00:00:25.760> but<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
rims eventually but you can see if the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.189 
rims eventually but you can see if the
log<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.740> big<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> strong<00:00:29.660> 21<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.840> 18

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
log is just so big and strong 21 in 18

log is just so big and strong 21 in 18
inch<00:00:31.529> lug<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.130> this<00:00:35.130> part

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
inch lug and you can see that this part

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.100 
inch lug and you can see that this part
hasn't<00:00:35.730> even<00:00:35.940> hit<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> ground<00:00:36.540> yet<00:00:36.870> because

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
hasn't even hit the ground yet because

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.610 
hasn't even hit the ground yet because
it's<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> log<00:00:40.800> a'<00:00:40.829> sub<00:00:41.510> deep<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.780> thick

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it's so so the log a' sub deep and thick

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.270 
it's so so the log a' sub deep and thick
that<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.070> doesn't<00:00:44.460> even<00:00:44.570> doesn't<00:00:45.570> even<00:00:45.660> hit<00:00:49.280> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that it doesn't even doesn't even hit so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.209 
that it doesn't even doesn't even hit so
it's<00:00:50.610> they're<00:00:50.910> still<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.079> front<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.100> of

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
it's they're still at a the front so of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.340 
it's they're still at a the front so of
20<00:00:53.579> psi<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> rears<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.230> 22<00:00:55.710> psi<00:00:56.270> to

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
20 psi in the rears of 22 psi to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.939 
20 psi in the rears of 22 psi to
properly<00:00:58.350> seek<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> bead<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.199> beats<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
properly seek the bead so the beats the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.539 
properly seek the bead so the beats the
so<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:04.290> bead<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.979> permanently<00:01:05.250> be

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
so it's the bead can permanently be

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.530 
so it's the bead can permanently be
seated<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> doesn't<00:01:07.229> pop<00:01:07.530> off<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.310> speed

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
seated so it doesn't pop off at speed

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
seated so it doesn't pop off at speed
because<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.900> put<00:01:10.080> them<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.350> yesterday<00:01:10.830> so

the 27 inch model I txt ours runs 17 PSI
all<00:01:29.040> around<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:34.100> handling<00:01:36.439> handles<00:01:37.439> great

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
all around so handling handles great

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
all around so handling handles great
steers<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> lot<00:01:39.659> better<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.740> course<00:01:41.070> that's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
steers a lot better but of course that's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.100 
steers a lot better but of course that's
because<00:01:41.759> there's<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> lot<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> air<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
because there's a lot of air in them and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.410 
because there's a lot of air in them and
there's<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> rougher<00:01:44.130> ride<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.640> course<00:01:44.670> because

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
there's a rougher ride of course because

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.719 
there's a rougher ride of course because

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
won't properly be able to judge how it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:02.090 
won't properly be able to judge how it
rides<00:01:51.930> until<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:53.430> let<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> air<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:55.340> but<00:01:56.340> uh
