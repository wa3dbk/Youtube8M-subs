00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
than that the visuals were pretty much

than that the visuals were pretty much
all<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> environments<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.729> set

looking<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.580> we'll<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
looking now we'll go and go to the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.390 
looking now we'll go and go to the
gameplay<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> gameplay<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> very<00:01:28.979> simple

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
gameplay the gameplay is a very simple

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.830 
gameplay the gameplay is a very simple
to<00:01:29.460> understand<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.420> game<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to understand because in this game I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.469 
to understand because in this game I
would<00:01:31.110> say<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.680> more<00:01:31.950> along<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> lines<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
would say it's more along the lines of

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.140 
would say it's more along the lines of
dynasty<00:01:34.200> Warriors<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.950> instead<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.610> much<00:01:35.880> more

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
dynasty Warriors but instead a much more

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.210 
dynasty Warriors but instead a much more
simplistic<00:01:36.720> version<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.770> because

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
simplistic version of that because

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
simplistic version of that because
rather<00:01:38.460> than<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.909> hack<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.479> slash<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:40.110> you're

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
rather than a hack and slash here you're

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.469 
rather than a hack and slash here you're
gonna<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.680> leading<00:01:41.070> an<00:01:41.189> army<00:01:41.520> into<00:01:41.880> battle<00:01:41.909> in

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
gonna be leading an army into battle in

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.539 
gonna be leading an army into battle in
this<00:01:42.899> case<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.320> only<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> push<00:01:44.189> about

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
this case you only have to push about

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
this case you only have to push about
three<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.060> four<00:01:45.299> different<00:01:45.509> buttons<00:01:46.020> some<00:01:46.560> of

three to four different buttons some of

three to four different buttons some of
the<00:01:46.680> commands<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> basic<00:01:47.820> attack<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the commands are a basic attack and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.120 
the commands are a basic attack and
depending<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> unit<00:01:49.920> you're

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
depending on what you unit you're

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
depending on what you unit you're
controlling<00:01:50.579> gain<00:01:50.880> will<00:01:51.180> either<00:01:51.390> unleash<00:01:51.869> one

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
controlling gain will either unleash one

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
controlling gain will either unleash one
or<00:01:52.439> two<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> different<00:01:53.579> styles<00:01:54.030> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
or two of the different styles of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.120 
or two of the different styles of
attacks<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.590> example<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
attacks that have like for example the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
attacks that have like for example the
swordsmen<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:57.030> ability<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.630> kind<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
swordsmen have an ability to kind of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840 
swordsmen have an ability to kind of
increase<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.619> string<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.460> course<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
increase the string and of course have a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
increase the string and of course have a
nice<00:02:00.119> tackle<00:02:00.479> maneuver<00:02:01.049> which<00:02:01.200> could<00:02:01.380> easily

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
nice tackle maneuver which could easily

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.410 
nice tackle maneuver which could easily
eliminate<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.460> majority<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> peoples

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
eliminate the majority of the peoples

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149 
eliminate the majority of the peoples
than<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> army<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.409> pretty<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:04.799> what<00:02:05.040> this

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
than the army so pretty much what this

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.490 
than the army so pretty much what this
essentially<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.820> supposed<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
essentially is supposed to be is this

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100 
essentially is supposed to be is this
strategic<00:02:08.399> game<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:09.090> basically<00:02:09.690> you're<00:02:10.020> gonna

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
strategic game or basically you're gonna

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.750 
strategic game or basically you're gonna
have<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> bunch<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.950> different<00:02:11.310> styles<00:02:11.489> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
have a bunch of different styles of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.540 
have a bunch of different styles of
units

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
units

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.480 
units
swordsman<00:02:13.510> Mays<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.740> all<00:02:15.100> kinds<00:02:15.460> of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
swordsman Mays and all kinds of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.340 
swordsman Mays and all kinds of
different<00:02:15.850> units<00:02:16.120> within<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.600> game<00:02:16.810> we're

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
different units within the game we're

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.770 
different units within the game we're
depending<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:17.980> what<00:02:18.460> units<00:02:19.060> you're<00:02:19.300> going<00:02:19.600> up

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
depending on what units you're going up

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.600 
depending on what units you're going up
against<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.650> may<00:02:20.800> have<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.040> unit<00:02:21.490> that's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
against you may have a unit that's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
against you may have a unit that's
either<00:02:21.970> gonna<00:02:22.360> be<00:02:22.540> better<00:02:22.810> against<00:02:23.380> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
either gonna be better against the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.620 
either gonna be better against the
opposing<00:02:24.010> team<00:02:24.250> or<00:02:24.490> you<00:02:25.240> might<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.570> to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
opposing team or you might have to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.630 
opposing team or you might have to
switch<00:02:26.020> between<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.560> different<00:02:27.070> unit<00:02:27.340> to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
switch between a different unit to

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.240 
switch between a different unit to
conquer<00:02:28.240> or<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.720> counter-attack<00:02:29.440> against<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
conquer or to counter-attack against the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.070 
conquer or to counter-attack against the
opposing<00:02:30.850> unit<00:02:31.150> that's<00:02:31.270> coming<00:02:31.630> after<00:02:31.990> you

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
opposing unit that's coming after you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.470 
opposing unit that's coming after you
like<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:32.770> example<00:02:33.160> when<00:02:33.430> someone<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:34.240> leading

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
like for example when someone is leading

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.270 
like for example when someone is leading
a<00:02:34.750> horse<00:02:34.930> army<00:02:35.320> charge<00:02:35.560> at<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:35.920> if<00:02:36.130> you're

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
a horse army charge at you if you're

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.100 
a horse army charge at you if you're
using<00:02:36.310> sportsman<00:02:37.090> you're<00:02:37.510> basically<00:02:37.900> gonna

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
using sportsman you're basically gonna

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.810 
using sportsman you're basically gonna
have<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.500> disadvantage<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.430> therefore

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
have the disadvantage and therefore

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.100 
have the disadvantage and therefore
you're<00:02:39.970> gonna<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.390> switch<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.870> group

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
you're gonna have to switch to a group

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.850 
you're gonna have to switch to a group
of<00:02:41.200> spearmen

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
of spearmen

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.030 
of spearmen
in<00:02:41.920> order<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.520> counter<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.150> charge<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.740> here

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
in order to counter that charge but here

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800 
in order to counter that charge but here
I<00:02:45.070> found<00:02:45.400> all<00:02:45.730> these<00:02:45.910> strategy<00:02:46.420> outlets

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
I found all these strategy outlets

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.810 
I found all these strategy outlets
pretty<00:02:47.380> much<00:02:47.590> useless<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.580> game

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
pretty much useless for this game

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.270 
pretty much useless for this game
because<00:02:49.060> what<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.720> found<00:02:49.990> out<00:02:50.320> at<00:02:50.830> least<00:02:51.040> with

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
because what I found out at least with

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.460 
because what I found out at least with
my<00:02:51.550> playthrough<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.690> once<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.170> find<00:02:53.200> a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
my playthrough is that once you find a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.290 
my playthrough is that once you find a
particular<00:02:53.830> unit<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.240> you

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
particular unit that you like and you

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.020 
particular unit that you like and you
max<00:02:56.020> out<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.440> unit<00:02:56.680> pretty<00:02:57.160> much<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.550> unit

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
max out that unit pretty much that unit

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.620 
max out that unit pretty much that unit
is<00:02:58.590> able<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.770> counter-attack<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:01.120> pretty

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
is able to counter-attack and pretty

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.600 
is able to counter-attack and pretty
much<00:03:01.720> defeat<00:03:02.110> any<00:03:02.350> unit<00:03:02.860> in<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.130> game<00:03:03.160> doesn't

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
much defeat any unit in the game doesn't

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.580 
much defeat any unit in the game doesn't
matter<00:03:03.730> how<00:03:04.000> strong<00:03:04.420> or<00:03:04.690> even<00:03:05.080> if<00:03:05.260> you're<00:03:05.440> at<00:03:05.560> a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
matter how strong or even if you're at a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.530 
matter how strong or even if you're at a
disadvantage<00:03:05.880> pretty<00:03:06.880> much<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.210> stick

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
disadvantage pretty much if you stick

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.990 
disadvantage pretty much if you stick
with<00:03:07.720> one<00:03:07.990> particular<00:03:08.350> unit<00:03:09.070> then<00:03:09.640> that's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
with one particular unit then that's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.820 
with one particular unit then that's
pretty<00:03:10.240> much<00:03:10.420> how<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.660> need<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.080> do<00:03:11.290> but

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
pretty much how you need to do but

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.380 
pretty much how you need to do but
anyways<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.430> whole<00:03:12.460> concept<00:03:12.970> here<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.360> that

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
anyways the whole concept here is that

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.970 
anyways the whole concept here is that
you<00:03:13.720> have<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> bunch<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.260> different<00:03:14.380> units<00:03:14.830> in

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
you have a bunch of different units in

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.250 
you have a bunch of different units in
which<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:15.340> command<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.930> along<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.080> game

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
which you can command and along the game

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.350 
which you can command and along the game
you're<00:03:17.440> gonna<00:03:17.500> basically<00:03:17.739> be<00:03:18.040> going<00:03:19.030> over

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
you're gonna basically be going over

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.660 
you're gonna basically be going over
contracts<00:03:20.170> now<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.440> contracts<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.520> could

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
contracts now the contracts is you could

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.220 
contracts now the contracts is you could
either<00:03:21.790> be<00:03:22.090> going<00:03:22.390> for<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.630> England<00:03:23.080> or

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
either be going for the England or

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.650 
either be going for the England or
France<00:03:23.290> units<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.430> pretty<00:03:25.000> much<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.540> know

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
France units and pretty much you know

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.320

my remote is the same concept but here

my remote is the same concept but here
instead<00:04:28.370> of<00:04:28.430> fighting<00:04:28.819> against<00:04:29.300> one<00:04:29.479> another

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
instead of fighting against one another

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.779 
instead of fighting against one another
you<00:04:30.050> guys<00:04:30.259> are<00:04:30.530> aligned<00:04:30.830> together<00:04:31.039> to<00:04:31.610> fight

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
you guys are aligned together to fight

these<00:04:32.000> demons<00:04:32.479> dragons<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.199> monsters<00:04:33.259> that

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
these demons dragons and monsters that

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.980 
these demons dragons and monsters that
have<00:04:34.009> evaded<00:04:34.580> your<00:04:34.699> lad<00:04:34.910> which<00:04:35.419> overall<00:04:35.750> is<00:04:35.960> a

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
have evaded your lad which overall is a

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.689 
have evaded your lad which overall is a
pretty<00:04:36.289> cool<00:04:36.530> concept<00:04:36.770> but<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.430> doesn't

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
pretty cool concept but it doesn't

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:38.920 
pretty cool concept but it doesn't
really<00:04:37.849> make<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.150> much<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.569> a<00:04:38.750> big

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
really make that much of a big

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.230 
really make that much of a big
difference<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.680> my<00:04:40.099> recommendation<00:04:40.970> if<00:04:41.150> you

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
difference so my recommendation if you

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.790 
difference so my recommendation if you
do<00:04:41.419> pick<00:04:41.599> up<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.840> game<00:04:42.020> at<00:04:42.289> least<00:04:42.319> play<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
do pick up the game at least play the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.439 
do pick up the game at least play the
nightmare<00:04:43.190> mode<00:04:43.340> because<00:04:44.000> it's<00:04:44.150> definitely

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
nightmare mode because it's definitely

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.700 
nightmare mode because it's definitely
gonna<00:04:44.599> kind<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.960> give<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.199> that<00:04:45.259> whole

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
gonna kind of give you that whole

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.650 
gonna kind of give you that whole
fantasy<00:04:46.220> portion<00:04:46.910> of<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.150> game<00:04:47.300> which<00:04:47.509> I

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
fantasy portion of the game which I

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.600 
fantasy portion of the game which I
thought<00:04:47.840> was<00:04:48.020> pretty<00:04:48.199> well<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:49.009> very<00:04:49.220> much<00:04:49.400> in

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
thought was pretty well but very much in

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.390 
thought was pretty well but very much in
the<00:04:49.910> end<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.240> combat<00:04:50.660> portion<00:04:51.319> is<00:04:51.470> basically

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
the end the combat portion is basically

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.969 
the end the combat portion is basically
a<00:04:52.520> simplistic<00:04:53.330> version<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:54.020> dynasty<00:04:54.680> warriors

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
a simplistic version of dynasty warriors

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.120 
a simplistic version of dynasty warriors
altogether<00:04:55.810> now<00:04:56.810> as<00:04:56.990> for<00:04:57.139> the<00:04:57.319> sound<00:04:57.590> portion

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
altogether now as for the sound portion

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.800 
altogether now as for the sound portion
of<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.460> game<00:04:58.669> I<00:04:58.849> did<00:04:59.060> find<00:04:59.449> that<00:04:59.599> the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
of the game I did find that the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.360 
of the game I did find that the
soundtrack<00:05:00.319> for<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.620> game<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:01.009> it<00:05:01.099> has<00:05:01.220> to

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
soundtrack for the game that it has to

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.740 
soundtrack for the game that it has to
offer<00:05:01.550> was<00:05:01.849> actually<00:05:02.240> pretty<00:05:02.479> good

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
offer was actually pretty good

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.270 
offer was actually pretty good
especially<00:05:03.110> when<00:05:03.500> you're<00:05:03.680> leading<00:05:03.919> an<00:05:04.159> army

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
especially when you're leading an army

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.999 
especially when you're leading an army
into<00:05:04.819> battle<00:05:05.300> or<00:05:05.419> following<00:05:06.289> some<00:05:06.530> units<00:05:06.860> or

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
into battle or following some units or

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.950 
into battle or following some units or
laying<00:05:07.220> ambushes<00:05:07.819> I<00:05:07.849> feel<00:05:08.150> like<00:05:08.389> just<00:05:08.690> any

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
laying ambushes I feel like just any

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.140 
laying ambushes I feel like just any
moment<00:05:09.500> in<00:05:09.620> time<00:05:09.650> as<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.220> was<00:05:10.460> playing<00:05:10.789> the<00:05:10.970> game

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
moment in time as I was playing the game

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.930 
moment in time as I was playing the game
the<00:05:11.659> music<00:05:12.110> definitely<00:05:12.349> fit<00:05:12.919> the<00:05:12.949> tone<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.819> I

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
the music definitely fit the tone and I

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.089 
the music definitely fit the tone and I
quite<00:05:14.300> enjoyed<00:05:14.659> it<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:15.020> much<00:05:15.259> now<00:05:15.740> there<00:05:15.949> isn't

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
quite enjoyed it so much now there isn't

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.100 
quite enjoyed it so much now there isn't
really<00:05:16.490> much<00:05:16.639> of<00:05:16.699> any<00:05:17.000> voice<00:05:17.300> acting<00:05:17.840> just

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
really much of any voice acting just

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.990 
really much of any voice acting just
every<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.680> often<00:05:18.889> there<00:05:19.280> might<00:05:19.430> be<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.639> cutscene

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
every so often there might be a cutscene

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.490 
every so often there might be a cutscene
depending<00:05:20.630> on<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.840> faction<00:05:21.259> that<00:05:21.289> you're

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
depending on the faction that you're

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.860 
depending on the faction that you're
fighting<00:05:21.889> for<00:05:22.190> but<00:05:22.849> the<00:05:23.150> voice<00:05:23.389> for<00:05:23.659> goal

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
fighting for but the voice for goal

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.899 
fighting for but the voice for goal
overall<00:05:24.560> was<00:05:24.949> pretty<00:05:24.979> much<00:05:25.400> all<00:05:25.669> right

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
overall was pretty much all right

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:27.610 
overall was pretty much all right
there's<00:05:26.150> nothing<00:05:26.330> too<00:05:26.720> special<00:05:26.990> going<00:05:27.409> along

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
there's nothing too special going along

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.290 
there's nothing too special going along
there<00:05:27.889> and<00:05:28.099> of<00:05:28.460> course<00:05:28.699> when<00:05:28.849> you<00:05:28.940> create<00:05:29.240> your

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
there and of course when you create your

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.969 
there and of course when you create your
custom<00:05:29.719> character<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:30.289> can<00:05:30.469> choose<00:05:30.710> how<00:05:30.919> you

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
custom character you can choose how you

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.709 
custom character you can choose how you
want<00:05:31.190> your<00:05:31.340> voice<00:05:31.520> maybe<00:05:31.880> one<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.270> little<00:05:32.509> bit

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
want your voice maybe one a little bit

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.320 
want your voice maybe one a little bit
more<00:05:32.990> of<00:05:33.259> a<00:05:33.500> lower<00:05:33.800> voice<00:05:34.070> or<00:05:34.639> maybe<00:05:34.880> you<00:05:35.120> want

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
more of a lower voice or maybe you want

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.899 
more of a lower voice or maybe you want
more<00:05:35.570> of<00:05:35.599> an<00:05:35.870> heroic<00:05:36.469> voice<00:05:36.680> as<00:05:36.949> you<00:05:37.310> command

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
more of an heroic voice as you command

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.149 
more of an heroic voice as you command
your<00:05:38.000> units<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:38.630> place<00:05:39.259> different<00:05:39.500> orders

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
your units and place different orders

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.640 
your units and place different orders
but<00:05:40.610> overall<00:05:40.909> the<00:05:41.389> soundtrack<00:05:42.110> is<00:05:42.259> definitely

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
but overall the soundtrack is definitely

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.110 
but overall the soundtrack is definitely
the<00:05:42.770> main<00:05:42.889> highlight<00:05:43.400> in<00:05:43.490> terms<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.849> the<00:05:43.940> sound

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
the main highlight in terms of the sound

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.810 
the main highlight in terms of the sound
portion<00:05:44.690> now<00:05:45.349> as<00:05:45.560> for<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.830> lifespan<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.610> me

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
portion now as for the lifespan to me

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.640 
portion now as for the lifespan to me
the<00:05:47.030> game<00:05:47.240> is<00:05:47.449> pretty<00:05:47.659> much<00:05:47.810> at<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.349> halfway

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
the game is pretty much at the halfway

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.490 
the game is pretty much at the halfway
point<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:49.639> the<00:05:49.699> single-player<00:05:50.240> aspect<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:51.229> is

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
point for the single-player aspect it is

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.559 
point for the single-player aspect it is
pretty<00:05:51.800> much<00:05:51.919> enjoyable<00:05:52.460> though<00:05:52.789> at<00:05:53.030> times<00:05:53.060> it

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
pretty much enjoyable though at times it

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.110 
pretty much enjoyable though at times it
gets<00:05:53.659> extremely<00:05:54.349> repetitive<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:55.159> as<00:05:55.699> for<00:05:56.030> the

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
gets extremely repetitive and as for the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.360 
gets extremely repetitive and as for the
other<00:05:56.300> half<00:05:56.630> since<00:05:57.169> I've<00:05:57.560> been<00:05:57.800> unable<00:05:58.159> to

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
other half since I've been unable to

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.100 
other half since I've been unable to
connect<00:05:58.849> to<00:05:59.000> the<00:05:59.120> online<00:05:59.300> portion<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.990> the

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
connect to the online portion of the

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.409 
connect to the online portion of the
game<00:06:00.319> I<00:06:00.590> can't<00:06:01.190> judge<00:06:01.490> whether<00:06:01.789> or<00:06:01.969> not<00:06:02.090> that

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
game I can't judge whether or not that

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.570 
game I can't judge whether or not that
the<00:06:02.599> addition<00:06:03.229> of<00:06:03.319> the<00:06:03.469> online<00:06:03.800> functions<00:06:04.400> is

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
the addition of the online functions is

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.010 
the addition of the online functions is
going<00:06:04.849> to<00:06:04.969> definitely<00:06:05.180> increase<00:06:05.810> the

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
going to definitely increase the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.680 
going to definitely increase the
lifespan<00:06:06.259> or<00:06:06.770> decrease<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.789> but<00:06:08.240> if<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:08.539> are

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
lifespan or decrease it but if you are

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.749 
lifespan or decrease it but if you are
able<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.139> connect<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:09.919> online<00:06:10.250> portion<00:06:10.550> of

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
able to connect to the online portion of

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.339 
able to connect to the online portion of
the<00:06:10.880> game<00:06:11.120> you<00:06:11.300> do<00:06:11.449> have<00:06:11.719> some<00:06:11.930> cooperative

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
the game you do have some cooperative

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.800 
the game you do have some cooperative
options<00:06:12.949> and<00:06:13.190> I<00:06:13.490> believe<00:06:13.789> also<00:06:14.030> a<00:06:14.180> versus<00:06:14.780> mode

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
options and I believe also a versus mode

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.570 
options and I believe also a versus mode
that<00:06:15.229> which<00:06:15.469> can't<00:06:15.770> easily<00:06:16.069> increase

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
that which can't easily increase

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.700 
that which can't easily increase
lifespan<00:06:16.849> but<00:06:17.569> as<00:06:17.719> it<00:06:17.900> stands<00:06:18.229> the<00:06:18.409> online
