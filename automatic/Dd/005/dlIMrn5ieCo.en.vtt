00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
little feeling I'm they're not that's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
little feeling I'm they're not that's
not<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> game<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.200> it
