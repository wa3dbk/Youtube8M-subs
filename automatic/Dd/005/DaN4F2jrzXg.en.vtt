00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
in a very very tight space here in my

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.849 
in a very very tight space here in my
garage<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.140> actually<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.590> other

garage but I do actually have other

garage but I do actually have other
spaces<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.579> are<00:01:02.640> lower<00:01:02.820> levels<00:01:03.180> so

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
spaces but there are lower levels so

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.910 
spaces but there are lower levels so
it's<00:01:03.600> easier<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.049> me<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> park<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> car<00:01:04.890> here

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it's easier for me to park the car here

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
it's easier for me to park the car here
in<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.850> narrow<00:01:06.119> gap<00:01:06.360> than<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.780> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
in this narrow gap than it would be to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
in this narrow gap than it would be to
take<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> fold<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
take it down I just have to fold in the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.710 
take it down I just have to fold in the
mirrors<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.119> careful<00:01:09.479> when<00:01:09.630> I'm

this<00:01:26.390> loud<00:01:26.719> start<00:01:27.289> from<00:01:27.439> a<00:01:27.500> sequence<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.520> I'm

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
this loud start from a sequence so I'm

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.580 
this loud start from a sequence so I'm
going<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.880> start<00:01:29.209> my<00:01:29.390> public<00:01:29.750> camera<00:01:30.109> on<00:01:30.469> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
going to start my public camera on the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.069 
going to start my public camera on the
outside<00:01:30.740> here<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:31.520> we<00:01:31.729> can<00:01:31.880> hear<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.149> I<00:01:32.420> have<00:01:33.049> a

outside here so we can hear it I have a

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.749 
outside here so we can hear it I have a
reversing<00:01:33.679> camera<00:01:34.039> so<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:34.189> can<00:01:34.280> very<00:01:34.549> safely

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
lift it up I do find it quite funny how

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.510 
lift it up I do find it quite funny how
it<00:01:44.539> opens<00:01:44.869> conveniently<00:01:45.679> with<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.340> pillar

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it opens conveniently with the pillar

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.089 
it opens conveniently with the pillar
right<00:01:46.789> there<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:47.780> step<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.170> over<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.739> carbon

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:49.099 
right there we step in over the carbon

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.300 
right there we step in over the carbon
side<00:01:49.369> sill<00:01:50.469> easier<00:01:51.469> to<00:01:51.619> do<00:01:51.739> that<00:01:51.860> people<00:01:52.039> think

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
side sill easier to do that people think

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.569 
side sill easier to do that people think
it<00:01:52.459> is<00:01:52.599> we've<00:01:53.599> got<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.810> 650s<00:01:54.439> logo<00:01:55.009> now<00:01:55.520> the

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
it is we've got a 650s logo now the

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.580 
it is we've got a 650s logo now the
fairness<00:01:56.329> I'm<00:01:56.539> gonna<00:01:56.689> close<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.170> door<00:01:57.200> just

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
fairness I'm gonna close the door just

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.959 
fairness I'm gonna close the door just
so<00:01:57.649> we<00:01:57.739> can<00:01:57.829> hear<00:01:57.979> what<00:01:58.159> it's<00:01:58.280> like<00:01:58.489> from<00:01:58.939> the

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
so we can hear what it's like from the

dynamics now this is where normally when

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.259 
dynamics now this is where normally when
you're<00:02:28.069> driving<00:02:28.340> you've<00:02:28.700> got<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.970> suspension

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
you're driving you've got the suspension

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.390 
you're driving you've got the suspension

track modes on each the difference of
track<00:02:36.230> on<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.340> powertrain<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.299> have

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
track on the powertrain is that you have

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.140 
track on the powertrain is that you have
the<00:02:38.540> intake<00:02:38.870> sound<00:02:39.139> generator<00:02:39.739> open<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:40.880> more

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
the intake sound generator open so more

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.970 
the intake sound generator open so more
noise<00:02:41.359> from<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.780> engine<00:02:41.810> pure<00:02:42.349> noise<00:02:42.560> comes

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
noise from the engine pure noise comes

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.940 
noise from the engine pure noise comes
in<00:02:43.160> through<00:02:43.400> valves<00:02:43.639> in<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.060> back<00:02:44.269> board<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
in through valves in the back board and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.710 
in through valves in the back board and
also<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> gearbox<00:02:46.519> is<00:02:46.669> programmed<00:02:47.150> or<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
also the gearbox is programmed or the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.990 
also the gearbox is programmed or the
ECU<00:02:48.349> is<00:02:48.440> programmed<00:02:48.859> raised<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.639> revs<00:02:49.849> a

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
ECU is programmed raised the revs a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.670 
ECU is programmed raised the revs a
little<00:02:50.239> bit<00:02:50.329> higher<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.750> make<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.230> little<00:02:51.440> bit

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
little bit higher and make a little bit

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.089 
little bit higher and make a little bit
not<00:02:51.859> more<00:02:52.069> noise<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:53.690> now<00:02:53.930> we<00:02:54.470> put<00:02:54.650> our<00:02:54.739> foot<00:02:54.919> on

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
not more noise so now we put our foot on

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.849 
not more noise so now we put our foot on
the<00:02:55.430> brake<00:02:55.609> pedal<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.150> start<00:02:56.510> up<00:02:56.810> listen<00:02:57.739> out

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
the brake pedal and start up listen out

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.289 
the brake pedal and start up listen out
it<00:02:58.160> will<00:02:58.250> Rev<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.519> little<00:02:58.819> bit<00:02:58.940> higher<00:02:59.120> than

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
it will Rev a little bit higher than

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:15.120 
it will Rev a little bit higher than
usual<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:00.019> make<00:03:00.169> a<00:03:00.290> very<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.650> nice<00:03:00.980> sound

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.970 

so<00:03:15.760> as<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.000> saw<00:03:16.180> blitz<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.020> towards<00:03:17.350> 4000

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
so as you saw blitz is up towards 4000

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.220 
so as you saw blitz is up towards 4000
or<00:03:18.070> so<00:03:18.250> rather<00:03:18.520> than<00:03:18.790> normal<00:03:19.270> I<00:03:19.480> think<00:03:19.930> maybe

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
or so rather than normal I think maybe

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.220 
or so rather than normal I think maybe
just<00:03:20.380> under<00:03:20.740> 3000<00:03:21.390> try<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.540> out<00:03:22.690> again<00:03:23.020> in<00:03:23.140> a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
just under 3000 try that out again in a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.350 
just under 3000 try that out again in a
moment<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.770> just<00:03:23.800> remind<00:03:24.220> myself<00:03:24.460> but<00:03:24.970> it's

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
moment and just remind myself but it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.940 
moment and just remind myself but it's
kind<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.630> fun<00:03:25.840> because<00:03:26.020> it's<00:03:26.320> just<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.800> little

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
kind of fun because it's just a little

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.580 
kind of fun because it's just a little
bit<00:03:27.220> more<00:03:27.370> Revie<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.940> jazzed<00:03:28.660> up<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.020> nor<00:03:29.230> for

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
bit more Revie and jazzed up the nor for

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.320 
bit more Revie and jazzed up the nor for
the<00:03:29.620> sake<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:29.860> just<00:03:30.250> turning<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.270> and

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
the sake of just turning it on and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.470 
the sake of just turning it on and
giving<00:03:32.290> one<00:03:32.470> or<00:03:32.590> two<00:03:32.680> buttons<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.300> think<00:03:34.300> in<00:03:34.390> the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
giving one or two buttons I think in the

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.260 
giving one or two buttons I think in the
p1<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.650> have<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:35.890> in<00:03:36.010> race<00:03:36.220> mode<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:37.180> you

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
p1 if you have it in race mode and you

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.370 
p1 if you have it in race mode and you
start<00:03:37.510> up<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:37.750> race<00:03:37.900> mode<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.290> what

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
start up in race mode but what

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.440 
start up in race mode but what
somatically<00:03:38.740> does<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.790> just<00:03:40.030> flips<00:03:40.270> it<00:03:40.420> a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
somatically does that it just flips it a

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.800 
somatically does that it just flips it a
little<00:03:40.720> bit<00:03:40.840> louder<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:42.310> in<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.490> car<00:03:42.810> you

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
little bit louder but in this car you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.450 
little bit louder but in this car you
don't<00:03:43.930> have<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> sort<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.500> permanent<00:03:44.800> race<00:03:45.190> mode

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
don't have a sort of permanent race mode

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.580 
don't have a sort of permanent race mode
as<00:03:45.610> such<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.030> do<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.300> with<00:03:46.590> random

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
as such to do that with random

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.590 
as such to do that with random
observation<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.340> noticed<00:03:48.700> though<00:03:48.820> in<00:03:49.030> neutral

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
observation I noticed though in neutral

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.410 
observation I noticed though in neutral
feel<00:03:49.870> static<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.740> Rebs<00:03:51.010> are<00:03:51.280> really<00:03:51.820> really

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
feel static the Rebs are really really

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.880 
feel static the Rebs are really really
low<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.840> can<00:03:52.990> hear<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.230> almost<00:03:53.440> rumbling

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
low and you can hear it almost rumbling

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.210 
low and you can hear it almost rumbling
whereas<00:03:54.640> if<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.820> put<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.180> Drive<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:57.070> can

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
whereas if I put it in Drive you can

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.740 
whereas if I put it in Drive you can
watch<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.610> revs<00:03:57.820> come<00:03:58.060> up<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.360> though<00:03:58.510> even

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
watch the revs come up and though even

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.930 
watch the revs come up and though even
though<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.710> doesn't<00:04:00.190> automatically<00:04:00.730> pull

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
though it doesn't automatically pull

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.250 
though it doesn't automatically pull
away<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.120> handbrake<00:04:01.630> all<00:04:01.810> set

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
away the handbrake all set

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.380 
away the handbrake all set
it's<00:04:02.860> interesting<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.850> revs<00:04:04.210> a

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
it's interesting just that the revs a

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.180 
it's interesting just that the revs a
little<00:04:05.140> bit<00:04:05.230> higher<00:04:05.380> it's<00:04:05.800> not<00:04:05.920> something

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
little bit higher it's not something

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.460 
little bit higher it's not something
I've<00:04:06.310> experienced<00:04:06.820> in<00:04:06.910> cars<00:04:07.120> before<00:04:07.470> they're

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
I've experienced in cars before they're

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.460 
I've experienced in cars before they're
back<00:04:09.100> in<00:04:09.280> neutral<00:04:09.720> watch<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.900> drop<00:04:11.050> off<00:04:11.200> again

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
back in neutral watch the drop off again

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.280 
back in neutral watch the drop off again
a<00:04:11.500> little<00:04:11.650> bit<00:04:12.450> for<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.510> sake<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.690> interest

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
a little bit for the sake of interest

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.610 
a little bit for the sake of interest
just<00:04:14.650> going<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.310> turn<00:04:15.880> off<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.209> car<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:16.660> just

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
just going to turn off the car and just

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.460 
just going to turn off the car and just
give<00:04:17.770> it<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.950> moment<00:04:18.690> then<00:04:19.690> I'm<00:04:19.810> going<00:04:20.080> to<00:04:20.200> start

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
give it a moment then I'm going to start

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.810 
give it a moment then I'm going to start
it<00:04:20.620> up<00:04:20.680> again<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.130> so<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.460> experience

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
it up again just so you can experience

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.710 
it up again just so you can experience
normal<00:04:22.450> startup<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:25.090> cars<00:04:25.330> like<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.570> with

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
normal startup with cars like this with

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.540 
normal startup with cars like this with
twin<00:04:25.900> turbos<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:26.380> shouldn't<00:04:26.680> start<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.340> stop

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
twin turbos you shouldn't start to stop

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.580 
twin turbos you shouldn't start to stop
them<00:04:27.730> too<00:04:27.940> frequently<00:04:28.480> because<00:04:28.870> otherwise

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
them too frequently because otherwise

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.380 
them too frequently because otherwise
the<00:04:29.800> fuel<00:04:30.070> doesn't<00:04:30.340> completely<00:04:30.970> go<00:04:31.180> through

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
the fuel doesn't completely go through

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.150 
the fuel doesn't completely go through
the<00:04:31.510> system<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.350> once<00:04:32.590> shouldn't<00:04:33.010> be<00:04:33.070> a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
the system but once shouldn't be a

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.680 
the system but once shouldn't be a
problem

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
problem

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.080 
problem
so<00:04:35.010> imagine<00:04:36.010> now<00:04:36.280> we've<00:04:36.490> just<00:04:36.520> got<00:04:36.700> back<00:04:36.940> in

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
so imagine now we've just got back in

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.730 
so imagine now we've just got back in
the<00:04:37.150> car<00:04:37.180> straight<00:04:37.870> in<00:04:38.050> first<00:04:38.410> on<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.560> brake

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
the car straight in first on the brake

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:49.740 
the car straight in first on the brake
and<00:04:39.010> start<00:04:39.310> up<00:04:39.580> at<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:39.820> engine

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.110 

slightly<00:04:50.710> slower<00:04:51.130> starts<00:04:51.610> up<00:04:51.760> as<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.000> came

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
slightly slower starts up as it came

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.330 
slightly slower starts up as it came
back<00:04:52.300> into<00:04:52.600> life<00:04:52.750> just<00:04:53.050> cleaning<00:04:54.040> things<00:04:54.190> and

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
back into life just cleaning things and

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.760 
back into life just cleaning things and
getting<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.640> running<00:04:55.500> sort<00:04:56.500> of<00:04:56.620> what<00:04:56.740> I

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
getting it running sort of what I

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.550 
getting it running sort of what I
expected<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.570> interesting<00:04:58.570> one<00:04:58.720> there<00:04:59.140> we<00:04:59.230> go

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
expected but interesting one there we go

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.890 
expected but interesting one there we go
the<00:05:00.250> loud<00:05:00.460> start<00:05:01.060> sequence

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
the loud start sequence

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.800 
the loud start sequence
at<00:05:03.020> McLaren<00:05:03.410> 650s<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:05.150> hopefully<00:05:05.449> this<00:05:05.570> is<00:05:05.600> all

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
at McLaren 650s so hopefully this is all

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.719 
at McLaren 650s so hopefully this is all
come<00:05:05.990> out<00:05:06.139> well<00:05:06.290> looking<00:05:06.590> forward<00:05:06.889> to<00:05:07.220> seeing

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
come out well looking forward to seeing

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.430 
come out well looking forward to seeing
how<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:07.880> looks<00:05:08.180> with<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.479> wide-angle<00:05:08.750> lens

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
how it looks with the wide-angle lens

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.860 
how it looks with the wide-angle lens
getting<00:05:10.190> myself<00:05:10.310> ready<00:05:10.850> for<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.360> Geneva<00:05:11.570> show

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
getting myself ready for the Geneva show
