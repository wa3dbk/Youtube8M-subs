00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.380
 channel now i'm in new york 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.969
 Marathon 2014 it is interesting to see 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.770
 how guys run and learn a little bit 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.880
 marathons generally keep looking 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.080
 now we are at god 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.060
 or non-russian like this it passes by 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.349
 all areas of new york but we were going to start 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.970
 here because we put on catch 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.420
 our friend who is also a jack microphone 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.070
 we had a little bit Paul fell to the floor 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.950
 so now we go back on 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 muffet we will shoot still there and if 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.510
 talk about the distance actually marathon 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.970
 up to 42 kilometers and I once 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.710
 Granddaddy asked Cupid has with every 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.330
 the race is a marathon actually 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.860
 Naturally for the marathon is not yet ready for 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.390
 order to run a marathon 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.190
 prepare but in my opinion how 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 at least a year says in principle that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.150
 it is possible for six months preparing dishes necessary 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 work very hard and speaking 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.989
 a little about the history of the marathon 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.290
 the name it comes from the fact that 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 1 ha did not run away from the city marathon boffin 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.800
 to report 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.570
 Greeks about winning the battle near the city 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.760
 marathon to higher he continued on with me 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.280
 Stachnym 34 kilometers but then when 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.799
 marathon added to the Olympic program 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.950
 games have done this 40 kilometers but when 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.000
 It took place to the first Roppongi in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.790
 the framework of the Olympic Games 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 then to the station for them to 42 km 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.909
 runners by me 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.230
 Windsor Castle because on 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.420
 queen diodes 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.110
 so that something concrete is actually my 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.110
 look story 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 and 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.140
 in general, I just checked the weather 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 now plus eight degrees centigrade 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 it's a bit cold because 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.939
 ideal running air temperature 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 at the marathon 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.890
 it is 14-16 degrees Celsius if higher 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.619
 18 then it may already be dangerous for 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.119
 health many protein and again with 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.979
 each rising degree runner 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.299
 loses at least one minute of his 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.879
 time for the whole distance 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.379
 if the air temperature is above plus 28 then 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.599
 cancels the covenant at all because they 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.310
 it becomes very dangerous now 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.900
 pulls up our train we will go on now 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.329
 manhattan to look further 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.040
 runner and I'm inspired 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.040
 plan your run on you work 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.700
 besides us here still full of god 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.989
 fans of thread people bright clothes with 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.939
 posters balls all support us 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.860
 now in Manhattan is coming soon 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.299
 just in case i only saw her 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.310
 that two orderlies went to go there 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.170
 meet now guys go down with 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.379
 bridge queen gathering and it will be possible 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.379
 see 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.770
 I hope you will be fine with me now 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.250
 heard because everywhere here is such 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.320
 crowd 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.120
 all support the runners and these 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.730
 white tents who see this tent 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.800
 with drinking and with food because when you 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.870
 run this distance very hard 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.240
 rely only on their strength because 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.740
 what is actually human glycogen 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.170
 enough to run 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.280
 usually literally 30 kilometers even 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.350
 if you supported 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.660
 special diet before the race if you 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.400
 trained because after a week 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.940
 before the race it is necessary to maintain carbohydrate 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.580
 diet 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.500
 it is already a tradition that all the main 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.780
 only pasta for dinner 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.940
 notes must be very high 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.370
 carbohydrate diet support is not very 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.800
 strongly after 30 kilometers as a rule 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.750
 already ending glycogen stores and for 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.850
 order to reach and were strength to the country 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 and there to maintain your body that is 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.570
 obligation to finish up 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.250
 be sure to have something to eat or 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.320
 some energy drink drink 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.480
 sports here are very worth it 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.000
 we are such tents and support 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.560
 athletes in general, we came from here 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.650
 now and then I filmed them under 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.270
 bridge ran and by the way you are here with 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.859
 I already had this here this cable 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.320
 the road to which you can go on 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.190
 Roosevelt Island and, accordingly, the bridge 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.919
 queen gathering show yes that's it over there 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.530
 the distance goes away and now we will see how 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.110
 they after turned under 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.240
 bridge run further look 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.520
 which there is swimming just a sea of people 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.319
 and but of course it looks very impressive 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.150
 bromine also really wanted to run up from 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.160
 I had the power of java of course 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.240
 I participated and what else would you like 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.160
 tell actually 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.460
 they are all divided into old women 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.560
 for speed because everyone runs and 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.349
 generally for each of these groups is given 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.720
 given its people who run with spoons 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.550
 next to them is very cancer , and he asked so 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.310
 what if you don't have an opportunity for yourself 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.229
 more often some that fix your 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.300
 speed whether the phone or whatever 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.580
 anyway you will always be helped and will 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.190
 next to the people who will ask you to t 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.349
 necessary for your group for your 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.940
 abilities let's say so besides 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.630
 each group starts all the time and no 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.639
 1 card for all 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.919
 is recorded starting from your 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.610
 personal start before your personal write 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.729
 you with every runner on the rooms have 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.009
 sensors that show you pass 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.530
 some checkpoints shows where he was 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.909
 how much time did it take him 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.810
 very convenient it is used in 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.810
 principle on all races 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.989
 know what the runners will say of course 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:01.779
 good deal but if you saw that 

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:04.929
 going on here this zone yes where 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:07.479
 people sick cry cry supports 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:09.459
 moms-dads and it is so cute 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.979
 so grab I really am right 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:13.479
 I was only impressed because 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.879
 such here are these tears so more then 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:19.199
 worried about their loved ones this 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:19.199
 just no out of reach
