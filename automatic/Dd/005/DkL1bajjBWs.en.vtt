00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.660
 Hello friends 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.370
 welcome to oriental and such again from a little bit of thyme in your hand this is 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.000
 what are we going 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.370
 let's accuse although the ipad stops after stopping our recipe today 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.840
 this recipe today the eggplant constanza the same 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.940
 for and here we have eggplant 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.069
 in this case we are going to use confiscation 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:26.100
 red I also have chilli paste sesame oil 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.960
 sugar 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.460
 take out good and soy the first thing we have to do is export the eggplant 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.379
 between appointments 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.860
 squares 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.129
 and season the peace 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.090
 it is very important to season it 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.050
 with salt 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.230
 so that this was not the half hour resting on a wringer so that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.310
 release all the bitterness that our eggplant has inside barletta for it we 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.600
 let's do 3 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.060
 a few squares 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.760
 with young people 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.310
 let's place here 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.270
 to then make the route 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.530
 fine salt 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.220
 there is a colander the collaborator is important because as he goes 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.309
 catching that salty sadesa 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.170
 will be letting go of Argentina's hand 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.770
 then I have a pan aside 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.310
 heating up 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 that time it is another very typical movie of Japanese cuisine to see 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.570
 smith appetizer japanese cuisine 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.490
 of the 52 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.270
 and else 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.039
 the summit very normal to use permission 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.210
 emphasizes more well-being because after we do not go to 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.050
 drain and we will wash it 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.720
 here we remove 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.520
 do you have that at this time it would be when we would place the smoker 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.870
 explained the note we would put our debt 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.950
 and thanks to the two super helper that we have the program 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.760
 I have already 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760
 another will prepare the refrigerator I will go for them 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.700
 how good a dish as an entree or as pericles 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.060
 oo it's very different in japan accompanies everything with these projects that we are going to 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.579
 have to terol look at the list of ingredients so that eta is called 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.189
 eggplant petras with miss oh sauce 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.880
 learn these projects because they are ideal 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.080
 as an appetizer or as 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 Accompaniment of a good but written yes 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.149
 this one that I have here 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.020
 has been in the fridge for half an hour 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.120
 that half hour 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.420
 has made it precisely from this this liquid milestone starts to come out 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.489
 what are we going to do to squeeze it 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.679
 It's worth to let go of that bitter 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.389
 how you choose them 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:32.149
 is that your min agents a little friends luisa merlo is totally forgotten 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.079
 that's precisely why we are going to do with our hands but for that I had 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:36.679
 helped 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:38.430
 the player who always 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.029
 OK with a cloth 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.069
 is going to facilitate the work that squeeze the twenty 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.129
 jaÃ©n 2 valencia 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.229
 and we squeeze and from this moment release all the bitterness 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.229
 roberts 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.389
 we completed strong it was coming out 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.909
 this is coming out the liquid be 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.909
 is the bitter one that has 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.779
 strong station 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.839
 here with strength 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.839
 squeeze the eggplant 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.189
 once we have it we pass it on 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.659
 to our conflict and we're going to start skipping the 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.789
 with sesame oil this time, even if you soda sesame oil 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.789
 for this the interest rates are 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.209
 and while this heats up a bit 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.289
 let's make our line one of the same barbastro come to me 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:42.289
 let's use sugar 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.319
 to sack 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.259
 it's heating up already perfect 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.989
 I'm not going to take advantage so that who after fencing giving a little bit I'm happy 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.839
 soy 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.799
 and nilin as well is this 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.269
 I have here that is a Japanese sauce 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.119
 by then the alcoholic strength 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.479
 3 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.479
 out of tune it seems like it's happening now 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:16.099
 but the red kiss 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.959
 we commented before you have to live it in water 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.150
 so that the sauce 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.730
 do not be too strong 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.400
 remember that even that is not a very very very intense flavor 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.150
 I do not think we can use water 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.779
 and here from this moment we start to 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.490
 stir 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.169
 so that it becomes 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.690
 in the sauce light red permit 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.820
 the miso is a germ vale of tribune wheat pastore 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.629
 A) Yes 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.669
 6 Caesar light on the other hand we have our fake after that took advantage of 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.809
 the patients 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.229
 we will also go 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.370
 another recipe very simple 6 maturing 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:55.800
 the eggplant 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.909
 with our oil the same 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.909
 we do not have 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.849
 From this moment 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.949
 as always we do the one who likes the spicy 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.689
 a little bit of 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.999
 of chilli pepper paste 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.629
 I do feel like it and a little bit deficient 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.609
 says oriental cultures the spicy helps open the stomach 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.740
 open appetite 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.999
 here we have 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.999
 from that moment we add our salsita 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.559
 a little bit of the cases these with the security forces 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.020
 different 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.889
 the eviction we have lived 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.400
 a few ambient 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.400
 we mix well 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.980
 and this makes that has left reduces a few minutes 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.980
 enter to take advantage to reach 100% 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.659
 to withdraw by any means 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.589
 outside 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:05.659
 if this were 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.659
 and the eggplant the ounce pass because we do not 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.960
 Panama 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 we started a little 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.330
 this sauce has to reduce is going to paralyze a little 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.449
 thanks to your part we have father 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.089
 the door glass is fusing the spaces and a sauce 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:27.370
 sweet 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.389
 that he liked nothing 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:35.099
 the spicy that goes very well and in this case red emitter this opera and always 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:36.849

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.180
 very simple very easy 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.159
 the only time you remember is to have the aubergine macerated 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.569
 half an hour of the first team 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.729
