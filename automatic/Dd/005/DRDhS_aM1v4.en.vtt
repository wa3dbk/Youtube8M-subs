with<00:01:55.930> me<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.140> don't<00:01:56.320> mind<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.680> generator<00:01:57.130> at<00:01:57.340> all

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
with me I don't mind a generator at all

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.540 
with me I don't mind a generator at all
now<00:01:59.410> they're<00:01:59.680> just<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.980> part<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.370> boat

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
now they're just a part of the boat

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.640 
now they're just a part of the boat
they're<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> machinery<00:02:01.570> aspect<00:02:02.230> of<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.470> boat

they're a machinery aspect of the boat

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.170 
they're a machinery aspect of the boat
the<00:02:03.070> owner<00:02:03.250> turns<00:02:03.550> them<00:02:03.760> on

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
the owner turns them on

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.850 
the owner turns them on
just<00:02:04.360> like<00:02:04.510> he<00:02:04.660> starts<00:02:04.990> his<00:02:05.110> engines<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.770> they

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
just like he starts his engines and they

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.980 
just like he starts his engines and they
run<00:02:06.070> 24<00:02:06.640> hours<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.970> day<00:02:07.060> when<00:02:07.360> he's<00:02:07.510> out<00:02:07.720> and

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
run 24 hours a day when he's out and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.139 
run 24 hours a day when he's out and
they're<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.770> part<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.130> boat<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.910> fix

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
they're just part of the boat it's a fix
