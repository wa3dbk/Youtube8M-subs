 Red 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 it is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 Hello and welcome to a whopping 110 edition of the mast 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.500
 ethically Euro 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.130
 Handwerg William is about to pop a champagne cork for a party 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 throw 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.870
 what instead we plunge into a gloomy world full of fear and 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.699
 without hope so up to premature this world has in it the many of these 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.890
 Setting the communiquÃ© Severin Jahn place so divorce 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.990
 Konami Bad at the side of the developer noticeably 7 and with support from 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.260
 Lithium Polymer another try the gameplay of the classic in the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.200
 third dimension 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.410
 We are already allowed to play a small excerpt from the game and were heavy 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.390
 excited 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.170
 we are in the deepest Middle Ages and a curse that lands on the earth 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 the deceased will see the entrance to heaven 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.490
 so soon there will be a nice one in the form of Charming bugs and the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.720
 The sun continues to rise with pleasure and to set a joke 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.650
 Appearance keeps telling us worked out and action 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.690
 Of course the whole thing will be half as much fun if it is not 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.970
 give in to give the monsters vigorously spanking the butt 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.010
 CastellÃ³n the rock whole crap the surname of the young man at the 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.460
 this time in this role hatches 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.180
 correct again this time it is an emissary of the Belmont family 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.350
 or the brotherhood of light dealing with the monster 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.150
 moderate shape applies 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.230
 for some, at first glance, are watching the changing of their saints 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.080
 but you could also do it with a Greek army commander 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.770
 mistaken 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.440
 now a w-lan has sold a kickstart 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.200
 the God of 3 was one or the other for the bombastic staging 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.090
 Model has stood to dismiss it from the hand 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.480
 but that does not matter because the Kunstverein has done a great job 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.560
 already in the early in the versions are at the present time probably the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.080
 Pie cheese Banias German cities made for astonished faces made clear 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.420
 that there where three not necessarily a miracle of ps3 has been 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.900
 the us currency keepers have been making fixed interest rates since the first 20 gameplay 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.089
 Castlevania Lords of Shadow at least visually to a potential with 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.019
 Obviously, in contrast to earlier times, you have much more value 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.689
 Emphasized on emotional and atmospheric density storytelling underscores 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.399
 these lovingly designed scenarios like a wonderful one 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.069
 Reveal the joy of detail 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.099
 yet the gameplay also allowed us to convince some armed with one 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.950
 cross-shaped particles come the so-called extras 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.420
 Metzel Gabriel Belmont in classic ten men would have her through 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.259
 all kinds of bloodthirsty monsters 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.599
 in the hands of them demo that was especially who says an order of magnitude 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.840
 with two hands that you can use a sports button when you have diverse 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.980
 Commander from the stack online with increasing experience points steadily 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.849
 continue to reform 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.739
 how can we wait like throwing knives or holy water and not a little gave one 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.489
 a contemporary level 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.830
 The game should be in the course of a balanced mix of Wesel 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.370
 Platform change markets offer and are hinted at in the demo only Storey 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.539
 sure to be fulminant finale 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.079
 The developers have taken quite into consideration the 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.049
 well-known scary atmosphere of the original area if you have parts 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.909
 pick up something like old-established fans in the street scene we should have 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.109
 After that we did not forget anyone what we did in why 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.189
 Castlevania the contract will not go 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.709
 That's true only to face but not with them 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.209
 I am sure that the forefather of all vampires be on 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.919
 We'll have to get that into the future 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.499
 next months the game should appear this year 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:08.769
 that is correct 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.949
 if he's gone she's when her lottery tickets go a bit far 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.349
 best the now displayed code in the search mask on the streets 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.769
 and certainly no real trends but they go 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.699
 we can do it now, because you do not know every day 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.059
 hundreds 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.059
 in this sense and guests not 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.499
 lie 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.900
 Bern 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900
 Munich 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:39.919
 No
