okay<00:00:02.820> finally<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.389> water<00:00:03.600> pump<00:00:04.100> there's<00:00:05.100> no

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay finally the water pump there's no

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.900 
okay finally the water pump there's no
one<00:00:06.109> okay<00:00:07.109> take<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.620> trick<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.309> novices<00:00:08.730> is

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
one okay take that trick for novices is

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.490 
one okay take that trick for novices is
like<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.300> said<00:00:09.480> before<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.840> lay<00:00:09.990> out<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> pump

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
like I said before you lay out the pump

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.070 
like I said before you lay out the pump
so<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.710> know<00:00:10.830> where<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:10.980> bolts<00:00:11.280> off<00:00:11.929> on<00:00:12.929> this

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
so you know where the bolts off on this

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.829 
so you know where the bolts off on this
particular<00:00:13.440> pump<00:00:14.120> there's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> stud<00:00:15.480> they<00:00:15.630> run

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
particular pump there's a stud they run

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
particular pump there's a stud they run
here<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.260> front<00:00:16.410> mount<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.490> still<00:00:17.820> they

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
here for the front mount and still they

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
here for the front mount and still they
run<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.480> mock<00:00:18.660> front<00:00:18.930> mount<00:00:19.140> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
run here for the mock front mount you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.800 
run here for the mock front mount you
can't<00:00:19.890> slide<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> pass<00:00:20.520> there<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.570> got<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
can't slide the pass there so you got to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.529 
can't slide the pass there so you got to
take<00:00:21.900> those<00:00:22.109> off<00:00:22.939> here<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:23.970> got<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> time

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
take those off here you got the time

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.580 
take those off here you got the time
belt<00:00:24.810> tensioner<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.369> idler<00:00:26.609> pulley<00:00:26.760> you

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
belt tensioner and the idler pulley you

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.450 
belt tensioner and the idler pulley you
might<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:28.710> well<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.920> down<00:00:28.949> there<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.340> take

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
might as well go down there and take

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.710 
might as well go down there and take
them<00:00:29.580> off<00:00:29.760> too<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.240> got<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.689> got

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
them off too because you got it you got

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.240 
them off too because you got it you got
to<00:00:30.900> collapse<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> tension<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.740> anyway<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
to collapse the tension or anyway and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790 
to collapse the tension or anyway and
that<00:00:32.510> tension<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.870> idler<00:00:34.320> pulleys<00:00:34.620> about

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that tension are the idler pulleys about

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
that tension are the idler pulleys about
to<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.040> full<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> antifreeze<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:36.149> mean<00:00:36.750> let's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to get full of antifreeze I mean let's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.209 
to get full of antifreeze I mean let's
say<00:00:37.020> any<00:00:37.230> freeze<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.800> stuff<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
say any freeze you get on stuff the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.560 
say any freeze you get on stuff the
better<00:00:38.989> okay<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.790> can<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.239> idler

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
better okay you can see I got this idler

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.779 
better okay you can see I got this idler
pulley<00:00:42.780> off<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.500> make<00:00:43.680> life<00:00:43.860> easier<00:00:44.309> help

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
pulley off and make life easier help

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.900 
pulley off and make life easier help
more<00:00:44.969> things

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
more things

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.330 
more things
there's<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.059> time<00:00:48.210> potential

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there's your time potential

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.100 
there's your time potential
see<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.430> pin<00:00:51.640> in<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:51.880> like<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.450> grenade<00:00:52.810> pin

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
see the pin in it like a grenade pin

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.070 
see the pin in it like a grenade pin
sticking<00:00:53.980> out<00:00:54.160> both<00:00:54.340> sides<00:00:54.810> basically<00:00:55.810> what

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
sticking out both sides basically what

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.630 
sticking out both sides basically what
they<00:00:56.170> did<00:00:56.230> was<00:00:56.380> I<00:00:56.710> compressed<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.310> in<00:00:57.400> the<00:00:57.460> vise

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
they did was I compressed it in the vise

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.870 
they did was I compressed it in the vise
I<00:00:57.940> pushed<00:00:58.360> this<00:00:58.900> pin<00:00:59.170> back<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.460> slip<00:01:00.760> the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
I pushed this pin back in and slip the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.160 
I pushed this pin back in and slip the
pin<00:01:01.060> in<00:01:01.210> now<00:01:02.880> these<00:01:03.880> things<00:01:04.089> are<00:01:04.270> very<00:01:04.660> stiff

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
pin in now these things are very stiff

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.870 
pin in now these things are very stiff
to<00:01:05.379> push<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.070> reason<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:06.550> is<00:01:06.580> is

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
to push in and the reason it is is

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.460 
to push in and the reason it is is
there's<00:01:07.120> a<00:01:07.180> spring<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.570> there<00:01:07.720> but<00:01:08.140> that's<00:01:08.229> not

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
there's a spring in there but that's not

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.420 
there's a spring in there but that's not
what<00:01:08.620> stiff<00:01:08.830> there's<00:01:09.760> a<00:01:09.910> spring<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:10.360> there<00:01:10.540> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
what stiff there's a spring in there and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.600 
what stiff there's a spring in there and
it's<00:01:12.430> just<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.960> pin<00:01:13.960> with<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.920> plunger<00:01:15.369> like<00:01:15.580> a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
it's just a pin with a plunger like a

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's just a pin with a plunger like a
shock<00:01:15.880> absorber<00:01:16.360> trying<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.410> push<00:01:17.619> glue<00:01:17.890> into

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
shock absorber trying to push glue into

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.810 
shock absorber trying to push glue into
a<00:01:18.160> tiny<00:01:18.550> little<00:01:18.850> pinhole<00:01:20.040> okay<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
a tiny little pinhole okay and the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.180 
a tiny little pinhole okay and the
spring<00:01:22.330> when<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:22.990> belt<00:01:23.350> flutters<00:01:23.830> actually

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
spring when the belt flutters actually

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.150 
spring when the belt flutters actually
just<00:01:24.369> takes<00:01:24.550> up<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.850> slack<00:01:25.200> okay<00:01:26.200> but<00:01:27.040> with

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
just takes up the slack okay but with

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.100 
just takes up the slack okay but with
that<00:01:27.310> pin<00:01:27.550> hole<00:01:27.790> it<00:01:28.030> allows<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.600> come<00:01:28.840> back

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
that pin hole it allows it to come back

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.749 
that pin hole it allows it to come back
and<00:01:29.380> forth<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.580> keep<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.060> tension<00:01:31.300> correct

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and forth and keep the tension correct

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.160 
and forth and keep the tension correct
so<00:01:33.759> actually<00:01:34.240> there's<00:01:34.390> not<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.570> lot<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.899> force

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
so actually there's not a lot of force

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.350 
so actually there's not a lot of force
against<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.800> it's<00:01:36.190> just<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:36.520> can't<00:01:36.880> move<00:01:37.149> it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
against it it's just you can't move it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.389 
against it it's just you can't move it
fast<00:01:37.690> it's<00:01:38.500> like<00:01:38.710> you're<00:01:38.860> trying<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.190> walk

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
fast it's like you're trying to walk

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.120 
fast it's like you're trying to walk
through<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:40.170> swimming<00:01:41.170> pool<00:01:41.320> for<00:01:41.590> molasses

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
through a swimming pool for molasses

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.350 
through a swimming pool for molasses
you're<00:01:42.250> not<00:01:42.369> gonna<00:01:42.460> do<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.729> fast<00:01:42.910> but<00:01:43.180> if<00:01:43.300> you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
you're not gonna do it fast but if you

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.300 
you're not gonna do it fast but if you
do<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.630> slow<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:43.899> have<00:01:43.990> no<00:01:44.200> problem<00:01:44.560> that's

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
do it slow you have no problem that's

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.480 
do it slow you have no problem that's
basically<00:01:45.700> all<00:01:45.820> these<00:01:46.090> things<00:01:46.300> on<00:01:47.280> okay<00:01:48.280> now

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
basically all these things on okay now

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.980 
basically all these things on okay now
if<00:01:48.670> they<00:01:48.820> don't<00:01:49.000> come<00:01:49.149> up<00:01:49.360> there<00:01:49.390> compressing

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
if they don't come up there compressing

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.639 
if they don't come up there compressing
super<00:01:50.320> easy

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
super easy
