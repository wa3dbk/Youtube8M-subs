00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.660 
bigger you can obviously use a bigger
brush<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.840> smaller<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:02.219> just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
brush but that that is smaller you just

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.119 
brush but that that is smaller you just
use<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.790> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.180> create<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
use one and this is going to create a

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.699 
use one and this is going to create a
strand<00:02:08.129> effect<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.289> run

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
strand effect so I'm just going to run

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.130 
strand effect so I'm just going to run
the<00:02:10.920> brush<00:02:11.129> over<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.810> hair

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the brush over the the hair

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.640 
the brush over the the hair
like<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.800> starts<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.960> break<00:02:15.960> up<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
like this so it starts to break up the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.210 
like this so it starts to break up the
harsh<00:02:17.069> line<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.810> looking<00:02:19.770> more<00:02:20.160> like

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
harsh line and get it looking more like

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.630 
harsh line and get it looking more like
strands<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:23.010> now<00:02:23.130> we're<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.459> take<00:02:23.580> a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
strands so now we're going to take a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
strands so now we're going to take a
brush<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.390> exact<00:02:25.020> same<00:02:25.230> settings

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620

too<00:04:01.170> perfect<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.799> my<00:04:02.430> opinion<00:04:02.670> anyway<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:04.140> I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
too perfect in my opinion anyway so I

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.949 
too perfect in my opinion anyway so I
also<00:04:05.250> kind<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.640> want<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.910> point<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.329> when

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
also kind of want to point out that when

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.870 
also kind of want to point out that when
you're<00:04:07.140> drawing<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.739> all<00:04:07.829> these<00:04:07.980> lines<00:04:08.340> try<00:04:08.820> to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
you're drawing in all these lines try to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.970 
you're drawing in all these lines try to
avoid<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:09.630> scribbling<00:04:10.200> up<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.560> down<00:04:10.769> like

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
avoid just scribbling up and down like

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.130 
avoid just scribbling up and down like
this<00:04:11.250> or<00:04:11.579> else<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.239> might<00:04:12.269> get<00:04:12.540> like<00:04:12.720> weird

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
this or else you might get like weird

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.770 
this or else you might get like weird
like<00:04:13.530> loop<00:04:14.220> things<00:04:14.640> like<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.480> hair

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
like loop things like this and hair

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.469 
like loop things like this and hair
doesn't<00:04:16.079> usually<00:04:16.169> act<00:04:16.500> like<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.479> could

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
doesn't usually act like that I could

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.479 
doesn't usually act like that I could
because<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.109> mean<00:04:19.380> like<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:19.769> said<00:04:19.799> hair<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.340> it

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
because I mean like I said hair is it

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.450 
because I mean like I said hair is it
perfect<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.630> could<00:04:21.810> get<00:04:21.930> caught<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.560> itself

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
perfect so it could get caught in itself

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.220 
perfect so it could get caught in itself
but<00:04:23.970> generally<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:25.289> way<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.440> would<00:04:25.770> kind<00:04:25.919> of<00:04:26.039> do

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
but generally the way I would kind of do

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.050 
but generally the way I would kind of do
it<00:04:26.320> though<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> wasn't<00:04:27.040> really<00:04:27.190> doing<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.670> here

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
it though I wasn't really doing it here

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.410 
it though I wasn't really doing it here
very<00:04:28.090> well<00:04:28.450> I<00:04:28.660> would<00:04:29.440> just<00:04:29.830> keep<00:04:30.820> draw<00:04:31.090> from

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
very well I would just keep draw from

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.310 
very well I would just keep draw from
the<00:04:32.170> top<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.470> bottom<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.160> just<00:04:33.250> draw<00:04:33.640> downward

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
the top to bottom and just draw downward

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.710 
the top to bottom and just draw downward
like<00:04:35.320> this<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.740> mean<00:04:35.890> y'all<00:04:36.550> like<00:04:36.850> curves<00:04:37.420> and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
like this I mean y'all like curves and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.230 
like this I mean y'all like curves and
draw<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.900> like<00:04:38.080> like<00:04:39.070> squiggly<00:04:39.880> like<00:04:40.030> this

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
draw it like like squiggly like this

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.660 
draw it like like squiggly like this
I'll<00:04:40.420> it's<00:04:40.540> hair<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.560> generally<00:04:41.980> just<00:04:42.490> go

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
I'll it's hair but generally just go

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.640 
I'll it's hair but generally just go
down<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.270> avoid<00:04:43.540> going<00:04:44.170> up<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.560> down

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
down and avoid going up and down

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.400 
down and avoid going up and down
scribbling<00:04:45.520> okay<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.120> next<00:04:46.480> we're<00:04:47.050> going<00:04:47.260> to

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
scribbling okay so next we're going to

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.590 
scribbling okay so next we're going to
do<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.920> exact<00:04:48.730> same<00:04:48.850> thing<00:04:49.180> you're<00:04:49.360> more<00:04:49.510> or

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
less but this time we're going to go in

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.740 
less but this time we're going to go in

okay so for this next part we're going
to<00:05:00.280> add<00:05:00.430> even<00:05:00.730> more<00:05:00.940> definition<00:05:01.750> so<00:05:02.110> I'm<00:05:02.350> going

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
to add even more definition so I'm going

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.560 
to add even more definition so I'm going
to<00:05:02.650> make<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.130> new<00:05:03.310> layer<00:05:03.460> right<00:05:04.090> click<00:05:04.150> on<00:05:04.510> it

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
to make a new layer right click on it

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.260 
to make a new layer right click on it
and<00:05:04.780> go<00:05:04.960> over<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.590> create<00:05:06.040> clipping<00:05:06.340> mask<00:05:06.550> and

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
and go over to create clipping mask and

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.090 
and go over to create clipping mask and
I'm<00:05:07.540> going<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.810> take<00:05:07.930> a<00:05:07.990> really<00:05:08.440> dark<00:05:08.650> color<00:05:08.860> so

awesome I and we're just gonna go over
the<00:05:24.210> dark<00:05:25.210> areas<00:05:25.630> very<00:05:25.930> lightly<00:05:26.650> like<00:05:27.040> so<00:05:27.460> and

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
the dark areas very lightly like so and

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.930 
the dark areas very lightly like so and
we're<00:05:28.330> going<00:05:28.600> to<00:05:28.860> not<00:05:29.860> do<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.520> same<00:05:30.730> thing

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
we're going to not do the same thing

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.760 
we're going to not do the same thing
with<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.120> light<00:05:31.330> areas<00:05:31.690> actually<00:05:32.170> it<00:05:32.590> doesn't

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
with the light areas actually it doesn't

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.370 
with the light areas actually it doesn't
really<00:05:33.040> work<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.460> same<00:05:33.640> way<00:05:33.700> so<00:05:34.390> instead<00:05:34.930> what

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
really work the same way so instead what

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.910 
really work the same way so instead what
we're<00:05:35.560> going<00:05:35.680> to<00:05:35.920> do<00:05:36.070> now<00:05:36.430> I'm<00:05:36.520> going<00:05:36.730> to<00:05:37.920> merge

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
we're going to do now I'm going to merge

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.030 
we're going to do now I'm going to merge
them<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.550> what<00:05:39.670> we're<00:05:39.790> going<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.090> do<00:05:40.210> is<00:05:40.480> take

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
them and what we're going to do is take

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
them and what we're going to do is take
the<00:05:42.390> burn<00:05:43.390> and<00:05:43.900> dodge<00:05:44.260> tool<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.070> then<00:05:45.820> we'll

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
the burn and dodge tool and then we'll

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.260 
the burn and dodge tool and then we'll
go<00:05:46.210> over<00:05:46.350> where<00:05:47.350> we<00:05:47.500> see<00:05:47.710> fit<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:49.020> lighten<00:05:51.270> like

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
go over where we see fit to lighten like

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.050 
go over where we see fit to lighten like
so<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:53.170> you<00:05:53.320> can<00:05:53.470> make<00:05:53.710> it<00:05:53.860> smaller<00:05:54.340> so<00:05:54.700> that

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
so and you can make it smaller so that
