00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.950 

hi<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:17.070> am<00:00:17.220> Hancock<00:00:17.790> schwarzer<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
hi I am Hancock schwarzer and this is

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.560 
hi I am Hancock schwarzer and this is
Orchestra<00:00:19.560> string<00:00:19.890> runs<00:00:20.130> my<00:00:20.820> new<00:00:21.090> sample

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
Orchestra string runs my new sample

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.990 
Orchestra string runs my new sample
library<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.950> will<00:00:23.100> give<00:00:23.280> you<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.610> a<00:00:23.640> first

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
library and I will give you now a first

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.740 
library and I will give you now a first
look<00:00:24.270> on<00:00:24.450> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
look on it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.610 
look on it
so<00:00:25.560> Orchestra<00:00:26.340> string<00:00:26.670> runs<00:00:26.880> includes<00:00:27.620> some

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
so Orchestra string runs includes some

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.970 
so Orchestra string runs includes some
basic<00:00:28.730> matron<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.850> minor<00:00:30.180> runs<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.980> several

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
basic matron and minor runs and several

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.319 
basic matron and minor runs and several
loop<00:00:32.219> string<00:00:32.730> figures<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.859> we<00:00:34.859> produced<00:00:35.329> in

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
loop string figures and we produced in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.950 
loop string figures and we produced in
wait<00:00:36.629> if<00:00:36.870> new<00:00:37.140> string<00:00:37.620> runs<00:00:37.859> builder<00:00:38.960> for

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
wait if new string runs builder for

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.130 
wait if new string runs builder for
creating<00:00:40.649> individual<00:00:41.640> runs<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.269> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.019> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
creating individual runs and this is the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.430 
creating individual runs and this is the
major<00:00:43.350> part<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> library<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:46.140> course

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
major part of the library and of course

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.009 
major part of the library and of course
everything<00:00:46.979> is<00:00:47.190> temporal<00:00:47.760> locked<00:00:47.999> so<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.870> are

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
everything is temporal locked so you are

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.879 
everything is temporal locked so you are
very<00:00:49.260> flexible<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:51.050> I<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.289> prepared<00:00:52.769> a

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:52.889 
very flexible and I have prepared a

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:55.579 
very flexible and I have prepared a
short<00:00:52.920> piece<00:00:53.429> so<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.569> how<00:00:54.809> Orchestra

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
short piece so you can see how Orchestra

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.259 
short piece so you can see how Orchestra
stream<00:00:55.889> runs<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.429> working<00:00:56.999> in<00:00:57.179> arrangement<00:00:59.269> so

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
stream runs is working in arrangement so

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.950 
stream runs is working in arrangement so
we'll<00:01:00.510> open<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.679> key<00:01:02.129> editor

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
we'll open this in the key editor

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:14.100 
we'll open this in the key editor
