different thicknesses and what I did was

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.380

I first I lined out the graphic with it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.049 
I first I lined out the graphic with it
then<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.170> got<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:40.680> painters<00:00:41.070> tape<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.969> I

then I got some painters tape and I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.930 
then I got some painters tape and I
covered<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.690> then<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.140> cut<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.620> okay<00:00:44.610> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
covered it and then I cut it okay this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.119 
covered it and then I cut it okay this
way<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
way because this in here is going to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.580 
way because this in here is going to
stay<00:00:47.340> silver<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> do<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> green<00:00:49.230> base

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
stay silver I'm going to do a green base

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
stay silver I'm going to do a green base
coat<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.070> top<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.610> silver<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.420> the

coat on top of this silver now and the
reason<00:00:52.079> why<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.230> paint<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> whole<00:00:53.100> tank<00:00:53.489> silver

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
reason why I paint the whole tank silver

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
reason why I paint the whole tank silver
was<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> give<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.440> nice<00:00:55.649> under<00:00:56.280> base<00:00:56.520> coat

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
was to give it a nice under base coat
