00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.000
At the beginning of the game,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.260
if you have a Master Key,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.360
then you can run to the Valley of Drakes

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.320
and get yourself some new gear.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
I have, at the same time, managed to descend into Blighttown

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.040
to get a Crimson Set yourself.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840
And now here's the sleeping Undead dragon.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.080
Here he guards 3 little gifts,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.840
which would be very nice to take.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.920
Especially, there valuable sword and shield.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.300
But if you just take them,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
then he immediately wakes up and starts to attack you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.620
and most likely he will kill you.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.080
But, if you are a Mage,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.760
you can safely kill him.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.760
It's enough, here, to pick up the distance

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.440
and beat him with Sorcery.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.460
A little closer, I'm not getting him!

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.580
Just like this.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.420
Now his evil breath is not enough for us,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.800
and we beat him calmly.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.640
At the initial levels of the game,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.660
we don't have very strong damage with Sorcery.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.200
But from a dealer you can gain a few spells,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.180
And build a water pump.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.840
Well,I mean, cast spells.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.800
it turns out 12 Heavy soul arrows, and

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.480
and 60 Soul arrows.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.460
And that should be enough

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500
To destroy this water pump.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.040
Well, and this dragon at the same time,Ğ¾f course.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960
Well, that's all very simple,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.220
without losing life, we finish him off.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.900
Okay, he is ready!

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.640
We receive the Dragon scale,will be useful,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.700
3000 souls and you can collect gifts:

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.300
Dragon Crest Shield,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.500
and Astora's Straight Sword.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.340
Great equipment to start the game.
