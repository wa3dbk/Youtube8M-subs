00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.500
 hello with this tutorial I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:11.210
 how to change the user in your 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.160
 applestore and thus be able to incorporate the 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.990
 user that I sent you by mail 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.060
 electronic to download them 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.279
 applications that we have sent you from 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.989
 the school is worth then good from 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.869
 your ipad what you have to go is 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.060
 directly to settings and in the bar 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.309
 lateral find access to 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.899
 applestore in this case I have it here what 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:35.090
 you see there is forgiveness here to the applestore and 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.980
 I guess you find your user 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.219
 of apple connected with the 2 download 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.510
 the applications then for 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.789
 disconnect this user I have to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.560
 point and here I have an option that is 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.650
 disconnect 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.120
 Then you are going to connect to the 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.580
 applestore with the user that I have 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.460
 passed by mail that is the user that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.480
 we have given you at school then 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.720
 you have to choose the first option that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.220
 is to use existing apple air 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.650
 we give it to you there and in the username 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.640
 you are going to incorporate what the errand is 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:12.590
 what will be apple 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.250
 a number in my case is 118 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.300
 sec 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.830
 point is and against points out that it will go 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.650
 incorporated in the mail that I have 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.550
 commanded 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.760
 which is in my case is a letter code 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.430
 and numbers in uppercase and lowercase e 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.200
 incorporate it, you fail because you just 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.600
 try several times will block you the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.270
 user 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.469
 there we have it, let's go slowly 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.469
 so as not to be wrong 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.640
 we continue here 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.830
 and I think this is the last letter 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.010
 a moment that here I was wrong 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.570
 always review well before doing it 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.230
 so I get it if it gets blocked you have to 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.320
 recover them and it's a little harder me 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.450
 I 'm going to connect and I already have it worth 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.040
 you have seen that it opens the options for 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.590
 lending to link and 'the white 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.540
 mail and what is the next step what 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.400
 you have to do is that this user 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.870
 you have to make your name and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.460
 your which means that this user 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.650
 from here this mail to the one that is 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.690
 linked you have to replace it with 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.640
 your set email and password 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.630
 incorporate yours which you 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.120
 You want to know how to do that, because he pointed and 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.550
 the first option is to see the user of 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.120
 Apple the air and apple I select 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.030
 and up here I have apple apple air 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.950
 119 to be point after here I have 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 to select to replace that 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.410
 user that mail 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.319
 let's incorporate my own mail 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.930
 OK 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.500
 here we incorporate my own mail and in 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.130
 password what I do is replace it 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.230
 by my own password 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.230
 I return to write twice already you have 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.630
 here we can my set mail 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.800
 in this case it would be Jorge point model 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.900
 at that point it is 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.660
 in your case remember that after 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.490
 student points and the point is I give 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.170
 finished the rest of options that I 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.910
 go asking for offering to give 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.250
 you do not have to change anything because 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.040
 this account the applications that you 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.270
 let's ask are already paid and there's 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.890
 what to do 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.080
 once you give with this users 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.660
 download both the applications that are going 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.970
 in the mail of Felix that you owed 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.680
 to arrive but on Monday you tell me how 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.420
 the applications of the two icons that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.050
 they came out on the desk that was the 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.150
 great from the set 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.940
 once you have finished remember 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.710
 always disconnect remember always 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.850
 you have to disconnect and you have to 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.680
 connect us again with your own 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.080
 user the staff to follow 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.030
 downloading your applications I hope 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.030
 that is worth this small tutorial
