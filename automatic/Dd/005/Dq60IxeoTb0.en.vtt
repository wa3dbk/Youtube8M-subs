I'm<00:00:03.430> not<00:00:03.639> at<00:00:04.170> 13:28<00:00:05.170> Ridgewood<00:00:05.920> looking<00:00:06.490> at<00:00:06.820> a

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
I'm not at 13:28 Ridgewood looking at a

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.100 
I'm not at 13:28 Ridgewood looking at a
standard<00:00:09.059> wisteria<00:00:10.120> it's<00:00:10.450> a<00:00:10.599> vine<00:00:10.809> that

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
standard wisteria it's a vine that

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.489 
standard wisteria it's a vine that
turned<00:00:11.440> into<00:00:11.650> a<00:00:11.830> tree<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:13.389> there<00:00:13.870> is<00:00:14.139> a<00:00:14.169> little

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:14.499 
turned into a tree and there is a little

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.109 
turned into a tree and there is a little
bit<00:00:14.650> of<00:00:14.769> a<00:00:14.829> problem<00:00:15.099> developing<00:00:15.879> with<00:00:15.999> this

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
bit of a problem developing with this

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.450 
bit of a problem developing with this
little<00:00:16.330> tree<00:00:16.539> the<00:00:17.230> foliage<00:00:17.650> suddenly<00:00:18.189> turned

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
little tree the foliage suddenly turned

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.300 
little tree the foliage suddenly turned
brown<00:00:18.849> and<00:00:19.269> the<00:00:20.050> client<00:00:20.439> called<00:00:20.650> me<00:00:20.800> up<00:00:21.039> and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
brown and the client called me up and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.130 
brown and the client called me up and
was<00:00:21.789> very<00:00:22.060> concerned<00:00:22.480> that<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.779> tree<00:00:22.990> is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
was very concerned that the tree is

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.980 
was very concerned that the tree is
dying<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:24.670> know<00:00:24.759> a<00:00:24.789> closer<00:00:25.119> inspection<00:00:25.539> of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
dying you know a closer inspection of

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.450 
dying you know a closer inspection of
the<00:00:26.140> tree<00:00:26.609> reveals<00:00:27.609> a<00:00:28.230> cankerous<00:00:29.230> growth<00:00:29.710> and

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
the tree reveals a cankerous growth and

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.060 
the tree reveals a cankerous growth and
all<00:00:30.669> these<00:00:30.820> little<00:00:30.939> nodules<00:00:31.660> are<00:00:32.070> developing

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
all these little nodules are developing

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.110 
all these little nodules are developing
on<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.520> trunk<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:34.719> tree<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:36.280> without

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
on the trunk of the tree so without

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.180 
on the trunk of the tree so without
tearing<00:00:37.690> this<00:00:37.780> apart<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:38.440> seeing<00:00:38.920> what's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
tearing this apart and seeing what's

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.069 
tearing this apart and seeing what's
going<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.730> down<00:00:40.000> here<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.300> would<00:00:40.570> say<00:00:40.809> that

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
going on down here I would say that

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.740 
going on down here I would say that
you've<00:00:41.829> got<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:42.100> trunk<00:00:42.789> canker<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:43.629> has

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
you've got a trunk canker that has

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.610 
you've got a trunk canker that has
developed<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:46.440> unfortunately<00:00:47.440> I'm<00:00:47.559> not

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
developed and unfortunately I'm not

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.849 
developed and unfortunately I'm not
familiar<00:00:47.980> with<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.989> sort<00:00:50.199> of<00:00:50.260> canker<00:00:50.680> on

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
familiar with this sort of canker on

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.160 
familiar with this sort of canker on
wisteria<00:00:51.489> I<00:00:51.760> have<00:00:52.120> not<00:00:52.270> seen<00:00:52.539> this<00:00:52.719> before<00:00:53.140> I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
wisteria I have not seen this before I

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.840 
wisteria I have not seen this before I
can<00:00:53.410> certainly<00:00:53.710> look<00:00:54.039> it<00:00:54.219> up<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.519> see<00:00:54.670> what

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
can certainly look it up and see what

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.939 
can certainly look it up and see what
what's<00:00:55.690> going<00:00:55.899> on<00:00:56.079> but<00:00:56.289> it<00:00:56.379> looks<00:00:56.590> like<00:00:56.649> it

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
what's going on but it looks like it

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.860 
what's going on but it looks like it
completely<00:00:57.269> constricted<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:58.390> base<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.809> the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
completely constricted the base of the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.340 
completely constricted the base of the
tree<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.940> see<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.969> lot<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.239> areas<00:01:01.510> around<00:01:01.840> here

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
tree I see a lot of areas around here

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.560 
tree I see a lot of areas around here
that<00:01:02.590> looks<00:01:03.460> like<00:01:03.609> there's<00:01:03.789> some<00:01:03.940> drying<00:01:04.210> out

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
that looks like there's some drying out

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
that looks like there's some drying out
so<00:01:05.009> it's<00:01:06.009> probably<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.400> combination<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:07.509> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
so it's probably a combination of a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.039 
so it's probably a combination of a
little<00:01:09.430> bit<00:01:09.520> of<00:01:09.610> basil<00:01:09.759> crown<00:01:10.210> rot<00:01:10.420> developing

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
little bit of basil crown rot developing

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.800 
little bit of basil crown rot developing
with<00:01:11.229> all<00:01:11.380> these<00:01:11.560> these<00:01:12.189> growths<00:01:12.549> in<00:01:12.820> here<00:01:13.119> so

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
with all these these growths in here so

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.830 
with all these these growths in here so
I<00:01:13.869> think<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.710> completely<00:01:15.310> cut<00:01:15.670> off<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.150> SAP

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
I think it completely cut off the SAP

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.969 
I think it completely cut off the SAP
flow<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.590> tree<00:01:17.799> of<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.220> tree<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.979> do

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
flow of the tree of the tree and I do

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.890 
flow of the tree of the tree and I do
believe<00:01:21.340> it<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.520> dead<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:25.119> not<00:01:25.150> very<00:01:25.570> well

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
believe it is dead it's not very well

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.440 
believe it is dead it's not very well
seated<00:01:26.680> in<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:26.950> ground<00:01:27.220> either<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.670> can<00:01:27.850> move

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
seated in the ground either I can move

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.920 
seated in the ground either I can move
it<00:01:28.689> I<00:01:28.869> could<00:01:29.409> push<00:01:29.619> it<00:01:29.650> over<00:01:30.070> quite<00:01:30.399> easily<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
it I could push it over quite easily so

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.539 
it I could push it over quite easily so
it'd<00:01:32.020> be<00:01:32.049> a<00:01:32.170> very<00:01:32.229> easy<00:01:32.439> thing<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.040> remove<00:01:33.310> you

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
it'd be a very easy thing to remove you

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.100 
it'd be a very easy thing to remove you
can<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.850> lean<00:01:34.030> on<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.479> it'll<00:01:34.570> break<00:01:34.840> off

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
can just lean on it and it'll break off

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.179 
can just lean on it and it'll break off
so<00:01:35.439> my<00:01:36.310> guess<00:01:36.579> is<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:37.060> there<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.780> some<00:01:38.189> root

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
so my guess is that there is some root

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.850 
so my guess is that there is some root
rot<00:01:39.430> down<00:01:39.640> in<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.850> base<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.860> it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
rot down in the base of this and it's

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.410 
rot down in the base of this and it's
more<00:01:42.130> it's<00:01:42.399> probably<00:01:42.460> a<00:01:42.729> combination<00:01:42.970> of

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
more it's probably a combination of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.090 
more it's probably a combination of
problems<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.990> does<00:01:44.140> seem<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.350> be<00:01:44.469> quite<00:01:44.740> moist

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
problems it does seem to be quite moist

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.179 
problems it does seem to be quite moist
in<00:01:45.369> here<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:46.509> will<00:01:46.780> definitely<00:01:47.110> reveal<00:01:47.770> itself

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
in here it will definitely reveal itself

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.590 
in here it will definitely reveal itself
when<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:48.579> pull<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.969> thing<00:01:49.240> out<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.540> the

when you pull this thing out of the

when you pull this thing out of the
ground<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.740> dig<00:01:50.950> up<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.340> stump<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:53.020> you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
ground and you dig up this stump if you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.340 
ground and you dig up this stump if you
see<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.380> lot<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.590> white<00:01:53.860> strand<00:01:54.369> e<00:01:54.549> mycelium<00:01:55.360> on

see a lot of white strand e mycelium on
the<00:01:56.619> roots<00:01:56.860> or<00:01:57.280> you'll<00:01:57.490> you'll<00:01:57.880> it'll<00:01:58.210> be

the roots or you'll you'll it'll be

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.550 
the roots or you'll you'll it'll be
quite<00:01:58.539> apparent<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.200> roots<00:01:59.380> are

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
quite apparent that the roots are

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.429 
quite apparent that the roots are
decayed<00:02:00.009> or<00:02:00.399> or<00:02:01.119> they'll<00:02:01.299> be<00:02:01.479> kind<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.140> soft

and spongy then it's more than likely a
water<00:02:07.440> induced<00:02:08.440> problem<00:02:09.070> too<00:02:09.910> much<00:02:10.120> water

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
water induced problem too much water

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.000 
water induced problem too much water
will<00:02:10.990> create<00:02:11.350> fungal<00:02:12.010> problems

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
will create fungal problems

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.420 
will create fungal problems
and<00:02:13.099> this<00:02:14.060> funny<00:02:14.900> canker<00:02:15.349> I'm<00:02:16.040> not<00:02:16.220> quite<00:02:16.400> sure

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and this funny canker I'm not quite sure

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.030 
and this funny canker I'm not quite sure
what<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.760> say<00:02:16.849> about<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
what to say about that

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.080 
what to say about that
interesting<00:02:19.040> though<00:02:19.220> I'm<00:02:19.640> gonna<00:02:19.760> take<00:02:19.970> this

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
interesting though I'm gonna take this

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.710 
interesting though I'm gonna take this
one<00:02:20.239> home<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.599> dissect<00:02:21.379> it<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:23.329> know<00:02:23.420> don't

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
one home and dissect it you know don't

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.509 
one home and dissect it you know don't
be<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.260> hurry<00:02:24.439> give<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.099> little<00:02:25.250> bit<00:02:25.430> of

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
be in a hurry give it a little bit of

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.130 
be in a hurry give it a little bit of
time<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.939> see<00:02:26.060> if<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.299> sprouts<00:02:26.569> out<00:02:26.870> because

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
time and see if it sprouts out because

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.649 
time and see if it sprouts out because
there's<00:02:27.319> still<00:02:27.530> some<00:02:28.209> flexibility<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.480> lot

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
there's still some flexibility in a lot

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.259 
there's still some flexibility in a lot
of<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.900> branches<00:02:30.409> but<00:02:30.620> your<00:02:31.459> hands<00:02:31.730> there<00:02:32.090> you

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
of the branches but your hands there you

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.440 
of the branches but your hands there you
can<00:02:32.420> see<00:02:32.599> they're<00:02:32.750> just<00:02:32.780> snapping<00:02:34.090> if<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.299> go

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
can see they're just snapping if you go

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.300 
can see they're just snapping if you go
to<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.810> larger<00:02:36.530> branches<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.040> they<00:02:37.129> all

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
to the larger branches and they all

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.920 
to the larger branches and they all
become<00:02:37.640> very<00:02:37.909> very<00:02:38.150> brittle<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.780> can

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
become very very brittle and you can

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.069 
become very very brittle and you can
just<00:02:39.109> snap<00:02:39.680> them<00:02:39.890> as<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.220> go<00:02:40.430> it'll<00:02:41.420> be<00:02:41.540> very

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
just snap them as you go it'll be very

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.630 
just snap them as you go it'll be very
apparent<00:02:42.349> that<00:02:42.560> there's<00:02:42.829> no<00:02:42.980> more<00:02:43.189> moisture

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
apparent that there's no more moisture

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.589 
apparent that there's no more moisture
in<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.109> I'd<00:02:45.109> give<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.010> I'd<00:02:46.970> give<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.390> few

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
in it I'd give it it I'd give it a few

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.809 
in it I'd give it it I'd give it a few
weeks<00:02:47.780> maybe<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.379> month<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.950> see<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.400> anything

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
weeks maybe a month and see if anything

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.339 
weeks maybe a month and see if anything
comes<00:02:49.849> out<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.569> starts<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.019> sprout<00:02:51.290> out

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
comes out and it starts to sprout out

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.300 
comes out and it starts to sprout out
but<00:02:51.829> I<00:02:51.859> doubt<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.579> highly<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.799> really<00:02:54.799> believe
