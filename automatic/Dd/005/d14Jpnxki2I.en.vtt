00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 It was dawn and I was walking through a lost field 

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:20.000
 Everything was peace and silence, just a prayer in the heart. I asked myself: 

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:25.000
 beyond these hills. In other lands, beyond my little world ... 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:30.000
 How can you give your word and shine your light? 

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.000
 Then the winds and torrential rains came, and they pushed me. 

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:41.000
 And his soft voice spoke to my heart, just walk ... 

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:50.000
 I will show you the way. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Now the path is before me and it takes me to see beyond the horizon, 

00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:01.000
 I did not know the days, the years or what would be beyond 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:04.500
 A stream that runs through a towering mountain, 

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.000
 flowers, thorns, an endless journey. 

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:12.000
 With every step I took, I had you there by my side. 

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.000
 Then came the day when He called you by your name, and took you to his side 

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:21.000
 I heard a voice that spoke to my heart. 

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.000
 You do not stay there looking at the sky, 

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.500
 do not let these moments pass by 

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:31.000
 A tired and hungry world is waiting for you 

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.500
 the path is long but do not fear. 

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.000
 get up, stand up and wipe away your tears, 

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:42.000
 I will be here by your side. 

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:49.000
 Forever. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Although the road is long we walk through it, we continue in your tracks 

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:11.000
 You taught us how to find our way, and how to listen to your voice. 

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:16.000
 But already the day was falling and the sun was hiding, 

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:21.000
 Filled with fatigue we feared dark night. 

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.000
 Then the storm came, we were completely alone. 

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:31.000
 And you seemed to be very far away, and we knew how to get back 

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:36.000
 and said Thomas, "How can we know the way?" 

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:41.000
 We do not know where you're going, why do not you stay? 

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:50.000
 Can not you see? It's too much for me 

00:02:51.001 --> 00:03:01.000
 "Do not be afraid, you already know the way" 

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.000
 Do not stay there looking at the sky 

00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:05.000
 do not let these moments pass by 

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:10.000
 A tired and hungry world is waiting for you. 

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.000
 The path is long but do not fear, get up 

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.000
 stand up and wipe away your tears, 

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:20.000
 I will be here by your side. 

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:22.000
 Do not stay there looking at the sky. 

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:29.000
 A tired and hungry world is waiting for you. 

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:32.000
 The path is long but do not fear, get up 

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:35.000
 stand up and wipe away your tears, 

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:39.000
 I will be here by your side. 

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:42.000
 I will be here with you 

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.000
 You know the way
