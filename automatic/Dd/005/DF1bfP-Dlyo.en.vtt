status but a wonderful silhouette and we

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
status but a wonderful silhouette and we
worked<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.070> hard<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.210> first

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
worked very hard for the very very first

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.660 
worked very hard for the very very first
sketches<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> first<00:00:55.890> models<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.550> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
sketches to the first models to get that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
sketches to the first models to get that
silhouette<00:00:57.059> right<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.750> William<00:00:58.050> lighter<00:00:58.350> than

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
silhouette right as William lighter than

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.529 
silhouette right as William lighter than
itself<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.879> know<00:01:00.000> I'm<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.180> create

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
itself and you know I'm really create

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
itself and you know I'm really create
these<00:01:00.600> fantastic<00:01:01.170> very<00:01:01.590> dramatic

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
these fantastic very dramatic

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
these fantastic very dramatic
proportions<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.910> that's<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> jagged

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
proportions because that's what a jagged

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
proportions because that's what a jagged
should<00:01:03.840> first<00:01:04.739> thing<00:01:04.949> was<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.220> wanted<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
should first thing was I wanted the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
should first thing was I wanted the
front<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.060> bold<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.049> create<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
front to be very bold and so we create a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.289 
front to be very bold and so we create a
grill<00:01:07.619> which<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.920> inspired<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> XF<00:01:08.820> which

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
grill which is inspired by the XF which

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.270 
grill which is inspired by the XF which
in<00:01:09.450> turn<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:09.780> inspired<00:01:10.229> by<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> original<00:01:10.500> xjs

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
in turn was inspired by the original xjs

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.770 
in turn was inspired by the original xjs
as<00:01:11.400> an<00:01:11.520> actual<00:01:11.640> lineage<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> thing

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
as an actual lineage there but the thing

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
as an actual lineage there but the thing
that<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.350> secret<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.610> you're<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.820> put<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that the secret is if you're gonna put a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
that the secret is if you're gonna put a
face<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.420> our<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.810> too<00:01:15.930> exaggerated

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
face like our is too exaggerated

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
face like our is too exaggerated
slightly<00:01:16.799> even<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> point<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.270> linking

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
slightly even the point is linking

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
slightly even the point is linking
comfortable<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.979> once<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
comfortable with it because once you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.920 
comfortable with it because once you
finish<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> car<00:01:21.180> comes<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> other<00:01:21.780> end

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
finish the car comes out the other end

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.289 
finish the car comes out the other end
there's<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> plea<00:01:22.680> object<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.700> has<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.060> still<00:01:24.240> be

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
there's a plea object it has to still be

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.030 
there's a plea object it has to still be
slightly<00:01:24.570> stirring<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.530> car<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
slightly stirring and this car has to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.530 
slightly stirring and this car has to
watch<00:01:26.220> two<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.520> three<00:01:26.670> years<00:01:26.909> into<00:01:27.090> its<00:01:27.299> life

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
watch two or three years into its life

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.350 
watch two or three years into its life
so<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.409> important<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.860> exaggerate<00:01:29.790> the

and what we did in this car was stretch

that graphic as far as we could it
started<00:02:21.300> here<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.660> pull<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.990> as<00:02:22.140> far<00:02:22.350> forward

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
started here we pull this as far forward

started here we pull this as far forward
as<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:22.890> good<00:02:23.130> we<00:02:23.640> call<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.030> far<00:02:24.570> back<00:02:24.900> towards

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
the rear car stretching is as far as

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.930 
the rear car stretching is as far as
this<00:02:28.230> unnaturally<00:02:29.100> beyond<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> rear<00:02:29.730> wheel

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
this unnaturally beyond the rear wheel

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.670 
this unnaturally beyond the rear wheel
but<00:02:30.300> what<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.450> mean<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:30.810> slid<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.230> down<00:02:31.260> slightly

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
but what I mean we slid it down slightly

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.350 
but what I mean we slid it down slightly
and<00:02:31.830> what<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.250> does<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.820> actually<00:02:32.940> give<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
and what this does is actually give the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.270 
and what this does is actually give the
car<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.750> visual<00:02:34.230> length<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.710> car<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.040> only<00:02:35.190> a
