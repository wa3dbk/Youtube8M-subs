00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
shadow goes bad some Heath jeeps by

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
shadow goes bad some Heath jeeps by
using<00:01:51.840> their<00:01:52.049> shoes<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.590> he's<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> hedgehog

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
using their shoes but he's a hedgehog

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
using their shoes but he's a hedgehog
Hedgehog<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.299> fast<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.869> since<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.619> Sonic

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
Hedgehog can go fast but since I'm Sonic

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.249 
Hedgehog can go fast but since I'm Sonic
the<00:01:56.219> Hedgehog<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.899> fast<00:01:58.170> yes<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
the Hedgehog I can go the fast yes so I

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.980 
the Hedgehog I can go the fast yes so I
really<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:05.250> why<00:02:05.719> hedgehogs<00:02:06.719> are

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
really think that's why hedgehogs are

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.430 
really think that's why hedgehogs are
way<00:02:07.200> cooler<00:02:07.740> than<00:02:08.060> porcupines<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:10.020> we're

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
way cooler than porcupines because we're

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.180 
way cooler than porcupines because we're
