little<00:01:50.150> locust<00:01:50.540> swarm<00:01:50.960> for<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.470> background

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.109 

that<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.970> inked<00:01:56.540> up<00:01:56.690> just<00:01:57.530> now<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.910> going

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
that I inked up just now this is going

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.030 
that I inked up just now this is going
to<00:02:02.180> be<00:02:02.330> basically<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:03.170> main<00:02:03.350> piece<00:02:03.770> right

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
locusts coming in right here this would

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.850 
locusts coming in right here this would
be<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.920> front<00:02:30.250> cover<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:31.090> square<00:02:31.860> focus

be the front cover this square focus
coming<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> satellite<00:02:33.670> dudes<00:02:34.120> going<00:02:34.360> to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
coming in the satellite dudes going to

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.910 
coming in the satellite dudes going to
be<00:02:34.540> sitting<00:02:34.870> there<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.200> then<00:02:35.349> this<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.560> like

very old ratty boot this is smart my
foot<00:03:10.269> Kevin<00:03:10.540> was<00:03:10.810> working<00:03:11.230> on<00:03:11.349> today<00:03:11.769> or

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
foot Kevin was working on today or

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.460 
foot Kevin was working on today or
hanging<00:03:13.120> out<00:03:13.269> listening<00:03:13.689> to<00:03:14.620> some<00:03:15.099> music<00:03:15.129> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
hanging out listening to some music I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.369 
hanging out listening to some music I
think<00:03:17.470> it's<00:03:17.620> pretty<00:03:17.769> cool<00:03:19.920> looks<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:21.129> a<00:03:21.159> guy

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
think it's pretty cool looks like a guy

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.759 
think it's pretty cool looks like a guy
with<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.500> tier<00:03:26.549> cacti<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:27.579> guess<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.360> plan<00:03:28.629> it

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
with the tier cacti I guess and plan it

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.390 
with the tier cacti I guess and plan it
looks<00:03:29.769> pretty<00:03:29.980> cool<00:03:31.290> maybe<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.799> variant

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
looks pretty cool maybe like a variant

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.860 
looks pretty cool maybe like a variant
