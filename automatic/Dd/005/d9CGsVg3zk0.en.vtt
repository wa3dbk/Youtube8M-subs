00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 all 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.670
 and 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.059
 I'm coming back for a new video so 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.010
 it will be the blog of my return to high school 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.170
 so in second 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.770
 you asked me a lot this video 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.940
 is also I was bombarded dsna in 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.740
 asking how had my 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.140
 back and so it's early I 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.610
 answered I answered and after that it was 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.830
 more possible because I had it all 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.570
 time but really then more 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.469
 just still explain so I 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.210
 really took a lot of time to 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.410
 every answer is so here I am 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.020
 really apologize if I did not answer 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.640
 at your usual synap responded and he 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.260
 had really nice so for 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.120
 start nothing to do with the video 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.220
 it's really off topic I'm 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.020
 cut the hair a little bit I 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.579
 do that but see you before 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.220
 it was just below the shoulders 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.110
 and maintenance and occupies shoulders 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.270
 here I wanted to want now 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.270
 pass about videos so my 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.470
 returned so washed up crappy engineering beautiful 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.600
 number 13 is maintained it's really 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.829
 troubled a disorder in hand even though I 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 did three ladies many think 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.759
 really house of these three outfits and 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.080
 finally I did not want to 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.880
 put one of these three better I had 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.880
 want to change and I struggled to 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.940
 find an outfit that suited me 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.710
 frankly I tried everything here I am 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.200
 I had prepared my bag and where the day before 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.850
 and we do not deny anything at all 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.280
 asleep she was great would be mostly 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.619
 I listened rather late but my part 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.280
 a single wrinkle and so does it seem 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.299
 normal as you saw in the video 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.970
 getty lies in what you eat 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.010
 stella and then I left so 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.970
 I took the goal of this hour so who 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.330
 brings me to 7:25 am launched for 8 hours 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.060
 where it's a bit early I joined 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.800
 one of my girlfriends so sarah and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.140
 other girlfriends I knew from 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.330
 the primary so it hopes in time I 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.800
 could not but here we are 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.540
 enough turn when we have the time to 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.250
 look at classes to spot on 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.600
 had to go do that to spot a 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.210
 to leave it like that we were not 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.560
 stressed not in a hurry and in the class I 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.570
 know two people one who was in 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.490
 my premium and that it was great 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.290
 a long time I do not want that I did not have 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.690
 spoken we do not know we start with 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.700
 during class and one of cm2 so of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.380
 primary school but I only knew of 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.450
 end view here it was not a girlfriend of 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.080
 cm2 it was just a person who was 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.720
 with me 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.480
 but here it is but finally it's good 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.610
 spoken and if not the other people from 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.220
 the place well that's going to talk discuss a 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.920
 little with the people the place but I 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.250
 do not have many affinities yet 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.500
 with one person but hey I think 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.270
 that that as and when flying with 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.140
 Wednesday which two days ago that are 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.610
 past and there is a subscriber actually who 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 is in my class but she has not 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.430
 spoken but I knew and who subscribed to 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.480
 my chain after her beautiful in Lille but 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 maybe she'll see her videos 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.630
 so I pity you a lot but it's 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.080
 strange enough to have someone following 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.340
 this video in his class but so 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.530
 I am myself in my videos have 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.540
 more the same outside but that's it 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.650
 it's quite strange helped by josÃ© at that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.240
 will make a killer target an asset but you 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.460
 here I am staying myself 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.390
 two years ago and if not I know 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.960
 other sites in other classes 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.480
 and their slums several granulometries 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.710
 very small here after I do not have the most 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.380
 little of my class though maybe but not 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.900
 do not ruin the high school shop but I 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.000
 think I was actually the babies 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.370
 debate because at chaumont meal then in 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.570
 second while hong thai game almost 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.450
 the same size khaimah while she is 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.820
 in terminal and I think it was going 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.590
 not see my head again do not really go 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.990
 lucky even lucky same sum 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.670
 context times more than that this time I 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.990

 runs to the site would be Monday monday 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.810

 I point at 8 o'clock point kind 13:30 to 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.490
 18h so in fact I have one of the courses 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.780
 so it'll be a little boring the good 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.970

 long hair for 1 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:41.080
 where the wind opens the door tel 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.499
