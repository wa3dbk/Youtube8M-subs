are<00:00:40.909> a<00:00:41.000> couple<00:00:41.149> ways<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.449> do<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.839> but<00:00:42.260> it

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
are a couple ways to do this but it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.540 
are a couple ways to do this but it
works<00:00:42.500> best<00:00:42.739> when<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:42.949> come<00:00:43.190> in<00:00:43.309> on<00:00:43.370> your

here he can drop the puck back to Martin

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.770 
here he can drop the puck back to Martin
on<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.890> point<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.180> would<00:01:14.299> likely<00:01:14.509> get

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
on the point but it would likely get

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.530 
on the point but it would likely get
picked<00:01:15.020> off<00:01:15.200> by<00:01:15.439> McArthur<00:01:15.979> he<00:01:16.970> could<00:01:17.119> also<00:01:17.270> do

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
picked off by McArthur he could also do

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.990 
picked off by McArthur he could also do
a<00:01:17.570> drop<00:01:17.869> pass<00:01:18.079> to<00:01:18.380> Malkin<00:01:18.829> again<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:19.520> this<00:01:19.729> too

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
a drop pass to Malkin again but this too

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.450 
a drop pass to Malkin again but this too
could<00:01:20.299> be<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.420> turnover<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.439> Carlson<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:22.220> time

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
could be a turnover to Carlson this time

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.149 
could be a turnover to Carlson this time
however<00:01:23.390> this<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.080> cross<00:01:24.380> crease<00:01:24.680> tutorial

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
however this is a cross crease tutorial

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.200 
however this is a cross crease tutorial
so<00:01:25.250> we're<00:01:25.400> going<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.670> go<00:01:25.790> for<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.000> cross

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
so we're going to go for the cross

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.270 
so we're going to go for the cross
crease<00:01:26.570> there's<00:01:27.170> one<00:01:27.409> incredibly<00:01:27.890> important

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
crease there's one incredibly important

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.040 
crease there's one incredibly important
element<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.700> dishing<00:01:29.180> these<00:01:29.330> cross<00:01:29.600> creases

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
element to dishing these cross creases

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.320 
element to dishing these cross creases
and<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.680> protecting<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.280> puck<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:32.210> can

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
and that is protecting the puck you can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.000 
and that is protecting the puck you can
protect<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.780> puck<00:01:32.960> by<00:01:33.170> holding<00:01:33.590> down<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.979> a

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
protect the puck by holding down the a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.580 
protect the puck by holding down the a
button<00:01:34.400> if<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.060> notice<00:01:35.630> by<00:01:35.960> protecting<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
button if you notice by protecting the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.770 
button if you notice by protecting the
puck<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:37.220> opens<00:01:37.670> up<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:37.909> lane<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.450> goes<00:01:38.510> in

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
puck it opens up a lane that goes in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.570
