it<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:19.439> believe<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> bar<00:01:20.070> should

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it to be we believe the bar should

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.539 
it to be we believe the bar should
remain<00:01:20.579> in<00:01:20.729> place<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:20.969> about<00:01:21.240> two<00:01:21.600> years<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
remain in place for about two years and

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
remain in place for about two years and
that's<00:01:23.549> based<00:01:23.969> on<00:01:24.179> our<00:01:24.509> extensive<00:01:25.049> experience

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that's based on our extensive experience

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
that's based on our extensive experience
with<00:01:25.710> pectus<00:01:26.070> excavatum<00:01:26.460> where<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> chest

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with pectus excavatum where the chest

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.520 
with pectus excavatum where the chest
pushes<00:01:28.530> inwardly<00:01:28.979> instead<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.670> outwardly<00:01:30.530> and

pushes inwardly instead of outwardly and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
pushes inwardly instead of outwardly and
in<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> condition<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.609> found<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.030> at<00:01:33.149> least

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
in that condition we found that at least

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.529 
in that condition we found that at least
two<00:01:33.539> years<00:01:33.749> is<00:01:34.280> necessary<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> keep<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.729> chest

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
two years is necessary to keep the chest

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.539 
two years is necessary to keep the chest
from<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:37.530> back<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.920> its<00:01:38.070> original<00:01:38.159> position

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
from going back to its original position

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.270 
from going back to its original position
after<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> bar<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.570> taken<00:01:39.929> out<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.890> believe

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
after the bar is taken out we believe

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
after the bar is taken out we believe
that<00:01:41.609> the<00:01:42.329> most<00:01:42.539> sensible<00:01:42.929> time<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.829> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that the most sensible time to do it is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
that the most sensible time to do it is
when<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.219> child<00:01:44.490> has<00:01:44.609> achieved<00:01:45.119> most<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
when the child has achieved most of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.919 
when the child has achieved most of
their<00:01:45.929> skeletal<00:01:46.530> growth<00:01:46.679> between<00:01:47.310> 15<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.119> 18

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
their skeletal growth between 15 and 18

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.139 
their skeletal growth between 15 and 18
or<00:01:49.289> 19<00:01:49.319> years<00:01:49.859> old<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.850> were<00:01:50.999> no

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
or 19 years old there were no

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.880 
or 19 years old there were no
difficulties<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:51.960> operation<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.799> then

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
difficulties with operation and then

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.080 
difficulties with operation and then
patients<00:01:53.130> haven't<00:01:53.640> experienced

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
patients haven't experienced

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.539 
patients haven't experienced
complications<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.109> we're<00:01:55.380> we're<00:01:56.340> very

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
