those would be your P geez it's gone
deep<00:00:45.100> which<00:00:45.280> is<00:00:45.430> time<00:00:45.610> now<00:00:45.820> there<00:00:46.059> we<00:00:46.239> go

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
deep which is time now there we go

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.319 
deep which is time now there we go
a<00:00:50.280> bunch<00:00:51.280> of<00:00:51.519> different<00:00:52.059> challenge<00:00:52.420> here

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
a bunch of different challenge here

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.880 
a bunch of different challenge here
let's<00:00:55.329> go<00:00:55.510> back<00:00:55.540> steeper<00:00:56.079> channels<00:00:56.470> let's<00:00:56.710> see

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
let's go back steeper channels let's see

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.899 
let's go back steeper channels let's see
if<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.070> come<00:00:57.339> here<00:00:57.519> anything<00:00:59.309> is<00:01:00.309> going<00:01:00.579> to<00:01:00.790> be

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
if I come here anything is going to be

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:08.399 
if I come here anything is going to be
on<00:01:01.000> Tools<00:01:06.479> seems<00:01:07.479> like<00:01:07.689> it's<00:01:07.869> going<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.110> take<00:01:08.229> a

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
on Tools seems like it's going to take a

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.510 
on Tools seems like it's going to take a
while<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.909> we<00:01:13.090> go<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:15.780> bad<00:01:17.009> quality

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
while there we go really bad quality

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.660 
while there we go really bad quality
though<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:20.530> probably<00:01:20.890> explainable

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
though that's probably explainable

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.960 
though that's probably explainable
because<00:01:22.509> if<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.930> go<00:01:23.140> on<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.560> client<00:01:25.229> yeah

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
because if I go on to the client yeah

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.969 
because if I go on to the client yeah
we'll<00:01:27.970> have<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:29.409> bad<00:01:29.530> reception<00:01:31.680> 17%<00:01:32.680> is

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
we'll have really bad reception 17% is

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.440 
we'll have really bad reception 17% is
that<00:01:33.159> 70%<00:01:33.790> yeah<00:01:34.770> exactly<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.490> I'm<00:01:37.120> quite<00:01:37.300> sure

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
that 70% yeah exactly so I'm quite sure

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.350 
that 70% yeah exactly so I'm quite sure
of<00:01:37.480> where<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.840> fix<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.820> have<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.090> winner

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
of where to fix that we have a winner

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.310 
of where to fix that we have a winner
and<00:01:40.780> scroll<00:01:41.110> back<00:01:44.370> yeah<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:46.810> it's<00:01:47.080> quite

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
and scroll back yeah so it's it's quite

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.429 
and scroll back yeah so it's it's quite
bad<00:01:48.240> otherwise<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:51.220> seems<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.640> be<00:01:51.760> working
