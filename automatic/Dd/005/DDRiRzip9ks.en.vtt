00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:11.859 

ah<00:00:07.900> the<00:00:08.900> orchestra<00:00:10.120> it's<00:00:11.120> just<00:00:11.420> a<00:00:11.510> group<00:00:11.719> of

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:11.869 
ah the orchestra it's just a group of

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.980 
ah the orchestra it's just a group of
musicians<00:00:12.080> getting<00:00:12.830> together<00:00:12.950> to<00:00:13.400> make<00:00:13.549> music

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
musicians getting together to make music

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.500 
musicians getting together to make music
how<00:00:14.990> do<00:00:15.049> they<00:00:15.230> make<00:00:15.440> these<00:00:15.619> instruments<00:00:15.860> work

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
how do they make these instruments work

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.830 
how do they make these instruments work
which<00:00:17.510> instruments<00:00:18.140> are<00:00:18.259> related<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:18.859> why<00:00:19.840> to

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
which instruments are related and why to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.109 
which instruments are related and why to
start<00:00:21.050> we<00:00:21.710> can<00:00:21.740> break<00:00:22.039> the<00:00:22.220> instruments<00:00:22.789> into

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
start we can break the instruments into

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.859 
start we can break the instruments into
four<00:00:23.390> families<00:00:24.669> each<00:00:25.669> family<00:00:26.240> is<00:00:26.359> grouped<00:00:26.630> by

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
four families each family is grouped by

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.060 
four families each family is grouped by
the<00:00:26.929> way<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.439> instrument<00:00:27.859> produces

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
the way the instrument produces

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.689 
the way the instrument produces
vibration<00:00:29.679> this<00:00:30.679> kind<00:00:31.009> of<00:00:31.130> classification

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
vibration this kind of classification

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.960 
vibration this kind of classification
gives<00:00:32.450> us<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.840> string<00:00:33.140> family<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:34.550> woodwind

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
gives us the string family the woodwind

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.960 
gives us the string family the woodwind
family<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:36.200> brass<00:00:36.500> family<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.490> the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
family the brass family and the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.770 
family the brass family and the
percussion<00:00:38.570> family<00:00:40.240> when<00:00:41.240> you<00:00:41.330> think<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
percussion family when you think of the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.960 
percussion family when you think of the
orchestra<00:00:41.960> you<00:00:42.560> most<00:00:43.160> likely<00:00:43.400> think<00:00:43.730> of<00:00:43.850> the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
orchestra you most likely think of the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.910 
orchestra you most likely think of the
violin<00:00:44.390> or<00:00:44.600> at<00:00:44.840> least<00:00:45.020> some<00:00:45.350> sort<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.650> string

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
violin or at least some sort of string

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.790 
violin or at least some sort of string
instrument<00:00:46.630> this<00:00:47.630> is<00:00:47.780> probably<00:00:48.200> because<00:00:48.470> they

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
instrument this is probably because they

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.920 
instrument this is probably because they
make<00:00:49.070> up<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.460> majority<00:00:49.580> of<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.300> instruments

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
make up the majority of the instruments

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.310 
make up the majority of the instruments
in<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.140> orchestra<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.100> good<00:00:52.550> thinking<00:00:53.320> all

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
in the orchestra so good thinking all

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.680 
in the orchestra so good thinking all
string<00:00:54.950> instruments<00:00:55.490> use<00:00:55.640> string<00:00:56.030> vibration

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
string instruments use string vibration

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.470 
string instruments use string vibration
to<00:00:57.020> produce<00:00:57.350> sound<00:00:57.650> so<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.850> makes<00:00:59.060> sense<00:00:59.150> that

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
to produce sound so it makes sense that

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.950 
to produce sound so it makes sense that
they<00:00:59.690> are<00:00:59.720> called<00:01:00.080> the<00:01:00.230> string<00:01:00.500> family<00:01:01.960> there

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
they are called the string family there

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.530 
they are called the string family there
are<00:01:02.990> four<00:01:03.470> main<00:01:03.890> string<00:01:04.220> instruments<00:01:04.759> these

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
are four main string instruments these

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.860 
are four main string instruments these
are<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.140> violin<00:01:06.620> the<00:01:07.310> viola<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.000> cello<00:01:08.600> and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
are the violin the viola the cello and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
are the violin the viola the cello and
the<00:01:08.960> bass<00:01:10.720> each<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.960> these<00:01:12.080> instruments<00:01:12.710> can

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
the bass each of these instruments can

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.600 
the bass each of these instruments can
be<00:01:12.920> plucked<00:01:13.370> or<00:01:13.610> bowed<00:01:14.060> as<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:15.800> can<00:01:15.950> see<00:01:16.160> here

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
be plucked or bowed as you can see here

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.910 
be plucked or bowed as you can see here
the<00:01:17.540> main<00:01:17.780> difference<00:01:18.230> between<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.710> four

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
the main difference between the four

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.630 
the main difference between the four
instruments<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.640> their<00:01:19.940> size<00:01:20.270> as<00:01:21.400> with<00:01:22.400> any

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
instruments is their size as with any

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.180 
instruments is their size as with any
instrument<00:01:23.120> smaller<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:25.010> higher

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
instrument smaller it is the higher

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.860 
instrument smaller it is the higher
pitches<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.970> plays<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:29.330> larger<00:01:29.840> the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
pitches it plays and the larger the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.110 
pitches it plays and the larger the
instrument<00:01:30.409> is<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.560> lower<00:01:31.010> pitches<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.760> plays

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
instrument is the lower pitches it plays

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.360 
instrument is the lower pitches it plays
the<00:01:35.170> very<00:01:36.170> common<00:01:36.590> arrangement<00:01:37.100> would<00:01:37.220> have

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
the very common arrangement would have

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.700 
the very common arrangement would have
the<00:01:37.520> violins<00:01:37.970> playing<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.450> melody<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.960> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
the violins playing the melody and the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.010 
the violins playing the melody and the
violas<00:01:40.159> cellos<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.670> basses<00:01:41.020> playing

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
violas cellos and basses playing

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.610 
violas cellos and basses playing
supporting<00:01:42.560> roles<00:01:43.810> this<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.990> not<00:01:45.140> always<00:01:45.409> the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
supporting roles this is not always the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.820 
supporting roles this is not always the
case<00:01:45.799> but<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.640> important<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.299> know<00:01:47.830> these

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
case but it's important to know these

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.680 
case but it's important to know these
instruments<00:01:49.310> are<00:01:49.640> some<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.150> oldest

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the music was being played the next

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.309 
the music was being played the next
largest<00:02:19.910> section<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.629> orchestra<00:02:21.140> is

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
largest section of the orchestra is

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:36.530 
largest section of the orchestra is
usually<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.129> woodwind<00:02:22.610> family

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.300 

most<00:02:37.540> woodwind<00:02:37.960> instruments<00:02:38.560> use<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.950> small

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
most woodwind instruments use a small

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.130 
most woodwind instruments use a small
piece<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.580> wood<00:02:39.790> called<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.300> reed<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.960> produce

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
piece of wood called a reed to produce

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.820 
piece of wood called a reed to produce
their<00:02:41.440> vibration<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.840> reed<00:02:44.080> vibrates<00:02:44.110> when

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
their vibration the reed vibrates when

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.370 
their vibration the reed vibrates when
air<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.190> blown<00:02:45.430> across<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.230> how

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
air is blown across it this is how

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.270 
air is blown across it this is how
instruments<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.310> clarinet<00:02:48.760> work

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
instruments like the clarinet work

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.060 
instruments like the clarinet work
saxophones<00:02:51.280> also<00:02:51.760> use<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> reed<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.860> why

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
saxophones also use a reed this is why

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.770 
saxophones also use a reed this is why
they<00:02:54.280> are<00:02:54.310> classified<00:02:54.820> as<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.120> woodwind<00:02:55.570> and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
they are classified as a woodwind and

parts called a double reed instruments

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.650 
parts called a double reed instruments
like<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.770> oboe<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.460> bassoon<00:03:18.820> use<00:03:19.630> a

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
there's also one woodwind which uses

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
there's also one woodwind which uses
just<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.110> wind<00:03:32.350> part<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.430> flute<00:03:34.620> the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
just the wind part it's the flute the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.820 
just the wind part it's the flute the
flute<00:03:35.650> does<00:03:36.160> not<00:03:36.490> have<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> reed<00:03:37.530> instead<00:03:38.530> the

flute does not have a reed instead the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.620 
flute does not have a reed instead the
player<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:39.340> blows<00:03:39.520> across<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> hole<00:03:40.240> in<00:03:40.480> the
