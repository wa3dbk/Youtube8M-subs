00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
moving on to the other side now try and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.030 
moving on to the other side now try and
do<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.079> least<00:01:55.229> once<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.560> week<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.860> start

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
do this at least once a week to start

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
do this at least once a week to start
with<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> benefits<00:01:57.119> are

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
with just to see what the benefits are

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.569 
with just to see what the benefits are
like<00:01:57.630> over<00:01:58.290> time<00:01:58.710> you'll<00:01:58.920> develop<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
like over time you'll develop it and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.740 
like over time you'll develop it and
there's<00:01:59.969> nothing<00:02:00.210> wrong<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.360> doing<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
there's nothing wrong with doing it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.340 
there's nothing wrong with doing it
after<00:02:00.899> every<00:02:01.290> ride<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> moving<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> car

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
after every ride so moving on to the car

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.109 
after every ride so moving on to the car
stretch<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> place<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.939> foam

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
stretch now going to place the foam

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.910

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
start rolling up that muscle so if your

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.920 
start rolling up that muscle so if your
foam<00:02:11.819> roller<00:02:12.000> make<00:02:12.209> sure<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.480> don't<00:02:12.660> cross

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
foam roller make sure you don't cross

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.030 
foam roller make sure you don't cross
any<00:02:13.080> joint

any joint

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.660 
any joint
so<00:02:14.159> we're<00:02:14.280> not<00:02:14.430> trying<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:16.370> stretch<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.549> those

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
so we're not trying to stretch out those

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.800 
so we're not trying to stretch out those
joints<00:02:18.090> we're<00:02:18.180> trying<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.390> stretch<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:18.689> those

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
joints we're trying to stretch out those

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.899 
joints we're trying to stretch out those
muscles<00:02:19.040> trying<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.099> relax<00:02:20.340> those<00:02:20.489> muscles

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.050 

and<00:02:23.909> roll<00:02:24.629> back<00:02:24.780> down<00:02:24.829> swap<00:02:25.829> it<00:02:25.980> around<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.909> you

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and roll back down swap it around as you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.179 
and roll back down swap it around as you
can<00:02:27.209> see<00:02:27.420> I'm<00:02:28.110> using<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.620> other<00:02:28.709> foam<00:02:28.980> roll

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
can see I'm using the other foam roll

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.319 
can see I'm using the other foam roll
now<00:02:29.599> this<00:02:30.599> one's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> lot<00:02:30.989> smoother<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:33.150> lot

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
now this one's a lot smoother and a lot

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.059 
now this one's a lot smoother and a lot
easier<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:33.780> if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.079> do<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.560> some<00:02:34.860> tight

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
easier so if you do have some tight

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.789 
easier so if you do have some tight
spots<00:02:35.400> tight<00:02:36.060> muscles<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.409> a<00:02:37.440> smooth

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799

advance on to the knobbly ones so you're

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.759 
advance on to the knobbly ones so you're

it's the ITB stretch iliotibial band
we're<00:02:59.459> going<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.609> start<00:02:59.970> off<00:03:00.090> with<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.299> hip

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
we're going to start off with the hip

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.470 
we're going to start off with the hip
and<00:03:00.540> were<00:03:00.629> going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.810> roll<00:03:00.959> down<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.409> knee

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.330 

now<00:03:32.230> we're<00:03:32.380> going<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.530> foam<00:03:32.740> roll<00:03:32.770> those<00:03:33.070> lats

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
now we're going to foam roll those lats

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.010 
now we're going to foam roll those lats
out<00:03:33.580> anybody<00:03:34.210> that's<00:03:34.420> been<00:03:34.450> sighting<00:03:34.930> the

saddle for a while is going to have bad
posture<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.210> need<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.480> correct<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:37.900> so

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410

we're<00:03:39.040> going<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.220> roll<00:03:39.370> down<00:03:39.610> all<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.600> way

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
we're going to roll down all the way

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.810 
we're going to roll down all the way
down<00:03:40.960> onto<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.380> floor<00:03:41.550> we're<00:03:42.550> going<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.730> get

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
down onto the floor we're going to get

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.790 
down onto the floor we're going to get
that<00:03:42.970> foam<00:03:43.660> roll<00:03:43.870> right<00:03:44.140> under<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:44.440> armpit

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
that foam roll right under that armpit

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.580 
that foam roll right under that armpit
and<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:45.160> turn<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.490> your<00:03:45.580> side<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:47.530> just

and just turn to your side and it's just

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.790 
and just turn to your side and it's just
a<00:03:47.800> small<00:03:47.980> movement<00:03:48.430> just<00:03:48.790> under<00:03:49.120> here<00:03:49.800> so

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
a small movement just under here so
