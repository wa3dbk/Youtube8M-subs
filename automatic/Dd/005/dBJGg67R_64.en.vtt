 government regulations on the application

 water meters according to housing 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.769

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.570
 Leningrad region 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.939
 metering devices are equipped with no more 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.590
 forty percent of the apartments why the process 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.570
 installation of meters that must 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.829
 help tenants save on rent 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.439

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.029
 Nikolai Korneev asked a question 40 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.739
 percent of apartments equipped you up to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.140
 damn area counters at first glance 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.000
 good rate almost half but for 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.640
 comparison of Petersburg where residents in 3 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.560
 times more sealed 68 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.950
 percent of households people think that 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.690
 all this is legislative projects on 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.090
 about the installation of meters this is all 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.940
 just another money extortion 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.950
 from the population though this is far from true 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.120
 such a popular opinion first years 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.010
 energy saving reforms 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 contributed by unscrupulous 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.040
 utilities taking advantage of bad 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.690
 public awareness instead 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.520
 set by law free 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.290
 sealing up some apartments 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.720
 utilities officers took the installation 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.340
 metering devices money unlike flax 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.650
 the area of St. Petersburg is still easier 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.280
 to work because I give up 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.960
 with them it is easier to find a compromise rather than 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.720
 Leningrad region in the flax region of the city 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.880
 small and utilities respectively small 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.799
 to achieve quality plumbing 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.049
 work damn year of control developed 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.670
 your know-how every plumber visit 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.740
 ends with a phone call 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 operator of the company after each 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.500
 the work we do have a conversation with 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.190
 the client is doing the control 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.950
 work quality is punctuality 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.400
 politeness and quality of service performed 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.439
 We try to choose the material quality 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.930
 we exclude China completely only either 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.530
 Our manufacturers are either German 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.600
 Italian 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.490
 quality floor counters are often 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.530
 apartment owners postpones 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.810
 sealing due to the plumbers themselves 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.939
 plumber associated with the image of Athos 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.920
 not wanting to mess with not complicated 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.140
 profitable case for example this one 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.500
 the situation here is four companies 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.580
 refused installed counter for 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.830
 access problems 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.900
 if our plumber says that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.910
 impossible to install or leave 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.150
 service quality engineer 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.550
 customers or it is like this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.370
 situations I left for the object myself 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.650
 Of course, this is often what they themselves 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.900
 directors come check quality 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.630
 work situation with poor quality 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.860
 services in the field of housing and communal services 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.930
 water meters or wiring 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.400
 soon change damn water control 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.410
 consider required from their own 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.060
 highly qualified specialists 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.130
 can bring up the discerning 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.990
 consumer doing so 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.700
 services market of the Leningrad region and 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.700
 Petersburg more competitive
