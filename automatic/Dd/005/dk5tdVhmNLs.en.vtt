00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
value King CPUs out there but I'm going

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350 
value King CPUs out there but I'm going
to<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:43.980> testing<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.399> myself<00:00:44.789> doing<00:00:45.090> my<00:00:45.329> own

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
to be testing it myself doing my own

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.720 
to be testing it myself doing my own
testing<00:00:46.079> against<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.559> 670<00:00:46.980> k<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> then

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
testing against for 670 k and then

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.810 
testing against for 670 k and then
making<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.210> realist<00:00:48.600> realistic<00:00:49.289> real<00:00:49.469> world

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
making some realist realistic real world

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.650 
making some realist realistic real world
recommendations<00:00:50.820> once<00:00:51.030> I've<00:00:51.210> tested

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
recommendations once I've tested

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
recommendations once I've tested
everything<00:00:51.989> thoroughly<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.039> let's<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
everything thoroughly so let's have a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.979 
everything thoroughly so let's have a
look<00:00:53.520> today<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.239> onto<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
look today what we get onto the in the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.369 
look today what we get onto the in the
box<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.120> yeah<00:00:57.120> let's<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.289> get

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
box and yeah let's just see what we get

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.410 
box and yeah let's just see what we get
in<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.530> box<00:00:58.739> okay<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.180> get

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
in the box okay so this is what you get

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.720 
in the box okay so this is what you get
you<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:01.379> box<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.250> about<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> same

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
you get a little box it's about the same

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.810 
you get a little box it's about the same
size<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.210> Intel's<00:01:03.629> box<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.260> guess<00:01:04.700> maybe<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
size as Intel's box I guess maybe a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
size as Intel's box I guess maybe a
little<00:01:05.939> bit<00:01:06.119> bigger<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> says

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
little bit bigger so this is as it says

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
little bit bigger so this is as it says
here<00:01:07.920> AMD<00:01:08.490> eight-core<00:01:09.330> processor<00:01:09.360> Black

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
here AMD eight-core processor Black

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
here AMD eight-core processor Black
Edition<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:11.060> straight<00:01:12.060> away<00:01:12.240> you'll<00:01:12.390> notice

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
Edition now straight away you'll notice

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.660 
Edition now straight away you'll notice
with<00:01:13.049> intel<00:01:13.439> processors<00:01:14.010> two<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.610> one

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
with intel processors two and this one

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
with intel processors two and this one
is<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> comes<00:01:15.330> sealed<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.259> seals

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is it comes sealed so if that seals

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.760 
is it comes sealed so if that seals
broken<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.640> i<00:01:17.909> recommend<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.049> maybe<00:01:19.530> take

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
broken then i recommend you maybe take

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
broken then i recommend you maybe take
it<00:01:19.920> back<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> store<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:20.960> honestly

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
it back to the store because honestly

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.910 
it back to the store because honestly
they<00:01:22.200> may<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.740> simply<00:01:24.259> bend<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.470> chip<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
they may have simply bend the chip the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
they may have simply bend the chip the
store<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.759> stores<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> bend

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
store that you some stores like to bend

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
store that you some stores like to bend
chips<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.280> sell<00:01:29.549> them<00:01:29.670> on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
chips you know and then sell them on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.160 
chips you know and then sell them on
we're<00:01:30.210> about<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.659> i<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.049> but

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
we're about and i really know but

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.719 
we're about and i really know but
basically<00:01:31.680> if<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:31.950> sealed<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
basically if it's sealed you know that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
basically if it's sealed you know that
you're<00:01:32.850> getting<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.270> copy<00:01:34.049> well<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> know

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you're getting a copy well you know

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770 
you're getting a copy well you know
you're<00:01:35.070> getting<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.460> chip<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.390> could<00:01:36.630> be

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you're getting your chip that could be

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.480 
you're getting your chip that could be
fast<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.500> couldn't<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.920> depending<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
fast or it couldn't be depending on the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
fast or it couldn't be depending on the
silica<00:01:38.790> madhuri<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.229> thing

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
silica madhuri so that's one thing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
silica madhuri so that's one thing
you've<00:01:40.530> got<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:41.090> fully<00:01:42.090> sealed

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you've got to like about fully sealed

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
you've got to like about fully sealed
box<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:42.990> looking<00:01:43.649> at<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.159> soon<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.549> open

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
box now looking at so soon as you open

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179 
box now looking at so soon as you open
the<00:01:44.850> box<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.570> cpu<00:01:46.290> comes<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> it's

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the box the cpu comes out and it's

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.800 
the box the cpu comes out and it's
packed<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.520> well<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.090> packed<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
packed really well it's packed just like

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.859 
packed really well it's packed just like
the<00:01:49.020> intel<00:01:49.920> cpus<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> chip

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the intel cpus are and that's the chip

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.039 
the intel cpus are and that's the chip
there<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:53.280> looks<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.820> nice<00:01:54.149> eight

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
there it's just looks like a nice eight

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.959 
there it's just looks like a nice eight
core<00:01:55.320> chip<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.740> let's<00:01:56.310> look<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> specs<00:01:56.850> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
core chip now let's look at the specs of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.090 
core chip now let's look at the specs of
this<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.329> an<00:01:57.540> eight-course<00:01:57.960> oh<00:01:58.259> look

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
this this is an eight-course oh look

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.380 
this this is an eight-course oh look
here<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.549> chip<00:01:59.850> here<00:02:00.000> i'll<00:02:00.119> try<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
here that this chip here i'll try and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.770 
here that this chip here i'll try and
give<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> guys<00:02:00.659> are<00:02:00.930> close<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.780> let's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
give you guys are close up here so let's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200 
give you guys are close up here so let's
have<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.930> look<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.060> an

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
have a look at this this is an

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.850 
have a look at this this is an
eight-core<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> an<00:02:08.039> eight-core<00:02:08.489> from<00:02:08.789> AMD<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
eight-core so an eight-core from AMD and

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.220 
eight-core so an eight-core from AMD and
it<00:02:10.860> basically<00:02:11.160> has<00:02:11.489> 16<00:02:12.000> megabytes<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.629> cash<00:02:12.989> on

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
it basically has 16 megabytes of cash on

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.760 
it basically has 16 megabytes of cash on
board

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
board

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.540 
board
and<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.580> eight<00:02:14.700> calls<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.240> four<00:02:15.510> modules<00:02:15.750> so

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
and it's eight calls on four modules so

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.790 
and it's eight calls on four modules so
basically<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.760> cpu<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.690> touted<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:19.200> being<00:02:19.260> a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
basically this cpu is touted as being a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.430 
basically this cpu is touted as being a
really<00:02:20.340> good<00:02:20.370> value-for-money<00:02:20.850> cpu<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.350> i'm

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
really good value-for-money cpu so i'm

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.870 
really good value-for-money cpu so i'm
going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.710> mainly<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.250> my<00:02:23.490> main<00:02:23.670> reason

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
going to be mainly the my main reason

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.520 
going to be mainly the my main reason
for<00:02:24.060> getting<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.720> also<00:02:24.930> i<00:02:25.110> want<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.380> try

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
for getting this is also i want to try

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.860 
for getting this is also i want to try
the<00:02:25.590> AMD<00:02:26.010> architecture<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.390> also<00:02:27.450> want<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the AMD architecture but also want to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.770 
the AMD architecture but also want to
pit<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.380> against<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.800> 4670k<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.600> guys

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
pit it against the 4670k as you guys

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.110 
pit it against the 4670k as you guys
know<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.320> put<00:02:31.590> them<00:02:31.710> head-to-head<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.910> one

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
know and put them head-to-head this one

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.930 
know and put them head-to-head this one
hopefully<00:02:33.840> being<00:02:34.080> at<00:02:34.260> 4.4<00:02:34.860> gigs<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.370> i'll<00:02:35.850> put

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
hopefully being at 4.4 gigs and i'll put

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.100 
hopefully being at 4.4 gigs and i'll put
the<00:02:36.030> fourth<00:02:36.240> 4670k<00:02:37.110> at<00:02:37.490> 4.2<00:02:38.490> gigs<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.110> levels

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the fourth 4670k at 4.2 gigs so levels

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.990 
the fourth 4670k at 4.2 gigs so levels
that<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.350> think<00:02:40.650> anyone<00:02:41.040> can<00:02:41.070> achieve<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.790> both

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that I think anyone can achieve on both

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.150 
that I think anyone can achieve on both
chips<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.080> now<00:02:43.230> that's<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> chip<00:02:43.800> let's<00:02:44.040> have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
chips so now that's the chip let's have

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.560 
chips so now that's the chip let's have
a<00:02:44.220> look<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.610> get<00:02:44.760> in<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.940> box<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.420> else

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
a look what we get in the box what else

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.390 
a look what we get in the box what else
we<00:02:45.750> get<00:02:45.900> with<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.110> box<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:47.010> basically<00:02:47.220> get

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
we get with this box we basically get

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.970 
we get with this box we basically get
AMD's<00:02:47.880> warranty<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:49.350> fan<00:02:49.650> installation

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
AMD's warranty and fan installation

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.210 
AMD's warranty and fan installation
manual<00:02:50.490> there<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.900> also<00:02:52.080> i<00:02:52.320> mean<00:02:52.710> as<00:02:53.040> you

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
manual there and you also i mean as you

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.640 
manual there and you also i mean as you
guys<00:02:53.520> know<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.970> stock<00:02:54.630> heatsink<00:02:54.840> fans<00:02:55.440> are

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
guys know the stock heatsink fans are

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.020 
guys know the stock heatsink fans are
pretty<00:02:55.800> junk<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.250> now<00:02:59.850> these

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
pretty junk so this is it here now these

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.990 
pretty junk so this is it here now these
CPUs<00:03:00.600> are<00:03:01.010> touted<00:03:02.010> as<00:03:02.100> running<00:03:02.370> pretty<00:03:02.700> hot

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
CPUs are touted as running pretty hot

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.690 
CPUs are touted as running pretty hot
they<00:03:03.180> are<00:03:03.210> 32<00:03:03.930> nanometer<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.490> thing<00:03:05.580> I

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
they are 32 nanometer so one thing I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.150 
they are 32 nanometer so one thing I
will<00:03:05.760> say<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.210> is<00:03:06.390> 32<00:03:06.870> nanometer<00:03:07.160> Intel's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
will say this is 32 nanometer Intel's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.280 
will say this is 32 nanometer Intel's
are<00:03:08.370> 22<00:03:08.820> nanometers<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.570> generally<00:03:10.050> will

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
are 22 nanometers so this generally will

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.020 
are 22 nanometers so this generally will
use<00:03:10.770> more<00:03:11.610> watts<00:03:12.320> for<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.440> performance<00:03:14.030> so

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
use more watts for the performance so

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.330 
use more watts for the performance so
something<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.570> AMD<00:03:15.960> doesn't<00:03:16.830> really<00:03:17.010> as<00:03:17.220> you

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
something that AMD doesn't really as you

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.460 
something that AMD doesn't really as you
guys<00:03:17.490> know<00:03:17.520> it's<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.840> disadvantages

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
guys know it's one of the disadvantages

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.860 
guys know it's one of the disadvantages
that<00:03:19.920> AMD<00:03:20.370> currently<00:03:20.730> has<00:03:20.970> versus<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.540> Intel

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
that AMD currently has versus the Intel

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.350 
that AMD currently has versus the Intel
CPUs<00:03:22.410> however<00:03:23.100> they<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.940> eight<00:03:24.060> cause

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
CPUs however they have the eight cause

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.260 
CPUs however they have the eight cause
there<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.070> games<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.520> stuff<00:03:27.030> like<00:03:27.209> that

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
there and if games and stuff like that

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.690 
there and if games and stuff like that
can<00:03:27.570> utilize<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.050> eight<00:03:28.170> threads<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.550> is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700

money<00:03:34.410> now<00:03:34.860> this<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.130> fan<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.550> comes<00:03:35.760> with

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
money now this is the fan it comes with

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.390 
money now this is the fan it comes with
I<00:03:36.150> actually<00:03:36.410> like<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.620> fan<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:37.950> lot<00:03:38.250> better

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
I actually like this fan a lot better

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.180 
I actually like this fan a lot better
than<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> intel<00:03:39.240> stock<00:03:39.570> heatsink<00:03:40.080> fan<00:03:40.410> so

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
than the intel stock heatsink fan so

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.210 
than the intel stock heatsink fan so
compare<00:03:41.880> them<00:03:41.970> side-by-side<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.810> guys

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
compare them side-by-side for you guys

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.080 
compare them side-by-side for you guys
basically<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> don't<00:03:44.430> really<00:03:44.520> care<00:03:44.790> about<00:03:44.850> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
basically I don't really care about the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.770 
basically I don't really care about the
heatsink<00:03:45.690> paste<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:46.860> it's<00:03:47.850> actually<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.630> comes

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
heatsink paste so it's actually it comes

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.540 
heatsink paste so it's actually it comes
pre<00:03:49.110> applied<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.590> some<00:03:49.770> nice<00:03:49.980> heatsink

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
pre applied with some nice heatsink

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.540 
pre applied with some nice heatsink
paste<00:03:50.790> here<00:03:51.920> now<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.130> actually<00:03:53.400> not<00:03:53.490> bad

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
paste here now it's actually not bad

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.370 
paste here now it's actually not bad
like<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.030> feels<00:03:54.240> better<00:03:54.720> than<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.050> intel

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
like it feels better than the intel

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.520 
like it feels better than the intel
stock<00:03:56.370> heatsink<00:03:56.670> fan<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.300> that<00:03:57.450> came<00:03:57.690> with

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
stock heatsink fan that that came with

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.949 
stock heatsink fan that that came with
so<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.730> heatsink<00:04:00.060> pace<00:04:00.240> that<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.540> came<00:04:00.750> with

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
so the heatsink pace that that came with

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.230 
so the heatsink pace that that came with
so<00:04:01.170> here<00:04:01.680> they<00:04:01.800> are<00:04:01.830> here<00:04:01.980> side<00:04:02.550> by<00:04:02.580> side<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
so here they are here side by side I

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.449 
so here they are here side by side I
definitely<00:04:03.990> liked<00:04:04.260> AMD's<00:04:04.740> stock<00:04:05.220> heatsink

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
definitely liked AMD's stock heatsink

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.699 
definitely liked AMD's stock heatsink
fan<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:06.000> lot<00:04:06.270> better<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.750> mean<00:04:07.230> if<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.440> guys

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
fan a lot better I mean if you guys

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.290 
fan a lot better I mean if you guys
would<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.580> actually<00:04:08.730> looks<00:04:09.030> like<00:04:09.150> it's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
would just it actually looks like it's

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.970 
would just it actually looks like it's
made<00:04:09.450> by<00:04:09.600> Cooler<00:04:09.840> Master<00:04:09.930> as<00:04:10.320> well<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.830> says

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
made by Cooler Master as well so it says

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.120 
made by Cooler Master as well so it says
coolermaster<00:04:11.760> they're<00:04:11.910> printed<00:04:12.330> on<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
coolermaster they're printed on the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.979 
coolermaster they're printed on the
heatsink<00:04:14.130> fan<00:04:14.190> which<00:04:14.520> is<00:04:14.670> pretty<00:04:14.850> cool<00:04:15.120> so

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
heatsink fan which is pretty cool so

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.260 
heatsink fan which is pretty cool so
cool<00:04:16.919> master<00:04:17.340> are<00:04:17.459> making<00:04:17.820> this<00:04:17.970> stock

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
cool master are making this stock

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.270 
cool master are making this stock
heatsink<00:04:18.480> fan<00:04:18.810> which<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.320> interesting<00:04:19.890> I've

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
heatsink fan which is interesting I've

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.070 
heatsink fan which is interesting I've
never<00:04:20.489> seen<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:20.790> before<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.750> didn't<00:04:21.989> know

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
never seen that before so I didn't know

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.469 
never seen that before so I didn't know
that<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:23.400> heatsink<00:04:23.790> fan<00:04:23.850> feels<00:04:24.240> better

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
that so this heatsink fan feels better

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.300 
that so this heatsink fan feels better
than<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.810> one<00:04:25.050> if<00:04:25.260> you're<00:04:25.740> running<00:04:25.860> stock

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
than this one if you're running stock

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.440 
than this one if you're running stock
clocks<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.150> all

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
clocks this is all

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.960 
clocks this is all
you're<00:04:27.600> going<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.990> need<00:04:28.370> same<00:04:29.370> with<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.580> Intel

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
you're going to need same with the Intel

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.660 
you're going to need same with the Intel
if<00:04:30.390> you're<00:04:30.570> going<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.900> overclock<00:04:31.470> which<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.430> am

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
if you're going to overclock which I am

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.080 
if you're going to overclock which I am
then<00:04:33.390> I<00:04:33.420> am<00:04:33.780> going<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.170> be<00:04:34.320> using<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:35.580> bad<00:04:35.850> boy

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
then I am going to be using this bad boy

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.140 
then I am going to be using this bad boy
here<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:37.220> I'm<00:04:38.220> going<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.430> do<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> review<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.090> that

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
here so I'm going to do a review of that

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.630 
here so I'm going to do a review of that
soon<00:04:39.630> once<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.440> set<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.740> whole<00:04:40.890> test<00:04:41.160> bench<00:04:41.400> up

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
soon once I set the whole test bench up

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.850 
soon once I set the whole test bench up
anyway<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.260> what<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.500> get<00:04:43.620> in<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.830> box

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
anyway this is what you get in the box

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
where I'm going to be pitting this

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.500 
where I'm going to be pitting this
against<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.380> 4670k<00:05:14.040> now<00:05:14.340> lastly<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.120> will<00:05:15.240> say

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
against the 4670k now lastly I will say

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.470 
against the 4670k now lastly I will say
before<00:05:15.810> I<00:05:15.840> go<00:05:16.340> people<00:05:17.340> talk<00:05:17.730> about<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:18.090> FX

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
before I go people talk about the FX

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.620 
before I go people talk about the FX
8320<00:05:19.290> not<00:05:19.530> being<00:05:19.860> as<00:05:20.040> good<00:05:20.310> as<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.580> bin<00:05:20.880> as<00:05:21.060> the

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
8320 not being as good as a bin as the

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.220 
8320 not being as good as a bin as the
880<00:05:22.170> 350<00:05:22.830> now<00:05:22.980> my<00:05:23.940> thinking<00:05:24.360> on<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.780> simply

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
880 350 now my thinking on it is simply

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.900 
880 350 now my thinking on it is simply
that<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.820> think<00:05:26.820> some<00:05:27.690> of<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.960> 8320<00:05:28.680> s<00:05:28.950> will<00:05:29.790> be

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
that I think some of the 8320 s will be

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.430 
that I think some of the 8320 s will be
bad<00:05:30.150> bins<00:05:30.540> of<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.530> 8350<00:05:32.220> s<00:05:32.280> in<00:05:32.460> other<00:05:32.610> words

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
bad bins of the 8350 s in other words

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.110 
bad bins of the 8350 s in other words
Andy<00:05:34.440> will<00:05:34.560> test<00:05:34.800> all<00:05:34.950> the<00:05:35.010> CPUs<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:35.640> if<00:05:35.970> they

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
Andy will test all the CPUs and if they

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.630 
Andy will test all the CPUs and if they
work<00:05:36.660> at<00:05:36.840> four<00:05:37.050> gigs<00:05:37.290> native<00:05:37.680> then<00:05:38.430> they're

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
work at four gigs native then they're

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.600 
work at four gigs native then they're
8350<00:05:39.390> s<00:05:39.450> if<00:05:40.260> they<00:05:40.530> don't<00:05:40.800> then<00:05:41.160> they'll<00:05:41.370> bend

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
8350 s if they don't then they'll bend

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.240 
8350 s if they don't then they'll bend
them<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:41.730> 83<00:05:42.270> 20s<00:05:42.660> however<00:05:43.320> I<00:05:43.440> believe<00:05:43.740> that

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
them to 83 20s however I believe that

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.210 
them to 83 20s however I believe that
some<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.390> 8320<00:05:45.930> s<00:05:46.170> will<00:05:46.260> just<00:05:46.470> not<00:05:46.620> be<00:05:46.650> bend

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
some of the 8320 s will just not be bend

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.010 
some of the 8320 s will just not be bend
at<00:05:47.340> all<00:05:47.460> that<00:05:47.700> and<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.420> wouldn't<00:05:48.600> have<00:05:48.720> tested

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
at all that and it wouldn't have tested

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.320 
at all that and it wouldn't have tested
them<00:05:49.140> all<00:05:49.350> cuz<00:05:49.500> they<00:05:49.560> got<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.770> fulfill<00:05:50.330> 8320

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
them all cuz they got to fulfill 8320

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.300 
them all cuz they got to fulfill 8320
quantities<00:05:52.200> so<00:05:52.410> that's<00:05:52.620> just<00:05:52.770> my<00:05:52.860> thinking<00:05:53.100> I

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
quantities so that's just my thinking I

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.040 
quantities so that's just my thinking I
think<00:05:53.520> some<00:05:53.700> of<00:05:53.730> them<00:05:53.940> will<00:05:54.540> run<00:05:54.720> really<00:05:55.020> well

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
think some of them will run really well

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.160 
think some of them will run really well
some<00:05:55.950> of<00:05:55.980> them<00:05:56.160> will<00:05:56.400> just<00:05:56.580> be<00:05:56.670> mediocre

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
some of them will just be mediocre

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.540 
some of them will just be mediocre
hopefully<00:05:58.170> I've<00:05:58.290> got<00:05:58.320> a<00:05:58.470> good<00:05:58.680> chip<00:05:58.950> I'm<00:05:59.400> going

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
hopefully I've got a good chip I'm going

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.310 
hopefully I've got a good chip I'm going
to<00:05:59.610> be<00:05:59.760> testing<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:00.270> as<00:06:00.720> you<00:06:00.840> guys<00:06:00.960> know<00:06:01.020> the
