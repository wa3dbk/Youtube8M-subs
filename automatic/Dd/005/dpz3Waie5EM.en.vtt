00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.330
 hello welcome to my game of the month 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:21.609
 we put an end to this very difficult 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.609
 space any difficult much 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.330
 nothing else is very complicated and that there 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.949
 some expansions which are in that 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.949
 our life you have cnc 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.070
 of luck especially with the damn 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.200
 given not only have to do and then 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.940
 is and if it goes well and if the moles 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.989
 always having the theory that for 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.880
 kill that due to the use of a coin 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.210
 than 50 percent for the 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.220
 skulls are 31 tell you not if one two 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 and three gates of the nation that the 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.510
 positive 17 cases in half 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.460
 the defense is fine 10 so that 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.860
 final is the number of letters with the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.890
 put with six and a half closes 50 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.260
 fails always wait with a zero 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.250
 clear how it is so easy bad dads and 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.210
 have at least 10 1 2 3 4 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210
 that is the difficulty of equal 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 but try to pass the difficulties 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.100
 game quite good training 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 simple scale quite well works 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.409
 very well a good player who knows him 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.409
 of euros of four out of five we have played 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.409
 6 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 of quality well are not they are either 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:02:04.280
 drawn and has 40,000 unemployed 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.220
 it really is double because to attack it 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.740
 in one thing to defend another 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.600
 according to die fernandez and little more in 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.280
 overall you can not say anything bad about 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.720
 the quality of the box is tiny 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.590
 very tight so that the game is not 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.570
 we can carry in the pocket of the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.360
 jacket 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.740
 how to request them whether the rules 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.250
 they understand pretty well is not it is not 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.250
 complicated 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.270
 effectively but then the rules and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.800
 simple the most complex part is 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.150
 how many in a marine and you have to readjust 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.940
 the training that we do not do a little bit to 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.830
 eye and sometimes it is not done well but good 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.630
 because the manual tells you that you have to 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.420
 move to the shortest section towards 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.650
 up or down and it 's a bit 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.890
 cumbersome but of walter albÃ¡n amore 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.020
 same as I care a lot and as for 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.490
 in terms of the number of players I say 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.000
 and what is said in scale quite well 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:00.830
 maybe 16 touched his black dot not so 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.750
 black is the difficulty because it is very 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.430
 difficult however 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.470
 there are others that we have analyzed that were 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.030
 very difficult and again to play 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.030
 this pending 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.950
 of the defeat of victory or of the 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480
 defeat is luck luck thank you and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.020
 the skulls start when it 's almost 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.040
 5 when you defend but it's always 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.550
 you never get skulls like I read 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.550
 call or not 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.580
 maybe the marines also a little bit 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.260
 more than a little more resistance 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.239
 life at least two that give you two 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.890
 waits because with a before normal a 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.750
 said hold nibble you kill if 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.900
 men do not know no I do not want to say that 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.060
 put more life to simplify the 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.400
 game that would not be bad but not though 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.800
 it was harder still but you had 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.090
 two points there has been something that marine 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.010
 moves fast once you stay on 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.840
 a marine if it 's a result game of 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.120
 six the number that stays because of course 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.470
 are six lines are not two are 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.870
 heads would be 12 Marines 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.489
 when one dies one already begins to be more 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.500
 complicated because basically the 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.270
 teams are balanced so that 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.460
 there is a normal marine 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.650
 marin special in a team is in the 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.470
 Flamethrower that kills with number 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.209
 constant with a heavy that kills and that 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.650
 makes three attacks and consists of the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.900
 claws that kills directly to three that 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.090
 we add better have utility said 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.820
 with 0 9 but correct in another is the 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.560
 librarian that allows you to attack two 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.480
 times if the first one succeeds in other 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.490
 in us in two others that are the 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.230
 general the agents that we also 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.950
 remember that they have people bonuses 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.590
 no color and there is one more that I do not remember 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.880
 who is but there is one they create good 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.140
 everyone has one with a bonus 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.670
 fat woman 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.950
 and the other one usually if you die 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.890
 especially the bonus 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.030
 the team is already very touched and after 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.530
 will have both the says is a 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.240
 loss if you die two I have in the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.820
 tropic and says I'm going to make popcorn 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.650
 you are out of the sphere of departure 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.660
 then a couple of points of life 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.740
 at least to give it more duration or something 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.729
 how they did 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:11.550
 dungeons and dragons that have lists and 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:15.270
 that survive two remains to revive 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.130
 well you know he died but he did not die come 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.300
 more impossible let alone of 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.789
 difficulties I say it for not leaving 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.599
 france that was with what supposes the 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.610
 second is so fast that it was from Alberto 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.770
 it was quite the Greek goddess she 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.870
 normalize for me to something else if to me 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.949
 it was at least palm hand 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.659
 special 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.280
 and in fact he the heroic put up with 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.289
 done we were lucky with one of the 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.599
 location charges the one that is so 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.330
 they only have to teleport and one is that 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.690
 lets pass if you do not risk dying 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:53.190
 but it allows you to pass fast and a little 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:55.220
 of hope to try but of all 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.960
 say that you are looking 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.819
 We recommend space cool and decent and if 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.830
 it seems easy to buy the expansions 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.230
 to have it harder still 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.480
 for this easy tonight on track 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.080
 next game I want to talk to you I do not know 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.080
 something cool 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.430
 thank you for your time peace 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.660
 time
