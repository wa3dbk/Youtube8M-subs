00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.139
 with friends the recipe that I bring 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.789
 for today is yuca a traditional meal 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:23.019
 Cuban yucca with the world then by the 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.019
 first of the year the water charges the yucca 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.740
 and good gentlemen 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.560
 10 minutes had not elapsed and now 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.560
 I was 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560
 living 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.370
 and starting to give symptoms of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.080
 softening then what did I do good 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 I made the system that we do in Cuba 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.900
 We voted for the boiling water and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.150
 we take cold water from the tap that 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.860
 We call that the scare so that 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.180
 finish softening as we liked it 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.180
 come and now I who is soft 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.780
 we extinguish the fire we cover and we go to 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.190
 make the delicious 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.320
 we already have prepared here in the bush 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.170
 Rite eight cloves of garlic 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.020
 and we are going to put salt 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.380
 because this is what this garlic mojito consists of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.320
 salt and lemon and oil 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.930
 we add salt to the garlic in the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.060
 moment to crush what will be the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 salt that will carry the yucca 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.060
 it's enough now to crush 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.200
 Y 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.900
 in this mode we only intend to break 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 deform the garlic but not make it a 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.410
 pasta 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.580
 Once the garlic is crushed, we will 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.580
 squeeze the two lemons 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.070
 I have fat on fire, it 's good 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.330
 hot really hot then now to 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:12.110
 I 'm going to see this fat that is mojo 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.840
 of garlic and lemon that we already prepared I'm going to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.450
 prepare the fat from the fire 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.450
 and then I add lennon 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.200
 and this must be done as a precaution 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.200
 Sirs 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.100

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.350
 I present the yucca with a true 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.600
 Cuban mojo that can be made from 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.050
 different ways and I'll explain it 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.520
