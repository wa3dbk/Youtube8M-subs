00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.590
 and then personnel p 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.779
 those who plan yet another 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.970
 gameplay say of the gods here on the channel 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.150
 of the pt-br oval I look forward immensely 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.460
 You listen to this gameplay comment and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 good there in play he used was the pig 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.740
 It was one who left playing dominei chan in the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 map what it has is a very good map very 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.630
 good working with every 12 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 will have to do with the subject that I 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.200
 I chose this beauty gameplay 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.140
 subject is going to be the weapons of the call of duty 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.129
 and in specific and the call of duty weapon 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.500
 dude dude 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.660
 well you know is very important in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.370
 which figure of nero not only because it kills 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.020
 dude just because it's the voice and kill 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.789
 it is not important that they be 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.399
 balanced so that they are not 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.440
 strong that they are not the weight is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.930
 expensive because it has a very gun can see 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.149
 very rebellious continued 3 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.909
 the cr staff will complain that too 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.520
 armata telona wants to kill very strong and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.400
 that the producer has to read fa 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.280
 It has to worsen manes but not always 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.220
 happens and the balance of weapons 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.140
 guy is something you can change the type safe 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.880
 because the weapon was not launched. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 safe from where you can end up being very 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.490
 bad not bad but it may not be so 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.810
 good because just home will have 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.420
 that weapon in the game and will end up getting 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.939
 very annoying or boring more 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.710
 quickly, man, so this was a 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.509
 thing that I liked in the search box 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.579
 that the weapons are really very 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 I do not know if it's because everyone 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.390
 are marking very fast because 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.399
 game is changing very fast but I'm 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.680
 enjoying the best weapons the most 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.360
 health for me is rone bÃ©dier every 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.280
 12 and sc 2010 that sc 2010 if not me 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.530
 deception is the first to Softwell that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 Release the game for me is very good. 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.159
 good to earn a mostly fait 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.840
 she has a very good aim is a website 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.810
 Very good and for me it does not have much 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 collect a face to software for both 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.740
 all very well balanced I do not see 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.319
 no much difference between what in 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.390
 one wins the other loses so always has 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.740
 something that makes them balanced 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.330
 and I liked it a lot 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.700
 I thought this is a problem in a 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.420
 Goal safe because it's nothing 3 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.150
 I had only crm p7 so I got this 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.190
 this fear right there dick come so 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.800
 in the old safe in the face still good that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.020
 did not come and ks machine gun for me too 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
 they are all the same for all the same me 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.450
 same same face to me then all 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.640
 very good all scoring very fast 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 but as the maps in the goal box are 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.590
 giants did not even add small 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.020
 the small maps then recommend 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.240
 you use the steakhouses because 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.310
 really, it's better it 's better for 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.500
 cause of the maps if it is a short 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.620
 I recommend you use a house chegan 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.900
 are also great for the vector to see and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.970
 I'm talking about bep 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.490
 because I think it's funny her name is 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.290
 Carol are also two weeks denying 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.260
 that the cut of more play to enjoy too much 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.810
 I was enjoying the same mall and fpc 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.000
 Cane bulldog is two Chinese that I 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.860
 I like you so much I do not know if you like 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.770
 playing shot will not enjoy but I like it 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.980
 Pretty then man I just wanted to say 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.120
 that in that video that each one was 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.820
 have to have a balanced 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.650
 certain that even football is not having 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.230
 this throw and the weapons team balanced 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.540
 Dear face, it was very good, dear. 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.850
 good, it was something that I thought not 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.370
 It would be good on the golf course but ended 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.260
 being very good very well balanced 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.520
