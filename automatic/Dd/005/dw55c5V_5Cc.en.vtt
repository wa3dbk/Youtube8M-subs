00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
plate from the pasta machine it's just

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:49.540 
plate from the pasta machine it's just
two<00:00:34.920> screws<00:00:35.210> come<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.600> easily

smallest hex on there depends what set

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.960 
smallest hex on there depends what set
you<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:30.800> and<00:01:31.800> you<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.250> remove<00:01:32.550> these<00:01:32.700> two

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
in it for the pin so you have to make

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.360 
in it for the pin so you have to make
sure<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.310> line<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:16.730> up<00:03:19.240> okay<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.750> go

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
sure you line that up okay and it's go

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.200 
sure you line that up okay and it's go
right<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:23.560> then<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.710> top<00:03:24.980> one<00:03:25.190> has<00:03:25.610> two<00:03:25.880> slots

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
right in then this top one has two slots

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.560 
right in then this top one has two slots
as<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.320> can<00:03:27.500> see<00:03:27.680> for<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.160> two<00:03:28.370> pins<00:03:29.270> that<00:03:29.510> are

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
as you can see for the two pins that are

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:40.290 
as you can see for the two pins that are
on<00:03:29.780> here<00:03:33.160> just<00:03:34.160> make<00:03:34.460> sure<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.880> line<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.270> up

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:51.330 

right<00:03:41.300> in<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:43.150> center<00:03:44.150> one<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:46.370> just

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.210 

okay<00:03:52.030> there<00:03:52.599> you<00:03:52.720> go<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.260> then<00:03:53.860> we<00:03:54.040> also

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
okay there you go and then we also

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.690 
okay there you go and then we also
greased<00:03:54.670> them<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:56.200> avoid<00:03:56.470> future<00:03:56.920> breakage<00:03:57.489> it

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
greased them to avoid future breakage it

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.290 
greased them to avoid future breakage it
gives<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.209> longer<00:03:59.310> lifespan<00:04:00.310> pretty<00:04:01.150> much

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
gives it a longer lifespan pretty much

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.830 
gives it a longer lifespan pretty much
and<00:04:04.620> spray<00:04:05.620> some<00:04:05.650> between<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.700> little<00:04:07.540> grease

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
and spray some between a little grease

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.229 
and spray some between a little grease
on<00:04:07.989> there<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:09.069> don't<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.459> grease<00:04:09.700> every

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
on there you don't have to grease every

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.130 
on there you don't have to grease every
inch<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.540> it<00:04:10.690> just<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:11.489> as<00:04:12.690> they<00:04:13.690> spin<00:04:14.019> it

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
inch of it just so that as they spin it

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:23.670 
inch of it just so that as they spin it
all

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.410 

that's<00:04:24.550> good<00:04:24.729> enough

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.700

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
you have the small hex screw which

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.010 
you have the small hex screw which
tightens<00:04:34.460> into<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.760> bottom<00:04:35.090> gear<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.720> you

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
tightens into the bottom gear and you

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:54.670 
tightens into the bottom gear and you
put<00:04:39.200> that<00:04:39.230> in<00:04:39.500> first<00:04:48.700> okay<00:04:52.810> thanks<00:04:53.840> grab<00:04:54.530> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
put that in first okay thanks grab the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:05.939 
put that in first okay thanks grab the
center<00:04:54.860> plate

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.040 

put<00:05:06.490> it<00:05:06.580> back<00:05:06.729> in<00:05:06.969> I<00:05:07.180> don't<00:05:07.539> tighten<00:05:07.719> it<00:05:07.900> all

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
put it back in I don't tighten it all

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.800 
put it back in I don't tighten it all
the<00:05:08.169> way<00:05:08.289> just<00:05:08.319> yet<00:05:08.740> until<00:05:08.949> I<00:05:09.129> get<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.810> screws

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
the way just yet until I get the screws

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.420 
the way just yet until I get the screws
in<00:05:11.050> on<00:05:11.199> the<00:05:11.259> sides<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.830> hex<00:05:12.039> screws<00:05:12.280> because

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
in on the sides the hex screws because

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.510 
in on the sides the hex screws because
sometimes<00:05:12.969> if<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.300> tighten<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.659> all<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.810> way

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
sometimes if you tighten it all the way

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.469 
sometimes if you tighten it all the way
it'll<00:05:15.520> give<00:05:15.669> you<00:05:15.759> a<00:05:15.789> hard<00:05:15.939> time<00:05:15.999> to<00:05:16.240> get<00:05:16.360> these

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
it'll give you a hard time to get these

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.760 
it'll give you a hard time to get these
hex<00:05:16.719> screws<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.199> so<00:05:17.949> I<00:05:17.979> just<00:05:18.310> tighten<00:05:19.270> it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
hex screws and so I just tighten it

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:55.830 
hex screws and so I just tighten it
line<00:05:20.770> up<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.039> school

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:04.490 

we<00:05:56.840> just<00:05:57.580> attacked<00:05:58.580> the<00:05:58.670> central

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.940 

and<00:06:04.980> that's<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.400> then<00:06:05.880> you<00:06:05.970> just<00:06:06.800> played<00:06:07.800> on

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
and that's it then you just played on

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:31.229 
and that's it then you just played on
side

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:31.239 

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:33.519 

then<00:06:32.239> once<00:06:32.509> down<00:06:32.779> a<00:06:32.809> little<00:06:33.049> paper<00:06:33.289> towel

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:33.529 
then once down a little paper towel

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.689 
then once down a little paper towel
little<00:06:33.889> Windex<00:06:34.189> cleaner<00:06:35.029> writer<00:06:35.619> and<00:06:36.699> that's

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
little Windex cleaner writer and that's

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.519 
little Windex cleaner writer and that's
how<00:06:37.879> you<00:06:37.939> replace<00:06:38.149> the<00:06:38.389> plastic<00:06:39.019> gears<00:06:39.229> on<00:06:39.379> an

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
how you replace the plastic gears on an

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.489 
how you replace the plastic gears on an
electric<00:06:39.949> pasta<00:06:40.309> machine
