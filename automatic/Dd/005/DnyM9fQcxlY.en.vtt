00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.650
 Hello trial test 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:15.299
 lithium battery screwdriver 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:18.180
 18600 53 lithium batteries 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:26.039
 connected in series voltage to 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:31.920
 they are 19 11 9 volts checking the grid 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:37.320
 stand for maximum effort 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.809
 drilling Pyaterochka tension 1 and 9 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.219
 three pieces are devoted 4 are not involved 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.450
 look at the rated voltage 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.450
 12 volt engine 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.030
 as we see three charged batteries 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.170
 easily copes with ratchet on 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.860
 maximum moment with both work and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:19.290
 from the spot but we also see a drawdown 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.119
 voltages below 9 and 6 volts that is already 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.970
 conditions that the minimum voltage on 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.759
 Bank 32 volts as well it is possible to three 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:36.630
 lower that is three banks at least 9 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:43.820
 volts and should be 85 this is brute force 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:49.110
 for cans so try now 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 last four items are nominal 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.119
 voltage charged state 42 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:05.520
 volt to 4 then 16.8 volts is completely 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:08.369
 charged the nominal will be 14 8 that is 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.820
 Principle 4 cans of excellent came to 14 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.570
 4 volts we have a black pipe gone 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.570
 contact break 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.770
 clear engine well and then nothing 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.770
 scary this ease of teaching to press 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.590
 banks have not eaten yet these banks are almost 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.590
 charged 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.900
 10 volts the same megaru loses on 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:07.290
 power is already big enough 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:16.420
 You can connect assembly 3 to 2 6 cans and 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:19.049
 In principle, it should work as it should 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.709
 you see the elements 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.709
 calmly climbs here 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.560
 Bonaqua zid means in native boxing 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:50.390
 exactly 6 this is how it looks and calm 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:54.400
 closes like this we will 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:04:01.480
 have a 12 volt lithium battery 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:07.510
 for 44 amperes hours instead of native 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.510
 12 volt 112 ampere hours 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:18.440
 1200 milliamps 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:23.270
 not only three 10 cans of 12 volts and all 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.970
 right here so in general will gather soon 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.410
 I looked that it will work out I plan 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.979
 purchase a charger with 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.099
 balancer so that you can correctly 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:40.310
 charge these batteries 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:42.110
 they went a little longer and also charge 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:49.159
 will surely be separate 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:53.150
 Verdi shavers on 4 4 pins 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:55.539
 yes plus minus and 2 midpoint will be 3 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.539
 on 2 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.360
 Here is such a kitchen 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 see continuation
