00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.240
 hello in this video tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.760
 explain what it is to visit 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.920
 first I will comment a little 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.550
 machines that I carry and then explain to you 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.130
 Operation is based on 2 x 1 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.590
 which I use to square the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.640
 four tracks and then I have integrated the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.880
 pool speak all 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 I use the 2 x1 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.270
 with four former four ministers over 234 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.750
 which took it out by an audio made by 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.350
 external to the four tracks of the mixer 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.420
 in this case he used 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.149
 an orange because then we'll see that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.920
 I will use all of mine with a corpus 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.090
 but now we are going to focus you 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.700
 simply 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.700
 as low with few elements 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.840
 then after 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.180
 we go down what 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.570
 later I will come to enter the second 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.570
 track 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.110
 the pressure of any other drink 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.160
 basically it 's on my way to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.160
 work because 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.240
 and then I have the session mode which is the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.210
 that shot the clips while it's 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.380
 similar to an F1 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.380
 what for me here got more profit 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.600
 because I can put more infinity of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.980
 clips of looks that I prepared myself 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.090
 Y 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.090
 for me I have a little 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.030
 those of the 20 as slaves with with 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.850
 tractor always first you have to 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.119
 start tractor first and then to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.600
 Breton and then you have to give 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.600
 external 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.860
 master that if you take the cards 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.490
 you could do it as they explain in another 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.490
 chapter of the book with a program 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.540
 software but in this case I like it 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.540
 more this configuration
