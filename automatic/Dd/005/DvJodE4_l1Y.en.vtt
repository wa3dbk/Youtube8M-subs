aunt ala just believes we could ever get
enough<00:00:01.949> ancient<00:00:02.460> DNA<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:03.060> clone<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> dinosaur

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
enough ancient DNA to clone a dinosaur

be extracted from this new tissue I

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.980

think<00:00:11.219> anything<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.700> possible<00:00:11.790> if<00:00:12.509> there<00:00:12.870> are

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
think anything is possible if there are

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
preserved and the dinosaur I think it's
