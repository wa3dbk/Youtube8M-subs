00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
come up and tilt at an ankle like we

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.770 
come up and tilt at an ankle like we
showed<00:03:13.930> before<00:03:15.150> right<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:18.160> does<00:03:18.430> that

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
showed before right so it does that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.580 
showed before right so it does that
there's<00:03:19.780> not<00:03:19.959> i<00:03:19.989> don't<00:03:20.139> know<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.379> else<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
there's not i don't know what else to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.199 
there's not i don't know what else to
say<00:03:20.829> about<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:21.190> robot<00:03:21.370> i<00:03:21.549> mean<00:03:21.699> it<00:03:21.790> looks<00:03:21.970> cool

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
say about the robot i mean it looks cool

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.990 
say about the robot i mean it looks cool
it's<00:03:22.599> just<00:03:22.980> expensive<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.340> all<00:03:24.519> hell<00:03:24.730> because

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
it's just expensive as all hell because

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.059 
it's just expensive as all hell because
it's<00:03:25.989> huge<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.849> damn<00:03:28.060> powered<00:03:28.540> either

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
it's huge it's the damn powered either

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.199 
it's huge it's the damn powered either
let's<00:03:30.069> see<00:03:30.250> if<00:03:30.310> we<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:30.609> get<00:03:30.699> it<00:03:30.819> in<00:03:30.909> all<00:03:31.090> of

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
let's see if we can get it in all of

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.449 
let's see if we can get it in all of
these<00:03:31.359> poses<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:35.109> can<00:03:35.290> we<00:03:36.069> can<00:03:36.310> like

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
these poses here so we can we can like

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.229 
these poses here so we can we can like
put<00:03:36.730> this<00:03:36.940> arm<00:03:37.269> behind<00:03:37.629> its<00:03:38.049> back<00:03:38.730> let<00:03:39.730> me<00:03:39.819> bend

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
put this arm behind its back let me bend

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.369 
put this arm behind its back let me bend
it<00:03:40.389> at<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.690> knee<00:03:41.220> here<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.959> think<00:03:44.260> I

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
it at the knee here and you think I

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.020 
it at the knee here and you think I
would<00:03:44.530> know<00:03:44.709> how<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:44.889> do<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.340> football<00:03:45.729> pose

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
would know how to do the football pose

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.159 
would know how to do the football pose
but<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.260> don't<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:49.239> we're<00:03:49.389> going<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.629> guess<00:03:49.900> like

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
but I don't so we're going to guess like

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.009 
but I don't so we're going to guess like
you<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.379> stretch<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.859> arm<00:03:51.099> out<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:52.120> move

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
you can stretch this arm out this move

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.059 
you can stretch this arm out this move
the<00:03:53.199> leg<00:03:54.090> right<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.209> leg<00:03:55.389> has<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.720> be<00:03:55.780> up<00:03:56.069> like

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
the leg right the leg has to be up like

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.449 
the leg right the leg has to be up like
he's<00:03:57.310> going<00:03:57.579> down<00:03:57.819> in<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.229> football<00:03:59.229> stance<00:03:59.650> to

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
he's going down in a football stance to

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.699 
he's going down in a football stance to
do<00:04:00.669> football<00:04:00.970> things<00:04:01.449> because<00:04:02.019> he's<00:04:02.680> a

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
do football things because he's a

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.949 
do football things because he's a
quarterback<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.579> quarterbacks<00:04:04.209> totally

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
guess if he's throwing the ball already

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.580 
guess if he's throwing the ball already
I<00:04:49.050> he<00:04:49.320> good<00:04:49.500> or<00:04:49.710> if<00:04:50.490> he<00:04:50.699> has<00:04:51.449> lost<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:52.080> ball<00:04:52.260> in

some way like fumbled it I don't know
that's<00:04:57.840> usually<00:04:58.199> not<00:04:58.260> how<00:04:58.680> quarterbacks<00:04:59.280> play

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
that's usually not how quarterbacks play

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.360 
that's usually not how quarterbacks play
the<00:04:59.760> game<00:04:59.970> but<00:05:00.410> apparently<00:05:01.410> in<00:05:01.620> fours<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.100> they

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
the game but apparently in fours a they

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.689 
the game but apparently in fours a they
do<00:05:03.320> being<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.440> quarterback<00:05:04.770> qualifies<00:05:05.460> you

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
do being the quarterback qualifies you

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.270 
do being the quarterback qualifies you
to<00:05:05.729> tackle<00:05:06.090> people<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:06.780> then<00:05:07.380> see<00:05:07.710> now<00:05:07.919> for<00:05:08.190> as
