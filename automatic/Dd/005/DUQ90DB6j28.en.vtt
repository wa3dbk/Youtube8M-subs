denial<00:01:48.240> all<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> time<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.409> let<00:01:49.590> me<00:01:49.649> give<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
denial all the time but let me give you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
denial all the time but let me give you
a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.070> proof<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.820> somebody<00:01:51.570> recently

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
a little proof of this somebody recently

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.069 
a little proof of this somebody recently
conducted<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.500> survey<00:01:52.790> asking<00:01:53.790> people

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
conducted a survey asking people

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.840 
conducted a survey asking people
everybody<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.710> above<00:01:55.979> average<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.729> below

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
everybody are you above average or below

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.380 
everybody are you above average or below
average<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.450> intelligence<00:01:59.270> 98%<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.360> people

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
average and intelligence 98% of people

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.999 
average and intelligence 98% of people
say<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.049> are<00:02:01.110> about<00:02:01.320> average<00:02:01.590> in

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
say there are about average in

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.370 
say there are about average in
intelligence<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.630> mathematically

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
intelligence and this is mathematically

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.139 
intelligence and this is mathematically
impossible<00:02:04.640> because<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.790> obviously<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
impossible because it's obviously a

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
impossible because it's obviously a
Gaussian<00:02:06.570> curve<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.049> what<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.770> shows<00:02:08.009> us<00:02:08.039> half

Gaussian curve and what it shows us half

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.339 
Gaussian curve and what it shows us half
of<00:02:08.729> mankind<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.539> denial<00:02:09.810> about<00:02:10.200> it

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
of mankind is in denial about it

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.160 
of mankind is in denial about it
stupidity

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
stupidity

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.020 
stupidity
this<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:12.830> painfully<00:02:13.310> evident<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.730> our<00:02:13.850> last

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
this is painfully evident in our last

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.490 
this is painfully evident in our last
presidential<00:02:14.480> election<00:02:14.750> by<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.260> way<00:02:15.490> okay<00:02:16.490> so

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
presidential election by the way okay so

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.170 
presidential election by the way okay so
now<00:02:18.500> let's<00:02:18.830> go<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> neurology<00:02:19.910> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
now let's go to get to the neurology and

these<00:02:45.709> people<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.220> ask<00:02:46.370> myself<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.700> very

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
these people and I ask myself a very

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.430 
these people and I ask myself a very
simple<00:02:47.180> question<00:02:47.360> okay<00:02:47.750> you've<00:02:47.870> created<00:02:48.110> two

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
simple question okay you've created two

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.050 
simple question okay you've created two
people<00:02:48.800> here<00:02:49.010> what<00:02:49.730> about<00:02:49.910> their

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
people here what about their

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.640 
people here what about their
personalities<00:02:50.690> do<00:02:51.380> they<00:02:51.470> have<00:02:51.560> different

preferences<00:02:53.720> there's<00:02:54.200> one<00:02:54.380> like<00:02:54.620> blondes<00:02:55.130> and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
preferences there's one like blondes and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.220 
preferences there's one like blondes and
the<00:02:55.280> other<00:02:55.400> like<00:02:55.580> brunettes<00:02:56.000> for<00:02:56.330> example<00:02:56.720> one

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the other like brunettes for example one

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.479 
the other like brunettes for example one
like<00:02:57.410> chocolate<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.130> other<00:02:58.250> like

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
like chocolate and the other like

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.370 
like chocolate and the other like
vanilla<00:02:59.270> what<00:02:59.750> what<00:02:59.930> happens

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
vanilla what what happens

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.380 
vanilla what what happens
so<00:03:00.620> we<00:03:00.739> tried<00:03:01.040> these<00:03:01.220> experiments<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:01.940> what

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
so we tried these experiments and what

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.210 
so we tried these experiments and what
we<00:03:02.540> did<00:03:02.750> was<00:03:02.930> we<00:03:02.959> have<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.320> first<00:03:03.560> train<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
we did was we have to first train the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.650 
we did was we have to first train the
right<00:03:04.370> hemisphere<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.820> communicate<00:03:05.360> with<00:03:05.510> us

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
right hemisphere to communicate with us

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.449 
right hemisphere to communicate with us
in<00:03:06.200> fact<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.470> right<00:03:06.590> hemisphere<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.130> read

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
in fact the right hemisphere can read

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.880 
in fact the right hemisphere can read
simple<00:03:08.330> commands<00:03:08.810> simple<00:03:09.410> words<00:03:09.620> simple

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
simple commands simple words simple

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.830 
simple commands simple words simple
sentences<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.150> then<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.330> ask<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.690> question

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
sentences and then you ask a question

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.180 
sentences and then you ask a question
and<00:03:12.170> say<00:03:12.290> point<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.800> box

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and say point to a box

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.580 
and say point to a box
yes<00:03:13.430> no<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.150> don't<00:03:14.450> know<00:03:14.600> because<00:03:15.320> it<00:03:15.410> can't

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
yes no I don't know because it can't

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.009 
yes no I don't know because it can't
talk<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.100> items<00:03:16.370> we<00:03:16.519> cannot<00:03:16.760> talk<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.870> can

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
talk the items we cannot talk but it can

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.930 
talk the items we cannot talk but it can

don't<00:03:24.860> know<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.180> asked<00:03:26.480> for<00:03:26.510> example<00:03:27.049> are

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
don't know so we asked for example are

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.979 
don't know so we asked for example are
you<00:03:27.590> at<00:03:27.920> Caltech<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.450> right<00:03:29.600> hemisphere

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
you at Caltech and the right hemisphere

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.440 
you at Caltech and the right hemisphere
