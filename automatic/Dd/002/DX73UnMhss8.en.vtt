00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
that the team spirit the hunger there

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.520

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
were there was a row last season where

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.470 
were there was a row last season where
players<00:02:43.160> have<00:02:43.400> come<00:02:43.549> into<00:02:43.700> home<00:02:43.970> games<00:02:44.239> in

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.990 
players have come into home games in
tracksuits<00:02:44.959> now<00:02:45.260> that's<00:02:45.980> not<00:02:46.190> my<00:02:46.519> way<00:02:46.549> I<00:02:46.819> think

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
tracksuits now that's not my way I think

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.670 
tracksuits now that's not my way I think
home<00:02:47.420> game<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.810> collar<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.140> tie<00:02:48.380> for<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
home game is a collar and tie for the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.110 
home game is a collar and tie for the
players<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.100> think<00:02:49.130> it's<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.489> good<00:02:49.609> thing<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.970> do

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
