00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
video it's about multiple theories I

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.360 
video it's about multiple theories I
just<00:00:06.899> wanted<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.140> make<00:00:07.259> one<00:00:07.500> video<00:00:07.710> about<00:00:08.160> them

all but um we're gonna jump straight

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.140 
all but um we're gonna jump straight
into<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.590> video<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.550> as<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.759> guys<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.090> see

into the video so as you guys can see
this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.990> image<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.040> Ninjago<00:00:14.910> 2015

trailer for the new cow season and then

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.630 
trailer for the new cow season and then
like<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:22.020> looks<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.560> lot<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.070> sensei

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
like this just looks a lot like sensei

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.779 
like this just looks a lot like sensei
guys<00:00:24.109> like<00:00:25.109> maybe<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> ghost<00:00:26.010> sensing<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
guys like maybe it's a ghost sensing and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.750 
guys like maybe it's a ghost sensing and
these<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.810> bunch<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> ninja<00:00:28.859> goes

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
these are all a bunch of the ninja goes

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.160 
these are all a bunch of the ninja goes
guys<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.269> we're<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> be<00:00:30.720> able<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> see

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
guys that we're going to be able to see

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.910 
guys that we're going to be able to see
but<00:00:31.920> um<00:00:32.219> basically<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.960> theory<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
but um basically the theory is is that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310 
but um basically the theory is is that
this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.969> ghost<00:00:36.270> version<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.899> Sensei

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
this is like a ghost version of Sensei

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.080 
this is like a ghost version of Sensei
Wu<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.800> these<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.850> ghost

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
Wu and these are just like the ghost

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.459 
Wu and these are just like the ghost
ninja<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.719> there's<00:00:39.930> five<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> them

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
they're just gonna go out and just

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.779 
they're just gonna go out and just
destroy<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.989> ghost<00:00:49.200> team<00:00:49.649> power<00:00:50.610> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
guess but yeah it was just like one

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.400 
guess but yeah it was just like one
little<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:54.090> um<00:00:55.070> another<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.640> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
while Seoul archers I guess probably

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
them um but he's definitely going to be

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.600 
them um but he's definitely going to be
a<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.390> guy<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> season<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:29.280> hundred

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
help the ninja a lot so the next one is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.390 
help the ninja a lot so the next one is
it's<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.659> three-parter<00:01:37.290> thing<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:38.130> um

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's kind of a three-parter thing but um

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's kind of a three-parter thing but um
some<00:01:38.850> people<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.780> wondered<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.530> Cole<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
some people have wondered if Cole is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300 
some people have wondered if Cole is
dead<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.829> he

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
dead or not because I have to and he

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.859 
dead or not because I have to and he
looks<00:01:44.810> awfully<00:01:45.810> ghostly<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.869> picture

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
looks awfully ghostly in this picture

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.280 
looks awfully ghostly in this picture
right<00:01:49.049> here<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.579> my<00:01:50.579> theory<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> no<00:01:51.960> he

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
right here and my theory is that no he

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.789 
right here and my theory is that no he
is<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.579> maybe<00:01:53.579> dead<00:01:53.880> um<00:01:54.320> he's<00:01:55.320> probably<00:01:55.590> just

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
is not maybe dead um he's probably just

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.560 
is not maybe dead um he's probably just
hit<00:01:56.009> oh<00:01:56.189> here's<00:01:56.490> another<00:01:56.729> image<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> him<00:01:57.390> right

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
hit oh here's another image of him right

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.480 
hit oh here's another image of him right
here<00:01:57.750> he's<00:01:58.259> probably<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.740> hit<00:01:58.979> by<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
here he's probably just hit by one of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.289 
here he's probably just hit by one of
the<00:01:59.640> ghost<00:02:00.360> arrows<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.950> may<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the ghost arrows and it may be just I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.139 
the ghost arrows and it may be just I
don't<00:02:03.990> know<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:05.189> him<00:02:05.310> under<00:02:05.399> control<00:02:05.790> but

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
don't know put him under control but

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.639 
don't know put him under control but
it's<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.299> possibility<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:07.049> Cole<00:02:07.439> might

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
it's a possibility that Cole might

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
it's a possibility that Cole might
actually<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.250> dead<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.509> little<00:02:09.780> sad

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
actually be dead so that's a little sad

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.040 
actually be dead so that's a little sad
and<00:02:10.289> here's<00:02:11.039> an<00:02:11.160> image<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.520> him

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
and here's an image of him

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.900 
and here's an image of him
just<00:02:12.230> not<00:02:12.590> looking<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.070> good<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.640> ghost

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
just not looking so good as a ghost

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.320 
just not looking so good as a ghost
right<00:02:14.180> now<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.260> I'm<00:02:16.040> really<00:02:16.310> wondering<00:02:16.550> what

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
right now so I'm really wondering what

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.010 
right now so I'm really wondering what
do<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.510> guys<00:02:17.690> think<00:02:17.750> about<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:20.020> sad

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
do you guys think about this this is sad

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.420 
do you guys think about this this is sad
I<00:02:21.320> guess<00:02:21.650> if<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.070> Cole's<00:02:22.340> really<00:02:22.700> dead<00:02:22.910> yeah

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
I guess if it's Cole's really dead yeah

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.400 
I guess if it's Cole's really dead yeah
and<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.610> final<00:02:25.790> theory<00:02:26.240> is<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.540> Ronan<00:02:27.380> has

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
and the final theory is that Ronan has

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.630 
and the final theory is that Ronan has
an<00:02:27.830> elemental<00:02:28.490> ability<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.690> um<00:02:30.160> on<00:02:31.160> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
an elemental ability so um on the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.140 
an elemental ability so um on the
Ninjago<00:02:32.330> wiki<00:02:32.570> about<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.590> aeroblades<00:02:34.150> it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
Ninjago wiki about the aeroblades it

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.210 
Ninjago wiki about the aeroblades it
says<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.690> whoever<00:02:36.200> has<00:02:36.530> an<00:02:36.680> elemental

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
says that whoever has an elemental

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.460 
says that whoever has an elemental
ability<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.270> aero<00:02:38.510> blades<00:02:38.840> will<00:02:39.050> light<00:02:39.080> up

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
ability the aero blades will light up

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.110 
ability the aero blades will light up
due<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.800> their<00:02:40.040> touch<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:40.550> they<00:02:40.670> have<00:02:40.820> like<00:02:40.970> an

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
due to their touch if they have like an

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.540 
due to their touch if they have like an
elemental<00:02:41.630> ability<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:42.320> Kai<00:02:42.890> when<00:02:43.220> he<00:02:43.340> touches

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
elemental ability so Kai when he touches

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.080 
elemental ability so Kai when he touches
his<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.000> starts<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.780> turn<00:02:44.930> red<00:02:45.200> moro<00:02:46.100> or<00:02:46.490> black

raven<00:02:47.870> know<00:02:48.290> why<00:02:48.500> do<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.680> keep<00:02:48.830> saying<00:02:49.010> ghost

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
raven know why do I keep saying ghost

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.750 
raven know why do I keep saying ghost
names<00:02:49.630> Romans<00:02:50.630> he<00:02:51.290> has<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> fifth<00:02:52.130> aero<00:02:52.430> blade

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
names Romans he has a fifth aero blade

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.580 
names Romans he has a fifth aero blade
and<00:02:52.970> I'm<00:02:53.510> guessing<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.320> going<00:02:54.500> to

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
and I'm guessing that this is going to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.590 
and I'm guessing that this is going to
be<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:54.830> fifth<00:02:55.040> aeroblade<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:55.820> comes<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.330> um

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
be the fifth aeroblade that comes in um

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.530 
be the fifth aeroblade that comes in um
at<00:02:57.560> least<00:02:57.620> one<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.340> sets<00:02:58.580> because<00:02:58.820> on<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
at least one of the sets because on the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.510 
at least one of the sets because on the
back<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.930> boxes<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.860> new<00:03:01.010> sets<00:03:01.250> there

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
back of the boxes of the new sets there

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.210 
back of the boxes of the new sets there
are<00:03:01.610> five<00:03:01.970> aero<00:03:02.300> blades<00:03:02.660> not<00:03:02.900> for<00:03:03.200> even<00:03:04.160> though

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
are five aero blades not for even though

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.280 
are five aero blades not for even though
for<00:03:04.250> have<00:03:04.580> already<00:03:04.790> been<00:03:04.940> shown<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.050> sets

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
for have already been shown in the sets

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.070 
for have already been shown in the sets
so<00:03:07.040> my<00:03:07.520> guess<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.790> that<00:03:08.000> Ronan<00:03:08.630> has<00:03:08.660> an

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
so my guess is that Ronan has an

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.020 
so my guess is that Ronan has an
elemental<00:03:09.650> ability<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.100> am<00:03:10.400> not<00:03:10.640> really<00:03:10.880> sure

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
elemental ability I am not really sure

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.530 
elemental ability I am not really sure
what<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.840> but<00:03:12.260> um<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.790> can<00:03:13.940> obviously<00:03:14.180> see

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
what it is but um you can obviously see

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.120 
what it is but um you can obviously see
he<00:03:14.750> has<00:03:14.960> his<00:03:15.140> own<00:03:15.260> aero<00:03:15.530> blade<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.010> it's

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
he has his own aero blade and it's

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.979 
he has his own aero blade and it's
glowing<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.730> color<00:03:16.970> it's<00:03:17.540> kind<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:17.870> a

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
glowing a color it's kind of like a

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.199 
glowing a color it's kind of like a
greenish<00:03:18.260> color<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:19.190> really<00:03:19.850> don't<00:03:20.000> know

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
greenish color so I really don't know

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.940 
greenish color so I really don't know
what<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.420> could<00:03:20.540> mean<00:03:20.600> he<00:03:21.350> could<00:03:21.590> have<00:03:21.830> an

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
what it could mean he could have an

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.570 
what it could mean he could have an
elemental<00:03:22.459> ability<00:03:22.880> he<00:03:23.120> could<00:03:23.390> not<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.020> he

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
elemental ability he could not and he

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.270 
elemental ability he could not and he
just<00:03:25.580> has<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> narrow<00:03:26.450> blade<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:28.010> just

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
just has a narrow blade and it just

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.400 
just has a narrow blade and it just
lights<00:03:28.459> up<00:03:28.640> for<00:03:28.910> him<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:29.570> that's<00:03:30.080> what<00:03:30.290> the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
lights up for him but that's what the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.080 
lights up for him but that's what the
Ninjago<00:03:30.860> wiki<00:03:31.070> said<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.610> if<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.880> have<00:03:31.970> an

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
Ninjago wiki said that if you have an

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.790 
Ninjago wiki said that if you have an
elemental<00:03:32.600> ability<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.110> lights<00:03:33.290> up<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.650> that

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
elemental ability it lights up to that

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.820 
elemental ability it lights up to that
color<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:34.730> maybe<00:03:35.330> Ronan<00:03:35.810> has<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.320> ability

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
color so maybe Ronan has the ability

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.880 
color so maybe Ronan has the ability
maybe<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:38.540> turn<00:03:38.750> into<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.110> ghost<00:03:39.350> maybe<00:03:39.680> that's

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
maybe to turn into a ghost maybe that's

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.830 
maybe to turn into a ghost maybe that's
his<00:03:40.070> elemental<00:03:40.489> ability<00:03:40.940> no<00:03:41.600> one<00:03:41.750> really

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
his elemental ability no one really

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.050 
his elemental ability no one really
knows<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.650> was<00:03:43.100> actually<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.430> bad<00:03:43.580> guess<00:03:43.820> but

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
knows that was actually a bad guess but

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.170 
knows that was actually a bad guess but
yeah<00:03:44.570> that's<00:03:44.870> just<00:03:45.050> like<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.530> little<00:03:45.970> too<00:03:46.970> in

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180
