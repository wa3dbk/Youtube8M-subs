hello<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.159> Daniel<00:00:02.610> Linehan<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.270> I'm

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hello I'm Daniel Linehan and I'm

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.599 
hello I'm Daniel Linehan and I'm
choreographing<00:00:04.290> zombie<00:00:04.950> aporia<00:00:05.370> and

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
choreographing zombie aporia and

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:15.020 
choreographing zombie aporia and
collaborating<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:06.540> selca<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.049> Tebow<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:14.030> my

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
collaborating with selca and Tebow so my

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.680 
collaborating with selca and Tebow so my
first<00:00:15.269> idea<00:00:15.660> about<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:17.310> piece<00:00:17.580> came<00:00:17.910> from<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
first idea about this piece came from I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.070 
first idea about this piece came from I
was<00:00:19.140> inspired<00:00:19.470> by<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:21.150> structure<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.900> rock

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
was inspired by the structure of a rock

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.120 
was inspired by the structure of a rock
concert<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.880> wanted<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> piece

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
concert and I wanted to have a piece

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.150 
concert and I wanted to have a piece
that<00:00:26.390> that<00:00:27.390> took<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.650> things<00:00:28.859> from<00:00:29.070> my

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
that that took some some things from my

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640 
that that took some some things from my
rock<00:00:29.400> concerts<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.660> structure<00:00:31.140> in

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
rock concerts like the the structure in

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.010 
rock concerts like the the structure in
terms<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.369> piece<00:00:32.610> being<00:00:32.880> made<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> short

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
terms of a piece being made up of short

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.950 
terms of a piece being made up of short
separate<00:00:34.530> pieces<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.250> tracks<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> CD<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.690> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
separate pieces like tracks on a CD or I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.580 
separate pieces like tracks on a CD or I
also<00:00:37.469> say<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.250> book<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> poetry<00:00:39.590> because

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
also say like a book of poetry because

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.440 
also say like a book of poetry because
it<00:00:41.219> doesn't<00:00:41.550> necessarily<00:00:42.000> always<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.420> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it doesn't necessarily always have a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.479 
it doesn't necessarily always have a
rock<00:00:42.750> reference<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.739> has<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.129> structure

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
rock reference but it has this structure

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.799 
rock reference but it has this structure
of<00:00:44.760> shorter<00:00:45.480> pieces<00:00:47.239> but<00:00:48.239> each<00:00:48.360> piece<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.719> was

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of shorter pieces but each piece I was

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
of shorter pieces but each piece I was
looking<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.200> different<00:00:49.920> kinds<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> aporia

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
looking at different kinds of aporia

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.799 
looking at different kinds of aporia
aporia<00:00:51.539> means<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.280> logical<00:00:53.280> contradiction<00:00:53.850> but

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
aporia means a logical contradiction but

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.240 
aporia means a logical contradiction but
and<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.350> thinking<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> logical

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and i was thinking about a logical

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.069 
and i was thinking about a logical
contradiction<00:00:56.789> between<00:00:56.910> two<00:00:57.390> different

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
contradiction between two different

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.439 
contradiction between two different
things<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> would<00:00:59.010> put<00:00:59.280> two<00:00:59.609> forms<00:01:00.210> together

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
things so I would put two forms together

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
things so I would put two forms together
like<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> body<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> voice<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.860> would

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
like the body and the voice and we would

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
like the body and the voice and we would
find<00:01:05.250> ways<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:07.189> find<00:01:08.189> tension<00:01:08.670> between<00:01:08.820> these

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
find ways to find tension between these

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.140 
find ways to find tension between these
two<00:01:09.210> forms<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.799> dancers<00:01:11.220> we're<00:01:11.520> often<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
two forms so as dancers we're often in

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.020 
two forms so as dancers we're often in
situations<00:01:12.390> where<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.670> about

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
situations where we have to think about

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
situations where we have to think about
several<00:01:15.570> things<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> time<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.070> bit<00:01:17.189> like

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
several things at a time it's a bit like

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
several things at a time it's a bit like
three<00:01:17.700> young<00:01:18.330> people<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:19.259> maybe<00:01:19.560> no<00:01:19.799> we

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
three young people or maybe no we

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:20.990 
three young people or maybe no we
shouldn't<00:01:20.189> emphasize<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> fact<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
shouldn't emphasize the fact that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.920 
shouldn't emphasize the fact that
they're<00:01:21.180> young<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:22.020> they're<00:01:22.320> under<00:01:23.130> -<00:01:23.930> we're

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
they're young but they're under - we're

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
they're young but they're under - we're
young<00:01:25.170> no<00:01:26.009> we're<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.340> yet<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.729> mean<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.090> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
young no we're not yet I mean this is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
young no we're not yet I mean this is
not<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.900> about<00:01:28.500> maybe<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.250> about

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
not about it it's about maybe it's about

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.670 
not about it it's about maybe it's about
our<00:01:29.579> time<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.960> constantly

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
our time that we're constantly

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.120 
our time that we're constantly
constantly<00:01:32.340> dealing<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.409> technology<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
constantly dealing with technology and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
constantly dealing with technology and
it's<00:01:35.460> those<00:01:35.610> three<00:01:35.909> people<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.570> we

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it's those three people that are we

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.390 
it's those three people that are we
don't<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> rock<00:01:37.890> band<00:01:38.100> or<00:01:38.159> not

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
don't know if it's a rock band or not

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120 
don't know if it's a rock band or not
but<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:38.820> always<00:01:39.000> under<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:40.130> some

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
but there are always under going some

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.060 
but there are always under going some
sort<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.490> external<00:01:42.479> forces<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.170> tasks<00:01:43.829> that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
sort of external forces or tasks that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
sort of external forces or tasks that
they<00:01:44.340> assign<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.880> themselves<00:01:45.360> yeah<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> mean<00:01:46.259> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
they assign to themselves yeah I mean I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.870 
they assign to themselves yeah I mean I
was<00:01:46.470> interested<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.979> working<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.549> idea

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
was interested in working with this idea

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.690 
was interested in working with this idea
of<00:01:47.939> tasks<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.869> tasks<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.530> sweeping<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of tasks but not tasks like sweeping and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.429 
of tasks but not tasks like sweeping and
running<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.149> broom<00:01:51.420> across<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> floor<00:01:52.290> but

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
running a broom across the floor but

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350 
running a broom across the floor but
more<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> task<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.729> fully<00:01:53.970> engage

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
more like a task that would fully engage

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.209 
more like a task that would fully engage
the<00:01:54.570> whole<00:01:54.720> body<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:56.009> body

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the whole body and like the body

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.280 
the whole body and like the body
including<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.820> voice<00:01:57.200> including<00:01:58.200> our

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
including the voice including our

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.929 
including the voice including our
concentration<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> our<00:01:59.189> thoughts<00:01:59.430> like

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
concentration and our thoughts like

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.899 
concentration and our thoughts like
something<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.810> really<00:02:00.990> requires<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.909> stamina

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
something that really requires a stamina

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.140 
something that really requires a stamina
and<00:02:03.240> requires<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.689> lot<00:02:03.780> of

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
and requires a lot of

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.460 
and requires a lot of
concentration<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.420> multitasking<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
concentration and multitasking and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.050 
concentration and multitasking and
there's<00:02:07.770> something<00:02:07.980> a<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.369> desperate<00:02:08.640> about

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
there's something a bit desperate about

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 
there's something a bit desperate about
it<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.660> I'll<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.410> we're<00:02:10.649> giving<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:11.130> lot

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
it I think I'll like we're giving a lot

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.990 
it I think I'll like we're giving a lot
of<00:02:11.490> like<00:02:11.940> energy<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:13.050> lot<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.440> force<00:02:14.000> and

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
of like energy and a lot of force and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.530 
of like energy and a lot of force and
we're<00:02:15.150> singing<00:02:15.510> loud<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.550> shaking<00:02:17.550> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
we're singing loud and shaking and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.520 
we're singing loud and shaking and
moving<00:02:20.690> something<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.810> about<00:02:22.320> while

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
moving something I think about while

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.430 
moving something I think about while
performing<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.780> their<00:02:24.780> relationship<00:02:25.200> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
performing it is their relationship to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
performing it is their relationship to
the<00:02:25.500> audience<00:02:25.800> here's<00:02:26.370> some<00:02:26.520> how<00:02:26.640> we're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the audience here's some how we're

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.900 
the audience here's some how we're
together<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.810> through<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.650> tasks<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.730> it's

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
together but through the tasks so it's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.790 
together but through the tasks so it's
the<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.360> tasks<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.720> bring<00:02:31.140> us<00:02:31.290> together<00:02:31.470> and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
the the tasks that bring us together and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.240 
the the tasks that bring us together and
sometimes<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.940> create<00:02:33.660> some<00:02:33.930> sort<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
sometimes they create some sort of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.500 
sometimes they create some sort of
distance<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.550> audience<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.120> sometimes

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
distance with the audience and sometimes

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.010 
distance with the audience and sometimes
on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> contrary<00:02:37.200> they<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:38.010> force<00:02:38.340> us<00:02:38.520> to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
on the contrary they they force us to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.710 
on the contrary they they force us to
look<00:02:40.020> at<00:02:40.140> them<00:02:40.260> be<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.740> them<00:02:40.800> or<00:02:41.510> into<00:02:42.510> them

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
look at them be with them or into them

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.190 
look at them be with them or into them
be<00:02:43.080> moving<00:02:43.590> inside<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.040> it
