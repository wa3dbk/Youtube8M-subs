actually oftentimes accused of being

actually oftentimes accused of being
dogmatic<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.690> these<00:00:36.840> things<00:00:37.050> by<00:00:37.260> people<00:00:37.620> who

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
dogmatic on these things by people who

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.590 
dogmatic on these things by people who
don't<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.160> look<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:38.879> everything<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
don't actually look at everything I have

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.030 
don't actually look at everything I have
to<00:00:39.750> say<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.110> that's<00:00:40.200> these<00:00:40.379> little<00:00:40.469> debates

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to say and that's these little debates

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.020 
to say and that's these little debates
about<00:00:41.600> high<00:00:42.600> reps<00:00:42.930> versus<00:00:43.469> low<00:00:43.739> reps<00:00:44.040> high

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
about high reps versus low reps high

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.690 
about high reps versus low reps high
volume<00:00:45.510> versus<00:00:45.899> low<00:00:46.079> volume<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.399> we'll<00:00:47.550> all

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
volume versus low volume and we'll all

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
volume versus low volume and we'll all
be<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> first<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> tell<00:00:48.539> people<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.050> think

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
be the first to tell people that I think

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.779 
be the first to tell people that I think
most<00:00:49.620> people<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.250> biggest<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
most people can get biggest and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.810 
most people can get biggest and
strongest<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.800> moderate<00:00:52.800> volume<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.460> long<00:00:53.670> as

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
strongest on moderate volume as long as

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
strongest on moderate volume as long as
frequency<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.420> high<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> frequencies

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
frequency is high in the frequencies

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.350 
frequency is high in the frequencies
accounting<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> volume<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.550> fairly<00:00:57.149> low

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
accounting for the volume and fairly low

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.590 
accounting for the volume and fairly low
reps<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.309> think<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.460> person<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.180> foolish

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
reps I think a person would be foolish

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.110 
reps I think a person would be foolish
whether<00:01:01.230> their<00:01:01.469> goals<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:02.010> size<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.820> strength

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
whether their goals are size or strength

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
whether their goals are size or strength
and<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.629> believe<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.559> disconnect

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and I don't believe you can disconnect

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.340 
and I don't believe you can disconnect
the<00:01:05.189> two<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> most<00:01:05.850> part<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> I've

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the two for the most part and I've

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
the two for the most part and I've
covered<00:01:07.590> over<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.280> why<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.729> want

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
covered over and over why I don't want

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.219 
covered over and over why I don't want
to<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.450> again<00:01:09.720> today<00:01:09.869> and

program don't ask me if you should

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
program don't ask me if you should
change<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> answer<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.840> no<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.530> change

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
so that you change things just as you're

push<00:02:23.140> past<00:02:23.320> those<00:02:23.560> plateaus<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.840> mean

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
push past those plateaus and what I mean

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.480 
push past those plateaus and what I mean
is<00:02:26.200> if<00:02:26.350> you're<00:02:26.470> doing<00:02:26.680> three<00:02:26.950> reps<00:02:27.160> sets

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
is if you're doing three reps sets

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.580 
is if you're doing three reps sets
you're<00:02:28.420> gaining<00:02:28.660> hypertrophy<00:02:29.380> you're

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
you're gaining hypertrophy you're

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.470 
you're gaining hypertrophy you're
getting<00:02:29.920> bigger<00:02:30.310> off<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.790> heavy<00:02:31.000> three<00:02:31.240> rep

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480

sets with heavy compound movements in
addition<00:02:34.960> to<00:02:35.020> getting<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.290> lot<00:02:35.320> stronger<00:02:35.770> but

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
addition to getting a lot stronger but

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.960 
addition to getting a lot stronger but
the<00:02:36.070> difference<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.490> when<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.640> start<00:02:36.940> getting

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
the difference is when you start getting

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.330 
the difference is when you start getting
reps<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.690> load<00:02:38.050> there's<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> power<00:02:38.710> element

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340

that doesn't exist you're training

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.950 
that doesn't exist you're training
yourself<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.930> lift<00:02:41.500> more<00:02:41.650> explosively<00:02:42.960> so

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
yourself to lift more explosively so

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.780 
yourself to lift more explosively so
there's<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.230> specific<00:02:44.770> neural<00:02:45.250> component

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
there's a specific neural component

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.240 
there's a specific neural component
involved<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:47.170> isn't<00:02:47.530> present<00:02:47.980> when<00:02:48.100> you're

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
doing higher reps in this but by that

on your one rep max in your three rep
max<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.530> also<00:02:59.650> if<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.390> increase<00:03:01.390> your<00:03:01.630> 10<00:03:02.050> rep

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
max is also if you increase your 10 rep

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.670 
max is also if you increase your 10 rep
max<00:03:02.530> by<00:03:03.490> 10%<00:03:04.240> I<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:05.020> almost<00:03:05.170> guarantee<00:03:05.350> you

max by 10% I can almost guarantee you
that<00:03:05.830> your<00:03:06.070> one<00:03:06.190> rep<00:03:06.400> max<00:03:06.430> goes<00:03:06.820> up<00:03:06.970> also<00:03:07.150> in

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
that your one rep max goes up also in

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.490 
that your one rep max goes up also in
addition<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.840> fact<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.230> gained<00:03:08.410> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
addition to the fact that you gained a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.100 
addition to the fact that you gained a
lot<00:03:08.650> more<00:03:08.680> hypertrophy<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.180> all<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.990> this

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
lot more hypertrophy so all of this

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.690 
lot more hypertrophy so all of this
feeds<00:03:11.380> into<00:03:11.530> each<00:03:11.800> other<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.220> knowing<00:03:12.340> how<00:03:12.670> to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
feeds into each other and knowing how to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.060 
feeds into each other and knowing how to
rotate<00:03:13.510> through<00:03:13.990> these<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.590> learning<00:03:14.950> how<00:03:15.040> to

rotate through these and learning how to

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.600 
rotate through these and learning how to
do<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.940> different<00:03:16.330> methodologies<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.610> I

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
do so with different methodologies and I

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.280 
do so with different methodologies and I
think<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.940> lot<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.150> people<00:03:19.450> do<00:03:19.690> do<00:03:19.840> better<00:03:20.080> on

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
think a lot of people do do better on

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.470 
think a lot of people do do better on
linear<00:03:20.500> type<00:03:20.860> periodization<00:03:21.310> than<00:03:21.910> nonlinear

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
linear type periodization than nonlinear

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.940 
linear type periodization than nonlinear
depending<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:22.990> what<00:03:23.200> your<00:03:23.350> specific<00:03:23.770> goals

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950

depending on what your specific goals
are<00:03:24.990> but<00:03:25.990> this<00:03:26.170> can<00:03:26.320> push<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.680> past<00:03:26.830> plateaus

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
are but this can push you past plateaus

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.040 
are but this can push you past plateaus
and<00:03:27.580> keep<00:03:27.790> your<00:03:28.000> body<00:03:28.210> growing<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:28.960> the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
and keep your body growing and it's the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.200 
and keep your body growing and it's the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.570 
lifts per session I can't find evidence
of<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.200> now<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.410> do<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.830> believe<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.550> does

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
of it now I do I believe that it does

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.250 
of it now I do I believe that it does
yeah<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.060> believe<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.660> does<00:03:46.840> for<00:03:47.020> my<00:03:47.140> own

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
yeah I believe that it does for my own

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.730 
yeah I believe that it does for my own
observations<00:03:47.950> my<00:03:48.070> anecdote<00:03:48.990> but<00:03:49.990> we<00:03:50.560> don't

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
observations my anecdote but we don't

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
observations my anecdote but we don't
actually<00:03:50.860> have<00:03:51.190> much<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.580> way<00:03:51.670> of

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
actually have much in the way of

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.840 
actually have much in the way of
evidence<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.330> prove<00:03:52.360> that

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.400 

but<00:03:57.850> in<00:03:58.000> my<00:03:58.150> experience<00:03:58.410> dramatically

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
but in my experience dramatically

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.470 
but in my experience dramatically
increasing<00:04:00.130> volume<00:04:00.580> is<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.790> good<00:04:01.000> way<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.150> push

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
increasing volume is a good way to push

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.010 
increasing volume is a good way to push
plus<00:04:01.750> plateaus<00:04:02.740> if<00:04:03.610> you're<00:04:04.330> doing<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.750> set

stalled<00:04:10.060> on<00:04:10.240> it<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.660> start<00:04:10.870> increasing

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
stalled on it and you start increasing

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.170 
stalled on it and you start increasing
the<00:04:11.709> number<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.040> sets<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.610> do<00:04:12.730> per<00:04:12.940> session

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
the number of sets you do per session

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.289 
the number of sets you do per session
and<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.570> push<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.200> volume<00:04:14.560> up<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:16.060> will

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
and you push that volume up it will

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.120 
and you push that volume up it will
oftentimes<00:04:16.690> push<00:04:17.230> you<00:04:17.440> past<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.890> plateau

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
oftentimes push you past that plateau

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.370 
oftentimes push you past that plateau
you<00:04:18.370> will<00:04:18.580> get<00:04:18.730> stronger<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.540> once<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.049> pushes

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
you will get stronger and once it pushes

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.080 
you will get stronger and once it pushes
you<00:04:20.470> past<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:20.919> plateau<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.400> can<00:04:21.729> drop<00:04:21.880> the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
you past that plateau you can drop the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.850 
you past that plateau you can drop the
volume<00:04:22.210> back<00:04:22.600> down<00:04:22.840> increase<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.530> weight<00:04:23.710> and

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
volume back down increase the weight and

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.330 
volume back down increase the weight and
continue<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.340> make<00:04:24.520> gains

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
continue to make gains

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.420 
continue to make gains
so<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:26.270> shouldn't<00:04:26.630> ever<00:04:27.020> be<00:04:27.139> a<00:04:27.530> situation<00:04:27.980> of

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
so it shouldn't ever be a situation of

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.550 
so it shouldn't ever be a situation of
us<00:04:28.639> going<00:04:28.970> either<00:04:29.210> or<00:04:29.570> should<00:04:30.080> we<00:04:30.200> be<00:04:30.230> using

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
us going either or should we be using

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.290 
us going either or should we be using
high<00:04:30.919> volume<00:04:31.370> low<00:04:31.430> volumes<00:04:31.820> should<00:04:32.090> be<00:04:32.180> we

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
high volume low volumes should be we

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.940 
high volume low volumes should be we
using<00:04:32.570> high<00:04:32.720> rap<00:04:32.960> verses<00:04:33.200> low<00:04:33.500> reps<00:04:33.740> the

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
using high rap verses low reps the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.629 
using high rap verses low reps the
answer<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.600> yes<00:04:35.800> yes<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:36.980> should<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.220> using

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
answer is yes yes you should be using

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.350 
answer is yes yes you should be using
those<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:39.550> because<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:40.669> choose<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.150> warm

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
those and because you choose to warm

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.550 
those and because you choose to warm
doesn't<00:04:41.720> mean<00:04:41.840> that<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.169> others<00:04:42.410> are

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
doesn't mean that the others are

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.470 
doesn't mean that the others are
mutually<00:04:42.950> exclusive<00:04:42.980> these<00:04:43.669> are<00:04:43.820> all<00:04:43.970> unique

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
mutually exclusive these are all unique

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.240 
mutually exclusive these are all unique

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
tools that have their own benefits and

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.490 
tools that have their own benefits and
uses<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.850> if<00:04:47.270> you<00:04:47.389> learn<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.630> utilize<00:04:47.900> all<00:04:48.350> of

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
uses and if you learn to utilize all of

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.950 
uses and if you learn to utilize all of
them<00:04:48.620> appropriately<00:04:49.419> it's<00:04:50.419> gonna<00:04:50.660> make<00:04:50.930> it

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
them appropriately it's gonna make it

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.600 
them appropriately it's gonna make it
easier<00:04:51.500> for<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.800> reach<00:04:52.040> your<00:04:52.190> goals<00:04:52.430> in
