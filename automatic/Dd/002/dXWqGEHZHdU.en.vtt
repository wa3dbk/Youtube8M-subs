changes is they kind of fix the glass
you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.949> kind<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.220> tell<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.179> glass<00:00:30.539> back<00:00:30.869> then

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
you can kind of tell the glass back then

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.630 
you can kind of tell the glass back then
if<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.349> ahead<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.679> take<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> normal

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
piece of glass actually a normal piece

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.790 
piece of glass actually a normal piece
of<00:00:36.329> glass<00:00:36.450> over<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:36.960> bad<00:00:37.140> but<00:00:37.590> if<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
look at the normal piece of glass the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.560 
look at the normal piece of glass the
transparent<00:00:41.340> glass<00:00:41.520> or<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.030> transparent

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
transparent glass or the new transparent

glass that they add in in the previous
41<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.059> snapshot<00:00:45.480> 41<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.710> B<00:00:46.980> snapshot<00:00:47.460> look

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
41 a snapshot 41 a and B snapshot look

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
41 a snapshot 41 a and B snapshot look
just<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.660> with<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> white<00:00:49.200> little

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
just like this with the white little

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529 
just like this with the white little
lines<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.430> tell<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.059> lot

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
lines and now you can tell it is a lot

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
lines and now you can tell it is a lot
more<00:00:51.899> transparent<00:00:52.829> than<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.039> was<00:00:53.129> before<00:00:53.250> so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
more transparent than it was before so

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.830 
more transparent than it was before so
we're<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.730> ahead<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:53.969> look<00:00:54.059> through<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.390> we

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
we're go ahead and look through this we

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
we're go ahead and look through this we
can<00:00:54.989> definitely<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.800> straight<00:00:56.100> through<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
can definitely see straight through it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
can definitely see straight through it
doesn't<00:00:56.579> matter<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:57.000> color<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.840> can

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
doesn't matter what color we can

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
doesn't matter what color we can
definitely<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.500> um<00:00:58.710> through<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> lot

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
definitely see um through it a lot

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
definitely see um through it a lot
better<00:01:00.090> than<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.480> could<00:01:00.719> before<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
better than we could before because it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.229 
better than we could before because it
had<00:01:01.500> these<00:01:01.680> white<00:01:01.949> lines<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.030> wasn't

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
had these white lines and it just wasn't

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
had these white lines and it just wasn't
transparent<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.589> before<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.790> they

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
transparent as it was before also they

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
transparent as it was before also they
are<00:01:05.970> adding<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.500> added<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
are adding in or they have added in this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
are adding in or they have added in this
new<00:01:08.580> thing<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.659> compatible<00:01:10.290> with

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
new thing that is compatible with

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
new thing that is compatible with
resource<00:01:11.159> packs<00:01:11.430> where<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.240> your

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
resource packs where you can make your

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870 
resource packs where you can make your
own<00:01:12.479> types<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.680> sounds<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> don't<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
own types of sounds now I don't have a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
own types of sounds now I don't have a
demonstration<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
demonstration as of right now but you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.760 
demonstration as of right now but you
can<00:01:17.280> add<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.810> own<00:01:18.930> sound<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.650> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
can add in your own sound so if you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.380 
can add in your own sound so if you
wanted<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> make<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> song<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.210> something

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
wanted to make like a song or something

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
wanted to make like a song or something
and<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.619> put<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> command<00:01:23.460> block

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and you can put it in a command block

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.670 
and you can put it in a command block
and<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.780> exactly<00:01:24.810> how<00:01:25.560> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and I don't really know exactly how it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.230 
and I don't really know exactly how it
works<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.280> mess<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> strip<00:01:27.119> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
works but you can mess with the strip of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.539 
works but you can mess with the strip of
the<00:01:27.330> scripts<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.650> resource<00:01:29.070> packs<00:01:29.340> or

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the scripts and the resource packs or

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.580 
the scripts and the resource packs or
aka<00:01:29.909> texture<00:01:30.329> packs<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.350> actually

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
aka texture packs and you can actually

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.330 
aka texture packs and you can actually
get<00:01:32.570> completely<00:01:33.570> custom<00:01:34.259> sounds<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
get completely custom sounds not just in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
get completely custom sounds not just in
single<00:01:35.670> player<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.210> multiplayers<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
single player but also multiplayers this

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.350 
single player but also multiplayers this
is<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.530> big<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:37.890> servers<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.329> example

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
is really big for servers so for example

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.260 
is really big for servers so for example
