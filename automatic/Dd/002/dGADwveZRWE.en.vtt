learning<00:00:07.770> tool<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.639> understand<00:00:09.530> exposure

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
learning tool to understand exposure

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.959 
learning tool to understand exposure
really<00:00:11.010> well<00:00:12.200> so<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> did<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:14.340> example

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
really well so what I did is an example

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
really well so what I did is an example
here<00:00:15.150> because<00:00:15.299> I'm<00:00:15.389> not<00:00:15.420> very<00:00:15.719> good<00:00:16.049> HDR<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.740> I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
here because I'm not very good HDR and I

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.250 
here because I'm not very good HDR and I
thought<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.640> show<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.420> how<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> did<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.990> maybe

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
thought if I show you how I did it maybe

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.620 
thought if I show you how I did it maybe
come<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.680> good<00:00:19.830> chime<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.369> help<00:00:20.520> me<00:00:20.670> tell

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
come to a good chime in and help me tell

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.519 
come to a good chime in and help me tell
me<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:21.900> doing<00:00:21.930> wrong

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
me what I'm doing wrong

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.460 
me what I'm doing wrong
so<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:24.900> good<00:00:25.050> HDR

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
so this is I think is a really good HDR

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
so this is I think is a really good HDR

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
never see so I'm going to do ISO of 200

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
never see so I'm going to do ISO of 200
because<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.739> want<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> capture<00:00:50.219> some<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
aperture priority because we don't want

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.439 
aperture priority because we don't want
to<00:00:54.960> change<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.649> field<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.910> only<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.420> to

looks good and right here the monitor

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.559 
looks good and right here the monitor
and<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.200> wall<00:02:37.560> looks<00:02:37.860> pretty<00:02:38.190> good<00:02:38.540> okay<00:02:39.540> now

imported them into Lightroom here's the
first<00:02:45.269> shot<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:45.959> i<00:02:46.110> think<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.739> zero

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
first shot which i think is the zero

first shot which i think is the zero
bracketed<00:02:48.330> shot<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.769> is<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.280> minus<00:02:50.610> two

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
bracketed shot and this is the minus two

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.550 
bracketed shot and this is the minus two

shot you can see the sky looks pretty
good<00:02:53.930> grass<00:02:54.930> looks<00:02:55.230> pretty<00:02:55.470> good<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.040> then

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
good grass looks pretty good and then

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.880 
good grass looks pretty good and then
here's<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.630> overexposed<00:02:57.630> plus<00:02:58.019> two<00:02:58.260> shot<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890

you can see the wall looks pretty good

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.050 
you can see the wall looks pretty good
but<00:03:01.440> I'd<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.709> see<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.670> bit<00:03:02.850> more

and<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.390> program<00:03:03.810> using<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.350> called

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
and the program using is called

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.360 
and the program using is called
Lightroom<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:06.299> I'm<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.900> increase<00:03:07.650> that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370

about<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> stop<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.690> think<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.380> stop

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
about a stop I think that just one stop

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.620 
about a stop I think that just one stop
you<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.549> see<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.790> wall<00:03:11.970> looks<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.269> little<00:03:12.390> bit

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
you can see the wall looks a little bit

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.970 
you can see the wall looks a little bit
better<00:03:12.900> I'm<00:03:13.140> looking<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> wall<00:03:13.890> right<00:03:14.130> now

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
better I'm looking at the wall right now

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.740 
better I'm looking at the wall right now

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
and actually let me bring it down ever

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.990 
and actually let me bring it down ever
so<00:03:18.989> slightly<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.280> what's<00:03:20.430> good<00:03:20.609> about<00:03:20.700> this

round-trip<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.750> back<00:04:00.930> into<00:04:01.489> Lightroom<00:04:02.489> so

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
round-trip it back into Lightroom so

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.289 
round-trip it back into Lightroom so
I'll<00:04:02.970> say<00:04:03.120> export<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:04.739> right<00:04:04.859> now<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.310> guess

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
I'll say export so right now it's guess

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.610 
I'll say export so right now it's guess
it's<00:04:06.480> reducing<00:04:06.840> nowadays<00:04:07.200> it's<00:04:07.440> aligning

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
it's reducing nowadays it's aligning

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.660 
it's reducing nowadays it's aligning

what I'm doing but you know the way it

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.990 
what I'm doing but you know the way it
looks<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.960> looks<00:05:05.110> pretty<00:05:05.530> good<00:05:05.970> except<00:05:06.970> for

looks it looks pretty good except for

looks it looks pretty good except for
all<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.390> noise<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:08.650> can<00:05:08.800> see<00:05:08.950> there's

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
all that noise you can see there's

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.100 
all that noise you can see there's
presets<00:05:09.610> down<00:05:09.850> here<00:05:10.150> some<00:05:10.750> of<00:05:10.780> them<00:05:10.960> look

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
presets down here some of them look

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.880

really<00:05:11.700> it's<00:05:12.700> really<00:05:13.480> trippy<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.530> I'll<00:05:14.590> save

really it's really trippy so I'll save

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.530

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
once it's back in the Lightroom will go

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.360 
once it's back in the Lightroom will go
ahead<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.550> tweak<00:05:21.850> it<00:05:21.970> up<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.210> little<00:05:22.419> bit<00:05:23.370> so

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
ahead and tweak it up a little bit so

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.400 
ahead and tweak it up a little bit so
all<00:05:25.060> right<00:05:25.210> now<00:05:25.240> I'm<00:05:25.510> looking<00:05:25.660> out<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:26.230> I'm

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
all right now I'm looking out and I'm

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.840 
all right now I'm looking out and I'm
looking<00:05:26.530> at<00:05:26.800> what<00:05:26.980> I've<00:05:27.070> got<00:05:27.100> here<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.760> it's

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
looking at what I've got here and it's

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.720 
looking at what I've got here and it's
pretty<00:05:28.120> darn<00:05:28.390> close<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.260> sky<00:05:29.620> needs<00:05:30.400> to<00:05:30.610> be

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
pretty darn close the sky needs to be

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.900 
pretty darn close the sky needs to be
bluer<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:32.260> alright<00:05:33.190> I'm<00:05:33.250> gonna<00:05:33.430> add<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.640> little

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
bluer so alright I'm gonna add a little

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.460 
bluer so alright I'm gonna add a little
bit<00:05:34.210> of<00:05:34.860> vibrance<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.130> saturation<00:05:37.350> into<00:05:38.350> my

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
bit of vibrance and saturation into my

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.120 
bit of vibrance and saturation into my
photo<00:05:38.770> ID<00:05:39.040> still<00:05:39.400> too<00:05:39.640> much<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:43.060> then<00:05:44.130> expose

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
photo ID still too much and then expose

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.030 
photo ID still too much and then expose
your<00:05:45.400> eyes<00:05:45.580> it<00:05:45.910> looks<00:05:46.150> about<00:05:46.630> right<00:05:47.080> let's

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
your eyes it looks about right let's

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.670 
your eyes it looks about right let's
take<00:05:48.160> a<00:05:48.250> look<00:05:48.310> at<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.790> contrast<00:05:50.970> and<00:05:52.229> I<00:05:53.229> think

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
take a look at the contrast and I think

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.490 
take a look at the contrast and I think
we<00:05:53.860> want<00:05:54.240> this<00:05:55.240> type<00:05:55.540> of<00:05:55.570> contrast<00:05:56.169> just<00:05:56.260> a

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
we want this type of contrast just a

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.840 
we want this type of contrast just a
linear<00:05:56.680> contrast<00:05:57.720> alright<00:05:58.720> let's<00:05:58.900> take<00:05:59.140> the

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
linear contrast alright let's take the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.350 
linear contrast alright let's take the
luminance<00:06:00.850> on<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.450> sky<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.580> bring<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:03.820> down

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
luminance on the sky and bring that down

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.540 
luminance on the sky and bring that down
and<00:06:05.290> it's<00:06:05.979> too<00:06:06.280> much<00:06:07.080> all<00:06:08.080> right<00:06:08.200> there<00:06:08.550> then

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
and it's too much all right there then

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.000 
and it's too much all right there then
let's<00:06:09.580> go<00:06:10.030> ahead<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.390> definitely<00:06:10.930> sharpen

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.300 

yeah<00:06:15.090> there's<00:06:16.090> some<00:06:16.240> sharpening<00:06:17.160> job<00:06:18.160> that

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
yeah there's some sharpening job that

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.810 
yeah there's some sharpening job that
looks<00:06:18.490> better<00:06:18.700> I<00:06:19.090> never<00:06:20.080> look<00:06:20.380> so<00:06:20.410> good<00:06:20.820> so

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
looks better I never look so good so

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.490 
looks better I never look so good so
there's<00:06:22.210> lots<00:06:22.510> of<00:06:22.690> noise<00:06:22.840> so<00:06:23.200> I'm<00:06:23.260> gonna<00:06:23.350> use

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
there's lots of noise so I'm gonna use

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.260 
there's lots of noise so I'm gonna use
the<00:06:23.620> noise<00:06:23.830> reduction<00:06:24.870> you<00:06:25.870> know<00:06:26.080> it's<00:06:27.270> it's

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
the noise reduction you know it's it's

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.980 
the noise reduction you know it's it's
probably<00:06:28.390> gonna<00:06:28.630> be<00:06:28.720> too<00:06:28.750> much

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
probably gonna be too much

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.070 
probably gonna be too much
let's<00:06:30.350> back<00:06:30.590> it<00:06:30.620> out<00:06:33.400> see<00:06:34.400> I<00:06:34.430> don't<00:06:34.580> know<00:06:34.699> why

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
let's back it out see I don't know why

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.670 
let's back it out see I don't know why
photo<00:06:36.080> max<00:06:36.350> creates<00:06:36.919> so<00:06:37.220> much<00:06:37.639> noise<00:06:38.680> alright

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
photo max creates so much noise alright

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.059 
photo max creates so much noise alright
