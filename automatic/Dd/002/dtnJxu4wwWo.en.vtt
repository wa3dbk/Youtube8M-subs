00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello friends with you valery 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.560
 Rudenko 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:12.120
 today we'll talk cooking in what 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.710
 wintering here is such a family I keep it in 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:20.630
 Generally in this hive for 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:24.359
 the conclusion and then I will have her winter Glinka 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 But on such bars to raise to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.039
 increase under the frame space 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.489
 so they will spend the winter better here 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.210
 I leave a lot of frames 8 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.170
 grams maximum is a good family they 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.440
 must fully chew the bee frame 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.750
 even now i will form they are not in oil 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.350
 they will shine their way on 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.350
 the walls are therefore very important to 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.830
 chewed completely frame in winter we 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.600
 raise because space 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:05.979
 leaves enough 1 row 1 frame 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.780
 there is almost enough sugar here 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:15.250
 you can feel a little feed up the frame 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:19.780
 almost completely flooded 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.310
 here a little sugar to give them here principle 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 a mixture of honey and sugar 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.280
 top was sealed honey is still honey with 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.460
 good colors that are not 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.310
 crystallizes 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 Well, sugar added that is one 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.420
 put between the barley frame and in the middle 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.640
 preferably already almost formed then 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.190
 have not ruin how the bees themselves built 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.990
 so leave the main thing so as not to hit 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.440
 middle of the first on what can the club 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.930
 split that is practically i will take away 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.470
 extra frame on the sides and leave only 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.130
 mid nest bees themselves 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.270
 formed and I will not disturb them 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.420
 as there is so there would add Well 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.430
 Somewhere it will look like this 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.360
 8 frames left 9 put on the side there 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.549
 brood a little more they will give a portion 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.430
 syrup here these frames are generally removed 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.530
 partially and can not drag out 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.540
 then I will put behind the false board that is 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.680
 such framework 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.959
 they are sealed there a little spray there 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.970
 good framework that formed the frame 2 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.340
 put here for the first time we are up to 1 and you 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.010
 here a little credit, too well, there 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.280
 and more such massive this thing in 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.730
 in the middle we are there also to form 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.780
 spoons there is space i think they 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.780
 we ourselves put 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.050
 that's all the formation raised on here 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.320
 such inserts in such a bee house 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.320
 winter 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.070
 I here now assured them disturbed if they 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.840
 quite a lot of families such care 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.820
 very much in time occupy everything to new 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:28.690
 meetings go to the site homemade 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:32.690
 plague . we will spend the winter chelas new 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.810
