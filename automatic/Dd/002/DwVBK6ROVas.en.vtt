 behind the family they are also managed 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.700
 it seems to me that marriage remains the fundamental basis of the family 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.890
 and it has to remain and that's the way it has to be 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.930
 6 It can not be us when we see a conjugal problem 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.560
 what we detect is that it is that their husbands spouses misbehave between 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.120
 they and they become better parents 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.680
 for a time 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.060
 I consider that before being a good father, a good husband needs to be a good husband 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.970
 he has a lot more numbers to be a good father 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.260

 3 when marriages when they are getting married 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.180
 We can tell you the following 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.330
 be very clear 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 If I believe that there is a prevention campaign there 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.700
 today society 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.560
 the immaturity of society 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.520
 by scientist we certainly in the the speed we use 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.340
 the difficulty she now what to think the things of maturing things 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.480
 m the difficulties that day traders have to assume the 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.120
 responsibility and commitment 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.020
 all that so 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.530
 porsche 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.280
 When they got married 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.500
 they need to have everything at hand they need to have everything together they need to have it 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.710
 all cd 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.370
 i immediate 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.540
 we are in the society of immediacy we can now speak 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.250
 quietly on the phone with whom we want we have men 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.760
 all over the world we can take by computer in an immediate way the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.840
 Basque country flights wherever 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.340
 In marriage, you do not need that immediacy, you have to let them mature. 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.380
 that let him wait there is a complaint and that it burns the marriage in the married couple 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.330
 husbands must curdle 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.299
 that relationship between them should dexter paper 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:17.299
 to be together to make a unit we detect many marriages 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.829
 percent and with less than five or ten years of marriage a lack of 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.489
 dignity of feeling 1 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.719
 and many continue to work and move their marriage to their 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.079
 individualism 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.459
 that they carry from their previous stage 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.159
 so I would tell them training to know what they are going 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.029
 and activity 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:37.269
 that maturity 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.049
 of commitment of responsibility 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.120
 during the marriage proceedings calmly with patience knowing that it has 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.379
 a very nice thing between the hands the inde then one thing that has to go growing 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.899
 and knowing that it is one thing 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.059
 in him pity of haiti hinds immediacy 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.589
 is not going to take effect the marriage is necessary 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.959
 Let Bush Aznar's appointment be left to curdle 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.159
 patron appointment 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.309
 to mature 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:07.889
 and that undoubtedly is the predation between greetings and Asia ment 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.659
 or are we organic 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.999
 and family sts six sessions by the way during truth 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.379
 because whenever there is an organic alteration of the union pro 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.529
 of the family 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:22.849
 or of marriage 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.609
 undoubtedly the collective is affected 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.359
 that is why it is studied from other points of view of these therapies 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.479
 narratives of behavioral therapy systemic therapies 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.049
 this person 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.199
 by nature he is a sociable being 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.779
 therefore he needs to live in society and the repercussion that this one brings 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:41.359
 with health problems 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.890
 obviously affecting 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.779
 to the set of the whole family 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.939
 of marriage 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:52.000
 that's why for this reason we and from our practice the usual we see how 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.889
 there is an affectation 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.239
 fundamentally 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.479
 at the first conjugal level 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.129
 later family 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.310
 when there is a medical disease 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.659
 or psychiatric 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.779
 what in one of the most shocks of the family members 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.999
 the fact that there is some organization 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.999
 that is dedicated 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:10.139
 to connect 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.399
 the society 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.319
 with family and conan with health 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.430
 sponda sale 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.170
 yes it seems that lived the people is the society go on the one hand the family that 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.529
 every time it seems that they are leaving 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.590
 breaking andrea do not go for another 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.139
 and that the authorities believe that the three mergers must be integrated 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.999
 therefore all those events are required 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:37.439
 in congresses symposiums that even he 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.930
 those three questions that is fundamental 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.020
 being repaired by james and bosh 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.800
 p 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.840
 right now 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.560
 touching the topic of the oncological patient relating to the family 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.789
 with the cancer patient and his affectation 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.120
 on the other hand what we have done the affectation of a disease in a 

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:00.439
 elderly patient how the family affects as a marriage or healthy spouse 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.490
 and of course the situation of 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.330
 children the disease to the people thinking with that so many commenting on 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.080
 these last years in spain 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.740
 obviously connecting with education with society and by 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.039
 course with the family parents zdf 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.179
 an experience only 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.779
 it was adequate 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.180
 for a few years it has been seen 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.180
 it a phenomenon that is paradoxical 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:31.069
 or no agreement 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.300
 what is it have increased a lot 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.889
 demands of child and adolescent psychiatry 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.629
 and in those same years 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.629
 yes it has also increased that the number of separations and divorces 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.639
 there is some relationship we do not know for bendodo we are developing a 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.529
 investigation 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.970
 to try to discern as background 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.290
 I do not know there is a relationship, but how are the structure and the dynamics and the 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.290
 functioning of the families of children who go to psychiatry 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.129
 g 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.229
 in principle in principle percent is also known 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:05.740
 what diseases of child psychiatry 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.119
 which major problems give 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:09.199
 percent to 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.050
 the exchange family family functioning system 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.580
 are the most diagnosed 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.849
 which are those derived from behavioral disorders after 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:17.419
 know 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.860
 she associates posada difficulty of behavior management 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.259
 both at school and a family 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.080
 soon of course yes there is an obvious relationship 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.570
 why this situation occurs 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.040
 there it is and authors that affirm what to the increase in demand 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.219
 colom in your best guess of the offer comment the demand 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.559
 but on the other hand you are also seeing that society lived 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:39.889
 the family 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.220
 6th download 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.110
 every time there is more no more number of marriages that separate 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.280
 therefore to it help child number 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.809
 in the rest the last percent 

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:54.579
 The latest report from the family policy committee announces that there are 15 million 

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:55.139
 children 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.259
 in any case 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.169
 affected by separations or divorces 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.899
 but that means that a child 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:03.449
 that are born in an environment in a family 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.599
 unstructured a family in which the mother or father 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.110
 they do not coexist 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.129
 does not have 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.610
 to put it in some fair way better said 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.169
 nor does it have a higher probability 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.480
 to suffer some percent situations in discussions does not mean that 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.430
 the fault suffers but it has more power than others 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.710
 to see the power the sword 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.219
 between them 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:28.819
 the stars and behavior 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.870
 which are the most diagnosed units of child-juvenile psychiatry 

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.020
 and they are the biggest problems 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.759
 conjugal and family
