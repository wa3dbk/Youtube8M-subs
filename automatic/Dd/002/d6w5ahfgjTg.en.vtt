00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
we've already taken the the socket in

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.990 
we've already taken the the socket in
and<00:01:19.110> loosen<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.710> fittings<00:01:20.160> but<00:01:20.760> you<00:01:20.910> would

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and loosen these fittings but you would

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.930 
and loosen these fittings but you would
just<00:01:21.120> take<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.450> socket<00:01:22.670> loosen<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
just take your socket loosen the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:35.150 
just take your socket loosen the
fittings<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> fitting<00:01:31.350> comes<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:34.160> take

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
fittings so the fitting comes out take

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.690 
fittings so the fitting comes out take
your<00:01:35.310> fitting<00:01:35.580> out<00:01:37.010> this<00:01:38.010> is<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> gas<00:01:38.430> side

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your fitting out this is the gas side

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.020 
your fitting out this is the gas side
dip<00:01:38.940> tube<00:01:39.210> take<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.380> tube<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:43.880> replace<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
dip tube take your tube out replace it

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.700 
dip tube take your tube out replace it
with<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.180> new<00:01:45.360> o-ring<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:48.500> tube<00:01:49.500> goes<00:01:49.680> back<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.410 

then<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.800> take<00:01:55.010> your<00:01:55.040> gas<00:01:55.340> side<00:01:55.670> fitting<00:01:56.210> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
then you take your gas side fitting and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.080 
then you take your gas side fitting and
this<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.840> important<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.040> pin<00:01:58.580> lock<00:01:58.760> keg

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
this is important on the pin lock keg

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.720 
this is important on the pin lock keg
the<00:01:59.840> gas<00:02:00.140> is<00:02:00.380> always<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.860> two<00:02:01.040> pin<00:02:01.280> connector

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
the gas is always the two pin connector

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.070 
the gas is always the two pin connector
on<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.420> lid<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:04.420> on<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.510> liquid<00:02:05.780> side<00:02:05.810> of

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
on the lid on the on the liquid side of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.140 
on the lid on the on the liquid side of
the<00:02:06.170> 3-pin<00:02:06.500> connector<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.220> have<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.030> have

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
the 3-pin connector and you have to have

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.820 
the 3-pin connector and you have to have
pins<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:08.990> there's<00:02:09.140> there's<00:02:09.680> no<00:02:09.800> way

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
pins on there so there's there's no way

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.730 
pins on there so there's there's no way
you<00:02:10.010> can<00:02:10.160> get<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.430> screwed<00:02:10.760> up<00:02:10.940> with<00:02:11.480> the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
you can get that screwed up with the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.470 
you can get that screwed up with the
with<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.830> ball<00:02:13.010> lock<00:02:13.220> though<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:14.150> fittings

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
with the ball lock though the fittings

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.480 
with the ball lock though the fittings
look<00:02:14.630> very<00:02:14.900> very<00:02:14.990> similar<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.310> only

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
look very very similar and the only

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.190 
look very very similar and the only
difference<00:02:16.760> really<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.570> you<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.810> tell<00:02:17.990> is

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
difference really that you can tell is

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.070 
difference really that you can tell is
there's<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.500> score<00:02:18.830> mark<00:02:19.070> on<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.340> base<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
there's a score mark on the base of the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.880 
there's a score mark on the base of the
gas<00:02:21.620> fitting<00:02:22.100> make<00:02:22.970> sure<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:24.050> that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
gas fitting make sure that that that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.550 
gas fitting make sure that that that
