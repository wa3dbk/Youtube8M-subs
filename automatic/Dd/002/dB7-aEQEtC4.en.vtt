00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.480
 instead of using chicken we are going to use 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.279
 cauliflower and so you would like to know how 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.250
 I made this recipe for please followed 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.710
 seeing 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.470
 you're going to need flour I'm using 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.619
 of water rice two heads of cauliflower 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.040
 salt pepper paprika and garlic powder and 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.290
 obviously your favorite buffalo sauce 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.210
 first to preheat your oven to 450 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.879
 fahrenheit and then in a container 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.220
 you are going to place a cup of water after 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.710
 a cup of flour a quarter of a spoon 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.840
 of paprika a quarter of a tablespoon of garlic 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.610
 in powder also a quarter of a tablespoon 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.680
 of pepper a quarter of a tablespoon of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.399
 salt and finally ensures to incorporate 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.780
 all the ingredients very, very good 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.270
 after you have washed your cauliflower 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.829
 very well you are going to cut them into smaller pieces 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.510
 or less as big as I am 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.790
 showing in the video for this recipe 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.100
 I need a cauliflower and a half because 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.720
 these colors were pretty big like that 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.850
 that if yours are also great 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.700
 then you will need less than two 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.760
 but if they are girls you are going to need more 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.280
 of a 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 then you will damage your cauliflower in the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.480
 flour that we had made and you're going to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040
 put a baking dish after 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.990
 that you have senado your tray you are going to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.390
 place it in the oven and you'll wait for 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.040
 20 to 30 minutes you will know when 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.010
 they are made because they are made a little 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.230
 golden brown once the 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.690
 time they will take out your cauliflower and you will 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.390
 start bathing each cauliflower in the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.760
 buffalo sauce more or less I use as 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.800
 a cup and every time you bathe each 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.020
 cauliflower you're going to put it back in the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.540
 container because we're going to go back to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.590
 put in the oven but this time nothing more 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.590
 for 5 minutes 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.870
 you can accompany them with your dressing 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.120

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.690
