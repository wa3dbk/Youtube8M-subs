00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.190 
also for some of the robber sites here
but<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.970> really<00:01:49.390> provides<00:01:49.750> that<00:01:49.870> kind<00:01:50.140> of

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
but it really provides that kind of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.290 
but it really provides that kind of
premium<00:01:50.440> feel<00:01:50.800> that<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:51.280> would<00:01:51.640> get<00:01:51.820> with<00:01:52.060> the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
premium feel that you would get with the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.320 
premium feel that you would get with the
devices<00:01:53.050> like<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.530> nexus<00:01:53.560> for<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.520> iPhone<00:01:55.090> 4

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
devices like the nexus for the iPhone 4

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.300 
devices like the nexus for the iPhone 4
and<00:01:55.360> iPhone<00:01:55.540> 4s<00:01:55.840> which<00:01:56.620> also<00:01:56.830> has<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.010> glass

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
and iPhone 4s which also has a glass

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.219 
and iPhone 4s which also has a glass
back<00:01:57.580> on<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.390> back<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:58.780> also<00:01:58.900> a<00:01:59.020> good<00:01:59.170> thing

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
back on the back and also a good thing

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.170 
back on the back and also a good thing
with<00:01:59.620> this<00:01:59.770> glass<00:02:00.010> back<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.640> when<00:02:01.090> you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
with this glass back is that when you

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.540 
with this glass back is that when you
put<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.479> down<00:02:01.510> on<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:01.960> table<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.740> doesn't<00:02:03.460> move

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
put it down on the table it doesn't move

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.030 
put it down on the table it doesn't move
around<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:04.150> much<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.619> think<00:02:05.740> that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
around that much because I think that

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.090 
around that much because I think that
these<00:02:06.220> kind<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.240> like<00:02:07.390> rubber<00:02:07.690> sides<00:02:08.110> protect

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
these kind of like rubber sides protect

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.760 
these kind of like rubber sides protect
the<00:02:09.250> phone<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.910> about<00:02:10.600> both<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.290> back<00:02:11.470> and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
the phone and about both on the back and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.199 
the phone and about both on the back and
on<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.950> front<00:02:12.160> side<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.730> put<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.030> down

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
on the front side when you put it down

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.449 
on the front side when you put it down
on<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.450> table<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.830> think<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.130> it

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
on the table and this I think that it

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.570 
on the table and this I think that it
provides<00:02:15.730> little<00:02:16.270> bit<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:17.070> security<00:02:18.070> over

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
provides little bit of a security over

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.729 
provides little bit of a security over
there<00:02:18.760> now<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.360> second<00:02:19.690> thing<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.930> do<00:02:20.110> enjoy<00:02:20.380> a

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
there now the second thing I do enjoy a

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.740 
there now the second thing I do enjoy a
ton<00:02:20.980> about<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.400> phone<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.910> sure<00:02:22.420> comes

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
ton about this phone is that sure comes

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.170 
ton about this phone is that sure comes
with<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.989> 13<00:02:23.260> megapixel<00:02:23.350> camera<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.700> year

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
with a 13 megapixel camera and this year

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.360 
with a 13 megapixel camera and this year
the<00:02:25.720> camera<00:02:26.050> doesn't<00:02:26.230> have<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.620> same<00:02:26.830> process

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
the camera doesn't have the same process

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.449 
the camera doesn't have the same process
like<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.730> Xperia<00:02:28.090> S<00:02:28.270> from<00:02:28.780> last<00:02:28.989> year<00:02:29.170> had

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
like the Xperia S from last year had

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.070 
like the Xperia S from last year had
which<00:02:30.459> was<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.030> was<00:02:31.150> laggy<00:02:31.420> when<00:02:31.930> you

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
which was that it was laggy when you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.760 
which was that it was laggy when you
record<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.680> 1080p<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.110> no<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.500> time

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
record it in 1080p and no but this time

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.800

compared<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:38.920> other<00:03:39.069> high-end<00:03:39.520> devices<00:03:39.760> is

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
compared to other high-end devices is

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.630 
compared to other high-end devices is
that<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.870> one<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.470> few<00:03:42.310> high-end

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
that this is one of the few high-end

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.339 
that this is one of the few high-end
devices<00:03:43.030> actually<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.599> also<00:03:43.900> market<00:03:44.230> right

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
devices actually this also market right

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.360 
devices actually this also market right
now<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:45.120> waterproof<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:47.220> when<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.280> have

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370

now that is waterproof so when you have
closed<00:03:48.700> all<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.000> things<00:03:49.480> here<00:03:49.750> on<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.050> side

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
closed all the things here on the side

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.449 
closed all the things here on the side
and<00:03:51.180> over<00:03:52.180> here<00:03:52.450> also<00:03:52.690> you<00:03:53.260> can<00:03:53.530> actually<00:03:54.220> pour

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
and over here also you can actually pour

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.370 
and over here also you can actually pour
water<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:55.120> this<00:03:55.390> device<00:03:55.690> which<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.170> pretty

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
water on this device which is pretty

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.380 
water on this device which is pretty
cool<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.860> also<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.489> it's<00:03:57.610> dust<00:03:57.849> proof<00:03:58.120> and

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
cool and also that it's dust proof and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.449 
cool and also that it's dust proof and
so<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.050> made<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.260> lot<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.410> cool<00:03:59.709> tests<00:04:00.130> I've<00:04:00.220> been

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
so I made a lot of cool tests I've been

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.339 
putting my expertise in beer and stuff
and<00:04:02.950> they<00:04:03.400> did<00:04:03.700> actually<00:04:03.940> survive<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:04.870> that's

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
and they did actually survive so that's

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.350 
and they did actually survive so that's
extremely<00:04:05.890> cool<00:04:06.160> feature<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.670> something
