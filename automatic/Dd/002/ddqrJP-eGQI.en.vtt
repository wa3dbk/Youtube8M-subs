and<00:00:57.319> how<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.620> do<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:57.979> and<00:00:58.389> you<00:00:59.389> need<00:00:59.600> to

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
and how to do that and you need to

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.529 
and how to do that and you need to
figure<00:00:59.870> out<00:00:59.989> your<00:01:00.289> numbers<00:01:00.739> because<00:01:01.159> I<00:01:01.609> would

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
figure out your numbers because I would

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:03.969 
figure out your numbers because I would
feel<00:01:02.569> really<00:01:02.749> bad<00:01:03.109> if<00:01:03.350> somebody<00:01:03.620> messed<00:01:03.829> up

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
feel really bad if somebody messed up

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.350 
feel really bad if somebody messed up
their<00:01:04.129> body<00:01:04.309> because<00:01:04.640> they<00:01:04.790> were<00:01:04.850> watching<00:01:05.299> a

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
their body because they were watching a

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.330 
their body because they were watching a
video<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:06.200> at<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.409> same<00:01:06.560> time<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:06.830> want<00:01:07.190> to<00:01:07.220> be

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
video but at the same time I want to be

comment below um my macros are pretty

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.990 
comment below um my macros are pretty
high<00:01:43.400> right<00:01:43.640> now

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
high right now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.400 
high right now
I<00:01:44.030> mean<00:01:44.360> I'm<00:01:44.450> 13<00:01:44.750> weeks<00:01:44.930> out<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:45.320> they

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
I mean I'm 13 weeks out so they

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.030 
I mean I'm 13 weeks out so they
shouldn't<00:01:45.650> be<00:01:45.740> too<00:01:45.890> low<00:01:46.070> my<00:01:46.820> cardio<00:01:47.510> is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
shouldn't be too low my cardio is

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.660 
shouldn't be too low my cardio is
significantly<00:01:49.040> higher<00:01:49.220> than<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.520> was<00:01:49.610> before

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
significantly higher than it was before

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.300 
significantly higher than it was before
but<00:01:50.660> that's<00:01:50.870> only<00:01:51.080> because<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.770> wasn't<00:01:52.100> doing

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
but that's only because I wasn't doing

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.480 
but that's only because I wasn't doing
any<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.480> is<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.630> pretty<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:55.190> amount<00:01:55.400> of

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
any so this is a pretty the amount of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.170 
any so this is a pretty the amount of
cardio<00:01:55.730> that<00:01:55.820> I'm<00:01:55.970> doing<00:01:56.150> is<00:01:56.510> pretty<00:01:56.930> standard

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
cardio that I'm doing is pretty standard

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.880 
cardio that I'm doing is pretty standard
my<00:01:59.180> thoughts<00:01:59.720> on<00:02:00.230> what<00:02:01.130> might<00:02:01.370> happen<00:02:02.000> and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
my thoughts on what might happen and

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.830 
my thoughts on what might happen and
again<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:04.190> don't<00:02:04.370> want<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.730> put<00:02:04.880> like<00:02:05.060> anybody

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
again I don't want to put like anybody

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.390 
again I don't want to put like anybody
to<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.380> what<00:02:06.560> marks<00:02:06.830> doing<00:02:07.190> and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
to think this is what marks doing and

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.070 
to think this is what marks doing and
what<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.520> think<00:02:07.640> he's<00:02:07.940> gonna<00:02:08.060> do<00:02:08.239> and<00:02:08.390> what<00:02:08.539> most

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
what I think he's gonna do and what most

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.440 
what I think he's gonna do and what most
people<00:02:09.229> do<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.860> they<00:02:09.920> slowly<00:02:10.759> increase<00:02:11.269> their

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
people do is they slowly increase their

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.360 
people do is they slowly increase their
cardio<00:02:11.840> up<00:02:12.170> until<00:02:12.590> their<00:02:12.739> show<00:02:12.950> day<00:02:13.129> they

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
cardio up until their show day they

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.030 
cardio up until their show day they
slowly<00:02:13.610> decrease<00:02:14.090> their<00:02:14.590> calories<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.740> until

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
slowly decrease their calories up until

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.789 
slowly decrease their calories up until
their<00:02:16.160> show<00:02:16.340> day<00:02:16.520> mostly<00:02:17.030> by<00:02:17.150> carbs<00:02:17.569> sometime

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
their show day mostly by carbs sometime

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.679 
their show day mostly by carbs sometime
they<00:02:19.799> manipulate<00:02:19.980> protein<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.939> fats<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
they manipulate protein and fats as I

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.050 
they manipulate protein and fats as I
mean<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.290> depends<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.709> your<00:02:22.890> take<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.340> some

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
mean just depends on your take and some

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
mean just depends on your take and some
people<00:02:24.329> increase<00:02:25.140> protein<00:02:25.530> or<00:02:25.799> decrease<00:02:26.189> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
people increase protein or decrease it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.009 
people increase protein or decrease it
and<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.610> increase<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.150> carbs<00:02:27.569> right<00:02:27.629> before

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
and then increase the carbs right before

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.199 
and then increase the carbs right before
the<00:02:28.200> show<00:02:28.379> I<00:02:28.709> mean<00:02:28.860> there's<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.819> different
