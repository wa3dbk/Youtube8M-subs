00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
but it's 16 by 9 so actually the width

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.790 
but it's 16 by 9 so actually the width
of<00:00:24.099> the<00:00:24.520> tablet<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.509> not<00:00:25.630> too<00:00:25.810> bad<00:00:26.020> and<00:00:26.349> there

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
of the tablet is not too bad and there

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.100 
of the tablet is not too bad and there
is<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:26.980> good<00:00:27.220> possibility<00:00:27.279> for<00:00:28.060> thumb<00:00:28.720> typing

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
is a good possibility for thumb typing

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.229 
is a good possibility for thumb typing
down<00:00:29.680> here<00:00:29.950> without<00:00:30.189> having<00:00:30.700> to<00:00:30.820> use<00:00:30.970> the

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
down here without having to use the

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.840 
down here without having to use the
split<00:00:31.989> keyboard<00:00:32.230> which<00:00:32.559> I<00:00:32.710> also<00:00:32.860> find<00:00:33.250> which<00:00:33.760> I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
split keyboard which I also find which I

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.460 
split keyboard which I also find which I
actually<00:00:33.940> find<00:00:34.300> quite<00:00:34.540> stressful<00:00:34.989> in<00:00:35.230> terms

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
actually find quite stressful in terms

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.740 
actually find quite stressful in terms
of<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:35.800> movement<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:36.910> when<00:00:37.179> you<00:00:37.269> can<00:00:37.390> get<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.719> a

of I movement so when you can get to a

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.509 
of I movement so when you can get to a
standard<00:00:38.170> keyboard<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:39.010> get<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.370> point

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519

so<00:06:18.560> far<00:06:18.800> me<00:06:18.980> impressed<00:06:19.250> with<00:06:19.400> the<00:06:19.520> weight<00:06:19.700> five

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910

12.5 inch screen in fact i'm pretty sure

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:34.740 
12.5 inch screen in fact i'm pretty sure
you<00:07:33.039> wouldn't<00:07:33.430> it<00:07:33.759> be<00:07:33.909> heavier<00:07:34.210> much<00:07:34.449> wider

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:34.750 
you wouldn't it be heavier much wider

you wouldn't it be heavier much wider
but<00:07:35.620> tension<00:07:36.130> hunter<00:07:36.400> it<00:07:36.759> works<00:07:37.030> pretty<00:07:37.270> well

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
but tension hunter it works pretty well

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.589 
but tension hunter it works pretty well
it's<00:07:38.560> not<00:07:38.830> perfect<00:07:39.789> actually<00:07:40.210> i<00:07:40.270> would<00:07:40.360> say

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 
it's not perfect actually i would say

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.990 
it's not perfect actually i would say
the<00:07:40.720> perfect<00:07:40.930> size<00:07:41.380> would<00:07:41.680> be<00:07:41.710> an<00:07:42.009> 8.9<00:07:42.550> inch

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610 
16-9 screen it would be lighter you get

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.089 
16-9 screen it would be lighter you get
more<00:07:45.849> of<00:07:45.909> a<00:07:46.060> crossover<00:07:46.449> with<00:07:46.719> your<00:07:46.870> thumbs<00:07:47.110> and

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
more of a crossover with your thumbs and

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:51.360 
more of a crossover with your thumbs and
it<00:07:48.909> would<00:07:49.000> be<00:07:49.139> good<00:07:50.139> hit<00:07:50.349> areas<00:07:50.770> for<00:07:51.190> your

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:51.370 
it would be good hit areas for your

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.209 
it would be good hit areas for your
thumbs<00:07:51.789> as<00:07:51.969> well<00:07:52.150> 7-inch<00:07:53.139> could<00:07:53.620> be<00:07:53.800> actually

00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:54.219 
thumbs as well 7-inch could be actually

00:07:54.219 --> 00:07:56.070 
thumbs as well 7-inch could be actually
a<00:07:54.460> 7-inch<00:07:55.120> is<00:07:55.210> great<00:07:55.479> I've<00:07:55.659> used<00:07:55.780> it<00:07:55.930> for<00:07:56.050> a

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 
a 7-inch is great I've used it for a

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.680 
a 7-inch is great I've used it for a
couple<00:07:56.169> years<00:07:56.349> but<00:07:57.070> I<00:07:57.580> think<00:07:57.849> 8.9<00:07:58.300> inch<00:07:58.479> could

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:58.690 
couple years but I think 8.9 inch could

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.120 
couple years but I think 8.9 inch could
be<00:07:58.810> optimal<00:07:59.259> I<00:07:59.320> think<00:07:59.620> that's<00:07:59.740> possible<00:07:59.919> with

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.130 
be optimal I think that's possible with
