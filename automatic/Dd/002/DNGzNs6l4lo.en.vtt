 half that were pierced in the chest 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.300
 by iron bar which has fanned 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.680
 the beliefs that vampires 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.680
 exist or existed 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.239
 these two skeletons are the last of 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.190
 a series of findings in europe 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.649
 western and central Bozhidar Dimitrov 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.199
 head of the national museum of bulgaria said 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.089
 that these two skeletons were 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.180
 stabbed with iron bars in his 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.210
 chest since in some Bulgarian villages 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.460
 it was common until the first decade of 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.399
 20th century 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.879
 last year also found a 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.949
 vampire skeleton as they have been called 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.100
 which was known as a vampire of 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.130
 those op 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.590
 the origin of the word vampire comes 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.610
 of the Slavic term subsequently 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 written as live 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.410
 according to pagan beliefs the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 people who considered themselves bad 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.020
 during their life they could become 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.600
 vampires after death unless 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 that these were stabbed in the chest 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.180
 with a stake of iron or wood 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.070
 according to Dimitrov believes that around 100 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.650
 people in Bulgaria were buried and 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.460
 stabbed in the chest to prevent 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.860
 they became vampires 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.020
 he also said he does not know how a 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.440
 so ordinary discovery 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.450
 for that time he became so popular and 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.600
 believes that it is due to the myth of the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.600
 vampires 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.540
 in the myths the nail it highlights in the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.330
 heart to a vampire is the most 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.040
 popular to exterminate them since the 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.620
 stick a stake into the cavity of the 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.020
 chest ensured the deflation of a 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.970
 bloated corpse what would prevent his 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.510
 transformation

 [Music] 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.770
 officially there is no evidence that 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.800
 the vampires existed or exist and for 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.110
 now we can only rely on this type 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 of findings linked to beliefs 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.170
 popular we wonder if ever 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.510
 there were vampires will be like those of 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.670
 the movies but so far 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.860
 it's still a mystery based on 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:48.219
 urban legends
