00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
there inevitably there'll be cars out

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.679 
there inevitably there'll be cars out
there<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.210> nearing<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
there and it was you know nearing the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.840 
there and it was you know nearing the
rush<00:01:21.869> hour<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> chasers<00:01:23.670> out

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
rush hour and there a lot of chasers out

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
rush hour and there a lot of chasers out
there<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> can't<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.470> congested

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
there as well and it can't get congested

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.640 
there as well and it can't get congested
I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.720> situation<00:01:27.930> where

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
I think this was just a situation where

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
I think this was just a situation where
there<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> lot<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> erratic<00:01:29.520> movement<00:01:30.060> with

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
there was a lot of erratic movement with

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.789 
there was a lot of erratic movement with
this<00:01:30.299> tornado<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> lot<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.439> people<00:01:31.710> got

movement<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.920> south<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.610> back

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
movement you know south and then back

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.999 
movement you know south and then back
north<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.840> changing<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.350> speed<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
north and then the changing of speed and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.550 
north and then the changing of speed and
direction<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.560> unfortunately

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
direction I think just unfortunately

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
direction I think just unfortunately
caught<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> people<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> cars<00:01:41.640> how

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
caught a lot of people in the cars how

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.499 
caught a lot of people in the cars how
fast<00:01:43.049> from<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.829> vantage<00:01:44.070> point<00:01:44.549> how<00:01:44.820> fast<00:01:45.210> on

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
fast from your vantage point how fast on

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.020 
fast from your vantage point how fast on
the<00:01:45.810> ground<00:01:46.259> did<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> tornado<00:01:47.399> appear<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.909> be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the ground did the tornado appear to be

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.690 
the ground did the tornado appear to be
moving<00:01:50.149> what<00:01:51.149> was<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.540> pretty<00:01:51.750> slow

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
moving what was going pretty slow

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.800 
moving what was going pretty slow
initially<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.329> why<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.659> thought

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
initially and so that's why we thought

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.389 
initially and so that's why we thought
what<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.140> were<00:01:55.229> trying<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.340> were

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
what we were trying to do when we were

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
what we were trying to do when we were
on<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> north<00:01:56.670> side<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> storm<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.479> dive

being on the south side of the storm is

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.530 
being on the south side of the storm is
generally<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> safest<00:02:05.790> place<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.270> usually

the<00:02:06.840> tornado<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.200> moving<00:02:07.439> away<00:02:07.530> from<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the tornado is moving away from you and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.999 
the tornado is moving away from you and
you<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.179> any<00:02:09.330> danger<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.830> being<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.979> a

you don't have any danger of being in a

you don't have any danger of being in a
in<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.670> hail<00:02:11.940> storm<00:02:12.180> either<00:02:12.480> but

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
in a hail storm either but

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.960 
in a hail storm either but
moving<00:02:13.570> slowly<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.500> mean<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.370> don't<00:02:15.700> know

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
moving slowly I mean I don't know

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.120 
moving slowly I mean I don't know
exactly<00:02:16.450> maybe<00:02:16.930> 10<00:02:17.230> miles<00:02:17.410> an<00:02:17.680> hour<00:02:17.800> maybe

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
exactly maybe 10 miles an hour maybe

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.250 
exactly maybe 10 miles an hour maybe
maybe<00:02:18.730> 15<00:02:19.120> miles<00:02:19.300> an<00:02:19.480> hour<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:19.870> we<00:02:19.960> thought<00:02:20.140> we

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
maybe 15 miles an hour so we thought we

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.540 
maybe 15 miles an hour so we thought we
had<00:02:20.380> enough<00:02:20.560> time<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.770> get<00:02:21.040> ahead<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.430> and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
had enough time to get ahead of it and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.860 
had enough time to get ahead of it and
get<00:02:21.670> south<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.150> end<00:02:22.270> up<00:02:22.360> getting<00:02:22.630> caught

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
get south of it end up getting caught

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.540 
get south of it end up getting caught
right<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.890> front<00:02:24.100> end<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.370> but<00:02:24.460> it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
right on the front end of it but it

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.190 
right on the front end of it but it
wasn't<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:24.970> quick<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.330> movement<00:02:25.960> do<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
wasn't that quick of movement do you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.230 
wasn't that quick of movement do you
know<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.380> wasn't<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> fast<00:02:26.860> mover<00:02:27.160> at<00:02:27.250> all<00:02:27.370> Mike

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
know it wasn't a fast mover at all Mike

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.670 
know it wasn't a fast mover at all Mike
I<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.630> ask<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:29.110> kind<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.470> tough

I have to ask you kind of a tough

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800 
I have to ask you kind of a tough
question<00:02:29.710> from<00:02:30.430> some<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.760> my<00:02:30.910> experience<00:02:31.660> out

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
question from some of my experience out

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.480 
question from some of my experience out
chasing<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.410> also<00:02:32.650> some<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:32.980> our<00:02:33.070> viewers

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
chasing and also some of our viewers

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.370 
chasing and also some of our viewers
want<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.850> know<00:02:33.910> when<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.600> was<00:02:34.780> looking<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.290> the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
want to know when I was looking at the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.710 
want to know when I was looking at the
video<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.280> see<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.670> tornado<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.390> then

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
video you can see the tornado and then

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.480 
video you can see the tornado and then
you<00:02:37.840> could<00:02:37.990> see<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.320> other<00:02:38.500> tornadoes<00:02:39.130> around

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
you could see the other tornadoes around

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.860 
you could see the other tornadoes around
it<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.700> course<00:02:39.880> as<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.210> know<00:02:40.240> we<00:02:40.480> call<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:40.810> a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
it of course as you know we call that a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.710 
it of course as you know we call that a
multiple<00:02:41.380> vortex<00:02:41.890> tornado<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.570> ask

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
multiple vortex tornado so I have to ask

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.820 
multiple vortex tornado so I have to ask
you<00:02:44.020> do<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.560> think<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.950> got<00:02:45.130> too<00:02:45.400> close<00:02:45.760> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
you do you think you got too close and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.530 
you do you think you got too close and
what<00:02:47.830> were<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.160> thinking<00:02:48.700> should<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.390> have

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
what were you thinking should you have

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.940 
what were you thinking should you have
turned<00:02:49.810> back<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.290> gone<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.680> other<00:02:50.830> direction

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
turned back and gone the other direction

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.860 
turned back and gone the other direction
mm-hmm<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:53.430> think<00:02:54.430> now<00:02:54.880> looking<00:02:55.360> at<00:02:55.660> what

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
mm-hmm I think now looking at what

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.450 
mm-hmm I think now looking at what
happened<00:02:56.320> with<00:02:56.410> that<00:02:56.440> tornado<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.130> smartest

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
happened with that tornado the smartest

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.460 
happened with that tornado the smartest
thing<00:02:57.640> for<00:02:57.850> us<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:57.970> what<00:02:58.630> would<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:58.960> been<00:02:59.140> to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
thing for us to what would have been to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.590 
thing for us to what would have been to
go<00:02:59.830> back<00:03:00.040> north<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.580> for<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.090> just<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.570> know

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
go back north and for and just you know

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.100 
go back north and for and just you know
end<00:03:01.870> up<00:03:02.020> being<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.620> hail<00:03:02.920> or<00:03:03.250> whatever<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:04.600> think

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
end up being in hail or whatever I think

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.900 
end up being in hail or whatever I think
in<00:03:05.410> our<00:03:05.500> particular<00:03:05.770> situation<00:03:06.130> we<00:03:06.520> travel

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
in our particular situation we travel

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.430 
in our particular situation we travel
with<00:03:07.030> three<00:03:07.270> three<00:03:07.660> vehicles<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.320> was

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
with three three vehicles and it was

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.200 
with three three vehicles and it was
amazing<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.010> me<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.190> our<00:03:09.370> lead<00:03:09.610> vehicle<00:03:09.820> and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
amazing to me that our lead vehicle and

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.870 
amazing to me that our lead vehicle and
our<00:03:10.270> vehicle<00:03:10.540> behind<00:03:10.840> us<00:03:11.040> didn't<00:03:12.040> even<00:03:12.190> move

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
our vehicle behind us didn't even move

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.400 
our vehicle behind us didn't even move
they<00:03:13.120> were<00:03:13.180> both<00:03:13.390> up<00:03:13.600> right<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:14.080> our<00:03:14.140> middle

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
they were both up right in our middle

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.230 
they were both up right in our middle
vehicle<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.010> travel<00:03:15.490> in<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.730> think<00:03:15.790> was<00:03:16.060> hit

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
vehicle that I travel in I think was hit

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.640 
vehicle that I travel in I think was hit
by<00:03:16.390> what<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.870> were<00:03:16.900> talking<00:03:17.320> about<00:03:17.350> they're

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
by what you were talking about they're

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
by what you were talking about they're
probably<00:03:17.980> one<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.130> those<00:03:18.280> suction<00:03:18.700> vortices

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
probably one of those suction vortices

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.870 
probably one of those suction vortices
and<00:03:20.230> ended<00:03:20.770> up<00:03:20.800> tossing<00:03:21.280> us<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:21.550> our<00:03:21.670> cars

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and ended up tossing us but our cars

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.430 
and ended up tossing us but our cars
really<00:03:22.150> only<00:03:22.300> travel<00:03:22.720> five<00:03:22.870> or<00:03:23.020> six<00:03:23.200> car

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
really only travel five or six car

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.530 
really only travel five or six car
lengths<00:03:23.770> apart<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:24.850> think<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.210> was<00:03:25.270> in

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
lengths apart and so I think it was in

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.970 
lengths apart and so I think it was in
that<00:03:25.870> instance<00:03:26.380> it's<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.560> little<00:03:26.740> bit<00:03:26.830> of<00:03:26.920> a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
that instance it's a little bit of a

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.010 
that instance it's a little bit of a
freak<00:03:27.220> occurrence<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.270> we<00:03:28.420> got<00:03:28.540> hit<00:03:28.690> by<00:03:28.810> one

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
freak occurrence that we got hit by one

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.140 
freak occurrence that we got hit by one
of<00:03:29.050> those<00:03:29.140> but<00:03:29.500> yes<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.370> mean<00:03:30.490> I<00:03:30.550> certainly<00:03:30.880> will

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
of those but yes I mean I certainly will

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.630 
of those but yes I mean I certainly will
admit<00:03:31.360> that<00:03:31.390> we<00:03:31.570> were<00:03:31.600> we<00:03:31.810> were<00:03:31.900> pretty<00:03:32.110> close

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
admit that we were we were pretty close

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.830 
admit that we were we were pretty close
but<00:03:33.640> in<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.850> situation<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.450> weren't<00:03:34.630> trying

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
but in that situation we weren't trying

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.180 
but in that situation we weren't trying
to<00:03:34.960> be<00:03:35.110> close<00:03:35.320> we're<00:03:35.530> trying<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.860> actually<00:03:35.980> get

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
to be close we're trying to actually get

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.830 
to be close we're trying to actually get
away<00:03:36.310> from<00:03:36.490> it<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.910> ended<00:03:37.360> up<00:03:37.420> getting<00:03:37.540> caught

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
away from it and ended up getting caught

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.260 
away from it and ended up getting caught
in<00:03:37.990> it<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:39.100> Mike<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.550> know<00:03:39.730> I'm<00:03:39.790> getting<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.090> wrap
