um yeah obviously I'm a big guy I still
a<00:00:09.480> long<00:00:09.750> way<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.960> go<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.170> fill<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.590> frame<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.190> i

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
a long way to go to fill my frame and i

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.339 
a long way to go to fill my frame and i
think<00:00:12.240> that's<00:00:12.420> that's<00:00:12.660> when<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.929> reasons<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
think that's that's when I reasons a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
think that's that's when I reasons a
very<00:00:13.559> excited<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.009> Minnesota's<00:00:14.490> their<00:00:14.759> their

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
very excited for Minnesota's their their

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.540 
very excited for Minnesota's their their
strengths<00:00:15.599> program<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:17.340> way<00:00:17.460> they

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
strengths program and the way they

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.700 
strengths program and the way they
develop<00:00:17.940> layers<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.410> think<00:00:21.710> my

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
develop layers like that and I think my

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.890 
develop layers like that and I think my
time<00:00:22.920> there<00:00:23.130> depends<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.699> how<00:00:24.330> hard<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.689> work

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
time there depends on how hard I work

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.900 
time there depends on how hard I work
and<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> put<00:00:26.430> into<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.439> physical
