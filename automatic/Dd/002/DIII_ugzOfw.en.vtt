sharpen this portion the blade has to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.979 
sharpen this portion the blade has to
sit<00:01:38.569> on<00:01:38.840> your<00:01:39.170> stone<00:01:40.509> flat<00:01:42.520> perfectly<00:01:43.520> flat<00:01:43.989> in

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:44.989 
sit on your stone flat perfectly flat in

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:49.570 
sit on your stone flat perfectly flat in
order<00:01:45.319> for<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:45.649> bevel<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.280> remain<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:48.580> perfect

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
order for this bevel to remain a perfect

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.469 
order for this bevel to remain a perfect
scandi<00:01:50.170> if<00:01:51.170> this<00:01:51.410> surface<00:01:52.069> is<00:01:52.190> not<00:01:52.399> flat<00:01:52.479> then

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
scandi if this surface is not flat then

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.270 
scandi if this surface is not flat then
you<00:01:53.569> don't<00:01:53.750> have<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.899> variation<00:01:54.319> of<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.890> scandi

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
you don't have a variation of a scandi

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.089 
you don't have a variation of a scandi
either<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.149> scandi<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.690> X<00:01:56.869> or<00:01:59.860> eventually<00:02:00.860> it

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
either a scandi of X or eventually it

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.520 
either a scandi of X or eventually it
will<00:02:01.160> turn<00:02:01.399> into<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.700> convex<00:02:02.300> or<00:02:02.720> something

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
will turn into a convex or something

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.499 
will turn into a convex or something
it'll<00:02:04.039> be<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.160> variation<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.060> scandi<00:02:05.450> it

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
it'll be a variation of a scandi it

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.139 
it'll be a variation of a scandi it
won't<00:02:05.690> be<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> true<00:02:06.110> skin<00:02:06.489> scandi<00:02:07.489> anymore

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
won't be a true skin scandi anymore

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.650 
won't be a true skin scandi anymore
so<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.929> have<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.950> perfect<00:02:10.369> stone

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so you have to have a perfect stone

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:23.729 
so you have to have a perfect stone
to<00:02:13.660> make<00:02:13.840> sure<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:16.120> you're<00:02:16.500> sharpening<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
to make sure that you're sharpening the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.360 
to make sure that you're sharpening the
skin<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:26.110> makes<00:02:26.290> sense

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.759 

so<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.540> stone<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.110> pick<00:02:32.319> up<00:02:32.470> at<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
so the stone that you pick up at the

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.610 
so the stone that you pick up at the
river<00:02:32.950> has<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.430> be<00:02:33.519> perfectly<00:02:33.940> flat<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.720> has

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
river has to be perfectly flat and has

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.559 
river has to be perfectly flat and has
to<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.830> flat<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.940> distance<00:02:37.330> long

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
to be flat in the in the distance long

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.880 
to be flat in the in the distance long
enough<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.860> touch<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:41.190> stroke<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.970> blade

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
enough to touch a stroke of the blade

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.520 
enough to touch a stroke of the blade
okay<00:02:45.060> now<00:02:46.060> people<00:02:46.390> say<00:02:46.569> this<00:02:46.810> Candy's<00:02:47.260> easier

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
okay now people say this Candy's easier

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.000 
okay now people say this Candy's easier
to<00:02:47.590> sharpen<00:02:47.890> because<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:49.000> has<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.239> place<00:02:50.010> it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
to sharpen because it has a place it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.530 
to sharpen because it has a place it
catches<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.640> blade<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:53.079> it's<00:02:53.650> kind<00:02:53.920> of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
catches the blade and so it's kind of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.979 
catches the blade and so it's kind of
dummy<00:02:55.540> perks<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.290> will<00:02:57.000> okay<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.690> again

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
dummy perks if you will okay but again

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.750 
dummy perks if you will okay but again
you<00:02:59.410> have<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.680> have<00:02:59.799> a<00:02:59.920> perfectly<00:03:00.459> flat

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
you have to have a perfectly flat

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.710 
you have to have a perfectly flat
surface<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.019> why<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> use<00:03:02.860> Diamond

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
surface and that is why I use Diamond

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.300 
surface and that is why I use Diamond
stones<00:03:04.720> most<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.379> time<00:03:05.560> because<00:03:05.799> that<00:03:05.980> is

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
stones most of the time because that is

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.539 
stones most of the time because that is
a<00:03:06.340> perfectly<00:03:06.849> flat<00:03:07.120> surface<00:03:08.129> okay<00:03:09.129> now<00:03:09.310> if<00:03:09.430> you

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
a perfectly flat surface okay now if you

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.250 
a perfectly flat surface okay now if you
use<00:03:09.579> water<00:03:10.150> stones<00:03:10.599> and<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:12.900> softer<00:03:13.900> stones

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
use water stones and and softer stones

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.120 
use water stones and and softer stones
that<00:03:14.890> over<00:03:15.370> time<00:03:15.640> they<00:03:16.329> will<00:03:16.540> then<00:03:17.200> wear<00:03:17.590> to

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
that over time they will then wear to

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.770 
that over time they will then wear to
your<00:03:18.519> rhythm<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:21.239> most<00:03:22.239> of<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.420> time<00:03:22.600> you

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
your rhythm and you most of the time you

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.349 
your rhythm and you most of the time you
will<00:03:22.900> not<00:03:23.049> get<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.560> perfect<00:03:24.329> Scandi<00:03:25.329> grind

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
will not get a perfect Scandi grind

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.039 
will not get a perfect Scandi grind
anymore<00:03:26.430> scandi<00:03:27.430> anymore<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.780> will<00:03:28.900> be<00:03:29.019> a

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
anymore scandi anymore it will be a

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.550 
anymore scandi anymore it will be a
variation<00:03:29.380> of<00:03:29.769> that<00:03:29.799> okay<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:34.560> saber

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
variation of that okay but with a saber

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.129 
variation of that okay but with a saber
or<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.010> full<00:03:36.459> flat<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.239> only<00:03:37.540> portion<00:03:37.840> that

or a full flat the only portion that

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.430 
or a full flat the only portion that
you're<00:03:38.319> sharpening<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:40.169> micro<00:03:41.169> bevel

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
you're sharpening is that micro bevel

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.150 
you're sharpening is that micro bevel
right<00:03:41.829> there<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:43.480> see<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.780> shiny<00:03:44.769> part

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
right there you see that shiny part

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.220 
right there you see that shiny part
right<00:03:45.400> there<00:03:45.840> that's<00:03:46.840> what<00:03:47.049> you're

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
right there that's what you're

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.890 
right there that's what you're
sharpening<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.889> you<00:03:48.639> can<00:03:48.819> take<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> round<00:03:49.540> rock

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
sharpening and you can take a round rock

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.420 
sharpening and you can take a round rock
and<00:03:50.319> sharpen<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:53.079> don't<00:03:53.319> have<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.590> to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
and sharpen that it you don't have to to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.159 
and sharpen that it you don't have to to
search<00:03:54.700> for<00:03:55.090> something<00:03:55.329> that's<00:03:55.480> perfectly

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
search for something that's perfectly

flat<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.910> can<00:03:58.060> take<00:03:58.269> any<00:03:58.510> rock<00:03:58.829> as<00:03:59.829> long<00:04:00.069> as<00:04:00.190> it

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
flat you can take any rock as long as it

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.809 
flat you can take any rock as long as it
has<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> smooth<00:04:00.910> surface<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:02.260> sharpen<00:04:02.889> a<00:04:03.099> saber

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
has a smooth surface and sharpen a saber

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.479 
has a smooth surface and sharpen a saber
or<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.769> full<00:04:05.769> flat<00:04:06.130> with<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.489> secondary<00:04:07.060> bevel

or a full flat with a secondary bevel

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.210 
or a full flat with a secondary bevel
okay<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:11.669> that's<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.900> story<00:04:14.200> with<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.530> full

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
okay so that's the story with a full

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.970 
okay so that's the story with a full
flat<00:04:15.489> or<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:16.299> saver<00:04:16.750> now<00:04:17.650> convex

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
flat or a a saver now convex

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.400 
flat or a a saver now convex
how<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.790> sharpen<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.360> convex<00:04:20.840> is<00:04:21.110> you<00:04:21.290> have

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
how you sharpen the convex is you have

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.700 
how you sharpen the convex is you have
to<00:04:21.560> have<00:04:21.770> a<00:04:21.800> soft<00:04:22.250> surface<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:23.350> lot<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.500> times

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
to have a soft surface a lot of times

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.240 
to have a soft surface a lot of times
people<00:04:24.980> will<00:04:25.280> take<00:04:25.840> sandpaper<00:04:27.160> into<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
people will take sandpaper into the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.760 
people will take sandpaper into the
field<00:04:28.520> with<00:04:28.700> them<00:04:28.880> or<00:04:29.540> a<00:04:29.600> strop<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.670> wrap<00:04:31.720> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
field with them or a strop and wrap the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.950 
field with them or a strop and wrap the
sandpaper<00:04:33.770> over<00:04:34.330> something<00:04:35.330> soft<00:04:35.600> like<00:04:35.810> a

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
sandpaper over something soft like a

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.310 
sandpaper over something soft like a
mouse<00:04:36.350> pad<00:04:36.710> or<00:04:37.040> something<00:04:37.280> like<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.610> that

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
mouse pad or something like that that

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.890 
mouse pad or something like that that
way<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.710> will<00:04:39.860> give<00:04:40.270> while<00:04:41.270> you're<00:04:41.510> you're

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
way it will give while you're you're

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:52.320 
way it will give while you're you're
strapping<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.990> that's<00:04:48.200> how<00:04:48.380> you<00:04:48.440> sharpen<00:04:48.890> a

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.600 

convex<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:54.650> just<00:04:54.800> drop<00:04:54.980> it<00:04:55.190> with<00:04:55.340> something

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
convex you just drop it with something

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:03.580 
convex you just drop it with something
soft<00:04:56.330> under<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:58.780> sandpaper<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.810> this

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
soft under the sandpaper so that this

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.060 
soft under the sandpaper so that this
edge<00:05:03.830> will<00:05:04.250> remain<00:05:04.640> as<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:05.390> convex<00:05:05.900> okay

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
edge will remain as a convex okay

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.710 
edge will remain as a convex okay
so<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:10.610> most<00:05:10.820> difficult<00:05:11.510> one<00:05:12.350> in<00:05:12.620> my<00:05:13.160> opinion

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
so the most difficult one in my opinion

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.460 
so the most difficult one in my opinion
to<00:05:14.720> reproduce<00:05:15.110> in<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.410> field<00:05:15.730> is<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:16.790> convex

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
to reproduce in the field is a convex

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.490 
to reproduce in the field is a convex
the<00:05:18.470> second<00:05:18.950> most<00:05:19.310> difficult<00:05:19.460> would<00:05:20.030> be<00:05:20.180> a

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
the second most difficult would be a

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.700 
the second most difficult would be a
scandi<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:22.520> easiest<00:05:23.210> in<00:05:23.480> my<00:05:23.720> opinion<00:05:24.170> is<00:05:24.320> a

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
scandi the easiest in my opinion is a

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.030 
scandi the easiest in my opinion is a
saber<00:05:25.250> or<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.670> full<00:05:26.210> flat<00:05:26.570> because<00:05:27.140> you're<00:05:27.890> only

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
saber or a full flat because you're only

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.380 
saber or a full flat because you're only
worried<00:05:28.670> about<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.180> very<00:05:30.340> my<00:05:31.340> portion<00:05:32.120> of<00:05:32.300> the

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
worried about a very my portion of the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.930 
worried about a very my portion of the
blade<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:32.990> has<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.800> touch<00:05:34.040> whatever<00:05:34.670> those

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
blade that has to touch whatever those

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.990 
blade that has to touch whatever those
you're<00:05:35.300> sharpening<00:05:35.660> with<00:05:36.700> hope<00:05:37.700> all<00:05:37.880> this

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
you're sharpening with hope all this

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.800 
you're sharpening with hope all this
makes<00:05:38.240> sense<00:05:38.510> okay<00:05:39.350> so<00:05:40.250> I<00:05:40.280> wanted<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:40.810> throw

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
makes sense okay so I wanted to throw

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.940 
makes sense okay so I wanted to throw
that<00:05:41.840> out<00:05:41.960> there<00:05:42.320> for<00:05:42.410> you<00:05:42.500> guys<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.800> think

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
that out there for you guys to think

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.860 
that out there for you guys to think
about<00:05:43.100> and<00:05:45.250> can<00:05:46.250> this<00:05:46.460> scan<00:05:47.240> d<00:05:47.270> be<00:05:47.450> sharpen<00:05:47.780> in

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
about and can this scan d be sharpen in

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.280 
about and can this scan d be sharpen in
the<00:05:47.930> field

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
the field
