00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.230 

to<00:04:20.450> raise<00:04:20.660> him<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:21.079> a<00:04:21.170> woman<00:04:21.760> as<00:04:22.760> early<00:04:23.150> as

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
possible we're in the middle of what

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.810 
possible we're in the middle of what
daddy<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.620> Nana<00:04:27.800> think<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.190> think<00:04:28.430> she's<00:04:28.670> at

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
daddy and Nana think I think she's at

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.850 
daddy and Nana think I think she's at
the<00:04:28.910> age<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.060> we<00:04:29.210> treat<00:04:29.480> her<00:04:29.600> like<00:04:29.630> her<00:04:29.900> and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
the age that we treat her like her and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.520 
the age that we treat her like her and
instill<00:04:31.280> in<00:04:31.430> her<00:04:31.610> traits<00:04:31.970> that<00:04:32.240> will<00:04:32.530> benefit

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
instill in her traits that will benefit

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.930 
instill in her traits that will benefit
her<00:04:33.620> when<00:04:33.800> she's<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.010> woman<00:04:34.220> like<00:04:34.580> how<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:34.790> be

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
her when she's a woman like how to be

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.700 
her when she's a woman like how to be
ladylike<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.660> how<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.990> respectful

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
ladylike and how to be respectful

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.710 
ladylike and how to be respectful
I<00:04:36.740> think<00:04:37.400> she's<00:04:37.730> three<00:04:37.940> hours<00:04:38.240> she'll<00:04:38.420> be<00:04:38.510> for

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
I think she's three hours she'll be for

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.930 
I think she's three hours she'll be for
just<00:04:39.230> a<00:04:39.350> few<00:04:39.530> months<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.400> think<00:04:40.460> it's<00:04:40.790> time

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
just a few months so I think it's time

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.960 
just a few months so I think it's time
to<00:04:40.970> treat<00:04:41.210> her<00:04:41.360> like<00:04:41.390> a<00:04:41.780> girl<00:04:42.110> not<00:04:42.700> not<00:04:43.700> quite<00:04:43.940> a
