we're going to do a comparison video
between<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.309> electronics<00:00:12.030> little<00:00:12.450> big<00:00:12.570> moth

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
between the electronics little big moth

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
between the electronics little big moth
and<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.380> bass<00:00:13.799> big<00:00:14.070> month<00:00:14.280> we're<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:14.969> to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and the bass big month we're going to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
and the bass big month we're going to
run<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.240> through<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.750> bass<00:00:16.379> we're<00:00:17.100> going<00:00:17.220> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
run it through on bass we're going to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
run it through on bass we're going to
run<00:00:17.400> side<00:00:17.670> by<00:00:17.699> side<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.990> hear<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
run side by side so you can hear the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:34.090 
run side by side so you can hear the
difference<00:00:19.740> between<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.160> pedals

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.240 

you

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:01:11.910 

you

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:33.060 

did

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:02:22.040 

you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.090 

so<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.140> was<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> side<00:02:23.470> comparison<00:02:23.950> between

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
so that was a side comparison between

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.970 
so that was a side comparison between
the<00:02:24.400> electronic<00:02:25.180> mod<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.140> little<00:02:26.710> big<00:02:26.800> moth

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the electronic mod and a little big moth

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.520 
the electronic mod and a little big moth
we<00:02:27.880> found<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.270> bass<00:02:28.420> room<00:02:28.690> off<00:02:28.840> retains<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.470> lot

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
we found the bass room off retains a lot

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.710 
we found the bass room off retains a lot
of<00:02:29.710> low-end<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> full<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.510> sound

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
of low-end so you get a full of sound

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.680 
of low-end so you get a full of sound
out<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.110> where<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.740> little<00:02:33.010> big<00:02:33.160> muff<00:02:33.400> is

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
out of it where the little big muff is

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.630 
out of it where the little big muff is
brighter<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.870> has<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> lot<00:02:35.350> more<00:02:35.380> top<00:02:35.680> end<00:02:35.920> so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
brighter and has a lot more top end so

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.160 
brighter and has a lot more top end so
if<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.910> want<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.270> slightly<00:02:37.480> different<00:02:37.990> sound

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
if you want a slightly different sound

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.990 
if you want a slightly different sound
compared<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.950> thicker<00:02:39.370> sound<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.790> bass

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
compared to the thicker sound with bass

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.340 
compared to the thicker sound with bass
big<00:02:40.240> muff<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:41.020> you're<00:02:41.110> going<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.290> be
