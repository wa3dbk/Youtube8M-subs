their website there are two ways you can
control<00:01:02.339> the<00:01:02.489> heli<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.059> app<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.839> can

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
control the heli with the app you can

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.899 
control the heli with the app you can
use<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.440> touchscreen<00:01:04.680> transmitter<00:01:05.549> sticks

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
use the touchscreen transmitter sticks

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.750 
use the touchscreen transmitter sticks
or<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.750> use<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.080> tilt<00:01:07.409> sensor<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
or you can use your tilt sensor but the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
or you can use your tilt sensor but the
tilt<00:01:09.000> sensor<00:01:09.329> only<00:01:09.450> controls<00:01:09.960> spin<00:01:10.289> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
tilt sensor only controls spin and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920 
tilt sensor only controls spin and
forward<00:01:10.890> reverse<00:01:11.009> motion<00:01:11.579> so<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.090> still<00:01:12.750> need

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
forward reverse motion so you still need

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.240 
forward reverse motion so you still need
to<00:01:13.049> control<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> throttle<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:14.100> the

I<00:02:14.130> personally<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.490> feel<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.700> a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
I personally like the feel of a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.910 
I personally like the feel of a
transmitter<00:02:16.450> stick<00:02:16.780> versus<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> touchscreen

transmitter stick versus a touchscreen

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.100 
transmitter stick versus a touchscreen
because<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.730> gives<00:02:19.000> me<00:02:19.209> some<00:02:19.540> sensory

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
because it gives me some sensory

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.830 
because it gives me some sensory
feedback<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.459> found<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.360> could<00:02:22.420> fly

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
feedback and I found that I could fly

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.090 
feedback and I found that I could fly
much<00:02:23.140> better<00:02:23.410> with<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.740> full-size

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
much better with the full-size

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.770 
much better with the full-size

that touches the sponge and you're ready

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.190 
that touches the sponge and you're ready
to<00:03:27.010> go<00:03:27.250> just<00:03:28.030> attach<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.540> suction<00:03:28.690> cup<00:03:29.079> to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
to go just attach the suction cup to

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.479 
to go just attach the suction cup to

your touchscreen in the center of the

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.430 
your touchscreen in the center of the
controller<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.600> should<00:03:31.870> work<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.110> fine

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
controller and it should work just fine

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.160 
controller and it should work just fine
it<00:03:33.280> may<00:03:33.549> take<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.820> little<00:03:34.209> tweaking<00:03:34.600> but<00:03:34.989> it

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
it may take a little tweaking but it

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.870 
it may take a little tweaking but it
works<00:03:35.410> great<00:03:35.560> on<00:03:35.860> other<00:03:36.010> games<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.519> apps<00:03:36.670> as

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
works great on other games and apps as

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.569 
works great on other games and apps as
well<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.420> give<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:38.049> try<00:03:38.079> all<00:03:39.070> together<00:03:39.370> I

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
well so give it a try all together I

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.220 
well so give it a try all together I
have<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.850> say<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.180> helicopter<00:03:40.329> fly<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:40.930> great

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
have to say the helicopter fly is great

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.650 
have to say the helicopter fly is great
and<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.769> app<00:03:41.920> works<00:03:42.220> really<00:03:42.519> well<00:03:42.760> even<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.480> my

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
and the app works really well even on my

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.440 
and the app works really well even on my
low<00:03:43.900> end<00:03:43.930> smartphone<00:03:44.709> but<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.459> honestly<00:03:45.970> had<00:03:46.269> an

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
low end smartphone but I honestly had an

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.120 
low end smartphone but I honestly had an
easier<00:03:46.780> time<00:03:46.989> flying<00:03:47.350> with<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.709> full-size

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
easier time flying with the full-size

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.500 
easier time flying with the full-size
transmitter<00:03:48.730> as<00:03:48.910> opposed<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.420> the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
transmitter as opposed to the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.479 
transmitter as opposed to the
touchscreen<00:03:49.870> my<00:03:50.680> phone<00:03:50.890> has<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.130> decent

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
touchscreen my phone has a decent

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.460 
touchscreen my phone has a decent
multi-touch<00:03:52.120> display<00:03:52.570> but<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.049> isn't<00:03:53.410> the

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
multi-touch display but it isn't the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.229 
multi-touch display but it isn't the
best<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.920> world<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.519> tiny<00:03:54.790> transmitter

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
best in the world and a tiny transmitter

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.210 
best in the world and a tiny transmitter
glitch<00:03:55.630> can<00:03:55.959> translate<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.680> big<00:03:56.920> crash

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
glitch can translate to a big crash

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.849 
glitch can translate to a big crash
really<00:03:57.579> quickly<00:03:57.940> adding<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.989> real<00:03:59.200> joystick

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
really quickly adding a real joystick

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.550 
really quickly adding a real joystick
really<00:04:00.609> helped<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.390> really<00:04:02.049> nice<00:04:02.290> when

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
really helped it's really nice when

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.050 
really helped it's really nice when
everything<00:04:03.040> comes<00:04:03.250> together<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.940> it

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
everything comes together and it

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.000 
everything comes together and it
actually<00:04:04.209> plays<00:04:04.630> back<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:04.930> flight<00:04:05.260> exactly<00:04:05.890> the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
actually plays back a flight exactly the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.979 
actually plays back a flight exactly the
same<00:04:06.190> as<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.459> happened<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.450> helicopter

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
same as it happened and the helicopter

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.650 
same as it happened and the helicopter
is<00:04:08.019> really<00:04:08.829> easy<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.310> fly<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.790> more<00:04:10.209> stable

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
is really easy to fly and more stable

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.509 
is really easy to fly and more stable
than<00:04:10.780> any<00:04:11.109> other<00:04:11.350> Air<00:04:11.560> Hogs<00:04:11.739> helicopter<00:04:12.370> I've

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
than any other Air Hogs helicopter I've

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.789 
than any other Air Hogs helicopter I've
ever<00:04:12.730> flown<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:13.450> check<00:04:14.140> it<00:04:14.260> out<00:04:14.350> if<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.620> have<00:04:14.769> a

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
ever flown so check it out if you have a

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.490 
ever flown so check it out if you have a
chance<00:04:15.130> and<00:04:15.370> stay<00:04:15.850> tuned<00:04:16.060> for<00:04:16.090> more<00:04:16.450> RC<00:04:17.019> 101

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
chance and stay tuned for more RC 101
