in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> wild<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.260> at<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> zoo<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.399> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
in the wild and here at the zoo so we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.220 
in the wild and here at the zoo so we
have<00:00:33.149> been<00:00:33.329> embarking<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.020> hearing

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
have been embarking on this hearing

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.200 
have been embarking on this hearing
study<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> past<00:00:35.070> two<00:00:35.489> years<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.090> we've

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
study for the past two years and we've

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.319 
study for the past two years and we've
gotten<00:00:36.510> some<00:00:36.690> fantastic<00:00:37.469> data<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.910> keeper

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
gotten some fantastic data as the keeper

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.569 
gotten some fantastic data as the keeper
I<00:00:39.600> found<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.200> quite<00:00:40.320> challenging<00:00:40.579> because

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
I found it quite challenging because

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.330 
I found it quite challenging because
what<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:43.559> part<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.129> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
what we have to do is our part in this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
what we have to do is our part in this
is<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> train<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.270> pandas<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.079> go

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
is we have to train the pandas to go

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.729 
is we have to train the pandas to go
into<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> soundproof<00:00:47.579> booth<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.809> us<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
into a soundproof booth with us in the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.100 
into a soundproof booth with us in the
booth<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> pandas<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.510> basically

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
booth with the pandas and then basically

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.220 
booth with the pandas and then basically
have<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.620> train<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> respond<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.809> tones

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
have to train them to respond just tones

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
have to train them to respond just tones
and<00:00:55.530> sounds<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> put<00:00:56.550> their<00:00:56.699> nose<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
and sounds and put their nose to a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.510 
and sounds and put their nose to a
target<00:00:57.660> after<00:00:58.469> they<00:00:58.829> put<00:00:58.980> their<00:00:59.129> nose<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
target after they put their nose to a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
target after they put their nose to a
target<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> clicker<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> bridge

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
target then we use a clicker as a bridge

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.149 
target then we use a clicker as a bridge
a<00:01:01.649> reward<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.969> noise<00:01:03.149> tells<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> Panda<00:01:04.500> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
a reward the noise tells the Panda that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
a reward the noise tells the Panda that
they<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:05.970> done<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> behavior<00:01:06.720> correctly

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
they have done the behavior correctly

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
they have done the behavior correctly
and<00:01:07.380> then<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> food<00:01:07.799> reward<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.490> follow

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
and then a food reward will follow

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.670 
and then a food reward will follow
afterwards<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.090> soon<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.510> she<00:01:12.869> she<00:01:13.439> really

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
afterwards but soon when she she really

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.219 
afterwards but soon when she she really
gets<00:01:13.860> into<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:16.400> Jen<00:01:17.400> Jen<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.850> had<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> feeling

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
gets into it and Jen Jen I had a feeling

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.100 
gets into it and Jen Jen I had a feeling
she<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.369> star<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:21.960> was

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
she was going to be a star that was

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
she was going to be a star that was
really<00:01:22.350> exciting<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.799> us<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.490> she<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
really exciting for us because she is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.429 
really exciting for us because she is
definitely<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.360> youngest<00:01:24.570> bear<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.259> have

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
definitely the youngest bear to have

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.920 
definitely the youngest bear to have
ever<00:01:25.619> participated<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.210> study<00:01:27.450> such<00:01:27.900> as

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
ever participated in a study such as

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
ever participated in a study such as
that<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.189> only<00:01:29.220> got<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> good<00:01:29.909> sense

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
that it so we not only got a good sense

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.480 
that it so we not only got a good sense
of<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.780> young<00:01:30.990> bear<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.560> hear<00:01:31.950> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
of what a very young bear could hear we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670 
of what a very young bear could hear we
also<00:01:32.640> learned<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.659> young<00:01:33.930> pandas<00:01:34.439> are

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
also learned that that young pandas are

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.080 
also learned that that young pandas are
very<00:01:34.710> smart<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> they're<00:01:35.729> able<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
very smart and they're able to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
very smart and they're able to
participate<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.470> study<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:37.920> quite

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
participate in the study that's quite

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
participate in the study that's quite
challenging<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.119> requires<00:01:39.540> them<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.840> really

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
challenging and requires them to really

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.960 
challenging and requires them to really
think<00:01:40.710> about<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.310> they're<00:01:41.460> doing<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
think about what they're doing and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.730 
think about what they're doing and
interact<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.570> their<00:01:42.840> keepers<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> really

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
interact with their keepers on a really

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.240 
interact with their keepers on a really
detailed<00:01:44.369> level<00:01:45.350> now<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> things<00:01:47.009> as

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
detailed level now one of the things as

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
detailed level now one of the things as
the<00:01:47.460> trainer<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> do

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the trainer that we do is that I do

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
the trainer that we do is that I do
control<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> computer<00:01:50.369> sends<00:01:50.790> us<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
control when the computer sends us a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.660 
control when the computer sends us a
tone<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:52.020> trick<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.920> whole<00:01:53.130> thing<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
tone the trick is to this whole thing is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
tone the trick is to this whole thing is
that<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.880> never<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.570> when<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> tone<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.320> going

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that I never know when a tone is going

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.330 
that I never know when a tone is going

sometimes a tone may be played sometimes
a<00:01:59.219> tone<00:01:59.460> may<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.060> played<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> Panda

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
a tone may not be played so the Panda

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.039 
a tone may not be played so the Panda
has<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.520> rewarded<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.420> either<00:02:03.780> sitting

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
has to get rewarded for either sitting

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.819 
has to get rewarded for either sitting
and<00:02:04.350> not<00:02:04.860> reacting<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.909> tone<00:02:06.180> or<00:02:06.829> reacting

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to a tone when a tone is played but it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.440 
to a tone when a tone is played but it
gets<00:02:10.739> even<00:02:10.950> harder<00:02:11.430> than<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
gets even harder than that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.200 
gets even harder than that
the<00:02:13.230> tones<00:02:13.530> will<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:14.280> played<00:02:14.580> out<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:15.060> our

human hearing range a lot of people ask

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.300 
human hearing range a lot of people ask
me<00:02:17.910> well<00:02:18.270> how<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.319> know<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.890> Panda

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
me well how do you know that the Panda

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.850 
me well how do you know that the Panda
has<00:02:21.120> responded<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.870> tone<00:02:22.080> properly<00:02:22.650> well

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
has responded to the tone properly well

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.680 
has responded to the tone properly well
there's<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.100> little<00:02:23.340> light<00:02:23.490> -<00:02:23.790> below<00:02:24.209> my<00:02:24.420> feet

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
there's a little light - below my feet

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600 
there's a little light - below my feet
that<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.050> flash<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.740> let<00:02:25.920> me<00:02:26.040> know<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.580> a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
that will flash that let me know that a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.270 
that will flash that let me know that a
tone<00:02:26.880> has<00:02:27.030> been<00:02:27.209> played<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:28.770> we<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.070> is

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
tone has been played and what we do is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.540 
tone has been played and what we do is
we<00:02:29.430> play<00:02:29.700> tones<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:31.320> we<00:02:31.680> know<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.130> loudness

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
we play tones that we know the loudness

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.460 
we play tones that we know the loudness
of<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:33.060> know<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.390> frequency<00:02:33.870> or<00:02:33.990> pitch<00:02:34.230> of

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
of we know the frequency or pitch of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.680 
of we know the frequency or pitch of
those<00:02:34.620> tones<00:02:34.890> these<00:02:35.190> are<00:02:35.370> measured<00:02:35.760> sounds

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
those tones these are measured sounds

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.720 
those tones these are measured sounds
that<00:02:36.840> we<00:02:36.930> play<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.200> them<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.740> they<00:02:38.280> tell<00:02:38.520> us

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
that we play to them and they tell us

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.100 
that we play to them and they tell us
basically<00:02:39.270> whether<00:02:39.450> they've<00:02:39.690> heard<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.930> or

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
basically whether they've heard it or

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.530 
basically whether they've heard it or
not<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.580> doctor's<00:02:41.940> office<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.330> might

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
not in the doctor's office you might

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.449 
not in the doctor's office you might
raise<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> finger<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.650> tell<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> doctor<00:02:44.280> that

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
raise a finger to tell the doctor that

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.460 
raise a finger to tell the doctor that
you<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.060> heard<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> tone<00:02:45.660> what<00:02:46.320> we

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you that you heard the tone what we

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.410 
you that you heard the tone what we
asked<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> pandas<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.820> put<00:02:48.060> their<00:02:48.239> nose

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
asked the pandas to do is put their nose

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.229 
asked the pandas to do is put their nose
on<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.750> target<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.800> very<00:02:50.010> clear<00:02:50.850> and

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
on a target and it's a very clear and

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.630 
on a target and it's a very clear and
unambiguous<00:02:51.480> move<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.560> they<00:02:52.709> make<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.250> if

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
unambiguous move that they make and if

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.250 
unambiguous move that they make and if
they<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.060> correctly<00:02:54.420> they<00:02:54.750> get<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> treat

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
they do it correctly they get a treat

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.460 
they do it correctly they get a treat
and<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:56.370> way<00:02:56.550> we<00:02:56.820> can<00:02:57.000> really<00:02:57.470> sequentially

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and this way we can really sequentially

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.970 
and this way we can really sequentially
present<00:02:59.070> tones<00:02:59.580> at<00:03:00.420> progressively<00:03:01.290> lower<00:03:01.590> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
present tones at progressively lower and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.100 
present tones at progressively lower and
lower<00:03:02.130> loudness<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.180> when<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
lower loudness and when we get to the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.630 
lower loudness and when we get to the
point<00:03:04.350> where<00:03:04.500> they<00:03:04.620> can't<00:03:04.890> hear<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.310> tone

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
point where they can't hear that tone

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.790 
point where they can't hear that tone
anymore<00:03:06.209> that's<00:03:06.810> when<00:03:07.050> we<00:03:07.170> know<00:03:07.320> we've<00:03:07.590> hit

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
anymore that's when we know we've hit

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.160 
anymore that's when we know we've hit
their<00:03:07.980> threshold<00:03:08.570> sue-lin<00:03:09.570> was<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> really

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
their threshold sue-lin was a really

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.840 
their threshold sue-lin was a really
important<00:03:10.590> panda<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:11.070> us<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.370> terms<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
important panda for us in terms of the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.729 
important panda for us in terms of the
scientific<00:03:12.360> research<00:03:12.540> she's<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> first

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
scientific research she's the first

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.100 
scientific research she's the first
giant<00:03:14.250> panda<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:15.239> which<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.540> have<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
giant panda for which we have the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.800 
giant panda for which we have the
comprehensive<00:03:16.739> hearing<00:03:17.280> data<00:03:17.880> on<00:03:18.150> we've

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
comprehensive hearing data on we've

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.420 
comprehensive hearing data on we've
learned<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.290> pandas<00:03:19.680> actually<00:03:20.010> have<00:03:20.160> quite

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
learned that pandas actually have quite

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.130 
learned that pandas actually have quite
sensitive<00:03:20.820> hearing<00:03:21.239> at<00:03:21.480> some<00:03:21.750> some

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
sensitive hearing at some some

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.539 
sensitive hearing at some some
frequencies<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.920> are<00:03:22.980> higher<00:03:23.190> than<00:03:23.220> we

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
frequencies that are higher than we

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.759 
frequencies that are higher than we
expected<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:25.079> were<00:03:25.260> really<00:03:25.290> really

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
expected and so we were really really

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.830 
expected and so we were really really
excited<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:26.310> have<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.579> time<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:26.970> her<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.360> to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
excited to have the time with her and to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.840 
excited to have the time with her and to
get<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.170> data<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:31.170> suelen<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.980> Jen<00:03:32.190> Jen<00:03:32.430> just

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
get that data so suelen and Jen Jen just

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.970 
get that data so suelen and Jen Jen just
made<00:03:33.480> their<00:03:33.630> trip<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.959> China<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:34.799> they're

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
made their trip to China and now they're

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.030 
made their trip to China and now they're
safely<00:03:35.459> at<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.660> Wolong<00:03:36.989> Panda<00:03:37.440> Conservation

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
safely at the Wolong Panda Conservation

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.280 
safely at the Wolong Panda Conservation
Center<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:38.910> were<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.420> course<00:03:39.570> very<00:03:39.720> sad<00:03:40.140> to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
Center and we were of course very sad to

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.780 
Center and we were of course very sad to
see<00:03:40.440> them<00:03:40.560> go<00:03:40.739> but<00:03:41.010> we're<00:03:41.310> really<00:03:41.489> excited
