limited<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> not

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
limited it is it this one is not

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
limited it is it this one is not
numbered<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.189> haven't<00:02:02.790> seen<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> bronze<00:02:03.360> bust

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
numbered I haven't seen a bronze bust

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530 
numbered I haven't seen a bronze bust
version<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.290> numbered<00:02:04.969> but<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.299> guess<00:02:06.509> is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
version that is numbered but my guess is

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.930 
version that is numbered but my guess is
it<00:02:06.990> could<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> batch<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.610> third

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it could be like a batch or third

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
same time yeah I don't know I would have

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.580 
same time yeah I don't know I would have
preferred<00:04:03.730> some<00:04:04.209> kind<00:04:04.449> of<00:04:04.480> class<00:04:04.750> or<00:04:05.019> security

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
preferred some kind of class or security

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
so you can move it without accidentally

let's put the bust aside and take a look

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.470 
let's put the bust aside and take a look
at<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.520> dig<00:05:15.820> back<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.970> this<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.180> kind<00:05:19.420> of

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
at the dig back and so this is kind of

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.600 
at the dig back and so this is kind of
interesting<00:05:19.690> I<00:05:20.020> know<00:05:20.080> you've<00:05:20.440> seen<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.580> other

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
interesting I know you've seen the other

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.180 
interesting I know you've seen the other
video<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.210> did<00:05:22.450> which<00:05:22.900> showed<00:05:23.260> this<00:05:23.500> and<00:05:23.830> there

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
video I did which showed this and there

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.400 
video I did which showed this and there
I<00:05:24.220> was<00:05:24.610> really<00:05:24.970> really<00:05:25.420> impressed<00:05:25.870> with<00:05:26.200> the

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
I was really really impressed with the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.530 
I was really really impressed with the
outer<00:05:26.620> slit<00:05:27.130> case<00:05:27.430> which<00:05:27.880> has<00:05:28.120> sort<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.390> like<00:05:28.510> a

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
outer slit case which has sort of like a

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.630 
outer slit case which has sort of like a
glossy<00:05:28.990> printing<00:05:29.440> for<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.620> glasses<00:05:29.920> and<00:05:30.400> you

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
glossy printing for the glasses and you

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.040 
glossy printing for the glasses and you
know<00:05:30.760> math<00:05:31.000> printing<00:05:31.450> for<00:05:31.600> everything<00:05:31.900> else

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
know math printing for everything else

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.300 
know math printing for everything else
and<00:05:32.170> I<00:05:32.260> think<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.560> looks<00:05:32.770> really<00:05:32.950> stunning

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
and I think that looks really stunning

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.270 
and I think that looks really stunning
so<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.210> problem<00:05:34.600> here<00:05:34.780> as<00:05:35.140> is<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.160> know

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
so the problem here as is that you know

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.040 
so the problem here as is that you know
the<00:05:36.700> slit<00:05:36.880> case<00:05:37.090> is<00:05:37.240> not<00:05:37.390> included<00:05:37.900> because

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
the slit case is not included because

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.290 
the slit case is not included because
you<00:05:38.320> have<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.560> outer<00:05:38.680> box<00:05:38.920> so<00:05:39.700> you<00:05:39.760> really

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
you have the outer box so you really

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.940 
you have the outer box so you really
miss<00:05:40.480> out<00:05:40.690> on<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:40.990> slip<00:05:41.200> case<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.740> think

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
miss out on the slip case and I think

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.510 
miss out on the slip case and I think
that's<00:05:42.130> very<00:05:42.400> sad<00:05:43.240> but<00:05:44.200> still<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.860> know<00:05:44.980> it's

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
that's very sad but still you know it's

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.300 
that's very sad but still you know it's
a<00:05:45.610> great<00:05:45.790> addition<00:05:46.560> get<00:05:47.560> an<00:05:47.680> interior<00:05:47.920> a<00:05:48.130> big

issued version of the DA pack and what's

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.330 
issued version of the DA pack and what's
different<00:06:01.120> about<00:06:01.390> it<00:06:01.570> is<00:06:01.780> that<00:06:02.230> it<00:06:02.860> doesn't

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
different about it is that it doesn't

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.540 
different about it is that it doesn't

have the collectors booklet in it if you

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.760
