00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.920
 hello wireless friends my name is 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:10.070
 I raise morals and this we have in the 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:12.890
 hand is the chi chi chi chi chi or g2 for 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.070
 the least critical this is the new range 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.929
 high of the company and has a series of 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.640
 pretty interesting features 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.720
 first of all what most calls the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.269
 attention is this the back button 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.430
 for all the rear buttons for 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.789
 can raise and lower the volume and also 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.820
 the home button there is going to try to 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.559
 make it work until the buttons 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.559
 rear to raise and lower the volume 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.809
 the home button is a bit by city 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.220
 or in this demonstration team of 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.040
 done this is the fifth video he recorded 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.409
 because I did not work the first nor the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.640
 fourth finally the point is that 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.159
 this is what most attracts attention 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.680
 things that are good about this that 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.689
 the sides do not have practically 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.920
 nothing to do on the phone there's no 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:02.720
 nothing nothing nothing in this device is something to 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.840
 this side here to see if I can 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.899
 zoom in 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.770
 is in the tray to place the 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.299
 hands 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.020
 this device works with hand symbol 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:18.799
 According to what we have been told, the frontal flame 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.100
 attention this panel ips full hd of 5.2 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:26.149
 inches the edge is really thin 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.039
 it's pretty good it 's very thin I have 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.319
 afraid of how this can react to 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.490
 the blows but apparently this part 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.960
 of the side is metal could make 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.909
 resist a bit better fall 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.429
 lateral anyway it seems to be 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.979
 that a fall would be catastrophic for 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.619
 this device what else do we have here 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.909
 well in the front we can see the usual 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.730
 it is sensor headset camera and brand 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.820
 of the yi 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.550
 from behind we had seen it on camera 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.320
 3 - megapixel stabilizer 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.320
 optical and a 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.130
 with flash with led flash and nothing else here 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.520
 down we have the jack for the connector 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.030
 for hearing aids we have a speaker and a 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.700
 microphone 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.680
 and what else do we have here? Nothing else is a 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.080
 very minimalist phone good here 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.600
 up has that little black dot more 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.750
 great that I assume that does not focus well this 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.650
 thing there is the biggest black dot 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.920
 It is a 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.620
 an infrared to be able to operate 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.340
 the remote control application that the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 we have here 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.300
 that allows you to control a series of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.040
 devices including of course 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.040
 this does not do little 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.430
 including all these devices that 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.750
 you have there in case you have it there is 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.760
 well 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.010
 to work with this remote control and 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.560
 handle all your devices even 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.180
 separated by room 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.610
 nothing very different from what we have seen 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.230
 in other devices in this sense the 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.480
 Interface 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.269
 is much more childish than 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.730
 we could have expected it comes very close 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.190
 more to what we saw at some point in 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.440
 touchwiz with samsung 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.980
 but it has a 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.860
 the truth has a much closer 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.970
 more in the style of vivid blue yÃ­ 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.770
 with these menus that are slidable and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.140
 that allow others to have 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.970
 contextual by the sides that of 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.390
 fact they are quite similar to those of others 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.090
 teams of the series and we've seen 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.860
 get to the market this is going to be the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.410
 first device that is going to have a dragon 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.490
 800 worldwide 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.690
 I say global distribution because we're going to 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.790
 there are probably other devices that 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.380
 they will defend themselves but this one will be 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.270
 distributed worldwide not only in 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.770
 asia or not only in usa so that's a 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.780
 pretty interesting doctor for there 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.990
 remember that this processor 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.370
 snapdragon 800 runs at 2 points 26 giga 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:11.290
 hertz in its four cores in this 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.390
 in this device we already saw the 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.660
 snapdragon 800 in some time ago 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.120
 you can see our measurements there is 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.270
 quite powerful is a lot of power 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.530
 for this good device we talk about 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.560
 the camera we talk about the buttons 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.430
 we talk about its interface 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.160
 we talk about these menus that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.590
 personally I 'm not a big fan of them and 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.699
 Now let's talk about some 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.229
 own characteristics of the jeep 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.710
 the first one and once it comes out 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.710
 this little manito 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.670
 We have estimated that this will 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.300
 allows you to deliver your equipment without anyone 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.009
 more see your content no one else is going to 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.619
 see it nobody is going to 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.619
 to use or misuse in that regard 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.629
 look do not see 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:08.389
 it did not work quite well but 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:10.879
 finally the issue is that within 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.770
 these characteristics we find that it is 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.309
 mods for you to deliver your phone 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:20.180
 without having the fear that someone will 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:23.629
 I can put your things in your photograph 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.090
 with good whoever wants you to drink 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:29.790
 photos in some little position 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.790
 a little visible for the rest or not 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.970
 You want me to see the rest that has more 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.500
 also this not with what it was that 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.540
 we just saw this that I play two 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.060
 times the screen and something works that 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.120
 we are also seen in others 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.190
 appliances and that more audio zoom 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.630
 we also find a very good 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.639
 sound quality in this device does not 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.500
 we have been able to prove it this assured there 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.250
 a demo a little further on where we're going 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.010
 to be able to prove these these 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.650
 characteristics that was so far 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.330
 what we have seen with this team 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:08.930
 in size it does not look so different to galaxy 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:12.750
 s 4 but equally feels even 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.720
 lighter smaller in the hand to 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.150
 Although it is almost the same width 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.280
 but it is a very good achievement that has 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.520
 made the disc in this device we are going to 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.920
 review it more in detail in text like this 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.880
 that this was the first approach to 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.040
 sorry to the chi chi chi axis here we have 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.970
 come to know here 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.970
