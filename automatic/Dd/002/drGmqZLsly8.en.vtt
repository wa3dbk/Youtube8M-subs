00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.399
 hello yourself hunter in this video 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.290
 I'll tell you about the jetpack or 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.540
 physical jet pack and ask and 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.490
 rank is equal to experiments in order to 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.970
 craft jet pack needed 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.470
 red dust iron shell 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.990
 electrical circuits and universal liquid 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.550
 capsule recipe electric 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.250
 jet pack remained unchanged 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.920
 for this it is necessary to glowing 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.770
 iron shell energy storage and 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.510
 advanced announcer scheme after 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.449
 you have them crafted them now 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.850
 filled with electric you can charge in 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.010
 any power storage is enough for the court 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.179
 put it and the maximum it holds in 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.409
 yourself 300 thousand units of electricity a 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:45.350
 jetpack can be filled 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:48.440
 fillers for this expose mode 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.960
 fill the capsule from the tank put there 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.389
 jet pack and here you should 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.039
 put biogas it can be done with 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:55.969
 using for example universal 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.530
 liquid capsules 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.179
 press shift and right click 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.480
 here we see biogas here and 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.570
 the filling process began 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.960
 over time 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.430
 here's a gas jet zibi satchel 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.900
 maximum takahiro will not be able to accommodate 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.050
 yourself 30 capsules of bio gas ie 330000 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.540
 milliliters is not required to give it rain 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.860
 off and now check how she is 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.750
 flies on a simple electric 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 jetpack you can maximum 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.640
 climb to a height in my 180 blocks 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.039
 on was true creative mode off 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.410
 but now we look yes we see 182 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.350
 30 here at this height you will 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.930
 hang out no higher than 180 gloms 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.930
 maximum 185 the next pack already 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 jet on it you will be able to climb 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 to a height of up to 250 blocks almost 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.170
 which is almost 70 blocks higher than with 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.170
 elliptical jet pack 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.850
 the cat we see 249 was the maximum in general 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:26.520
 at a height of about 200 forty you 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:29.560
 hang so let us go back now 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.980
 here in order to fly on a jet 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.290
 knapsack 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.910
 or its electric jet pack 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.050
 must be placed in the slot where you have 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.420
 bib on it all put huskies 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.660
 subscribe to my channel and see you soon 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.660
 meeting
