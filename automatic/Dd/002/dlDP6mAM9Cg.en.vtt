00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello the concepts are gone and today they are 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.440
 here with my buddy who greets you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.760
 because he has a small problem when 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.090
 people see it around says go 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.790
 practiced at 463 of incredible hour 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 takes in hand but you see the layers 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.250
 the surface finish is not 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.590
 awesome 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.410
 so today we will try to improve the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.480
 its appeal making it smoother is the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.010
 surface and to do this we will have to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.010
 use alive may instead seem 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.210
 first we need the vinegar is not 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.269
 another came soon another one of m 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 I do not do this in which 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.110
 we'll evaporate pitcher and then there 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.809
 will serve a sacrificial victim 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.500
 in this case the octopus first thing 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.329
 discriminates the sector is flammable 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
 you do n't have to work with the division 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.620
 skillful is not a problem carnival thing a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.540
 life so I recommend maximum 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.610
 attention open windows and then 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.070
 released little to the house of I am sorry 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.899
 but I value this is the second time 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 I do this thing so it's not that 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.729
 be an expert and the first or 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.410
 simply damaged the piece above 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 a lattice four shots of iron 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.660
 this did maybe we'll try instead 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.369
 to hang it from above so during the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.759
 procedure that if perhaps agitated 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.070
 slightly and accelerate a thing too 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.770
 because the acetone vapors are more 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 heavy air and which is an advantage 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.820
 because it does not go light in the room but 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.619
 the fact remains really proof what 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.080
 means that it comes closer towards 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.390
 the lower part and therefore the part closer to 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.759
 fund arrived immediately more effect 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.770
 of skier compared to the part in China 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.140
 so maybe shaking it we burn it a little 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.640
 to muller this problem 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.369
 then we place the glass jar 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.890
 over the bed for printed and we can 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.250
 to have 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.310
 right at the trigger let's say thanks to 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.090
 this point we then pour mm in height 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.710
 of acetone inside the glass so li 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.560
 he calls udine only when it is warm that 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:16.510
 maybe they'll see you right away and come 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.730
 just as we warm up we prepare the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.739
 to 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.830
 we will use the wire with the support 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.810
 our object wants to sign and it is though 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.230
 they say not to attack in some 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.510
 way 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.269
 we use life all the many e 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.280
 we try to put it on the bottom of the 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.830
 I fish not to treat by way of a 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.090
 point at which we engage from ours 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.760
 son 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.820
 now let's take then we tell them 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.570
 let's go back to the colors and wait 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.470
 project we will have to put something on it 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.870
 an invader to hook up with cool currents 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.750
 I suspect it 's better to use something 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.610
 first plastic i 'm not sure yes 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.160
 can see in the room 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.380
 however, by now steam has made a layer there 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.269
 lead to this height 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.700
 we can then try to immerse the 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:11.200
 Our object we can adjust fil of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.980
 iron so that if the right height 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.610
 here it does not touch and is perfectly immersed 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.290
 now let's leave here a few minutes 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.680
 this age bacterium is very rapid 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.840
 will have passed about 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.879
 30 45 seconds this is a result 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.849
 now I don't know if it says a correction in 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:48.389
 room but the smoothing is already happening 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:51.420
 the tube is still in the pair of 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.980
 minutes with links result from where 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.980
 I accelerate it and I also put on music 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:12.000
 let's see how about a now passed 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:16.900
 another minute maybe a little less is already 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.730
 actually on the tentacles almost not 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.640
 you see those layers still something 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.640
 there is but this is very happy email 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.600
 obviously it would be to leave it 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.300
 evaporate a little outside the jar 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.680
 to then repeat but I am extremely 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.490
 here I want to see the 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.490
 result therefore 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.940
 when we talk about the past again about 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.320
 another minute I saw a drop for 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.600
 along the head this why 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.600
 probably with dance on the body that you 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.490
 cold therefore the result stably 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.220
 it will not be uniform one hundred percent is not 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.010
 guaranteed however we say definitely one 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.600
 very very interesting thing in the room 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.950
 you will not be able to see well but much now 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.290
 I take high photographs 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.180
 resolution 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:26.150
 but I would ask for another minute of cooking 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.150
 another minute of sauna and we're ready 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.390
 ok 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.350
 I'd say we're ready now let's leave 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.320
 dry an object for a while 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:40.640
 maybe on a small piece of cardboard 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.640
 and then we see final result 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:11.040
 this final result is reported 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.810
 from the photos there is an improvement 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.000
 very clear is not yet exceptional 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.710
 surely it might be more 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.510
 I have noticed from some parts it turns out 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.360
 happy about something else and that we still have to 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.190
 it seems that the procedure to understand this well 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.260
 will give when technical home 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.140
 try it yourself and let us know in the 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.270
 comments as are your results if 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.100
 the million enjoyed sign up at 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:38.850
 our channel and share it with i 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.850
 your friends is in itself a rejection of many 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:46.470
 team first when we need acetone 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.540
 first we need a hundred per hour 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.900
 the first thing we need in the middle 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:07:00.480
 six cities need the token for 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.480
 acetone the acetone towards where
