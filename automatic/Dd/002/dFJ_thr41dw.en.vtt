those toxins that kind of sit around in
our<00:03:50.530> bodies<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.130> make<00:03:51.340> us<00:03:51.489> absorb<00:03:51.880> fat<00:03:52.319> into

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
our bodies and make us absorb fat into

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.159 
our bodies and make us absorb fat into
digestible<00:03:53.819> material<00:03:54.819> further<00:03:55.329> just<00:03:55.780> making

I'm saying red bell peppers because more

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.600 
I'm saying red bell peppers because more
than<00:04:08.380> your<00:04:08.560> green<00:04:08.830> or<00:04:08.950> your<00:04:09.070> yellow<00:04:09.250> bell

than your green or your yellow bell
peppers<00:04:10.060> red<00:04:10.750> bell<00:04:11.080> peppers<00:04:11.680> get<00:04:12.310> rid<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.640> a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
peppers red bell peppers get rid of a

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.210 
peppers red bell peppers get rid of a
lot<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.030> toxins<00:04:13.900> now<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.590> reason<00:04:14.980> why<00:04:15.100> I'm

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
lot of toxins now the reason why I'm

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.680 
lot of toxins now the reason why I'm
bringing<00:04:15.250> that<00:04:15.640> up<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:16.000> because<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.420> has<00:04:16.540> even

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
bringing that up is because it has even

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.920 
bringing that up is because it has even
more<00:04:16.840> vitamin<00:04:17.380> C<00:04:17.680> than<00:04:18.190> an<00:04:18.220> orange<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:19.630> a<00:04:19.660> red

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
more vitamin C than an orange so a red

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.270 
more vitamin C than an orange so a red
bell<00:04:20.140> pepper<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.590> going<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.830> give<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.070> even

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
bell pepper is going to give you even

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.210 
bell pepper is going to give you even
more<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.410> digestible<00:04:23.410> material<00:04:24.070> and

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
more of that digestible material and

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.530 
more of that digestible material and
it's<00:04:24.340> going<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.550> break<00:04:24.760> things<00:04:25.000> down<00:04:25.150> in<00:04:25.420> your

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
it's going to break things down in your

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.510 
it's going to break things down in your
body<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.110> you're<00:04:26.470> able<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.890> push<00:04:27.310> them

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
body so that you're able to push them

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.150 
body so that you're able to push them
out<00:04:27.640> another<00:04:28.570> one<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:28.960> really<00:04:29.080> like<00:04:29.830> is
