all<00:03:39.190> dynamite<00:03:39.850> that's<00:03:39.970> why<00:03:40.209> we<00:03:40.330> gravitate

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
all dynamite that's why we gravitate

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.080 
all dynamite that's why we gravitate
towards<00:03:41.230> street<00:03:42.040> fighters<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.610> naked<00:03:42.910> bikes

three cylinder and you know with the
right<00:04:03.880> pipe<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.360> little<00:04:04.510> quieter<00:04:04.930> than

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
right pipe it's a little quieter than

right pipe it's a little quieter than
it's<00:04:05.319> one<00:04:05.500> with<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.800> right<00:04:05.950> pipe<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.370> also

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
it's one with the right pipe it also

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.949 
it's one with the right pipe it also
makes<00:04:06.819> a<00:04:06.940> great<00:04:07.030> noise<00:04:07.150> but<00:04:07.660> its<00:04:07.780> power

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
makes a great noise but its power

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.840 
makes a great noise but its power
delivery<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.470> also<00:04:08.860> great<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:09.760> you've

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
delivery is also great and then you've

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.980 
delivery is also great and then you've
got<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:10.150> inline<00:04:10.540> four<00:04:10.840> from<00:04:11.230> md<00:04:12.090> again<00:04:13.090> it

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
got this inline four from md again it

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.560 
got this inline four from md again it

triple and the MV it has a traction
control<00:05:10.120> as<00:05:10.240> well<00:05:10.420> but<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:10.810> also<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.290> different

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
control as well but it also is different

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.630

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
only comes into sharp focus because

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.500 
only comes into sharp focus because

these two bike steer with such precision

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.690 
these two bike steer with such precision
and<00:05:31.870> linearity<00:05:32.200> these<00:05:32.800> are<00:05:33.100> fantastic

I<00:05:53.890> think<00:05:54.400> we<00:05:54.460> did<00:05:54.580> what<00:05:54.700> 124<00:05:55.470> 123<00:05:56.470> 123<00:05:57.160> on<00:05:57.430> this

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
I think we did what 124 123 123 on this

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:05.340 
I think we did what 124 123 123 on this

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
number lightyears ahead of those two so

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.600 
number lightyears ahead of those two so
horsepower<00:06:08.230> winner<00:06:08.560> right<00:06:08.800> there<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:09.400> least

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
horsepower winner right there the least

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.730 
horsepower winner right there the least
powerful<00:06:10.000> so<00:06:10.390> you<00:06:10.450> need<00:06:10.780> to<00:06:10.960> rev<00:06:11.410> it<00:06:11.530> up<00:06:11.590> a

that if that was the benchmark this

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.310 
that if that was the benchmark this
thing<00:06:50.310> is<00:06:50.430> so<00:06:50.640> much<00:06:50.820> better<00:06:51.030> but<00:06:51.660> now<00:06:51.840> with<00:06:52.110> the
