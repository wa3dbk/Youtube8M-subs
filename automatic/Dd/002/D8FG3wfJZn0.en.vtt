now the server only holds 12 people it's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.200 
now the server only holds 12 people it's
located<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.930> Toronto<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> server<00:01:25.950> host<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.909> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
located in Toronto the server host is in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.880 
located in Toronto the server host is in
Toronto<00:01:27.720> Canada<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.979> didn't<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
Toronto Canada you didn't know and so I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.039 
Toronto Canada you didn't know and so I
can't<00:01:32.310> let<00:01:32.520> everyone<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.450> join<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> server

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
can't let everyone just join the server

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.870 
can't let everyone just join the server
because<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.680> only<00:01:34.710> will<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.220> full<00:01:35.549> almost

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
because not only will it be full almost

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
because not only will it be full almost
all<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> time<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:37.079> it'll<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.829> laggy<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
all the time but it'll be laggy and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.859 
all the time but it'll be laggy and
whatnot<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.390> doing<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
whatnot so I'm going to be doing is

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
whatnot so I'm going to be doing is

on<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> server<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.909> don't<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.689> I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
on the server and I don't know if I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.380 
on the server and I don't know if I
mentioned<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> server<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.829> very

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390

mentioned this but the server is very
very<00:02:03.390> very<00:02:03.659> vanilla<00:02:05.479> what<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.659> means<00:02:06.869> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
very very vanilla what that means is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
very very vanilla what that means is
that<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.819> isn't<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> lot<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that there isn't gonna be a lot of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.479 
that there isn't gonna be a lot of
plugins<00:02:09.629> there's<00:02:09.959> no<00:02:10.080> real<00:02:10.289> economy<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:11.069> you

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
