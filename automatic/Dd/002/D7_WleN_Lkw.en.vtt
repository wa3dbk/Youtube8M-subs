00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.070 

so<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.550> nest<00:00:02.790> box<00:00:03.090> that<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.480> built<00:00:03.840> for

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
so this is the nest box that I built for

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.690 
so this is the nest box that I built for
my<00:00:04.339> button<00:00:05.339> cribs<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.200> I<00:00:07.200> did<00:00:07.710> build<00:00:07.950> one<00:00:08.550> of

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
my button cribs and I did build one of

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.759 
my button cribs and I did build one of
it<00:00:08.849> but<00:00:09.240> then<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.510> decided<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.349> need<00:00:10.530> to

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
it but then I decided that I need to

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.009 
it but then I decided that I need to
have<00:00:11.130> two<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.490> them<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> took<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.719> one<00:00:12.870> down

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
have two of them so I took that one down

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.839 
have two of them so I took that one down
and<00:00:13.230> repelled<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:13.950> over<00:00:14.400> again<00:00:14.490> and

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
and repelled it all over again and

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.710 
and repelled it all over again and
decide<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.320> two<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.740> them<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.640> they<00:00:18.570> will

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
decide to have two of them and they will

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.950 
decide to have two of them and they will
be<00:00:18.750> by<00:00:19.109> side<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:19.710> side<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> built<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.900> one

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
be by side by side so I built this one

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.540 
be by side by side so I built this one
and<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.939> has<00:00:24.210> two<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.570> them<00:00:24.810> true<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:26.160> space

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and it it has two of them true to space

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.620 
and it it has two of them true to space
in<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:27.289> separate<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> divider<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.160> and

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
in here separate with a divider here and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.350 
in here separate with a divider here and
by<00:00:30.630> doing<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:32.489> end<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:33.270> on

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
by doing this I can have one end be on

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.750 
by doing this I can have one end be on
this<00:00:33.540> side<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.500> other<00:00:34.890> hand<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> other

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
this side and other hand on the other

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.209 
this side and other hand on the other
side<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> same<00:00:36.899> time<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> very<00:00:38.700> nice<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
side at the same time so very nice and

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.430 
side at the same time so very nice and
it's<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.969> chopped<00:00:42.899> inches<00:00:43.350> long<00:00:43.590> by<00:00:44.579> sis

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's actually chopped inches long by sis

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's actually chopped inches long by sis
why<00:00:46.440> ants<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.190> tall<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.829> pretty<00:00:49.829> much<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.629> use

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
why ants is tall and pretty much I use

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.700 
why ants is tall and pretty much I use
small<00:00:52.110> nails<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:54.020> has<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.829> a

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.359 
little bit of a lip there
so<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.629> built<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.100> watch<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so I built this and I have to watch to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.899 
so I built this and I have to watch to
spend<00:01:05.670> hours<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.540> scrap<00:01:07.340> plywood<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.729> have

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
spend hours out of scrap plywood I have

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
spend hours out of scrap plywood I have
flying<00:01:09.180> around<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.799> really

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
flying around it's not it's not really

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.539 
flying around it's not it's not really
the<00:01:11.220> best<00:01:11.430> looking<00:01:11.930> nest<00:01:12.930> box<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.920> but

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the best looking nest box you know but

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
the best looking nest box you know but
it's<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> serve<00:01:15.600> its<00:01:15.750> purpose<00:01:16.170> because

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's going to serve its purpose because

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's going to serve its purpose because
you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.119> too<00:01:18.180> perfect<00:01:18.920> there's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you can see it's not too perfect there's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.999 
you can see it's not too perfect there's
probably<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.659> holes<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.530> or

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
probably like you know holes in here or

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:23.690 
probably like you know holes in here or
gaps

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
gaps

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
gaps
I'm<00:01:24.390> sure<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:25.439> easy<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:26.070> how<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.490> like

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
I'm sure it's easy see how it's not like

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.200 
I'm sure it's easy see how it's not like
perfect<00:01:27.210> or<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.689> even<00:01:28.049> light<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.210> that's

this<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> felt<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.560> very<00:01:37.770> quick<00:01:38.100> very

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
this one I felt just very quick very

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.690 
this one I felt just very quick very
easy<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.600> didn't<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.040> didn't<00:01:41.340> square

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
easy I didn't you know I didn't square

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
easy I didn't you know I didn't square
or<00:01:42.090> make<00:01:42.240> sure<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:42.960> square<00:01:43.229> anything

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
or make sure that it's square anything

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
or make sure that it's square anything
it<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.700> cut<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> bell<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.110> see

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it just cut a bell so you can see

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
it just cut a bell so you can see
there's<00:01:46.500> light<00:01:46.799> shining<00:01:47.159> through<00:01:47.250> which

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there's light shining through which

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.980 
there's light shining through which
would<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.390> fine

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
would be fine

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.359 
would be fine
and<00:01:50.090> see<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.710> piece<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.040> stays

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and see so this little piece here stays

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.060 
and see so this little piece here stays
here<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.259> there<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.890> H

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
here so if they go in there the H

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.550 
here so if they go in there the H
doesn't<00:01:56.399> wear<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.259> actually<00:01:58.409> just

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
doesn't wear out so I can actually just

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620 
doesn't wear out so I can actually just
go<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.100> here<00:01:59.310> reach<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.820> grab<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.149> eggs<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
go in here reach in grab the eggs and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.350 
go in here reach in grab the eggs and
they<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.799> kick<00:02:02.070> any<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> batting<00:02:03.240> out

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
they don't kick any of the batting out

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
they don't kick any of the batting out
here<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.950> pretty<00:02:05.250> nice<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:07.320> it's

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
here so that's pretty nice and it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.600 
here so that's pretty nice and it's
gonna<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:07.950> inside<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> cage<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
gonna go inside the cage and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.540 
gonna go inside the cage and
that's<00:02:10.270> it
