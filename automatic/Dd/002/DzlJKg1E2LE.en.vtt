box for the broad saver before you can
start<00:02:38.910> flying<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.630> need<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> putt<00:02:40.860> some

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
start flying you need a putt some

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.880 
start flying you need a putt some
batters<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> mole<00:02:42.540> control<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.200> charge

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
batters in the mole control and charge

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.300 
batters in the mole control and charge
the<00:02:44.610> quad<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.440> put<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.130> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the quad you can put this in the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.840 
the quad you can put this in the
computer<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.270> dis<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.010> quadcopter

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
computer and dis this in the quadcopter

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.080 
computer and dis this in the quadcopter
so<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.420> can<00:02:51.630> charge<00:02:51.980> well<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.190> quadcopters

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
so it can charge well the quadcopters

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.390 
so it can charge well the quadcopters
charging<00:02:54.810> left<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> batteries<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
charging left for the batteries in the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.460 
charging left for the batteries in the
remote

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.740 

we<00:03:06.470> got<00:03:06.680> batteries<00:03:07.340> in<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.090> remote<00:03:08.540> is

quadcopter<00:03:41.450> um<00:03:42.020> okay<00:03:44.530> all<00:03:45.530> right<00:03:48.010> we'll<00:03:49.010> have

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
quadcopter um okay all right we'll have

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.110 
quadcopter um okay all right we'll have
to<00:03:49.310> see<00:03:49.520> when<00:03:50.480> all<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.140> light<00:03:51.380> finish

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
blinking then we can fly the quadcopter

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.990 
blinking then we can fly the quadcopter
I'm<00:03:56.750> ready<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.350> fly<00:03:57.590> but<00:03:57.860> be<00:03:58.280> careful<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.820> not

earth just put it a little throttle so
local<00:04:18.530> up<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:19.400> space<00:04:19.790> think<00:04:20.660> we're<00:04:20.840> all<00:04:20.959> ready

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.760 
local up to space think we're all ready
let's<00:04:21.709> take<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.790> outside

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.060 

higher

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.529 
do you think so that was your first
flying<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.289> it<00:04:38.409> loss<00:04:38.860> what<00:04:39.520> do<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.639> think<00:04:39.729> good

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
flying of it loss what do you think good

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:55.990 
flying of it loss what do you think good
there<00:04:41.289> are<00:04:41.379> you<00:04:41.469> ready<00:04:41.619> for<00:04:41.800> some<00:04:41.919> more<00:04:42.039> joy

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:08.080 

I<00:05:02.830> slide<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:03.860> but<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:06.280> crossed<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.790> it

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
I slide it but it I crossed it and it

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.440 
I slide it but it I crossed it and it
flipped<00:05:08.420> over<00:05:08.600> like<00:05:08.960> that<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.740> then<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
flipped over like that and then it the

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.560 
flipped over like that and then it the
light<00:05:11.660> stopped<00:05:11.990> blinking<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:12.950> was<00:05:13.130> dead

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
light stopped blinking and it was dead

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.360 
light stopped blinking and it was dead
that's<00:05:14.570> because<00:05:15.080> little<00:05:15.380> lights<00:05:15.980> are

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
that's because little lights are

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.850 
that's because little lights are
blinking<00:05:16.910> week<00:05:17.510> when<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.020> batteries<00:05:18.470> are<00:05:18.650> low

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
blinking week when the batteries are low

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.640 
blinking week when the batteries are low
we<00:05:19.280> have<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:19.940> charge<00:05:20.270> on<00:05:20.630> you<00:05:21.080> have<00:05:21.200> to<00:05:21.230> charge
