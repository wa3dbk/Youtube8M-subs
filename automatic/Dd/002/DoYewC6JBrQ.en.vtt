00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
hosts by doing that

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.550 
hosts by doing that
you<00:02:25.180> all<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.630> got<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.870> do<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.080> just<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.350> that

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
you all you got to do is just do that

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.320 
you all you got to do is just do that
and<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.310> doesn't<00:02:27.460> lag<00:02:27.730> anybody<00:02:28.150> but

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
and if it doesn't lag anybody but

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.590 
and if it doesn't lag anybody but

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
yourself then you're not the host so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.390 
yourself then you're not the host so
