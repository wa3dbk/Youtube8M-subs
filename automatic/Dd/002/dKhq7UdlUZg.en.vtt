now<00:00:07.569> that<00:00:07.720> we<00:00:07.839> cut<00:00:07.990> off<00:00:08.020> the<00:00:08.260> rear<00:00:08.469> of<00:00:08.530> the<00:00:08.650> car

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
now that we cut off the rear of the car

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.520 
now that we cut off the rear of the car
we<00:00:09.730> can<00:00:09.760> actually<00:00:10.300> see<00:00:10.570> what<00:00:10.809> we<00:00:10.929> have<00:00:11.080> left<00:00:11.349> of

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
we can actually see what we have left of

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.870 
we can actually see what we have left of
it

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
it

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.700

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 
we just trimmed out the whole rear

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.159 
we just trimmed out the whole rear
quarter<00:00:15.129> section<00:00:15.519> of<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.730> car<00:00:15.910> and<00:00:16.570> took<00:00:17.020> it

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:17.169 
quarter section of the car and took it

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.580 
quarter section of the car and took it
off<00:00:17.290> all<00:00:17.529> in<00:00:17.680> one<00:00:17.860> shot<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:19.600> put<00:00:19.810> it<00:00:19.900> up<00:00:20.050> on<00:00:20.230> the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
off all in one shot we put it up on the

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.220 
off all in one shot we put it up on the
seat<00:00:21.369> board<00:00:21.670> to<00:00:22.060> mock<00:00:22.240> it<00:00:22.420> up<00:00:22.510> to<00:00:22.689> see<00:00:22.869> what<00:00:23.109> we

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
seat board to mock it up to see what we

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.200 
seat board to mock it up to see what we
actually<00:00:23.260> have<00:00:23.800> to<00:00:23.830> do<00:00:24.130> with<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.430> car<00:00:24.640> so<00:00:25.060> now

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
actually have to do with the car so now

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.120 
actually have to do with the car so now
that<00:00:25.269> we<00:00:25.449> chose<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.720> rear<00:00:26.080> a<00:00:26.109> rear<00:00:26.590> section<00:00:27.070> of

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
that we chose to rear a rear section of

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.570 
that we chose to rear a rear section of
the<00:00:27.189> Mercedes<00:00:27.760> on<00:00:27.939> to<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.300> z4<00:00:28.750> we<00:00:28.929> we<00:00:29.859> just<00:00:30.070> put

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
the Mercedes on to the z4 we we just put

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.280 
the Mercedes on to the z4 we we just put
it<00:00:30.670> on<00:00:30.760> there<00:00:31.000> just<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.359> see<00:00:31.599> actually<00:00:32.110> what

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
it on there just to see actually what

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.930 
it on there just to see actually what
kind<00:00:32.470> of<00:00:32.590> fabrication<00:00:33.040> where<00:00:33.340> we<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:33.760> do

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
kind of fabrication where we have to do

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.270 
kind of fabrication where we have to do
obviously<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:35.199> Mercedes<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:35.860> lot<00:00:36.100> longer

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
obviously the Mercedes is a lot longer

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.210 
obviously the Mercedes is a lot longer
than<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.870> said<00:00:38.110> but<00:00:38.350> look<00:00:38.620> we're<00:00:38.860> gonna<00:00:38.979> end

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
than the said but look we're gonna end

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.950 
than the said but look we're gonna end
up<00:00:39.280> doing<00:00:39.430> have<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.909> lengthen<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.570> trunk<00:00:40.839> a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
up doing have to lengthen the trunk a

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.060 
up doing have to lengthen the trunk a
little<00:00:41.229> short<00:00:41.530> in<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.860> body<00:00:43.769> still<00:00:44.769> we<00:00:44.949> have

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
little short in the body still we have

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.590 
little short in the body still we have
to<00:00:45.190> you<00:00:45.430> know<00:00:45.460> follow<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:45.940> proportions<00:00:46.510> a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
to you know follow the proportions a

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.969 
to you know follow the proportions a
little<00:00:46.809> bit<00:00:46.930> we<00:00:47.049> don't<00:00:47.080> want<00:00:47.409> the<00:00:47.530> car<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.860> look

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
little bit we don't want the car to look

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.359 
little bit we don't want the car to look
too<00:00:48.159> stubby<00:00:48.580> so<00:00:48.820> we<00:00:49.000> yeah<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:50.350> know<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:50.589> all

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
that's fun look yeah I said that for an

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.390 
that's fun look yeah I said that for an
z4<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.220> all<00:01:12.790> in<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.090> same<00:01:13.330> paragraph<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:15.250> got

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
z4 and all in the same paragraph we got

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.920 
z4 and all in the same paragraph we got
new<00:01:15.550> quarter<00:01:15.850> panels<00:01:16.210> coming<00:01:16.420> in<00:01:16.630> from<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
new quarter panels coming in from the

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.180 
new quarter panels coming in from the
states<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.600> couple<00:01:19.810> other<00:01:20.230> body<00:01:20.800> parts

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
states and a couple other body parts

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.330 
states and a couple other body parts
which<00:01:21.400> we're<00:01:22.060> gonna<00:01:22.120> have<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.510> modify<00:01:22.810> but<00:01:23.710> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
which we're gonna have to modify but you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.180 
which we're gonna have to modify but you
know<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.640> biggest<00:01:25.000> part<00:01:25.330> of<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:27.010> rear

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
know the biggest part of it is the rear

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.590 
know the biggest part of it is the rear
trunk<00:01:27.460> section<00:01:27.730> there's<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.120> big<00:01:28.360> space

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
trunk section there's a big space

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.990 
trunk section there's a big space
between<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.320> Mercedes<00:01:29.980> and<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.490> set<00:01:30.700> forth

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
between the Mercedes and the set forth

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.330 
between the Mercedes and the set forth
so<00:01:31.600> all<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.260> section<00:01:32.620> is<00:01:32.770> either<00:01:32.950> gonna<00:01:33.159> have

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
so all this section is either gonna have

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.520 
so all this section is either gonna have
to<00:01:33.400> be<00:01:33.640> fabricated<00:01:33.909> where<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:35.020> Mercedes<00:01:35.500> a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
to be fabricated where the Mercedes a

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.890 
to be fabricated where the Mercedes a
little<00:01:35.830> shorter<00:01:36.220> or<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.909> BMW<00:01:37.480> is<00:01:37.540> a<00:01:37.600> little

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
little shorter or the BMW is a little

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.550 
little shorter or the BMW is a little
bit<00:01:38.050> longer<00:01:38.260> so<00:01:39.120> now<00:01:40.120> that<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.870> rear<00:01:41.080> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
bit longer so now that the the rear the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.500 
bit longer so now that the the rear the
rear<00:01:41.590> sections<00:01:42.159> cut<00:01:42.400> off<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.820> just<00:01:43.030> mocked<00:01:43.300> up

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
rear sections cut off and just mocked up

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.000 
rear sections cut off and just mocked up
we're<00:01:44.110> going<00:01:44.260> to<00:01:44.320> go<00:01:44.409> ahead<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.800> start

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
we're going to go ahead and start

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.280 
we're going to go ahead and start
cutting<00:01:45.159> off<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.670> front<00:01:45.909> clip<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.360> do<00:01:47.170> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
cutting off the front clip to do the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:02:20.710 
cutting off the front clip to do the
same<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:47.710> so<00:01:48.280> let's<00:01:48.490> go<00:01:48.640> ahead<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:49.000> start

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.180 

most<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.960> cuttings<00:02:22.260> done<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:22.710> on<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
most of the cuttings done now on the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.250 
most of the cuttings done now on the
front<00:02:23.670> clip<00:02:23.940> we've<00:02:24.450> cut<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:24.960> close<00:02:25.230> as

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
front clip we've cut it as close as

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.410 
front clip we've cut it as close as
possible<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:26.010> keep<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.520> much<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:26.910> original

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
possible to keep as much as original

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.690 
possible to keep as much as original
body<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.840> possible<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.340> trimmed<00:02:29.580> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
body as possible so we just trimmed it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.550 
body as possible so we just trimmed it
out<00:02:29.820> without<00:02:30.570> cutting<00:02:30.930> through<00:02:31.290> too<00:02:31.470> many

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
out without cutting through too many

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.950 
out without cutting through too many
layers<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> skin<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.790> now<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.540> easily

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
layers of the skin and now we can easily

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:43.910 
layers of the skin and now we can easily
just<00:02:34.170> start<00:02:34.620> peeling<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.100> car<00:02:35.340> away<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
just start peeling the car away and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:03:14.210 
just start peeling the car away and
bring<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.280> way

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.260 

we're<00:03:15.220> gonna<00:03:15.310> have<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:15.610> do<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.820> little<00:03:16.060> more

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
we're gonna have to do a little more

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.860 
we're gonna have to do a little more
trimming<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.080> front<00:03:17.620> clip<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:19.420> scoot<00:03:19.720> it

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
trimming in the front clip just scoot it

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.820 
trimming in the front clip just scoot it
back

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.520 

so<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:23.550> we<00:03:23.610> just<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.570> know<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:24.720> just<00:03:25.050> put<00:03:25.410> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
so now we just you know we just put the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.230 
so now we just you know we just put the
fun<00:03:25.710> clip<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.130> just<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.520> see<00:03:26.730> what<00:03:26.970> we're<00:03:27.150> gonna

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
fun clip on just to see what we're gonna

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.120 
fun clip on just to see what we're gonna
have<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.540> modify<00:03:27.990> to<00:03:28.170> make<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.650> fit<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.890> lot

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
have to modify to make it fit a lot

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.000 
have to modify to make it fit a lot
nicer<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.980> can<00:03:32.130> start<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.550> see<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:34.010> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
nicer you can start to see that the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.640 
nicer you can start to see that the
whole<00:03:35.190> idea<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.550> using<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.660> newer<00:03:36.840> car<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.410> a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
whole idea of using a newer car and a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.780 
whole idea of using a newer car and a
classic<00:03:38.100> body<00:03:38.310> over<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> top<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.120> it

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
classic body over the top of it

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.490 
classic body over the top of it
but<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.180> know<00:03:42.270> this<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.630> just<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> beginning

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
but you know this is just the beginning

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:55.370 
but you know this is just the beginning
of<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.680> work<00:03:53.360> so<00:03:54.360> we<00:03:54.480> got<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.750> skins<00:03:55.020> on<00:03:55.230> we

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
of the work so we got the skins on we

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.380 
of the work so we got the skins on we
chose<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> BMW<00:03:56.310> because<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.910> wheelbase<00:03:57.360> of

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
chose a BMW because of the wheelbase of

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.840 
chose a BMW because of the wheelbase of
the<00:03:57.960> Mercedes<00:03:58.470> -<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.710> BMW<00:03:59.310> was<00:03:59.490> almost

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
the Mercedes - the BMW was almost

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.100 
the Mercedes - the BMW was almost
similar<00:04:00.030> there's<00:04:00.390> only<00:04:00.540> about<00:04:00.750> one

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
similar there's only about one

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.740 
similar there's only about one
centimeter<00:04:01.350> difference<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:03.300> wheelbase

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
centimeter difference so the wheelbase

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.280 
centimeter difference so the wheelbase
the<00:04:04.200> width<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.920> windshield<00:04:05.370> proportion

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
the width the windshield proportion

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.810 
the width the windshield proportion
there<00:04:07.290> they're<00:04:07.770> all<00:04:07.890> relatively<00:04:08.610> pretty

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
there they're all relatively pretty

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.570 
there they're all relatively pretty
close<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.450> know<00:04:10.410> what<00:04:10.920> we'll<00:04:11.100> do<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.460> start

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
close so know what we'll do is start

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.759 
close so know what we'll do is start
fitting<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.600> body<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.790> set<00:04:15.000> for

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
fitting the body to the set for

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.080 
fitting the body to the set for
everything<00:04:16.769> on<00:04:16.950> those<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.340> 400<00:04:17.700> remain

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
everything on those that 400 remain

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.699 
everything on those that 400 remain
factory<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.720> wheelbase<00:04:19.049> engine<00:04:19.560> the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
factory the wheelbase engine the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.590 
factory the wheelbase engine the
transmission<00:04:19.739> everything<00:04:20.670> down<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.510> the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
transmission everything down to the

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.080 
transmission everything down to the
wiring<00:04:21.810> would<00:04:22.019> remain<00:04:22.680> exactly<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.340> same<00:04:23.640> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
wiring would remain exactly the same the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.270 
wiring would remain exactly the same the
only<00:04:24.150> thing<00:04:24.360> we're<00:04:24.660> going<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:24.990> do<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.410> fit<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
only thing we're going to do is fit the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:56.510 
only thing we're going to do is fit the
body<00:04:26.610> skins<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.080> Tuesdays<00:04:28.650> at<00:04:28.830> 4:00

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
see you next time when we're cutting

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.430 
see you next time when we're cutting
