00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.190
 The Civic Series 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.190
 Third full model change 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.599
 Visit to Japan 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.140
 With 3-door hatchback 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.380
 4-door sedan 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.960
 Live door shuttle 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 And we will face this two-stroke war 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.110
 With city and race 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.470
 One country and two examples that mean so 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 I asked to take it to the hospital since then 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 The competition with the Civic became stronger in the afternoon 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.790
 The mask looks similar 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.110
 cp1 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.910
 Play a good move favor 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.910
 Vo &amp; ride snowstorm that went in November 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 Canopy glass that brings an overwhelming sense of openness 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.700
 For the sake of 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.330
 It was a feature of only x 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.720
 The view from the driver's seat is now 315 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.650
 Since September 1990 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.650
 Appeared as a new Honda sports spirit 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.149
 Wear 1.6 liters 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.149
 Finally the final stage 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.830
 In a unit that was already installed in pda and was popular 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.370
 The biggest point is 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.180
 Honda's unique variable valve timing and lift mechanism 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.180
 It continued 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.620
 Use special paper 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.300
 Low rotation area long root 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.300
 I want to turn off the valve lift amount and the opening timing 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.100
 There are also cases where it is compatible with ease of handling and amazing leather 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.590
 How much new with spursengine 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.360
 sir 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.860
 The highest output is 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.750
 At 160 horsepower equivalent to 100 horsepower per liter 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.150
 It was no exaggeration to say that the engine 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.370
 It is said that this Baba is canceled 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.320
 Tire size is 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.450
 While there is until 1956 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.160
 Special type disc brake is also equipped 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.080
 Srina domestic setting using discus coupling is set 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.749
 The run is a word of the last time 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:14.899
 Senator is gone and marked 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:16.089
