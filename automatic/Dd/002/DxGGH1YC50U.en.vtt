tape and pull out a measure out like
that<00:00:18.560> just<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.680> short<00:00:19.920> amount<00:00:22.160> in<00:00:23.689> order<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> fit

that just a short amount in order to fit

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.009 
that just a short amount in order to fit
the<00:00:25.260> length<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:26.570> label<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.869> says

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the length of your label here that says

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.730 
the length of your label here that says
Mac<00:00:28.230> 129<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:30.050> I'm<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> cut<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.619> in

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
Mac 129 so I'm just going to cut it in

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.459 
Mac 129 so I'm just going to cut it in
half<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.180> snip<00:00:33.390> halfway<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> pull<00:00:34.250> and

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
half and we snip halfway then I pull and

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
half and we snip halfway then I pull and
the<00:00:37.469> reason<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.770> we're<00:00:37.980> doing<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the reason that we're doing this is to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.840 
the reason that we're doing this is to
line<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.629> side<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:41.629> underneath<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.850> label

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
line the side just underneath the label

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.940 
line the side just underneath the label
so<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.899> when<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.230> apply<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> nail-polish

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so that when we apply the nail-polish

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.330 
so that when we apply the nail-polish
topcoat<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:49.649> gives<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> crisp<00:00:50.219> edge<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> reason

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
topcoat it gives a crisp edge the reason

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.799 
topcoat it gives a crisp edge the reason
that<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.579> doing<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.390> sealing<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that we're doing this and sealing it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.959 
that we're doing this and sealing it
with<00:00:54.840> top<00:00:55.110> coat<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.890> these<00:00:56.460> labels

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
with top coat is because these labels

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.720 
with top coat is because these labels
and<00:00:57.420> numbers<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.590> fade<00:00:58.949> over<00:00:59.190> time<00:01:01.730> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and numbers just fade over time the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.250 
and numbers just fade over time the
brush<00:01:02.910> handle<00:01:03.239> itself<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> black<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
brush handle itself is black and that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
brush handle itself is black and that
won't<00:01:04.470> fade<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.760> passed<00:01:06.270> on

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
won't fade but this is just passed on

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.380 
won't fade but this is just passed on
with<00:01:07.409> who<00:01:07.619> knows<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:09.030> we're<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.180> going

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
with who knows what so we're just going

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.700 
with who knows what so we're just going
to<00:01:09.420> seal<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> around<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> edge<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
to seal this around the edge of the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
to seal this around the edge of the
color<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.670> label<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
color of the label so that it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
color of the label so that it's
completely<00:01:14.420> pressed<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:17.490> way<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
completely pressed down that way the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.830 
completely pressed down that way the
nail<00:01:18.119> polish<00:01:18.390> won't<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:18.689> underneath<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:20.840> then

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
nail polish won't go underneath it then

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.940 
nail polish won't go underneath it then
just<00:01:22.020> take<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.770> more<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.950> you're

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
with your topcoat wipe off the excess

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.500 
with your topcoat wipe off the excess
into<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.459> bottle<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.640> with<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.239> side<00:02:30.390> that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
into the bottle and with the side that

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.090 
into the bottle and with the side that
you<00:02:30.600> didn't<00:02:30.870> wipe<00:02:30.989> down<00:02:31.260> you're<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.830> going

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
you didn't wipe down you're just going

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.660 
you didn't wipe down you're just going
to<00:02:32.660> apply<00:02:33.660> it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.570 

make<00:02:41.390> sure<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:41.900> fill<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:45.400> every<00:02:46.400> line

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
make sure that you fill in every line

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.420 
make sure that you fill in every line
now<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.989> added<00:02:51.440> too<00:02:51.709> much<00:02:51.739> around<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.190> corner

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
now I added too much around that corner

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.540 
now I added too much around that corner
so<00:02:53.440> I'm<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.770> use<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> q-tip<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.489> I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.850 
to do is wait for this to dry I'm also
going<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.760> be<00:03:16.880> doing<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.450> my<00:03:17.630> 134<00:03:18.500> which<00:03:18.739> I

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
going to be doing this to my 134 which I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.390 
going to be doing this to my 134 which I
just<00:03:19.069> got<00:03:20.260> because<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.350> really<00:03:21.799> do<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.100> want

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
just got because I really do not want

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.460 
just got because I really do not want
these<00:03:22.640> numbers<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.390> fade<00:03:25.360> so<00:03:26.360> once<00:03:26.840> again<00:03:26.959> I've

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
these numbers to fade so once again I've

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.199 
these numbers to fade so once again I've
already<00:03:27.769> taped<00:03:28.069> it<00:03:28.220> down<00:03:28.400> before<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.970> made<00:03:29.120> the

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
already taped it down before I made the

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:38.170 
already taped it down before I made the
video<00:03:31.480> wipe<00:03:32.480> off<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.690> excess<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.970> just

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
video wipe off that excess and just

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.460 
video wipe off that excess and just
apply

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.310 

over<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.280> area<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:49.030> it's<00:03:49.390> also<00:03:49.630> possible<00:03:49.990> to

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
over this area now it's also possible to

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.860 
over this area now it's also possible to
do<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.710> without<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.130> top<00:03:51.520> coat<00:03:51.820> or<00:03:52.540> without

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
do this without the top coat or without

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.570 
do this without the top coat or without
the<00:03:53.020> tape<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:54.160> is<00:03:54.280> what<00:03:54.400> I've<00:03:54.490> been

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
the tape and this is what I've been

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.810 
the tape and this is what I've been
doing<00:03:54.730> recently<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.620> just<00:03:57.340> wanted<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.640> make

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
doing recently but I just wanted to make

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.460 
doing recently but I just wanted to make
it<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.000> little<00:03:58.180> bit<00:03:58.360> cleaner<00:03:58.630> because<00:03:58.960> before

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
it a little bit cleaner because before

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.470 
it a little bit cleaner because before
when<00:03:59.830> I<00:03:59.860> would<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.340> just<00:04:00.490> run<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.060> top<00:04:01.270> coat

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
when I would do is just run the top coat

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.240 
when I would do is just run the top coat
right<00:04:01.720> over<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.830> would<00:04:02.950> get<00:04:03.040> this

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
right over it and you would get this

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.700 
right over it and you would get this
messy<00:04:03.910> edge<00:04:04.240> and<00:04:04.990> it<00:04:05.050> just<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.410> didn't<00:04:05.650> look

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
messy edge and it just it didn't look

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.170 
messy edge and it just it didn't look
even<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.430> was<00:04:06.550> kind<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.790> like<00:04:06.910> gross

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
even and it was kind of like gross

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.870 
even and it was kind of like gross
looking<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.950> I<00:04:08.980> wanted<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.370> clean<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.700> up<00:04:09.790> a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
looking so I wanted to clean it up a

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.370 
looking so I wanted to clean it up a
little<00:04:09.910> bit<00:04:10.210> so<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.390> have<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> great<00:04:10.960> idea<00:04:10.990> of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
little bit so I have a great idea of

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.080 
little bit so I have a great idea of
applying<00:04:11.500> tape<00:04:12.780> that's<00:04:13.780> what<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.930> do<00:04:14.020> now<00:04:15.090> so

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
applying tape that's what I do now so

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.979 
applying tape that's what I do now so
you're<00:04:16.209> basically<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.540> going<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.840> wait<00:04:16.959> for

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
you're basically just going to wait for

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.220 
you're basically just going to wait for
this<00:04:17.170> to<00:04:17.230> dry<00:04:17.350> which<00:04:17.859> should<00:04:18.070> be<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:18.220> around

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
this to dry which should be in around

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.720 
this to dry which should be in around
five<00:04:20.230> minutes<00:04:20.739> or<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.130> but<00:04:21.370> I'm<00:04:21.430> going<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.609> make

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
five minutes or so but I'm going to make

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.460 
five minutes or so but I'm going to make
it<00:04:21.850> 10<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.390> then<00:04:22.720> I'll<00:04:22.840> get<00:04:22.930> back<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.350> and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
it 10 and then I'll get back to you and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.780 
it 10 and then I'll get back to you and
show<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:23.650> what<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:23.890> looks<00:04:23.920> like

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.060 

now<00:04:27.780> I've<00:04:27.930> waited<00:04:28.110> long<00:04:28.230> enough<00:04:28.380> right<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.830> dry

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
now I've waited long enough right to dry

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.220 
now I've waited long enough right to dry
so<00:04:29.820> we're<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.150> going<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.510> take<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.870> edges<00:04:31.200> of

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
so we're just going to take the edges of

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.690 
so we're just going to take the edges of
the<00:04:31.350> tape<00:04:32.930> go<00:04:33.930> ahead<00:04:34.200> and<00:04:34.440> peel<00:04:34.830> off<00:04:35.190> around

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
the tape go ahead and peel off around

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.770 
the tape go ahead and peel off around
the<00:04:35.940> edge<00:04:37.880> carefully<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.800> there's<00:04:40.980> that<00:04:41.160> oh

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
the edge carefully so there's that oh

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:51.620 
the edge carefully so there's that oh
don't<00:04:42.780> ruin<00:04:42.930> my<00:04:43.080> nails<00:04:43.290> oh<00:04:45.350> here's<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:50.630> I'm

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
don't ruin my nails oh here's that I'm

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.000 
don't ruin my nails oh here's that I'm
very<00:04:51.780> careful<00:04:52.050> with<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:52.470> because<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:52.770> really

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
very careful with this because I really

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.350 
very careful with this because I really
don't<00:04:53.160> want<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.340> scratch<00:04:53.520> my<00:04:53.730> brush<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.330> I'm

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
don't want to scratch my brush and I'm

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.290 
don't want to scratch my brush and I'm
sure<00:04:54.540> that's<00:04:54.720> not<00:04:54.900> really<00:04:55.350> likely<00:04:55.590> but<00:04:56.300> you

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
sure that's not really likely but you
