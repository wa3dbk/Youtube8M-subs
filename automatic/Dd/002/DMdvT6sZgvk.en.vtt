it's just a regular sheet napkin it's
one<00:00:21.619> big<00:00:21.859> piece<00:00:22.180> square<00:00:23.180> folded<00:00:23.800> so<00:00:24.800> I<00:00:25.130> take

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
one big piece square folded so I take

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.060 
one big piece square folded so I take
the<00:00:28.369> folded<00:00:28.910> edge<00:00:29.240> right<00:00:29.810> here<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:30.740> put

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
the folded edge right here and I put

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.759 
the folded edge right here and I put
this<00:00:31.279> towards<00:00:31.580> me<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.269> this<00:00:32.900> part<00:00:33.230> these<00:00:33.530> two

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
this towards me and this part these two

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.940 
this towards me and this part these two
edges<00:00:34.309> are<00:00:34.340> for<00:00:34.699> folded<00:00:35.449> these<00:00:35.930> all<00:00:36.320> these<00:00:36.680> up

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
edges are for folded these all these up

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.660 
edges are for folded these all these up
both<00:00:37.370> edges<00:00:38.030> are<00:00:38.180> not<00:00:38.450> folded<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.320> I<00:00:39.620> take<00:00:40.489> and

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
both edges are not folded so I take and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:49.619 
both edges are not folded so I take and
I<00:00:40.730> fold<00:00:41.000> these<00:00:41.180> two<00:00:41.239> folded<00:00:41.899> edges<00:00:42.190> together

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.240 

you<00:00:50.629> do<00:00:50.780> that<00:00:50.960> on<00:00:51.079> both<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.469> these<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:52.039> is<00:00:52.100> a

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
you do that on both of these this is a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.490 
you do that on both of these this is a
folded<00:00:52.670> edge<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:53.149> is<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.329> folded<00:00:53.780> edge<00:00:53.989> so

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
folded edge and this is a folded edge so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.860 
folded edge and this is a folded edge so
I'm<00:00:54.590> going<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.800> fold<00:00:55.280> those<00:00:55.520> together<00:00:56.829> and

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
I'm going to fold those together and

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.969 
I'm going to fold those together and
then<00:00:59.870> I'm<00:01:00.170> going<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.440> cut<00:01:00.770> a<00:01:00.949> petal<00:01:01.430> type<00:01:03.520> shape

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
then I'm going to cut a petal type shape

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:24.999 
then I'm going to cut a petal type shape
out<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.250> this

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.039 

I<00:01:25.039> kind<00:01:25.729> of<00:01:25.789> like<00:01:25.969> to<00:01:26.119> have<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.450> little<00:01:26.630> spot

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
I kind of like to have that little spot

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.340 
I kind of like to have that little spot
cuz<00:01:27.289> you<00:01:27.380> have<00:01:30.520> okay<00:01:31.990> kinda<00:01:32.990> looks<00:01:33.140> like<00:01:33.200> an

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
cuz you have okay kinda looks like an

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.539 
cuz you have okay kinda looks like an
ice-cream<00:01:33.740> cone<00:01:38.409> so<00:01:39.409> I'll<00:01:39.590> do<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:39.950> one

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
ice-cream cone so I'll do this one

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.289 
ice-cream cone so I'll do this one
I<00:01:42.039> hold<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.159> folded<00:01:43.610> edge<00:01:44.289> and<00:01:45.289> I<00:01:45.530> go<00:01:45.710> around

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
I hold the folded edge and I go around

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:57.910 
I hold the folded edge and I go around
actually<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:47.569> can<00:01:47.780> hold<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.170> as<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.409> pattern<00:01:56.920> go

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
actually I can hold this as a pattern go

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:06.339 
actually I can hold this as a pattern go
all<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.250> way<00:01:58.280> around<00:02:04.599> and<00:02:05.599> at<00:02:05.869> this<00:02:05.990> point

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
all the way around and at this point

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.389 
all the way around and at this point
you're<00:02:07.280> going<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.490> open<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.909> up<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.979> have<00:02:10.220> a

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
you're going to open it up you have a

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:22.120 
you're going to open it up you have a
bunch<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.729> hearts

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.400 

this<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.270> did<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.540> cut<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:23.960> I'll

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
this one I did you cut like that I'll

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.310 
this one I did you cut like that I'll
cut<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.830> from<00:02:25.040> I've<00:02:25.280> got<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.930> cut<00:02:27.170> this

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
cut this from I've got to just cut this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.600 
cut this from I've got to just cut this
in<00:02:27.500> half<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:32.030> you<00:02:32.060> just<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.930> bunch<00:02:33.170> of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
in half so you just have a bunch of

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.520 
in half so you just have a bunch of
hearts<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:40.730> these<00:02:40.850> hearts<00:02:41.240> just<00:02:41.870> about<00:02:42.320> an

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
hearts and up these hearts just about an

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.120 
hearts and up these hearts just about an
inch<00:02:42.740> I'm<00:02:43.040> going<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.250> cut<00:02:43.430> about<00:02:43.460> an<00:02:43.730> inch

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
inch I'm going to cut about an inch

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.980 
inch I'm going to cut about an inch
maybe<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.250> half<00:02:46.520> an<00:02:46.670> inch<00:02:48.460> these<00:02:49.460> in<00:02:50.120> half<00:02:50.390> again

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
maybe a half an inch these in half again

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:07.980 
maybe a half an inch these in half again
so<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.670> bunch<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.760> petals

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.910 

I<00:03:09.510> kind<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.600> stack<00:03:10.930> them<00:03:11.110> together<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.740> can

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
I kind of stack them together and I can

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.650 
I kind of stack them together and I can
cut<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:13.200> punch<00:03:15.930> cut<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:18.480> stack<00:03:19.480> them

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
cut the punch cut and stack them

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.390 
cut the punch cut and stack them
together<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.230> make<00:03:20.530> time<00:03:20.800> make<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.160> go<00:03:21.280> by

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
together and make time make it go by

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.610 
together and make time make it go by
faster<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:21.970> doesn't<00:03:22.270> have<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.870> totally

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
faster it doesn't have to be a totally

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.610 
faster it doesn't have to be a totally
accurate<00:03:23.740> just<00:03:24.220> about<00:03:24.700> an<00:03:24.850> inch<00:03:25.380> why<00:03:26.380> didn't

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
accurate just about an inch why didn't

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.790 
accurate just about an inch why didn't
you<00:03:26.680> get<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:28.950> then<00:03:29.950> with<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> pin<00:03:31.590> each<00:03:32.590> one

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
you get it and then with a pin each one

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.620 
you get it and then with a pin each one
of<00:03:32.890> these<00:03:32.980> petals<00:03:33.250> I'm<00:03:34.090> going<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.390> start

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
of these petals I'm going to start

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:44.880 
of these petals I'm going to start
curling<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:37.830> squishing<00:03:40.890> curl<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:43.890> squish

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
curling and squishing curl and squish

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.370 
curling and squishing curl and squish
and<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:47.260> see<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.620> get<00:03:47.770> you're<00:03:48.900> you're<00:03:49.900> curled

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
and you see you get you're you're curled

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.460 
and you see you get you're you're curled
petals<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.510> I'm<00:03:52.570> going<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.780> take<00:03:52.990> and<00:03:53.200> do<00:03:53.290> this

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
petals so I'm going to take and do this

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.140 
petals so I'm going to take and do this
on<00:03:53.680> all<00:03:53.950> of<00:03:54.190> them<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:55.450> will<00:03:55.660> be<00:03:55.690> back<00:03:57.150> okay

on all of them and I will be back okay
so<00:03:58.210> I'm<00:03:58.390> back<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.780> have<00:03:59.020> all<00:03:59.260> my<00:03:59.290> petals<00:03:59.890> curled

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
so I'm back I have all my petals curled

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.910 
so I'm back I have all my petals curled
and<00:04:01.030> as<00:04:01.600> I'm<00:04:01.780> putting<00:04:01.990> my<00:04:02.230> rows<00:04:02.440> together<00:04:02.830> I

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
and as I'm putting my rows together I

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.520
