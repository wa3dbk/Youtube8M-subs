00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
impressions of it it actually has a nice
weight<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.740> doesn't<00:01:47.280> feel<00:01:47.399> too

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

weight to it it doesn't feel too
terribly<00:01:48.090> heavy

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.859 

okay<00:02:01.310> this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> base<00:02:03.000> jump<00:02:03.360> where<00:02:03.540> BJ

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
okay this is the base jump where BJ

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.920 
okay this is the base jump where BJ
instead<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> PJ<00:02:04.790> version<00:02:05.930> difference

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
instead of the PJ version difference
