00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.109
 no , I didn't think so at the last 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.910
 because we find there too few 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.110
 created opportunities for 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 but actually she must have of course 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.809
 is already the third as the fourth time that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.160
 the year before the injury time 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.440
 time is happily happening 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 no the weak roar the environment is right 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.199
 whatever I grimace 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.699
 and from that I the weather and nature 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.309
 coin happy happy for the team 3 point 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.180
 caught and yes it is of course a whole 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.730
 very 5 ounces 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.809
 and what did you think about vitesse today 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.699
 You can imagine that we are very good 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.989
 started with a great goal from 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.430
 unscrew 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 we had that with the initiative too 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.619
 and an opponent who fell far back 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.229
 among those who were constantly in possession of the ball 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.450
 I thought it was careless about a save 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.619
 possession and every time on the counter 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.930
 with that you played them come then 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.340
 dangerous end up although I equalize 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.650
 came to the first time she was with Piet 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.439
 came for the goal so it wasn't that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 he lowered or that we were 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.070
 finally no first half jeffers ten 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.740
 minutes knew who reboot sharp in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.979
 media classy grabs it am next to the yes 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.439
 your love go again through focus we 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.170
 a year so what yes it is now again 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 learn big town and butts I am a half 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.720
 off and then i just got the check 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 was who he was controlling the game in 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.340
 indiana who score was kind of but within 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 Media suitable drs is an interested 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.430
 Been winter that how 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.049
 you come out few weeks you do not have to 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.369
 played the echie then it is actually 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.210
 but one thing important that you just 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.860
 are 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.530
 knocking has come true for three 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.470
 points 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.340
 in the end , less point that you caught 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.720
 the weather when he played hooves 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.200
 I also have a fight against Wolfsburg 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.090
 a 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.709
 the go even him well this is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.800
 then you say another one 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.760
 yes today have a good pot 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.470
 closed very first hall where the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.569
 footballers sitting naturally was different 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.550
 put its as a means pressing could the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.440
 wall mother footballer but ultimately 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.270
 pick up that point during earth 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.650
 did more and saw peace in ontario 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.940
 plow 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.410
 well you see how that opponent 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.819
 so does not play what they normally do 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.890
 want to do pressure for turning off and agree 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.390
 the we play very dominant in possession 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.030
 we had tinis that were dominant 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.300
 parade the ball but you have to watch out for it 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.220
 the counter so you have to be in a wat 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.540
 faster pace player you need more accurate 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.910
 be in possession of the ball if they lose the ball 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.560
 so you must be good we say 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.880
 that we had a phase of in the 2nd half 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.560
 fifteen minutes or so I start very well 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.480
 well where we were at a high pace 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.540
 played and then you see that it is 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.980
 difficult rain and after that he got hit 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.569
 we hope that industry will lose some 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.190
 were we then the parent party 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.260
 I thought it would be an open competition 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.580
 where the spaces were large and where it 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.370
 in a row with both sides could of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.209
 yes because a young got to day or it 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.450
 check cardigan 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.820

 We now pointer who won the game what 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.980
 family that is game for dbo in the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.840
