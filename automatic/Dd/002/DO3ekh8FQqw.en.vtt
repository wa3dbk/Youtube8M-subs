power pellets as you collect them you

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.300 
power pellets as you collect them you
might<00:02:40.140> even<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.380> call<00:02:40.680> them<00:02:40.830> dots<00:02:41.010> but

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
might even just call them dots but

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.430 
might even just call them dots but
anyway<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.540> collect<00:02:42.690> power<00:02:42.989> pellets<00:02:43.350> I've

anyway as you collect power pellets I've

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.340 
anyway as you collect power pellets I've
got<00:02:43.590> six<00:02:43.860> up<00:02:44.010> at<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> top<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:45.420> allows<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.049> to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
got six up at the top it allows you to

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.830 
got six up at the top it allows you to
drive<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> little<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.370> faster<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.120> if<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.690> run

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
into an enemy you'll lose one so it's an

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.550 
into an enemy you'll lose one so it's an
incentive<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.090> bang<00:02:54.390> around<00:02:54.720> too<00:02:54.989> much<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
incentive not to bang around too much I

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.370 
incentive not to bang around too much I
don't<00:02:56.160> know<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.459> really<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:57.120> or<00:02:57.239> not

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
don't know if I really like that or not

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.270 
don't know if I really like that or not
but<00:02:58.380> that's<00:02:58.709> okay

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
but that's okay

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.800 
but that's okay
so<00:02:59.640> right<00:02:59.790> now<00:02:59.880> I've<00:03:00.000> activated<00:03:00.299> an<00:03:00.540> item

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
so right now I've activated an item

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.199 
so right now I've activated an item
called<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.140> katamari<00:03:01.560> ball<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.030> just

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
called the katamari ball you can just

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.550

let<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.420> hover<00:03:03.480> around<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.290> anyone

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
let it hover around you and if anyone

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.210 
let it hover around you and if anyone
bumps<00:03:04.830> into<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.040> they'll<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.400> hit<00:03:05.549> like<00:03:05.930> that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
bumps into you they'll get hit like that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.170 
bumps into you they'll get hit like that
or<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.430> shoot<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:08.849> at<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.120> enemy<00:03:11.180> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
or you can shoot it out at the enemy the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.640 
or you can shoot it out at the enemy the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
graphics are pretty good the framerate

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.949

is<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.370> little<00:03:14.609> bit<00:03:14.730> lower<00:03:14.970> than<00:03:15.090> ideal

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
is just a little bit lower than ideal

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.640 
is just a little bit lower than ideal
but<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:17.220> game<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.519> still<00:03:17.609> very<00:03:18.000> playable<00:03:18.650> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
but the game is still very playable it

but the game is still very playable it
actually<00:03:20.280> looks<00:03:20.519> much<00:03:20.880> nicer<00:03:21.209> than<00:03:21.690> chrome<00:03:22.109> a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
actually looks much nicer than chrome a
