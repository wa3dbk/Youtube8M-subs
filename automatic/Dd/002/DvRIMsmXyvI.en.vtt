00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.930
 I'm on my way to Sassenheim because 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.930
 hyundai called 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.270
 they wanted a car back goodbye 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.730
 today of an endurance test one 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.830
 special endurance test that I think even the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.439
 most successful takes 60 out of the 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.570
 history of car week 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.989
 This hyundai i10 has exactly in year 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.369
 drove with us and just about 46,000 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.010
 kilometers up and that's huge when 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.210
 a small car 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.859
 46,000 kilometers in one year 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.289
 wanted to say something about the popularity 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.730
 of this car on the editorial board 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.769
 there are very good reasons for that 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.539
 it is a very good thing to know 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.559
 I 'll tell you why that is so 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.899
 I first we go back in time 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.609
 it was almost a year and a half ago 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.829
 before we had these endurance tests 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.809
 until October 2013 and I flew to 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.379
 sardinia for the cherry introduction from 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.519
 the i10 how excited I was then 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.989
 two months later I came to 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.329
 the Netherlands was increasingly opposed 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.250
 endurance testing my other I 10 reason for 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.939
 us to organize a large multi-tester 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.509
 in the a-segment and that test that bonny 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.790
 this enduring test comes up in bright January 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.040
 stable stand and early summer property 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.850
 psa and Theo came with their success like 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.920
 triplets with a completely new one 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.079
 successor of reason for us to revisit 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.680
 a large multi-test in the A-segment to be 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:28.040
 and unfortunately for the C1 108 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.140
 and the aygo this i10 again became the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.310
 winner 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.719
 but of course the world does not stand 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.670
 quiet and europe with a brand new 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.259
 twingo end of the summer 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.899
 again reason for a test in it 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.770
 segment and unfortunately for the twingo that 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.200
 team won 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.979
 again and that makes this car up to 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.590
 on this day 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.560
 in our opinion, the best tested car 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.079
 you think the a-segment is a small one 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.490
 city â€‹â€‹car yes that is true but we 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.010
 discovered that he is also doing very well 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.510
 on long long journeys 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.000
 so we went up and down to monaco 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.060
 3,000 kilometers in this car 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.860
 no problem we made this a long drive 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.700
 along the battlefields of the Ardennes 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.170
 offensive 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.340
 a block all went well it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.560
 The only thing you notice is that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.450
 long journeys at high speed consumption 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 goes very up and that too for that 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.750
 it travels the trunk than the tight 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.680
 chance for the rest just did this 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.680
 very good 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.560
 what makes the hyundai i10 like that 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.939
 without that, it is very short 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.239
 Basically the fact that he is like that 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.739
 feels incredibly mature when you get in 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.269
 the car is when you drive it then have 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.349
 You feel more like you're working on 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.170
 the car just drives really a class 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.370
 higher that is in the chassis what 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.709
 and often small cars are a bit 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.659
 light source feelings about this car 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.900
 feels incredibly mature 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.760
 well comfortable if wanted 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.840
 interior does not look bare steel everything 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.750
 neatly lined 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.400
 nice even nice original design 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.530
 see the empire from all the seats 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.670
 sit well and maybe 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.200
 main 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.030
 the space for this car in particular 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 in the back it really has a series of 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.680
 space unprecedented for this class 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.590
 must be 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.750
 then 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.170
 and that means saying goodbye to this car 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.030
 it hurts but does not worry because 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.160
 wait a very nice cloth against it 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.420
 bleeding in sassenheim 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.420
 because the new endurance tests are ready
