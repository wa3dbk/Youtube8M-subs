00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.040
 here went to his first 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.130
 space fallen i was in the dark 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.110
 parts of the world over the indian ocean i 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.289
 completely turned off the light of his cabin 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.570
 to give my eyes used to when I 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.960
 flown over southern australia dark we 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.390
 passed through the southern lights and she like 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.760
 as if flooded us from below and it was possible 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.349
 see all its shades i mean i before 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 saw aurora coming on earth 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 surfaces on being in the middle of the south 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.649
 settlements are like being directly part of it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 interactions between the sun and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 atmosphere and magnetic field and yes it is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 visually like a prism or rainbow or 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.520
 anything like that it was 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.039
 real test of how it is in 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 really connected and how sunny 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.489
 magnetic energy and atmospheric protection 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.680
 field work together this case showed 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.739
 me that this is really this system 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.840
 planetary system this goes on all 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.129
 most of the time we will not 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.310
 but it goes on constantly all the time 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.979
 these things work together in orbit you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.320
 you get this vision of perspective you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.330
 see something complicated subject system 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 many influences that goes on 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.600
 continuously 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.210
 one of the effects of which are subject to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.380
 the earth itself is of course a creature 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.869
 who are alive and mozilla 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.530
 volcanic eruption but also flora and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.750
 fauna 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.000
 and in the last 100 years oh god you don't 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 imagine our quantity has grown to 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.350
 seven billion people who 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.840
 at the same time breathing and warming and turn on 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.140
 light their houses and turn on the engines in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 their cars 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.399
 of course it affects the planet among 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.810
 other things you can see some 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.340
 settled texts from space 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.220
 to the naked eye 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.040
 if you fly at the bottom and visit or 5 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 at Î¼s pollution seen from space she 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.549
 like an ugly gray spot on 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.880
 the surface of the world is man-made 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.770
 local climate change when i 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.149
 for the first time in metal over asia there was 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.300
 big inland sea 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.440
 Aral rather large territory 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.080
 always filled with water in the 90s for 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.129
 last 20 years due 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.760
 agricultural irrigation 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.440
 politicians 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.410
 Aral Sea turned from 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.599
 the fourth largest sea on earth 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:30.150
 virtually non-existent it dried out and 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.400
 we did it intentionally as a species we 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 made a conscious decision will allow 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.040
 the fourth largest sea turn 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.080
 in a little stinky jack 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 once the coastline is now just 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.140
 sand and fertilizer residues which 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.940
 merged in this sea throughout 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.700
 dozens of years we are definitely changing 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.209
 climate at the global level the question is 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.489
 who will be that person the question is 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.129
 who seems to be the person who decided 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.989
 something to change we can't wait for that 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.269
 it will make for us others they are not 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.909
 empowered and especially if we 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.129
 elected if we are chosen that's how we are 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.230
 we show ourselves and real motivation 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.080
 comes to each of us individually 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 that's who can not change anything 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.040
 say let them or he eliana eliana 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.680
 are we supposed to or should i changed and 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.080
 then it won't be perfect 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.450
 somewhat criticized before 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.670
 than people will feel enough pain or 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.409
 enough remorse to 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.430
 actually change your course 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:38.370
 but I'm sure this is not the end of the world. 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.709
 just the problem we are facing 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.090
 something will change but we will have to 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.090
 deal with it yourself 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.760
 just enough light yes I wonder 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.860
 the sun shines on us all right 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.860
 the sun shines not only on us
