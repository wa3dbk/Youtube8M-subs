that Campbell's very different to to a

that Campbell's very different to to a

performance element here we're not we're
not<00:01:26.520> racing<00:01:26.940> around<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.180> track<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.230> focus

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
not racing around a track so the focus

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.500 
not racing around a track so the focus
is<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:28.920> data<00:01:29.310> collection<00:01:29.910> systems

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
is more on data collection systems

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.620 
is more on data collection systems
checks<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.060> an<00:01:33.180> analytical

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
checks so it's more of an analytical

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.800 
checks so it's more of an analytical
test<00:01:35.390> we<00:01:36.390> don't<00:01:36.570> get<00:01:36.830> too<00:01:37.830> much<00:01:38.070> chance<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
test we don't get too much chance to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.570 
test we don't get too much chance to
test<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> circuit<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.440> days<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.460> these

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
test on the circuit these days so these

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.560 
test on the circuit these days so these
extra<00:01:42.229> shakedown<00:01:43.229> days<00:01:43.470> are<00:01:43.800> very<00:01:43.979> useful<00:01:44.970> all

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
extra shakedown days are very useful all

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300 
extra shakedown days are very useful all
the<00:01:45.720> data<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.080> click<00:01:46.440> today<00:01:46.620> will<00:01:46.950> will

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the data we click today will will

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
the data we click today will will
obviously<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.970> could<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.240> straight<00:01:48.300> back<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
obviously we could go straight back to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
obviously we could go straight back to
the<00:01:48.930> factory<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.920> analyzed<00:01:50.400> by<00:01:50.670> various

forward didn't work Williams I think I'd
be<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> rare<00:03:08.910> former<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.360> think
