doing a lot of bad

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.220 
doing a lot of bad
for<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.840> think<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.980> was<00:02:18.130> 27<00:02:18.940> bucks<00:02:19.270> off<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.810> RC

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
for I think it was 27 bucks off the RC

for I think it was 27 bucks off the RC
planet<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.980> mean<00:02:21.250> that's<00:02:21.459> as<00:02:21.640> much<00:02:21.790> as<00:02:22.000> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
planet I mean that's as much as a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.910 
planet I mean that's as much as a
plastic<00:02:22.630> one<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:22.840> it'll<00:02:23.230> hold<00:02:23.410> up<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.709> whole

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
plastic one and it'll hold up a whole

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.440 
plastic one and it'll hold up a whole
lot<00:02:24.190> longer<00:02:24.370> plus<00:02:25.330> since<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.870> are<00:02:26.760> mounted<00:02:27.760> to

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
lot longer plus since you are mounted to

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.199 
lot longer plus since you are mounted to
the<00:02:28.600> actual<00:02:29.850> diff<00:02:30.850> case<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:32.080> really<00:02:32.380> helps

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
the actual diff case it really helps

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.660 
the actual diff case it really helps
stiffen<00:02:34.209> everything<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:36.489> know<00:02:36.580> you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
stiffen everything up and you know you

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.000 
stiffen everything up and you know you
don't<00:02:36.880> have<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.959> bending<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:40.620> truck<00:02:41.620> so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
don't have the bending of the truck so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.690 
don't have the bending of the truck so
this<00:02:42.220> this<00:02:42.489> has<00:02:42.670> been<00:02:42.819> my<00:02:43.060> set<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.600> now<00:02:43.840> for

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
this this has been my set up now for

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.400 
this this has been my set up now for
probably<00:02:45.700> about<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.910> month<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:47.170> worked

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
probably about a month it's worked

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.460 
probably about a month it's worked
really<00:02:47.709> great<00:02:47.980> no<00:02:48.310> problems<00:02:48.880> at<00:02:49.060> all<00:02:49.470> some

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
took a it goes a golden horizons center

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.130 
took a it goes a golden horizons center
diff<00:03:11.190> aluminum<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.510> put<00:03:13.510> some<00:03:13.660> gears<00:03:13.900> in

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
diff aluminum and put some gears in

working great for me not only that it
really<00:03:28.329> helps<00:03:28.660> launch<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.380> vehicle<00:03:29.560> because

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
really helps launch the vehicle because

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.130 
really helps launch the vehicle because
now<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.489> have<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.829> lease<00:03:33.060> at<00:03:34.060> least<00:03:34.360> three

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
now you have a lease at least three

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.490 
now you have a lease at least three
tires<00:03:35.760> turn<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.060> long<00:03:37.269> time<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.930> they<00:03:38.260> turn

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
tires turn in a long time and they turn

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.740 
tires turn in a long time and they turn
together<00:03:38.760> really<00:03:39.760> helps<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.209> launch<00:03:40.450> straight

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
together really helps it launch straight

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.759 
together really helps it launch straight
obviously<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.470> want<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.739> keep<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:44.410> front

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
obviously you want to keep the the front

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.560 
obviously you want to keep the the front
diff<00:03:45.130> open<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.359> that<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.930> can<00:03:47.079> turn<00:03:47.350> good<00:03:47.650> but

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
diff open so that it can turn good but

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.420 
diff open so that it can turn good but
other<00:03:49.570> than<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:50.049> my<00:03:50.290> setup<00:03:50.620> pretty

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
other than that that's my setup pretty

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.979 
other than that that's my setup pretty
bulletproof<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.570> thing<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.959> insane<00:03:54.989> in

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
bulletproof this thing is insane in

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.340 
bulletproof this thing is insane in
addition<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.680> guess<00:03:56.859> I<00:03:57.070> guess<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.549> got<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:57.880> RPM

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.220 

lower<00:04:02.350> control<00:04:02.890> arms<00:04:03.400> front<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.180> rear<00:04:04.420> with

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
lower control arms front and rear with

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.190 
lower control arms front and rear with
rpm<00:04:06.480> back<00:04:07.480> bumper<00:04:08.079> but<00:04:08.440> that's<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.549> setup

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
rpm back bumper but that's the setup

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.090 
rpm back bumper but that's the setup
hopefully<00:04:11.200> I'm<00:04:11.260> going<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.410> get<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.709> guys<00:04:11.859> are
