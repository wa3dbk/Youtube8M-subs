00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.480
 If it is called "final fantasy" 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.520
 So how come so many games in this series? 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.420
 We should have heard before, this name really used to be meaningful. 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.060
 There is a very good explanation is 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:43.060
 In 1987, they made Final Fantasy as a farewell to the game industry. 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.300
 Why? 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.000
 Because the company that made it is about to go bankrupt. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.519
 So.. this is their "last" attempt to make a successful game. 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.860
 They made the final fantasy 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.080
 Grand Theft Auto GTA will exist because of another game error 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.759
 In 1995, Rockstar made the game Race'n'Chase 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.240
 This game is played like GTA later. 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.699
 Just this game is only focused on playing the police or gangsters to chase the car 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.220
 But the bug in the game makes the AI ​​playing the police car try to knock you off the road. 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.960
 Not really catching up and arresting you 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.140
 This makes the game famous among testers. 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.940
 So they reinvented the game model to make him more adaptable to this dynamic 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.300
 So, GTA was born. 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.360
 In the development of hacker invasion, they added a vision of New York in the game. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.100
 The developer cut off the part of the night scene that contained the Gemini building. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.539
 The reason is that there are restrictions on memory 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 The player noticed this, and the explanation he got when complaining to the developer was 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.440
 In the game, the Gemini building was destroyed by a terrorist attack. 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.240
 ...and this game was released more than a year before the 9/11 attacks. 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.500
 XBOX was originally called DirectX Box. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.280
 The initial decision was to demonstrate Microsoft's DirectX graphics technology. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.780
 How is it beneficial to the home market? 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.000
 The most well-known enemies of the BioShock series are Big Daddy and Little Sister. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 However, before thinking of Little Sister, another idea emerged in the minds of developers. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.820
 First, Little Sister, or at the time called Gatherers 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.540
 Designed with sea cucumber as a prototype, like this 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.560
 But no one will sympathize with this role. 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.800
 Big ☆ shock ☆ hi 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.700
 So art created a more pitiful role for it. 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.859
 An art paints the role of a dog in a wheelchair 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.520
 There is also a dragonfly with an anus-filled funnel. 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.740
 That's right... try to pity him to see σ`∀ ́) σ 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.400
 New Zealand has considered arresting fans of Manhunt 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.040
 The court said that this game will arouse the fun of killing 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.040
 Achieve the goal with more violent and fun killing 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.760
 Although the 12-year-old slut’s kid seems to be a minority of gamers 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.359
 But the truth is far from this 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.820
 Players under the age of 18 accounted for 32% 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.359
 This means that 68% of players are 18 years old or older. 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.480
 But the average age of the player is actually 30 years old. 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.380
 But shocking the world is that about 45% of players are women! 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.400
 (So ​​you told me this is an opportunity w) 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.420
 The best game console in history is PlayStation2. 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.619
 It sold a total of 155 million units worldwide. 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.040
 The best selling handset is Nintendo DS 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.040
 It sold more than 153 million units worldwide. 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.760
 The most popular game console in history is Apple Pippin. 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.380
 It sold 43,000 units in two years on the shelf. 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.820
 I don’t think that he is Apple’s. 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.140
 No, I am joking. 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.640
 Lie you der 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.080
 But it will fail because of its pricing 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.659
 He is priced at $599.99 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.460
 And its competitors are cheaper and better in terms of performance and functionality. 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.859
 (The Rockman was originally called Rockman... Do you think I would turn this way?) Megaman was originally called Rockman. 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.060
 But when they went public in North America, they changed their name to Megaman. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.900
 Nintendo believes that people may mistake their names for cocaine males. 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.820
 About 270 million 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.800
 Grand Theft Auto 5 is probably the biggest budget game in game history 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.700
 It really costs so much to make 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.159
 Only one movie has a higher budget than it 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.940
 God Ghost 3, budget 300 million US dollars 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280
 (thanks for watching)
