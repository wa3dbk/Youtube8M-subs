00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
because it's easy and it's reliable

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.769 
because it's easy and it's reliable
works<00:00:19.350> every<00:00:19.500> time<00:00:20.000> but<00:00:21.000> before<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> talk<00:00:21.480> about

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
works every time but before I talk about

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.160 
works every time but before I talk about
that<00:00:22.910> we<00:00:23.910> often<00:00:24.180> get<00:00:24.300> asked<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
that we often get asked it up in the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.839 
that we often get asked it up in the
shops<00:00:26.630> when<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.900> sharpen<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.470> knife<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
shops when do I sharpen a knife and I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.820 
shops when do I sharpen a knife and I
think<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.240> aren't<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.630> easy<00:00:30.779> answer<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.439> when

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
think they aren't be easy answer is when

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.549 
think they aren't be easy answer is when
you<00:00:31.920> lose<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> whale<00:00:32.430> factor<00:00:33.559> it's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
you lose the whale factor it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.560 
you lose the whale factor it's
particularly<00:00:34.890> easy<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.910> cutting<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
particularly easy if you are cutting a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
particularly easy if you are cutting a
tomato<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.200> something<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> shiny<00:00:38.160> skin<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
tomato or something with a shiny skin on

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.470 
tomato or something with a shiny skin on
it<00:00:38.850> because<00:00:40.160> then<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.940> knife<00:00:42.120> isn't

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it because then if the knife isn't

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680 
it because then if the knife isn't
really<00:00:42.719> sharp<00:00:43.020> it'll<00:00:43.469> slide<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.660> that<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
really sharp it'll slide off and that is

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.139 
really sharp it'll slide off and that is
also<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.170> reminder<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.770> how<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.520> blunt<00:00:47.969> knife

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
also a reminder that how a blunt knife

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.590 
also a reminder that how a blunt knife
is<00:00:48.390> actually<00:00:48.890> more<00:00:49.890> dangerous<00:00:50.610> than<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.539> sharp

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
is actually more dangerous than a sharp

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
is actually more dangerous than a sharp
knife<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.800> sharp<00:00:53.100> knife<00:00:53.309> cutting<00:00:53.670> into

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
knife because a sharp knife cutting into

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.020 
knife because a sharp knife cutting into
a<00:00:54.120> tomato<00:00:54.300> or<00:00:54.840> anything<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:56.030> peppers

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
a tomato or anything which is peppers

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.689 
a tomato or anything which is peppers
are<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> good<00:00:57.539> example<00:00:58.340> where<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.489> liable

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
are not a good example where it's liable

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.090 
are not a good example where it's liable
to<00:00:59.789> ski<00:01:00.120> off<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.629> possibly<00:01:01.559> end<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.949> your

to ski off and possibly end up in your
hand<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:03.570> obviously<00:01:03.780> dangerous<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.650> sharp

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
four parts there's two parts that you

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.760 
four parts there's two parts that you
will<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:42.060> when<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> use<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.110> intimately

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
will be when you use one intimately

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.179 
will be when you use one intimately
aware<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.250> which<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.970> lid<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.189> they

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
aware of which is the lid here and they

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.109 
aware of which is the lid here and they
eat<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> wheels<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.700> two<00:01:50.880> wheels

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
eat the wheels but the two wheels

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.819 
eat the wheels but the two wheels
themselves<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.750> obviously<00:01:51.990> separate<00:01:52.409> parts

themselves are obviously separate parts

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.219 
themselves are obviously separate parts
and<00:01:53.070> eventually<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:53.970> wear<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.899> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
and eventually they can wear out and you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.490 
and eventually they can wear out and you
can<00:01:55.500> replace<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.369> sell<00:01:56.579> replacements

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
reason and make sure when you push them

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.940 
reason and make sure when you push them
back<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.120> again<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.480> they<00:02:22.599> both<00:02:22.810> run<00:02:23.620> freely

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
back in again that they both run freely

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.970 
back in again that they both run freely
and<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.660> mirror<00:02:25.840> sharp<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:28.830> sharp<00:02:29.830> lock

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and the mirror sharp is a sharp lock

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.240 
and the mirror sharp is a sharp lock
works<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.430> water<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:33.010> probably

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
works with water and you can probably

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.970 
works with water and you can probably
see<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.569> there's<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.140> little<00:02:35.349> tray<00:02:35.680> that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
see here that there's a little tray that

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.400 
see here that there's a little tray that
these<00:02:36.190> wheels<00:02:36.459> sit<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.810> idea<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.380> that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
these wheels sit in and the idea is that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.809 
these wheels sit in and the idea is that
you<00:02:38.680> fill<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.040> tray<00:02:39.370> with<00:02:39.760> water<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:42.489> run

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
you fill that tray with water I just run

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.789 
you fill that tray with water I just run
it<00:02:42.910> under<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.150> tap<00:02:43.239> normally<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.230> as<00:02:44.680> I've

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
it under the tap normally but as I've

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.400 
it under the tap normally but as I've
got<00:02:44.920> no<00:02:45.069> tap<00:02:45.310> here<00:02:45.519> today<00:02:47.819> water<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> put

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
got no tap here today water and you put

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.490 
got no tap here today water and you put
the<00:02:50.500> lid<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.870> again<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.079> don't<00:02:53.260> know<00:02:53.349> if<00:02:53.410> you

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
the lid on and again I don't know if you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.350 
the lid on and again I don't know if you
can<00:02:53.620> see<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.950> but<00:02:54.190> there's<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.489> number<00:02:54.670> one<00:02:55.000> slot

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
can see it but there's a number one slot

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.960 
can see it but there's a number one slot
and<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> number<00:02:55.840> two<00:02:56.140> slot<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.769> if<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.819> have<00:02:57.940> a

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
and a number two slot and if you have a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.520 
and a number two slot and if you have a
knife<00:02:58.209> which<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.420> which<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.170> getting<00:02:59.349> quite

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
knife which is which is getting quite

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.289 
knife which is which is getting quite
blunt<00:02:59.950> you'd<00:03:00.250> use<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.579> number<00:03:00.849> one<00:03:01.000> slot

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
blunt you'd use the number one slot

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.960 
blunt you'd use the number one slot
first<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.769> just<00:03:02.950> put<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.310> knife<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.760> and

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
first and you just put the knife in and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.740 
first and you just put the knife in and
run<00:03:04.329> it<00:03:04.450> flaps<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.900> forwards<00:03:05.290> like<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
run it flaps and forwards like that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.390 
run it flaps and forwards like that
don't<00:03:07.750> put<00:03:07.959> any<00:03:08.109> pressure<00:03:08.139> on<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.650> we<00:03:09.100> let<00:03:09.250> the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
don't put any pressure on it we let the

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.870 
don't put any pressure on it we let the
knife<00:03:09.579> and<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.209> sharpener<00:03:10.690> do<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.900> work<00:03:11.880> run

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.670 
it back to the boys and the amount of
times<00:03:16.569> you<00:03:16.660> have<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.139> is<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.560> be

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
times you have to do it is going to be

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.089 
times you have to do it is going to be
dependent<00:03:18.130> on<00:03:18.250> how<00:03:18.880> blunt<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.720> knife<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.139> but

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
dependent on how blunt the knife is but

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.580 
dependent on how blunt the knife is but
once<00:03:21.250> you've<00:03:21.370> done<00:03:21.549> that<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:22.389> can<00:03:22.420> then<00:03:22.599> hone

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
a knife one way of testing them up this

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.840 
a knife one way of testing them up this
is<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.330> paper<00:03:55.540> test<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.200> when<00:03:56.890> it's<00:03:59.850> when

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
is the paper test and when it's when

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.240 
is the paper test and when it's when
it's<00:04:00.880> sharp<00:04:01.240> it<00:04:01.840> should<00:04:02.140> cut<00:04:02.650> into<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.950> piece<00:04:03.070> of

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
it's sharp it should cut into a piece of

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.699 
it's sharp it should cut into a piece of
paper<00:04:03.430> like<00:04:03.550> that<00:04:03.910> without<00:04:04.480> any<00:04:04.870> effort<00:04:05.470> at
