00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.519
 more 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.379
 my beloved sister 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.070
 about a week AKR safe and full of confidence and yet 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.169
 so relaxed 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.210
 the men and women who undercut her name 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.489
 one can not lead the way to Murcia one sees only teeming 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.259
 that could mean that 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.260
 of course, nothing to see 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.060
 left as a backup ten months ago 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.170
 I have only one thing in mind to discover what our father does not drive 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.740
 written in a letter Dr a year before my birth 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.850
 he rejected a secret library under the castle massaging a sanctuary 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850
 filled with priceless service 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.600
 So what am I going to do there? 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.480
 he will receive me 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.780
 overzealous Templar 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.610
 fear the worst 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 or not that is wrong 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 to be seen almost from almost 300 years 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.110
 because the claim to the castle Freckleben 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 he is going to come there 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.710
 I am ready to fight 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.760
 not because I'm tired 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 but because our war can only develop in one direction 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960
 SÃ³crates 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 I have more questions now 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.660
 That's why I've matured so far 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.120
 17 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.380
 to find the wisdom of the great changed 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 that it better understand cancer 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
 and my third place 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.430
 they can never happen 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.500
 my skills should be inadequate and on 1 the idea is not new 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.449
 to invent 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.449
 we are not looking in my hands 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.209
 to continue the search for the truth 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.039
 for the benefit of all 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.959
 a life 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.319
 that still a future 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.079
 and the world will cope with it 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.209
 to 1 preferred
