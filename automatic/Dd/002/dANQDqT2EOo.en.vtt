can result in the sump splitting when

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.819 
can result in the sump splitting when
you<00:00:58.620> undo<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.220> bolt<00:00:59.970> so<00:01:00.720> be<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:01.170> careful

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
with the oil draining below you should

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.920 
with the oil draining below you should
now<00:01:15.579> reach<00:01:15.850> down<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.270> side<00:01:16.509> of<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.780> engine

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930

see<00:01:21.430> I'm<00:01:21.729> really<00:01:22.329> lucky<00:01:22.539> here<00:01:22.930> because<00:01:23.259> in

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
see I'm really lucky here because in

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.020 
see I'm really lucky here because in
fact<00:01:23.560> it's<00:01:23.860> exactly<00:01:24.340> as<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:24.579> should<00:01:24.610> be<00:01:24.880> which

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
fact it's exactly as it should be which

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.289 
fact it's exactly as it should be which
is<00:01:25.179> finger<00:01:25.539> tight<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:27.159> may<00:01:27.640> well<00:01:27.969> end<00:01:28.000> up

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
is finger tight but you may well end up

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.050 
is finger tight but you may well end up
having<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.720> use<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.200> chain<00:01:29.829> wrench<00:01:30.159> in<00:01:30.610> order<00:01:30.909> to

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
remove the oil filter this is very messy

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.539 
remove the oil filter this is very messy
because<00:01:34.420> residual<00:01:35.259> oil<00:01:35.439> pours<00:01:35.890> out<00:01:36.159> to<00:01:36.369> make

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
because residual oil pours out to make
