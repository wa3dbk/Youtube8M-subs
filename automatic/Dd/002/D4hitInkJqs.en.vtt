doing<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.639> and<00:04:58.700> it's<00:04:59.030> not<00:04:59.150> as<00:04:59.270> hard<00:04:59.540> obviously

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
doing it and it's not as hard obviously

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.680 
doing it and it's not as hard obviously
takes<00:05:01.190> longer<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:01.729> this<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:02.210> just<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.479> 10
