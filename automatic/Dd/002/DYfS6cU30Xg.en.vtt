00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.259 
that the way you know the hair wasn't
what<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.420> wanted<00:04:07.659> to<00:04:08.019> be<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> supposed<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.829> be

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
what I wanted to be a supposed to be

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.399 
what I wanted to be a supposed to be
version<00:04:10.269> and<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.599> don't<00:04:10.810> think<00:04:10.989> that<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.230> was

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
version and I don't think that it was

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.529 
version and I don't think that it was
because<00:04:12.159> the<00:04:12.370> curls<00:04:12.819> look<00:04:13.359> too<00:04:13.780> uniform<00:04:14.739> so

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:15.539 
because the curls look too uniform so

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.020 
because the curls look too uniform so
right<00:04:16.539> then<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.959> was<00:04:17.109> suspect<00:04:17.680> okay<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.849> was

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
right then I was suspect okay it was

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.360 
right then I was suspect okay it was
suspect<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.720> me<00:04:19.750> so<00:04:21.360> you<00:04:22.360> know<00:04:22.510> when<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.830> begin
