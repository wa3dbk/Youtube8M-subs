00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
now you have to expect a little bit of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.200 
now you have to expect a little bit of
grease<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.780> from<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> burger<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.610> it's

grease in this from the burger and it's
not<00:01:21.540> quite<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:21.960> sloppy<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.549> Mexican<00:01:23.970> one

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

the<00:01:59.579> top<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.329> little<00:02:00.659> bit<00:02:00.810> more<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the top so a little bit more of a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
the top so a little bit more of a
standard<00:02:01.530> affair<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:03.240> far<00:02:03.329> as

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
standard affair there I think as far as

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
standard affair there I think as far as
burgers<00:02:03.930> go<00:02:04.140> even<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> we

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
burgers go even we go and we see that we

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.199 
burgers go even we go and we see that we
have<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.409> just<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.610> quite<00:02:08.610> fantastic<00:02:10.670> bath<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
have a just a quite fantastic bath of

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.930 
have a just a quite fantastic bath of
sauce<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.810> would<00:02:12.989> say<00:02:13.200> now<00:02:14.010> there's<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.640> lot

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
sauce I would say now there's a lot

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.820 
sauce I would say now there's a lot
going<00:02:15.269> on<00:02:15.360> here<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.599> we<00:02:15.750> need<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.800> a

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
going on here that we need to have a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.920 
going on here that we need to have a
look<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.489> first<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.940> all<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.269> think<00:02:18.660> it's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
look at so first of all I think it's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.440

pretty<00:02:19.170> clear<00:02:19.410> tonight<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.099> have

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
pretty clear tonight that we have

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.229 
pretty clear tonight that we have
barbecue<00:02:21.450> sauce<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.080> great<00:02:22.620> quantities<00:02:23.280> so

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.280 
barbecue sauce in great quantities so
that's<00:02:25.050> good<00:02:25.349> we'll<00:02:25.769> just<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:27.200> get<00:02:28.200> an

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that's good we'll just have a get an

austrial<00:02:28.739> full<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.160> yeah<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:30.120> that

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
austrial full of that yeah that is that

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.250 
austrial full of that yeah that is that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
all I'm not I must say we are lacking

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.530 
all I'm not I must say we are lacking
much<00:02:38.130> lettuce<00:02:38.580> now<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.880> know<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.299> thing

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
much lettuce now you know I have a thing

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.030 
much lettuce now you know I have a thing
for<00:02:42.569> lettuce<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.739> know

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
for lettuce you know

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.209 
for lettuce you know
and<00:02:44.219> the<00:02:44.459> Nestle<00:02:45.000> necess<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:46.650> still<00:02:46.980> call

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
and the Nestle necess I would still call

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.949 
and the Nestle necess I would still call
this<00:02:47.370> Minji<00:02:47.760> definitely<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.329> it's<00:02:51.870> not

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
this Minji definitely but it's it's not

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.589 
this Minji definitely but it's it's not
quite<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.620> bad<00:02:52.829> as<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.969> Mexican<00:02:54.390> fiesta

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
quite as bad as the Mexican fiesta

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.809 
quite as bad as the Mexican fiesta
although<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.409> have<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> feeling<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.310> reason<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
although I have a feeling the reason it

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.089 
although I have a feeling the reason it
doesn't<00:02:56.969> seem<00:02:57.329> as<00:02:57.540> bad<00:02:57.719> is<00:02:57.989> because<00:02:58.319> there

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
doesn't seem as bad is because there

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.559 
doesn't seem as bad is because there
isn't<00:02:59.250> actually<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.849> much<00:03:00.030> lettuce<00:03:00.420> in

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
isn't actually that much lettuce in

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.240 
isn't actually that much lettuce in
there<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.019> if<00:03:01.170> there<00:03:01.379> is<00:03:01.409> more<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:02.010> I

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
there now if there is more of this I

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.610 
there now if there is more of this I
think<00:03:02.519> we<00:03:02.939> would<00:03:03.030> maybe<00:03:03.239> see<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:04.049> problem<00:03:04.439> a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
think we would maybe see the problem a

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.949 
think we would maybe see the problem a
little<00:03:04.829> more<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.849> then<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.150> have<00:03:06.329> cheese<00:03:06.720> now<00:03:06.930> I

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
little more so then we have cheese now I

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.190 
little more so then we have cheese now I
must<00:03:07.319> say<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.670> Australian<00:03:09.299> barbecue<00:03:09.959> burger

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
must say the Australian barbecue burger

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.300 
must say the Australian barbecue burger

something that I I sort of really

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.200

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
look particularly inspiring it looks a

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.270

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.930 
little bit sort of crispy on the edges
but<00:04:10.700> it's<00:04:10.760> it's<00:04:11.510> very<00:04:11.750> floppy<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.940> little

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
but it's it's very floppy and a little

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.060 
but it's it's very floppy and a little
bit<00:04:14.030> uninspiring<00:04:14.750> but<00:04:15.080> it<00:04:15.260> may<00:04:15.440> taste<00:04:15.740> good<00:04:16.040> so

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
bit uninspiring but it may taste good so

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.860 
bit uninspiring but it may taste good so
let's<00:04:16.430> give<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.210> the<00:04:17.239> benefit<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.840> doubt

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
let's give that the benefit of the doubt

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.840 
let's give that the benefit of the doubt
there's<00:04:18.800> an<00:04:18.890> example<00:04:19.220> here

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
there's an example here

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.800 
there's an example here
oh<00:04:20.530> hang<00:04:21.530> on<00:04:21.620> we've<00:04:21.770> got<00:04:21.890> some<00:04:22.070> cheese<00:04:22.810> dangled

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
oh hang on we've got some cheese dangled

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.190 
oh hang on we've got some cheese dangled
each<00:04:23.900> here<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:24.380> now<00:04:25.450> that's<00:04:26.450> how<00:04:26.660> gluey<00:04:27.020> the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
each here but now that's how gluey the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.890 
each here but now that's how gluey the
cheese<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.650> most<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:28.670> slowly<00:04:29.390> coming<00:04:29.750> off

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
cheese is most it is slowly coming off

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.960 
cheese is most it is slowly coming off
but<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.140> can<00:04:30.320> see<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:30.710> there's<00:04:31.370> quite<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.730> lot

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
but you can see that there's quite a lot

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.300 
but you can see that there's quite a lot
of<00:04:32.000> stuff<00:04:32.330> stuck<00:04:32.720> onto<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.170> burger<00:04:33.620> oh<00:04:33.770> there

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
of stuff stuck onto that burger oh there

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.600 
of stuff stuck onto that burger oh there

so it does come out but if you don't

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
it

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:35.560 
it
Sheila<00:05:31.089> leave<00:05:31.809> the<00:05:31.959> burger<00:05:32.289> line

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.770 

right<00:05:36.200> okay<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:37.910> I've<00:05:38.000> had<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.240> move<00:05:38.450> because

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
right okay so I've had to move because

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.320 
right okay so I've had to move because
that<00:05:39.200> cuz<00:05:40.040> Sheila's<00:05:40.400> making<00:05:40.730> a<00:05:40.790> right<00:05:40.940> pane<00:05:41.180> of

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
that cuz Sheila's making a right pane of

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.100 
that cuz Sheila's making a right pane of
herself<00:05:41.600> so<00:05:41.840> I<00:05:42.050> think<00:05:43.450> we've<00:05:44.450> dumped<00:05:44.780> half<00:05:44.930> the

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
herself so I think we've dumped half the

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.890 
herself so I think we've dumped half the
burger<00:05:45.440> over<00:05:45.650> there<00:05:45.800> for<00:05:46.010> her<00:05:46.900> hopefully

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
burger over there for her hopefully

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.510 
burger over there for her hopefully
she's<00:05:48.110> gonna<00:05:48.260> take<00:05:48.620> an<00:05:48.800> interest<00:05:49.040> in<00:05:49.220> that<00:05:49.370> and

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
she's gonna take an interest in that and

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.430 
she's gonna take an interest in that and
leave<00:05:49.610> us<00:05:49.760> alone<00:05:49.880> now<00:05:50.240> so<00:05:50.870> that's<00:05:51.260> why<00:05:51.380> the

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
leave us alone now so that's why the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.050 
leave us alone now so that's why the
burger<00:05:51.740> looks<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:52.010> bit<00:05:52.040> weird<00:05:52.340> how<00:05:52.580> much<00:05:52.700> eaten

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.059 
so in summary I would say that the
Australian<00:06:15.909> barbecue<00:06:16.360> supreme<00:06:16.900> is<00:06:17.139> actually

pretty<00:06:18.370> nice<00:06:18.599> now<00:06:19.599> I<00:06:19.930> probably<00:06:20.199> didn't<00:06:20.500> get<00:06:20.590> to

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
eat quite as much of it as I would've

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.689

antics<00:06:25.150> but<00:06:25.419> I<00:06:25.629> must<00:06:26.050> say<00:06:26.199> it<00:06:26.469> is<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.830> is<00:06:27.009> a

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
antics but I must say it is it is a

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.770 
antics but I must say it is it is a
country<00:06:27.520> mile<00:06:28.020> ahead<00:06:29.020> of<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.919> Mexican<00:06:30.340> fiesta

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
country mile ahead of the Mexican fiesta

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.480 
country mile ahead of the Mexican fiesta

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.129 
it's actually tasty I still haven't
quite<00:06:33.550> worked<00:06:33.729> out<00:06:34.180> what<00:06:34.389> the<00:06:34.419> white<00:06:34.659> sauce<00:06:34.930> is

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
quite worked out what the white sauce is

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.589 
quite worked out what the white sauce is
in<00:06:35.289> there<00:06:35.439> but<00:06:36.099> it's<00:06:36.250> good<00:06:36.430> works<00:06:37.150> well<00:06:37.419> with

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
in there but it's good works well with

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.719 
in there but it's good works well with
the<00:06:37.750> with<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.199> barbecue<00:06:38.590> sauce<00:06:38.620> so<00:06:39.460> I<00:06:39.490> would

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
the with the barbecue sauce so I would

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.659 
the with the barbecue sauce so I would
say<00:06:39.879> all<00:06:40.120> in<00:06:40.270> all<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:41.250> the<00:06:42.250> Australian

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
say all in all the the Australian

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.629 
say all in all the the Australian
barbecue<00:06:43.090> supreme<00:06:43.509> burger<00:06:44.169> is<00:06:44.530> a<00:06:44.860> definitely

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
barbecue supreme burger is a definitely

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.059 
barbecue supreme burger is a definitely
I<00:06:46.029> would<00:06:46.240> say<00:06:46.389> a<00:06:46.509> lot<00:06:46.779> more<00:06:47.020> Mark<00:06:47.349> Webber<00:06:47.620> than

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
I would say a lot more Mark Webber than

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.529 
I would say a lot more Mark Webber than
it<00:06:48.159> is<00:06:48.279> roll<00:06:48.490> terrace<00:06:49.020> for<00:06:50.020> obvious<00:06:50.289> reasons

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
it is roll terrace for obvious reasons

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.200 
it is roll terrace for obvious reasons
I'd<00:06:52.539> recommend<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.169> and<00:06:53.349> it<00:06:53.590> gets<00:06:53.800> a<00:06:54.520> seven

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
I'd recommend it and it gets a seven

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.930 
I'd recommend it and it gets a seven
half<00:06:55.419> out<00:06:55.599> of<00:06:55.629> ten
