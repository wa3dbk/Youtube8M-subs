00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.710 
weight but this particular tenant guard
versus<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> prior<00:01:32.250> season<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:33.180> designed<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
versus the prior season was designed and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.350 
versus the prior season was designed and
engineered<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.350> give<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.710> five<00:01:35.460> degrees<00:01:35.880> more

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
engineered to give you five degrees more

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
engineered to give you five degrees more
range<00:01:36.690> of<00:01:36.810> motion<00:01:36.870> versus<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> prior<00:01:38.040> total

percent<00:01:41.400> might<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.880> sound<00:01:42.120> like<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.360> ton<00:01:42.690> but

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
percent might not sound like a ton but

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.750 
percent might not sound like a ton but
when<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.440> do<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> math<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> actually<00:01:44.400> adds<00:01:44.520> up

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
when you do the math it actually adds up

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.130 
when you do the math it actually adds up
to<00:01:44.790> twenty<00:01:45.180> percent<00:01:45.479> more<00:01:45.720> range<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.080> motion

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to twenty percent more range of motion

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.930 
to twenty percent more range of motion
so<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:46.710> twenty<00:01:46.950> percent<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.460> power<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
so that's twenty percent more power the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.000 
so that's twenty percent more power the
player<00:01:48.150> has<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:49.080> put<00:01:49.260> on<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> ice<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.799> every

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
player has to put on the ice with every

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.490 
player has to put on the ice with every
single<00:01:50.280> stride<00:01:50.520> now<00:01:51.080> so<00:01:52.080> we<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
single stride now so we know it's the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
single stride now so we know it's the
power<00:01:52.619> line<00:01:52.830> it's<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.430> better<00:01:53.729> for

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
power line it's going to be better for

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
power line it's going to be better for
that<00:01:54.000> longer<00:01:54.510> more<00:01:54.659> powerful<00:01:55.140> stride<00:01:55.380> how

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
that longer more powerful stride how

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.580 
that longer more powerful stride how
does<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.190> fit<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.670> look<00:01:57.600> compared<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.320> one

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
does the fit and look compared this one

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.100 
does the fit and look compared this one
to<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> vapor<00:01:59.070> line<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.610> a<00:02:00.030> vapor<00:02:00.630> skate<00:02:00.990> is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to the vapor line so a vapor skate is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.960 
to the vapor line so a vapor skate is
going<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.710> little<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.040> more<00:02:02.340> narrow<00:02:02.670> in

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
going to be a little bit more narrow in

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.950 
going to be a little bit more narrow in
the<00:02:03.030> forefoot<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:05.000> not<00:02:06.000> quite<00:02:06.330> have<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.570> heel

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the forefoot and not quite have the heel

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
the forefoot and not quite have the heel
lock<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.439> supreme<00:02:07.799> does<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.189> it's<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:09.030> of

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
lock that a supreme does so it's kind of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.480 
lock that a supreme does so it's kind of
a<00:02:09.239> flip-flop<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.990> little<00:02:10.319> bit<00:02:10.440> vapor<00:02:11.160> very
