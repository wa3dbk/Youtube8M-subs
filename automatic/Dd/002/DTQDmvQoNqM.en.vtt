problem<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.090> got<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.450> now<00:02:11.599> we<00:02:11.630> already<00:02:12.020> broke

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
problem you got it now we already broke

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.080 
problem you got it now we already broke
those<00:02:12.620> lugs<00:02:12.950> loose<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.580> this<00:02:13.790> should<00:02:13.940> be<00:02:14.060> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
those lugs loose so this should be a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.850 
those lugs loose so this should be a
breeze<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> lot<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.540> times<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.290> tire<00:02:18.590> will

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
breeze now a lot of times the tire will

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.710 
breeze now a lot of times the tire will
actually<00:02:19.220> rust<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.000> hub<00:02:20.180> because<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.540> hub

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
actually rust to the hub because the hub

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.300 
actually rust to the hub because the hub
will<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:20.959> rusty<00:02:21.380> due<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.590> condensation<00:02:21.830> or

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
will get rusty due to condensation or

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.860 
will get rusty due to condensation or
moisture<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:22.760> whatever<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.420> can't<00:02:23.690> get

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
moisture or whatever and you can't get

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.750 
moisture or whatever and you can't get
it<00:02:23.989> off<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.319> if<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.620> happens<00:02:25.040> all<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.610> gotta

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
it off so if that happens all you gotta

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.030 
it off so if that happens all you gotta
do<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:25.880> hit<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.480> side<00:02:26.750> hit<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.500> side<00:02:27.800> click

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
do is hit this side hit that side click

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.890 
do is hit this side hit that side click
this<00:02:28.190> side<00:02:28.459> keep<00:02:28.940> hitting<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.330> back<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.720> forth

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
this side keep hitting it back and forth

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.510 
this side keep hitting it back and forth
until<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.319> break<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.560> loose<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.370> that

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
until you can break it loose but that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.890 
until you can break it loose but that
