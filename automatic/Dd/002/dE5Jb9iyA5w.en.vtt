00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 Now let's chop the potatoes 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.840

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 we also cut our fresh onions 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 let's eat our parsley 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.160

 flapping in a bowl 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.960
 we use mayonnaise because we do not use oil 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.640
