"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.550
"The family members get tricked."

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.070
"Such is our trickery."

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.430
"Don't get tricked, dear uncle."

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.510

"Such is our trickery."

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.190
"Don't get tricked, dear uncle."

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.430
"The one who is a fake

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.110
"No. No, pal."

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.150
"If you are going through a crisis.."

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.030
"..even your shadow deserts you."

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.070
"Why complain about disloyalty?"

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.070
"This is what the world says."

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.750
"This is what the world says."

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.390
"This is what the world says."

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.670
But what?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.030
"Who is real? Who is a fake?"

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.590
Who is a fake?"

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.710
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.310
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.030
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.790
"The family members get tricked."

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.190
"Such is our trickery."

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.230
"Don't get tricked, dear uncle."

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.230
"Uncle."

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.470
"In this world, even your
own turn their backs on you."

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.830
"And if you become famous,
they come and hound you."

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.430
"The world will not
fulfill its promise."

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.230
So true.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.870
"Since strangers taunt us these days."

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.830
"Taunt us."

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.470
"Taunt us."

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.230
"Taunt us."

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.350
But how?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.110
"Who is real? Who is a fake?"

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.630
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.310
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.150
"The family members get tricked."

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.590
"Such is our trickery."

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.630
"Don't get tricked, dear uncle."

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.510
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.190
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.590
"Uncle. Uncle."

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.390
"Uncle. Uncle. Uncle."

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.870
"The family members get tricked."

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.310
"Such is our trickery."

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.550
