 angelica because her mother ignores her and her 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.350

 they had an abortion 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.909
 Angelica could not decide if the children 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.399
 without being born would be man or woman then 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.750
 he invented the same character in his head 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:13.399
 but with different genres to broun 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.250

 goldring being the only rugrats that was not 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.040
 product of the imagination of angelica 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.710

 a deformation that grew more 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.290
 evident by what he lives being 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.030

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.039
