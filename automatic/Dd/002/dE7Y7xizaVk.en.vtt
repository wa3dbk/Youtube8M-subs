almost<00:00:24.960> spend<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> two<00:00:25.890> lakhs<00:00:26.160> per<00:00:26.400> system

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
almost spend up to two lakhs per system

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.849 
almost spend up to two lakhs per system
but<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.539> week<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.019> show<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.289> something

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
but this week we show you something

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.569 
but this week we show you something
where<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> bar<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:30.000> higher<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.340> mean

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
where the bar just got higher and I mean

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.110 
where the bar just got higher and I mean
really<00:00:36.090> higher<00:00:36.300> 16<00:00:37.020> lakh<00:00:37.290> rupees<00:00:37.879> see<00:00:38.879> what

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
really higher 16 lakh rupees see what

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
really higher 16 lakh rupees see what
that<00:00:39.360> sounds<00:00:39.750> like

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.110 

you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.529 

I<00:00:50.070> had<00:00:51.070> my<00:00:51.250> first<00:00:51.430> system<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:51.850> my<00:00:51.940> car<00:00:52.149> were<00:00:52.360> two

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
I had my first system in my car were two

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.930 
I had my first system in my car were two
lags<00:00:52.780> or<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.170> then<00:00:53.949> slowly<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.520> gradually<00:00:54.640> I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
lags or so then slowly and gradually I

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.569 
lags or so then slowly and gradually I
stabbed<00:00:55.690> up<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.930> ladder<00:00:56.110> and<00:00:56.469> increased<00:00:57.250> the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
stabbed up the ladder and increased the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.610 
stabbed up the ladder and increased the
output<00:00:57.879> of<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.210> system<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:59.050> then<00:00:59.230> I<00:00:59.469> took

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
output of the system and then I took

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.380 
output of the system and then I took
this<00:00:59.920> cord<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:00.309> they<00:01:00.399> were<00:01:00.460> entirely<00:01:01.149> because

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
this cord and they were entirely because

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.170 
this cord and they were entirely because
I<00:01:01.719> wanted<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.620> have<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.160> huge<00:01:03.460> car<00:01:03.879> audio<00:01:04.150> system

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
I wanted to have a huge car audio system

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.560 
I wanted to have a huge car audio system
in<00:01:04.509> my<00:01:04.629> car<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:06.159> had<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.790> system<00:01:07.149> worth<00:01:07.300> 4

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
in my car so I had a system worth 4

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.719 
in my car so I had a system worth 4
lakhs<00:01:07.810> initially<00:01:08.770> in<00:01:08.860> this<00:01:09.009> car<00:01:09.220> then<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.490> went

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
lakhs initially in this car then I went

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.270 
lakhs initially in this car then I went
ahead<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.000> had<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.869> set<00:01:11.229> up<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.409> nine<00:01:11.649> lakhs<00:01:11.860> and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
ahead and had a set up of nine lakhs and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.580 
ahead and had a set up of nine lakhs and
now<00:01:12.550> this<00:01:12.759> is<00:01:12.970> 150<00:01:13.570> lands<00:01:13.780> which<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.440> see

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
now this is 150 lands which you see

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.149 
now this is 150 lands which you see
aware

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.770 

well<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> basic<00:01:20.550> requirements<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.180> first<00:01:21.540> is

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
well the basic requirements are first is

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
well the basic requirements are first is
the<00:01:21.990> head<00:01:22.140> unit<00:01:22.290> who's<00:01:22.590> gonna<00:01:22.800> play<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> song

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the head unit who's gonna play the song

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.910 
the head unit who's gonna play the song
for<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.729> either<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.810> flash<00:01:25.229> drive<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> CD

or you can call also call it a CD player
the<00:01:29.369> second<00:01:29.670> thing<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.720> speakers<00:01:31.110> they're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the second thing is the speakers they're

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.740 
the second thing is the speakers they're
two<00:01:31.890> types<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.550> coaxial<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> second

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
two types one is coaxial and the second

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
two types one is coaxial and the second
one<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.960> component<00:01:34.290> speakers<00:01:34.700> component

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
one is component speakers component

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.160 
one is component speakers component
speakers<00:01:35.880> generally<00:01:36.240> sound<00:01:36.690> better<00:01:36.900> than<00:01:37.080> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
speakers generally sound better than the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890 
speakers generally sound better than the
coaxial<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.640> prepare<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.180> usable

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
coaxial and they prepare the usable

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980 
coaxial and they prepare the usable
frequency<00:01:40.410> range<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.890> usually<00:01:41.310> from<00:01:42.150> 80<00:01:42.720> Hertz

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
frequency range is usually from 80 Hertz

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.710 
frequency range is usually from 80 Hertz
till<00:01:43.350> particular<00:01:43.770> Hertz<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:45.000> comes<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
till particular Hertz and then comes the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
till particular Hertz and then comes the
subwoofers<00:01:45.990> who's<00:01:46.830> gonna<00:01:47.009> play<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.280> low

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
subwoofers who's gonna play the low

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120 
subwoofers who's gonna play the low
frequency<00:01:48.150> notes<00:01:48.330> from<00:01:49.020> 20<00:01:49.380> Hertz<00:01:49.409> till<00:01:49.890> 80

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
frequency notes from 20 Hertz till 80

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.270 
frequency notes from 20 Hertz till 80
Hertz<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.910> most<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> scenarios<00:01:52.440> then

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
Hertz and most of the scenarios then

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
Hertz and most of the scenarios then
comes<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.580> amplifiers<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.690> are<00:01:54.750> two<00:01:54.869> types

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
comes the amplifiers there are two types

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260 
comes the amplifiers there are two types
of<00:01:55.320> amplifiers<00:01:55.800> which<00:01:56.310> are<00:01:56.430> mainly<00:01:56.700> used<00:01:56.820> when

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of amplifiers which are mainly used when

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
of amplifiers which are mainly used when
one<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> stereo<00:01:58.259> amplifier<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
one is the stereo amplifier and the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.550 
one is the stereo amplifier and the
second<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.580> are<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.970> monoblock<00:02:00.560> stereo

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
second one is are the monoblock stereo

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
second one is are the monoblock stereo
amplifiers<00:02:02.009> are<00:02:02.220> basically<00:02:02.670> used<00:02:02.970> for<00:02:03.330> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
amplifiers are basically used for to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690
