the<00:05:50.190> corner<00:05:53.030> we<00:05:54.030> have<00:05:54.300> a<00:05:56.450> card<00:05:57.450> from<00:05:57.660> the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.939 
correct set card from the correct set oh
here's<00:06:17.770> another<00:06:18.070> star<00:06:18.580> and<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:20.500> appears<00:06:20.620> like

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
here's another star and it appears like

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.640 
here's another star and it appears like
it<00:06:21.340> should<00:06:21.699> be<00:06:21.729> holographic<00:06:22.539> with<00:06:23.350> all<00:06:23.530> these

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
it should be holographic with all these

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.540 
it should be holographic with all these
little<00:06:23.860> bubbles<00:06:24.600> but<00:06:25.600> it's<00:06:26.259> not<00:06:26.490> it's<00:06:27.490> not

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
little bubbles but it's not it's not

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.930 
little bubbles but it's not it's not
anywhere<00:06:28.240> close<00:06:28.300> to<00:06:28.509> being<00:06:28.690> holographic

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
anywhere close to being holographic

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.830 
anywhere close to being holographic
here's<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.060> level<00:06:31.300> X<00:06:31.479> that<00:06:31.780> isn't<00:06:32.020> even<00:06:32.220> shiny

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
here's the level X that isn't even shiny

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:48.830 
here's the level X that isn't even shiny
so<00:06:35.039> 2<00:06:36.039> level<00:06:36.430> X<00:06:36.610> is<00:06:36.789> in<00:06:36.910> a<00:06:37.000> pack<00:06:42.930> 3<00:06:44.100> 4<00:06:45.630> 5<00:06:46.630> stars<00:06:47.199> a

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
so 2 level X is in a pack 3 4 5 stars a

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.379 
so 2 level X is in a pack 3 4 5 stars a
random<00:06:49.840> energy<00:06:50.050> that<00:06:50.500> doesn't<00:06:50.830> say<00:06:51.550> which<00:06:51.940> set

random energy that doesn't say which set

00:06:52.389 --> 00:07:00.420 
random energy that doesn't say which set
it's<00:06:52.570> from<00:06:55.110> and<00:06:56.250> three<00:06:57.250> other<00:06:57.750> cards<00:06:59.280> so<00:07:00.280> we

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
it's from and three other cards so we

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.029 
it's from and three other cards so we
have<00:07:00.520> one<00:07:00.789> two<00:07:00.970> three<00:07:01.000> four<00:07:01.510> five<00:07:01.840> six<00:07:02.199> seven

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
have one two three four five six seven

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.409 
have one two three four five six seven
eight<00:07:03.340> nine<00:07:03.400> nine<00:07:04.410> cards<00:07:05.410> on<00:07:06.009> the<00:07:06.669> packet<00:07:07.150> said

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419 
eight nine nine cards on the packet said

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:12.659 
eight nine nine cards on the packet said
there<00:07:07.720> should<00:07:08.080> be<00:07:08.349> ten<00:07:09.630> 10<00:07:10.630> cards<00:07:11.490> at<00:07:12.490> least

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
there should be ten 10 cards at least

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.129 
there should be ten 10 cards at least
this<00:07:12.880> time<00:07:13.150> they're<00:07:13.389> all<00:07:13.510> from<00:07:13.690> the<00:07:13.840> correct

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
this time they're all from the correct

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.400 
this time they're all from the correct
set<00:07:14.440> but<00:07:15.030> anybody<00:07:16.030> who<00:07:16.300> knows<00:07:16.539> when<00:07:16.990> they<00:07:17.110> open

always a reverse holo and these cards

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.760 
always a reverse holo and these cards
should<00:07:28.240> be<00:07:28.360> foil<00:07:29.010> so<00:07:30.270> this<00:07:31.270> is<00:07:31.449> fraud<00:07:31.780> this<00:07:32.620> is

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770 
should be foil so this is fraud this is

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.680 
should be foil so this is fraud this is

exact same way and I would like my money

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.460 
exact same way and I would like my money
back<00:07:41.460> for<00:07:42.460> both<00:07:42.639> Lots<00:07:43.030> purchase<00:07:43.690> because<00:07:44.229> this

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.470 
back for both Lots purchase because this

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.919 
back for both Lots purchase because this
