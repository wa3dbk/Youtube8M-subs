00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
really explained and I guess that was

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.280 
really explained and I guess that was
because<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.940> was<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.269> another<00:03:08.569> issue<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.170> is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
could've at least given us a little bit

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.490 
could've at least given us a little bit
of<00:03:14.120> exposition<00:03:14.660> or<00:03:14.810> something<00:03:15.049> that<00:03:15.170> tells<00:03:15.350> us

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
of exposition or something that tells us

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.039

hey this is how I got the right so it
was<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.410> little<00:03:18.680> bit<00:03:18.799> of<00:03:18.889> a<00:03:18.950> fault<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.459> okay

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
was a little bit of a fault in it okay

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.190 
was a little bit of a fault in it okay
and<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.030> really<00:03:20.299> enjoyed<00:03:20.600> about<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.109> that

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
and I really enjoyed about this is that

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.809 
and I really enjoyed about this is that
there's<00:03:21.440> an<00:03:21.590> overall<00:03:21.889> sense<00:03:22.220> of<00:03:22.340> family

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
there's an overall sense of family

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.309 
there's an overall sense of family
throughout<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.239> series<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.780> theme<00:03:24.019> here

throughout this series the theme here

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.660

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
into this any more pages and you just

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.100 
into this any more pages and you just
get<00:05:27.190> it<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.400> be<00:05:27.490> unwieldy<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.210> yes<00:05:28.450> volume<00:05:28.930> 2

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
get it to be unwieldy and yes volume 2

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.110 
get it to be unwieldy and yes volume 2
is<00:05:29.289> actually<00:05:29.560> even<00:05:29.979> bigger<00:05:30.550> than<00:05:30.760> this<00:05:30.910> by

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
is actually even bigger than this by

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.719 
is actually even bigger than this by
about<00:05:31.300> I'd<00:05:32.110> say<00:05:32.139> about<00:05:32.410> 200<00:05:32.650> pages<00:05:33.100> so<00:05:33.520> you're

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729
