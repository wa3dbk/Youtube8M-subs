already<00:01:08.490> probed<00:01:09.320> programmed<00:01:10.320> let's<00:01:11.159> start<00:01:11.310> up

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
already probed programmed let's start up

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.820 
already probed programmed let's start up
and<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:16.229> camera<00:01:16.530> file<00:01:16.939> that's<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.180> great

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
and the camera file that's just great

and the camera file that's just great
again<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:23.270> think<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.750> will<00:01:24.930> need<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.409> get

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
again I think I will need to get

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.249 
again I think I will need to get
something<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.400> hold<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.880> thing<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:30.259> now

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
something to hold this thing out now

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.480 
something to hold this thing out now
then<00:01:31.700> let's<00:01:32.700> try<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.299> again<00:01:33.479> shall<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.960> I
