for me

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010

I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:36.240> boot<00:01:36.479> would<00:01:36.659> become

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I think this boot would become

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.580 
I think this boot would become
uncomfortable<00:01:37.560> anything<00:01:38.280> past<00:01:38.579> about<00:01:38.930> 65<00:01:39.930> for

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
uncomfortable anything past about 65 for

uncomfortable anything past about 65 for
me<00:01:40.710> personally<00:01:41.090> everybody<00:01:42.090> has<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:43.049> different

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
me personally everybody has a different

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.219 
me personally everybody has a different
opinion<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.030> for<00:01:45.600> me<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> wear<00:01:46.110> this

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
opinion on that but for me to wear this

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
opinion on that but for me to wear this
boot<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:46.590> day<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.520> getting<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> 65<00:01:48.540> or

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

two<00:02:01.350> linings<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.549> neoprene<00:02:02.969> outside<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.070> the

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
two linings the neoprene outside and the

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
two linings the neoprene outside and the
synthetic<00:02:06.299> inside<00:02:06.899> basically<00:02:07.439> there's<00:02:07.890> tiny

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
synthetic inside basically there's tiny

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.390 
synthetic inside basically there's tiny
little<00:02:08.369> hairs<00:02:08.989> or<00:02:09.989> fibers<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> look

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
little hairs or fibers that kind of look

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
little hairs or fibers that kind of look
like<00:02:11.819> little<00:02:12.180> hairs<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.510> there<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
like little hairs in there in the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830 
like little hairs in there in the
between<00:02:13.349> these<00:02:13.590> two<00:02:13.890> pieces<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.599> here

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
between these two pieces like this here

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.920 
between these two pieces like this here
between<00:02:16.440> these<00:02:16.739> two<00:02:16.800> here<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.760> how<00:02:18.690> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
between these two here and how that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.809 
between these two here and how that
works<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:19.769> make<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> rubber<00:02:20.550> boot

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
works and how they make a rubber boot

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.509 
works and how they make a rubber boot
breathe<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.769> foot<00:02:23.069> moves

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
breathe is they as your foot moves

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.080 
breathe is they as your foot moves
through<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> boot<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.870> steps<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.280> you

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
through the boot and steps and and you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.940 
through the boot and steps and and you
know<00:02:27.209> your<00:02:27.750> foot<00:02:27.959> moves<00:02:28.140> back<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.620> forth<00:02:28.830> in

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
know your foot moves back and forth in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.190 
know your foot moves back and forth in
the<00:02:29.040> boot<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.760> creates<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.269> billows<00:02:30.630> effect<00:02:30.989> so

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the boot it creates a billows effect so

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.110 
the boot it creates a billows effect so
what<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.470> does<00:02:31.680> these<00:02:31.950> hairs<00:02:32.310> trap<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.910> air

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
what it does these hairs trap the air

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.210 
what it does these hairs trap the air
and<00:02:33.510> they<00:02:33.599> create<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.989> pocket<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> air<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:35.160> that

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
and they create a pocket of air in that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.910 
and they create a pocket of air in that
pocket<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.300> air<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:38.340> allows<00:02:38.670> air<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.450> circulate

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
pocket of air it allows air to circulate

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.610 
pocket of air it allows air to circulate
so<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.130> not<00:02:41.250> foot<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.239> rubber<00:02:42.510> that's<00:02:43.170> where

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
so it's not foot on rubber that's where

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.680 
so it's not foot on rubber that's where
that's<00:02:44.129> where<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.400> big<00:02:44.790> huge<00:02:45.180> difference<00:02:45.569> is

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
that's where the big huge difference is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
that's where the big huge difference is
and<00:02:45.840> that's<00:02:45.959> where<00:02:46.200> muck<00:02:46.920> boot<00:02:47.160> has<00:02:47.400> done

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
and that's where muck boot has done

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.910 
and that's where muck boot has done
something<00:02:48.120> different<00:02:48.599> it's<00:02:48.989> not<00:02:49.260> foot<00:02:49.680> on

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
something different it's not foot on

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.370 
something different it's not foot on
rubber<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.849> foot<00:02:51.239> with<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> cushion<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.290> air

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
rubber it's foot with a cushion of air

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.690 
rubber it's foot with a cushion of air
all<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.650> way<00:02:52.769> around<00:02:53.099> it<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.519> your

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
all the way around it it's like your

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.250 
all the way around it it's like your
your<00:02:54.060> foot<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.329> in<00:02:54.360> bubble<00:02:54.780> wrap<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.110> has

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
your foot is in bubble wrap or has

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.830 
your foot is in bubble wrap or has
bubble<00:02:55.560> wrap<00:02:55.739> around<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:57.239> then<00:02:57.630> every

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
bubble wrap around it and then every

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.720 
bubble wrap around it and then every
time<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.170> step<00:02:58.470> i'll<00:02:59.099> put<00:02:59.310> pressure<00:02:59.549> on

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
time you step i'll put pressure on

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.490 
time you step i'll put pressure on
different<00:03:00.090> points<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.420> boot<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:01.049> creates

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
different points of the boot it creates

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.500 
different points of the boot it creates
a<00:03:01.590> billows<00:03:01.980> effect<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.640> starts<00:03:03.090> circulating

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
a billows effect and starts circulating

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.750 
a billows effect and starts circulating
the<00:03:03.930> air<00:03:03.959> throughout<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> boot<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.489> it's<00:03:05.640> very

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the air throughout the boot so it's very

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.880 
the air throughout the boot so it's very
very<00:03:06.000> simple<00:03:06.269> design<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.500> does<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> very

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
very simple design but it does a very

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.199 
very simple design but it does a very
complicated<00:03:08.340> task

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
complicated task

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.390 
complicated task
that's<00:03:09.660> why<00:03:09.900> simply<00:03:10.230> rolling<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> boot<00:03:11.099> down

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
that's why simply rolling the boot down

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.670 
that's why simply rolling the boot down
allows<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.450> billows<00:03:12.900> effect<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.380> get<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
allows that billows effect to get the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.620 
allows that billows effect to get the
air<00:03:13.829> out<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.700> allows<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.209> suck<00:03:15.450> in

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
air out and it allows it to suck in

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.610 
air out and it allows it to suck in
fresh<00:03:15.959> air<00:03:16.340> all<00:03:17.340> at<00:03:17.670> once<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.600> sooner<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.109> air

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
fresh air all at once the sooner the air

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.129 
fresh air all at once the sooner the air
can<00:03:19.889> get<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:21.540> sooner<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.989> can

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
can get out the sooner it can

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.800 
can get out the sooner it can
recirculate<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.220> cooler<00:03:23.579> it's<00:03:23.700> gonna<00:03:23.819> be<00:03:24.090> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
recirculate the cooler it's gonna be so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.509 
recirculate the cooler it's gonna be so
that's<00:03:25.139> why<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.440> offers<00:03:26.040> different

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
that's why this offers different

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.569 
that's why this offers different
temperature<00:03:26.940> ranges<00:03:28.010> rolled<00:03:29.010> down<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.400> this

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
temperature ranges rolled down like this

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.910 
temperature ranges rolled down like this
is<00:03:29.760> great<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.299> it's<00:03:30.959> cold<00:03:31.230> are<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.560> gonna<00:03:31.709> go

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
is great if it's cold are you gonna go

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.099 
is great if it's cold are you gonna go
atv<00:03:32.459> riding<00:03:32.700> or<00:03:33.150> something<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.690> that

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
atv riding or something like that

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.979 
atv riding or something like that
these<00:03:34.380> boots<00:03:34.590> are<00:03:34.769> great<00:03:34.889> for<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.220> hunting

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
these boots are great for that hunting

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.530 
these boots are great for that hunting
