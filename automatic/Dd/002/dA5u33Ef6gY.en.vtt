00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.640
 a year and a half ago 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.209
 I live here that I paint here 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.929
 the meeting with guarantee was like a 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:23.619
 a bit like a revelation because in 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:30.309
 general I work with a black and white 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:33.610
 alone but really life from 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:36.760
 colors and was to come to Barranquilla 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.850
 It was like discovering that life has 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.479
 really colors graffiti the street 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.290
 art is not learned in school 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.290
 school on the street 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.040
 it is an open door for all 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.110
 which is like the triumph in 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.660
 canyon of the streets of 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.390
 barranquilla 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:10.460
 return by his pistol to kiss that I do not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.460
 I go and killed 0-1 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.810
 There was always a curiosity 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.880
 paint great show you a message after 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.439
 MetroClub another to see 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.480
 and I said well I'm going to start painting 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.220
 on the street 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.780
 but I have to start painting as with 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.510
 an image that people feel 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.220
 some relationship design and then I thought 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.050
 in that image of the monalisa because I 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.640
 he said like that even though people do not 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.800
 know a lot about the history of 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.530
 art is a very media image very very 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.530
 influenced like rap also something 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.900
 that at that time happened we started to 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.090
 watch YouTube videos and see it 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.820
 already like us in other cities of 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.820
 painted and behind the murals and the same 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 I stretch this mobility that I like 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.710
 in Barranquilla because it's the graphite 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.530
 graffiti artists who are super motivated but 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:13.210
 very good but they are not closed 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.960
 I think I'm going to change maybe 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.960
 in style
