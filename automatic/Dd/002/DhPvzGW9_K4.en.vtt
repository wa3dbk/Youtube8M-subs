that<00:06:08.610> whether<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:09.509> dancing<00:06:09.930> is<00:06:10.050> the<00:06:10.139> main

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
that whether the dancing is the main

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.469 
that whether the dancing is the main
part<00:06:10.440> or<00:06:10.620> not<00:06:10.770> I<00:06:11.070> mean<00:06:11.490> that's<00:06:11.789> Taemin's

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
part or not I mean that's Taemin's

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.230
