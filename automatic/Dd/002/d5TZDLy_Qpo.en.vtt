00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.890
 hello guys how are we here 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.410
 survivor in a new video and in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.830
 this case, we are still on the path to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.689
 hunter in farc there are 3 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.190
 Well, apparently in this mission 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.320
 we have to hunt a black panther 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:39.500
 It's worth a house with a bow very well, so let's go 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.330
 it to see if now the villain kills us 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 because a panther is usually quick 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.660
 well, let's go there 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.660
 by small view of someone 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.670
 if it does not attack me some bug is prevented 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670
 something 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.010
 beautiful 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.009
 ok let's hunt to brightness what 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.009
 we found near 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.560
 it comes to a room 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.950
 always the camera very useful but there and 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:33.149
 we have new panther found 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.149
 what we want 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.130
 it looks like the hand of a leopard to see 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.130
 see see 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.490
 and they should keep looking good just in case 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.490
 that later we 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.219
 will that 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.820
 let's go down in silent mode 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.050
 to see how 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.050
 if it is we are going to put 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.220
 yes yes possible as can be seen is black 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.220
 obviously the flag 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.890
 behind 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.130
 and from which I liberate giblets to the step 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.150
 You leave the bug to fuck when it's over 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.450
 this mission is very careful 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.950
 since as you just saw water as 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.650
 the panterita is spent 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.879
 power 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.280
 but good as here as you see a couple of 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.330
 arrows so dodging the jumping 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.210
 to one side or the other 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.260
 well 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.810
 you can kill her easily I hope that you 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.050
 have liked the video thank you for watching me 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.460
 guys, hello 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.460
 and until another video
