00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
nuclear equation of state that's kind of

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.050 
nuclear equation of state that's kind of
a<00:00:28.289> mouthful<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.190> means<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.820> tried

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
a mouthful what that means is we tried

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.630 
a mouthful what that means is we tried
to<00:00:30.210> measure<00:00:30.920> proton<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.129> neutron<00:00:32.219> emission

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
to measure proton and neutron emission

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.260 
to measure proton and neutron emission
from<00:00:33.950> basically<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.070> condensed<00:00:35.730> region<00:00:36.150> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
from basically a condensed region of

nuclei<00:00:39.380> basically<00:00:40.380> what<00:00:40.560> we<00:00:40.680> were<00:00:40.800> looking<00:00:41.130> at

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
nuclei basically what we were looking at

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.639 
nuclei basically what we were looking at
was<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.790> equation<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.390> State<00:00:42.649> specifically

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
was the equation of State specifically

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.410 
was the equation of State specifically
the<00:00:43.800> asymmetry<00:00:44.160> term<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.880> equation<00:00:45.090> of

the asymmetry term of the equation of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.639 
the asymmetry term of the equation of
State<00:00:45.630> now<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.930> does<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> equation<00:00:46.559> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
State now what does the equation of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.160 
State now what does the equation of
State<00:00:46.890> mean<00:00:47.190> everything<00:00:48.149> has<00:00:48.360> an<00:00:48.600> equation<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
State mean everything has an equation of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.290 
State mean everything has an equation of
state<00:00:49.530> what<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> means<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.550> how<00:00:50.670> stiff<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> it

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
state what that means is how stiff is it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
state what that means is how stiff is it
how<00:00:51.780> much<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.380> to<00:00:52.530> push<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
how much do you have to push on it to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.100 
how much do you have to push on it to
get<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.700> to<00:00:53.910> compress<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.450> much<00:00:54.600> work<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
get it to compress how much work do you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.500 
get it to compress how much work do you
have<00:00:55.200> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.890> compress<00:00:56.270> is<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
have to do to get it to compress is the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.139 
have to do to get it to compress is the
equation<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> state<00:00:58.200> soft<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:59.040> a<00:00:59.070> sponge<00:00:59.520> or

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
equation of state soft like a sponge or

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360 
equation of state soft like a sponge or
is<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> very<00:01:00.570> hard<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> bowling<00:01:02.040> ball<00:01:02.340> for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
is it very hard like a bowling ball for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.309 
is it very hard like a bowling ball for
example<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.600> we're<00:01:03.780> attempting<00:01:04.079> to

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:04.319 
example and so we're attempting to

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.469 
example and so we're attempting to
understand<00:01:04.889> the<00:01:05.039> equation<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.579> state<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.030> what

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
understand the equation of state of what

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
understand the equation of state of what
we<00:01:06.569> call<00:01:06.749> neutron<00:01:07.170> stars<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:08.069> they<00:01:08.249> soft<00:01:08.549> or

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
we call neutron stars are they soft or

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.819 
we call neutron stars are they soft or
are<00:01:08.939> they<00:01:09.090> stiff<00:01:09.539> how<00:01:10.139> do<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.380> measure<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
are they stiff how do we measure that

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.620 
are they stiff how do we measure that
well<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.340> equation<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.819> state<00:01:11.999> also<00:01:12.179> works<00:01:12.479> in

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
well the equation of state also works in

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.160 
well the equation of state also works in

we<00:01:14.009> measure<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.399> equation<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> State<00:01:15.119> by

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we measure the equation of State by

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
we measure the equation of State by
looking<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:15.840> number<00:01:16.079> of<00:01:16.109> protons<00:01:16.649> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
looking at the number of protons and

looking at the number of protons and
neutrons<00:01:17.249> that<00:01:17.609> come<00:01:17.819> out<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.149> excited

they come out more slowly that means the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
state is soft that was basically the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.559 
state is soft that was basically the
fundamental<00:01:29.520> principle<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.450> were

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
fundamental principle that we were

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.289 
fundamental principle that we were
trying<00:01:30.779> to<00:01:30.899> get<00:01:31.109> at<00:01:31.289> with<00:01:31.499> this<00:01:31.649> experiment

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
trying to get at with this experiment

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.269 
trying to get at with this experiment
the<00:01:33.299> result<00:01:33.959> is<00:01:34.109> actually<00:01:34.229> still<00:01:34.709> subject<00:01:35.219> to

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:35.279 
the result is actually still subject to

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:37.339 
the result is actually still subject to
interpretation<00:01:35.719> because<00:01:36.719> we<00:01:36.869> work<00:01:37.020> closely

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
interpretation because we work closely

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:40.330 
interpretation because we work closely
with<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.889> theorists<00:01:38.520> who<00:01:38.969> give<00:01:39.209> us<00:01:39.389> an<00:01:39.599> idea

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
with the theorists who give us an idea

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
with the theorists who give us an idea
they<00:01:41.340> tell<00:01:41.579> us<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.969> see<00:01:42.179> something<00:01:42.749> that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
they tell us if you see something that

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.749 
they tell us if you see something that
tells<00:01:43.679> you<00:01:43.829> something<00:01:43.859> else<00:01:44.369> about<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
tells you something else about the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.599 
tells you something else about the
equation<00:01:45.209> of<00:01:45.299> state<00:01:45.599> and<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.679> what<00:01:47.099> we<00:01:47.310> tried

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
equation of state and so what we tried

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.249 
equation of state and so what we tried
to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.849> is<00:01:47.969> actually<00:01:48.149> take<00:01:48.509> our<00:01:48.719> results<00:01:49.169> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to do is actually take our results and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.239 
to do is actually take our results and
feed<00:01:49.889> them<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.659> other<00:01:51.659> theorists<00:01:52.289> to

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
feed them to other theorists to

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.219 
feed them to other theorists to
constrain<00:01:53.729> their<00:01:53.880> theories<00:01:54.329> even<00:01:54.509> more<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
constrain their theories even more and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.529 
constrain their theories even more and
so<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.549> were<00:01:56.700> able<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.479> were

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
so what we were able to do is we were

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.089 
so what we were able to do is we were
able<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.869> take<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> result<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.829> tell<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
able to take this result and tell the

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.339 
able to take this result and tell the
theorists<00:01:59.429> this<00:01:59.669> is<00:01:59.849> what<00:01:59.999> we<00:02:00.119> observe<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
theorists this is what we observe the

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.440 
theorists this is what we observe the
theorists<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:01.979> take<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.459> and<00:02:02.849> we<00:02:03.060> also<00:02:03.209> do

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
theorists then take that and we also do

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.569 
theorists then take that and we also do
our<00:02:03.599> own<00:02:03.749> theory<00:02:04.169> and<00:02:04.349> say<00:02:04.799> okay<00:02:05.279> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
our own theory and say okay that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.260 
our own theory and say okay that

we could have the experiments that we

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.800 
we could have the experiments that we
ran<00:02:12.040> are<00:02:12.220> basically<00:02:12.550> set<00:02:12.880> up<00:02:13.000> very<00:02:13.270> similar<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.940 
what you see behind me there's basically
a<00:02:16.120> few<00:02:16.420> fundamental<00:02:17.020> things<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.800> to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
a few fundamental things that we have to

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.650 
a few fundamental things that we have to
measure<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.000> measure<00:02:19.120> neutrons

measure we have to measure neutrons

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.840 
measure we have to measure neutrons
neutrons<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:20.560> about<00:02:20.740> seven<00:02:21.370> meters<00:02:21.640> behind

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
neutrons are about seven meters behind

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.330 
neutrons are about seven meters behind
me<00:02:22.210> these<00:02:22.390> large<00:02:22.660> walls<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.220> measure

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
me these large walls we have to measure

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.800 
me these large walls we have to measure
protons<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.150> those<00:02:25.270> are<00:02:25.420> measured<00:02:25.720> in

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
protons and those are measured in

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.720 
protons and those are measured in
charged<00:02:26.110> particle<00:02:26.650> detectors<00:02:27.160> which<00:02:27.340> are<00:02:27.490> put

close<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.210> our<00:02:28.540> target<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.710> also<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.310> get

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
close to our target we also have to get

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.430 
close to our target we also have to get
an<00:02:30.550> idea<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.940> how<00:02:31.060> violent<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.810> collision<00:02:32.290> is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
an idea of how violent the collision is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.070 
an idea of how violent the collision is
why<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.490> necessary<00:02:34.150> because<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.780> need<00:02:34.960> to

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
why is that necessary because we need to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.260 
why is that necessary because we need to
know<00:02:35.200> how<00:02:35.380> dense<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:36.310> excited<00:02:36.910> nuclear

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
know how dense this excited nuclear

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.420 
know how dense this excited nuclear
region<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.200> only<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> most<00:02:38.860> violent

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
region is and only the most violent

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.370 
region is and only the most violent
collisions<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.090> most<00:02:40.240> central<00:02:40.780> collisions

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
collisions the most central collisions

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.140 
collisions the most central collisions
if<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.650> will<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> most<00:02:42.100> head-on<00:02:42.520> collisions

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
if you will the most head-on collisions

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.570 
if you will the most head-on collisions
will<00:02:43.690> allow<00:02:43.870> us<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.110> measure<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.800> so<00:02:45.250> we<00:02:45.370> have

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
will allow us to measure that so we have

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.790 
will allow us to measure that so we have
these<00:02:45.700> three<00:02:46.030> fundamental<00:02:46.350> components<00:02:47.350> for

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
these three fundamental components for

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.430 
these three fundamental components for
our<00:02:47.830> experiment<00:02:48.520> we<00:02:48.760> measure<00:02:49.030> neutrons<00:02:50.020> we

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
our experiment we measure neutrons we

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.110 
our experiment we measure neutrons we
measure<00:02:50.650> protons<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.459> then<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:51.910> measure

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
measure protons and then we measure

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.640 
measure protons and then we measure
essentially<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.080> violence<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
essentially the violence of the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.199 
essentially the violence of the
collision<00:02:54.070> by<00:02:54.160> how<00:02:54.370> many<00:02:54.550> particles<00:02:54.910> are

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
collision by how many particles are

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.150 
collision by how many particles are
coming<00:02:55.360> out<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.900> collision<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.740> can

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
coming out of the collision you can

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.650 
coming out of the collision you can
imagine<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.970> collision<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.450> very

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
imagine that if the collision is very

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.720 
imagine that if the collision is very
central<00:02:59.110> if<00:02:59.290> it's<00:02:59.440> head-on<00:02:59.890> you're<00:03:00.490> gonna<00:03:00.580> get

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
central if it's head-on you're gonna get

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.460 
central if it's head-on you're gonna get
a<00:03:00.790> lot<00:03:01.030> of<00:03:01.150> particles<00:03:01.540> coming<00:03:01.750> out<00:03:01.900> if<00:03:02.200> it's

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
a lot of particles coming out if it's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.320 
a lot of particles coming out if it's
just<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.770> glancing<00:03:03.280> collision<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.910> grazing

how do they do that well gravity holds
them<00:04:21.110> together<00:04:21.290> what<00:04:22.250> keeps<00:04:22.520> them<00:04:22.730> from

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
them together what keeps them from

collapsing into a black hole is this

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.200 
collapsing into a black hole is this

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
repulsive nuclear force and that is what

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.060 
repulsive nuclear force and that is what

we call the asymmetry term of the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.500 
we call the asymmetry term of the
equation<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.670> state<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.120> that's<00:04:38.240> what<00:04:38.390> we're

equation of state and that's what we're

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
trying to study that's what we're trying

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.040 
trying to study that's what we're trying

I always tell people especially when I'm
talking<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.140> children<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.830> I'm<00:04:46.040> a

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
talking to children that I'm a

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.310 
talking to children that I'm a
professional<00:04:46.430> failure<00:04:47.300> what<00:04:47.930> does<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.050> mean

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
professional failure what does that mean

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.680 
professional failure what does that mean
that<00:04:48.560> means<00:04:48.740> 90%<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.550> everything<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.030> do<00:04:50.090> does

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
that means 90% of everything I do does

not<00:04:50.720> work<00:04:51.230> we<00:04:51.800> spend<00:04:52.040> a<00:04:52.100> lot<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.310> time

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
not work we spend a lot of time

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.460 
not work we spend a lot of time
basically<00:04:53.000> what<00:04:53.540> I<00:04:53.570> call<00:04:53.780> beating<00:04:54.200> on<00:04:54.350> the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
basically what I call beating on the

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.380 
basically what I call beating on the
equipment<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:55.310> get<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.670> work<00:04:55.790> correctly<00:04:56.210> we

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
equipment to get it to work correctly we

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.120 
equipment to get it to work correctly we
take<00:04:56.570> it<00:04:56.690> apart<00:04:56.990> we<00:04:57.290> do<00:04:57.470> something<00:04:57.800> else<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.100> it

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
take it apart we do something else to it

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.650 
take it apart we do something else to it
we<00:04:58.340> put<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.550> back<00:04:58.730> in<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.270> it<00:04:59.450> seemed<00:04:59.630> like

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
we put it back in and it seemed like

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.270 
we put it back in and it seemed like
these<00:04:59.930> experiments<00:05:00.500> in<00:05:00.560> particular<00:05:01.070> because

these experiments in particular because
they<00:05:01.400> have<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:01.700> many<00:05:01.820> different<00:05:01.940> components

what I like to do is remind people that

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.060 
what I like to do is remind people that
it<00:05:32.600> was<00:05:32.750> scientists<00:05:33.440> physicists

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
x-rays they invented the MRI these are

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.870 
x-rays they invented the MRI these are
things<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.260> as<00:05:45.560> physicists<00:05:46.130> we<00:05:46.250> do<00:05:46.370> not<00:05:46.490> set

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
things that as physicists we do not set

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.969 
things that as physicists we do not set
out<00:05:46.910> to<00:05:47.060> do<00:05:47.780> we<00:05:48.050> don't<00:05:48.169> get<00:05:48.380> up<00:05:48.500> in<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.710> morning

out to do we don't get up in the morning
and<00:05:49.070> say<00:05:49.190> I'm<00:05:49.310> going<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.700> invent<00:05:50.000> something<00:05:50.680> we

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
and say I'm going to invent something we

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.990 
and say I'm going to invent something we
do<00:05:51.800> get<00:05:51.979> up<00:05:52.070> in<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:52.280> morning<00:05:52.550> and<00:05:52.640> say<00:05:52.790> I'm

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
do get up in the morning and say I'm

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.570 
do get up in the morning and say I'm
interested<00:05:53.479> in<00:05:53.600> a<00:05:53.690> problem<00:05:53.930> and<00:05:54.350> by<00:05:55.010> studying

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
interested in a problem and by studying

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.190 
interested in a problem and by studying
this<00:05:55.729> problem<00:05:56.240> we<00:05:56.570> end<00:05:56.720> up<00:05:56.840> making<00:05:56.990> a

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
this problem we end up making a

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.080 
this problem we end up making a
contribution<00:05:57.560> to<00:05:58.010> society<00:05:58.040> that<00:05:58.669> maybe<00:05:58.910> we

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
contribution to society that maybe we

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.630 
contribution to society that maybe we
didn't<00:05:59.330> set<00:05:59.510> out<00:05:59.540> to<00:05:59.870> do<00:06:00.020> but<00:06:00.620> benefit<00:06:01.430> society

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
didn't set out to do but benefit society

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.480 
didn't set out to do but benefit society
nonetheless<00:06:02.180> in<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.320> future<00:06:03.650> we<00:06:04.160> hope<00:06:04.310> that

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
nonetheless in the future we hope that

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.719 
nonetheless in the future we hope that
do<00:06:04.640> things<00:06:04.850> like<00:06:05.030> a<00:06:05.240> commercial<00:06:06.020> fusion

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
do things like a commercial fusion

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.400 
do things like a commercial fusion
basically<00:06:07.729> making<00:06:07.940> energy<00:06:08.180> free<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:09.290> the

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
basically making energy free to the

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.710 
basically making energy free to the
entire<00:06:09.710> planet<00:06:10.250> we<00:06:10.940> hope<00:06:11.090> to<00:06:11.210> do<00:06:11.330> things<00:06:11.540> like

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
entire planet we hope to do things like

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.440 
entire planet we hope to do things like
increasing<00:06:12.470> the<00:06:12.560> speed<00:06:12.800> of<00:06:12.979> detectors<00:06:13.550> that

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
increasing the speed of detectors that

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.200 
increasing the speed of detectors that
has<00:06:14.600> direct<00:06:15.760> non-invasive<00:06:16.760> medical
