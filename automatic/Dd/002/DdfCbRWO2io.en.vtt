00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.769
 I probably like everyone interested 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.850
 the same question why our 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.340
 Ukrainian roads 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.410
 always do where it is not so important 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.230
 maybe just ukravtodor 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.300
 choose the easiest solutions why 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.739
 do a whole new way when 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.649
 you can do well how to earn much 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.270
 more than filled with repairs who 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.030
 calculates the amount spent 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.309
 asphalt on such sites 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.890
 before you the road to the Crimea is perfect and 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.629
 even has fresh intelligence you probably 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.129
 Now it occurred to me that I was speaking from 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.640
 roads in the occupied territory 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.829
 Crimea 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.780
 and here it is not thorough 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.269
 repaired side road 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.100
 Ukraine at the entrance border peninsula 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.659
 who needed to do this 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.269
 direction remains a mystery 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:00.309
 but I assure you that millions of our money 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.309
 were spent erroneously 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.360
 And this dear viewers our Melitopol 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.980
 understand the difference i won't give 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.980
 comment you all see for yourself
