00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.260
 all right 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.780
 Hello everyone, today I'm going to show you my 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.240
 daily makeup routine sometimes 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.890
 change depending on the day I'll put in the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.890
 description of the products below 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.180
 when you get up you need to use a 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.890
 facial cleanser i use micellar water 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.900
 of bioderma for fast cleaning 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.580
 slight but effective skin because 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.990
 it is very practical in this sense and 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.520
 considering that you already washed the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.980
 face with a cleaner the day before 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.720
 is enough tonic clinics serving 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.460
 to reduce pores and prepare the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.900
 skin for the moisturizer by product in 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.730
 the one that you can invest that is also the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.890
 best primer is a protective cream 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.840
 solar there are many formulas without oils 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.660
 that therefore do not give fat is the case of 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.640
 or lack with protection factor 90 ma 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.290
 clip conditioner is a test is 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.790
 lips make the wrinkles of the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.960
 radios and prepares them for any 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.960
 lipstick that you use after 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.899
 then I use the mac makeup base 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 study scout foundation in the tone of 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.070
 nc 37 what I like about him is the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.140
 iridescent finish that leaves on the cheeks 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.509
 I would say it's a cover makeup 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.430
 medium high but not too dry is not 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.720
 cracks on the contrary the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.090
 result is a beautiful brillito 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.549
 natural I have tried many and always 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.229
 I love again saying this if you have the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.299
 Oily skin may you prefer another base 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.009
 Matt matt finish make sure 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.580
 extend it well by working in circles 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580
 with the brush 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.280
 next step the fixing powders of 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.810
 make a forever are the best me 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.400
 applied all over the face to make 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 the makeup lasts longer 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.420
 to apply them I love the brush of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.210
 technical dial blushes because 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 it has the perfect size something important 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.820
 is to give a little pat with him instead 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.820
 to drag the brush 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.880
 now applied the product silver that's 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.159
 the mac 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.860
 It is a powder illuminator with pigments 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.900
 brilliant 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.520
 adds a shine to nacreous that does not have 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.060
 what to do with the glitter but if it is 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.060
 perceptible 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.450
 I apply it with the brush for the contour 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.170
 also of real techniques first in the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.790
 bone and cheeks on the chin 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.610
 between the eyebrows and finally in the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.750
 bridge of the nose be careful little 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.750
 product gives a lot 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 then I use the rouge powder 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.090
 nars in the orgasm tone come to this 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.220
 beautiful color that comes to be a rose 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.630
 golden finish peach illuminates 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.130
 very much cheeks and I think that 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.960
 it would look good with any skin tone 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.760
 it is important to extend it well with the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.710
 brush and talking about brushes i what 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.960
 I apply with laia screeched of perfectly 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.850
 and half level is great because it takes 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.170
 the fair amount of product actually 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.670
 it's the only brush that I have that I do not 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.260
 they would be technical and it 's because yours 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.150
 colonet is too big for 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.930
 cheeks and yet it 's perfect for 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.930
 bronzing powder 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.190
 time to remove the cocoa 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.730
 we go with the lips what I love 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.129
 of this profiler that is the current it 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.349
 of make up forever in tone 1 ce es 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.230
 which is very creamy waterproof easy to 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:28.060
 apply and finally the matte finish me 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.060
 love everything you say is little 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.620
 the color is a brownish ros that is 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.620
 perfectly adapts to the color of the lip 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.650
 I highly recommend it in this 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.650
 any other color 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.180
 we are almost finished, we go to the 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.879
 eyes 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.560
 this is the shadow cuadri mate marc la 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.629
 I apply with the shadow beige brush 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.400
 rial techniques that comes in the case 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.739
 of eyes of this same brand and that is my 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.329
 preferred of the entire collection not the 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.980
 applied all over the mobile eyelid but 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.980
 only at the end to open the eye 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.440
 the shades of a brownish gray 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.440
 perfect for every day 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.720
 do not tighten too much if you pretend 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.459
 extend it along the cavity of 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.459
 eye the movement is from one side to another 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.240
 mascara 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.130
 right now I'm using realtech 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.200
 benefit that has a very practical brush 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.169
 it does not convince me at all because 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.729
 unfortunately leaves lumps that is a 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.470
 very intense black and lasts a lot 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.210
 really is amazing is needed 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.470
 good makeup remover to remove it 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.540
 I apply on the end of the lashes 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.979
 for a more natural effect the trick is 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.280
 leave the brush still and only move the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.280
 tabs 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.169
 Last but not least, take 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.150
 the lacquer and an eyebrow brush mix 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.220
 there all the same to have a brow gel 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.199
 with this the eyebrows do not move at all 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.060
 the day moves the brush up in 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.680
 the first half of each and of a 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.160
 side by side as you reach the end 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.160
 of the eyebrow 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.150
 and there is already a makeup very very 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:12.150
 resplendent good face effect 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.420
 I hope you liked to continue in
