here are given a variety of challenges
every<00:00:48.899> day<00:00:49.489> experiments<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> problems<00:00:51.270> they

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
every day experiments and problems they

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
every day experiments and problems they
have<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.570> solve<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.890> helps<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.430> many<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.760> the

have to solve it helps that many of the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
have to solve it helps that many of the
classrooms<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.629> laptops<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.620> students

like<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.680> why<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.430> take<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.909> away

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
like that so why do we take that away

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.719 
like that so why do we take that away
from<00:01:33.210> them<00:01:33.560> when<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.680> come<00:01:34.799> into<00:01:34.979> school<00:01:35.070> are

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
