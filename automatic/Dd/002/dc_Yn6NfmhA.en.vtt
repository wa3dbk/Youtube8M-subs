00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
single joint on this robot here I even

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.729 
single joint on this robot here I even
did<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.719> we're<00:00:46.020> gonna<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.530> another

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
did it so we're gonna do it for another

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.619 
did it so we're gonna do it for another
test<00:00:47.010> drive<00:00:47.280> although<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.000> won't<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.329> anything

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
test drive although I won't do anything

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
test drive although I won't do anything
bad<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.469> gonna<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.739> some<00:00:49.890> fun<00:00:50.090> all

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
right so this is the interface and what

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
right so this is the interface and what
I'm<00:00:52.980> looking<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:54.059> looking

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I'm looking at right now is I'm looking

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
I'm looking at right now is I'm looking
for<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.809> eyes<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.620> PackBot<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.699> see

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
for the eyes of PackBot and you can see

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.279 
for the eyes of PackBot and you can see
it's<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> little<00:00:57.090> gripper<00:00:57.600> there<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
it's a little gripper there and if I

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.830 
it's a little gripper there and if I
wanted<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> drive<00:00:59.520> that's<00:01:00.000> medium<00:01:00.390> let's<00:01:00.690> go

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
wanted to drive that's medium let's go

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
wanted to drive that's medium let's go
slow<00:01:01.140> I'm<00:01:01.410> basically<00:01:01.949> steering<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> gives<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
slow I'm basically steering it gives you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179 
slow I'm basically steering it gives you
a<00:01:02.940> predictive<00:01:03.420> path<00:01:03.690> now<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.290> also<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a predictive path now I can also do the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.969 
a predictive path now I can also do the
auto<00:01:05.400> drive<00:01:05.820> where<00:01:06.210> if<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.750> point<00:01:07.080> where<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
auto drive where if I point where that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
auto drive where if I point where that
blue<00:01:08.189> dot<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.820> where<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.150> gonna<00:01:09.299> drive

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
blue dot is is where it's gonna drive

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
blue dot is is where it's gonna drive
and<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.200> pointed<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.890> founding<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and I just pointed so it's founding a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
and I just pointed so it's founding a
new<00:01:11.490> path<00:01:11.700> any<00:01:12.150> point<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.990> hit<00:01:13.140> stop<00:01:13.350> let's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
new path any point I can hit stop let's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
new path any point I can hit stop let's
get<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> turn<00:01:14.610> around<00:01:14.729> though<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
get it to turn around though so a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.100 
get it to turn around though so a
turning<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:20.009> fast

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.560 

all<00:01:24.710> right<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.100> I'm<00:01:25.190> controlling<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:26.360> if<00:01:26.480> I

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
all right so I'm controlling but if I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.230 
all right so I'm controlling but if I
also<00:01:26.780> wanted<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.500> do<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.860> number<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.310> preset<00:01:28.970> I

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
also wanted to do a number of preset I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.180 
also wanted to do a number of preset I
don't<00:01:29.540> even<00:01:29.630> have<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.900> figure<00:01:29.930> out<00:01:30.500> like<00:01:30.920> oh

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
don't even have to figure out like oh

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.700 
don't even have to figure out like oh
well<00:01:31.760> how<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.150> move<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:32.930> joint<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.470> that

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
well how do I move that joint and that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.680 
well how do I move that joint and that
joint<00:01:34.010> in<00:01:34.160> that<00:01:34.400> joint<00:01:34.730> I<00:01:34.880> want<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.240> set<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.420> for

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690

the<00:01:42.770> way<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.070> works<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.790> all<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.510> your<00:01:44.660> irobot

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
the way this works is all of your irobot

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.890 
the way this works is all of your irobot
assets<00:01:46.130> are<00:01:46.430> controlled<00:01:46.970> through<00:01:47.090> one<00:01:47.450> app<00:01:47.660> so

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
assets are controlled through one app so

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.900 
assets are controlled through one app so
I'm<00:01:48.020> gonna<00:01:48.140> switch<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.590> up<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.130> assets<00:01:49.550> tape

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
I'm gonna switch it up to assets tape

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.060 
I'm gonna switch it up to assets tape
control<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.720> first-look<00:01:51.230> robot<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.830> once

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
control the first-look robot and once

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.830

again<00:01:52.220> I'm<00:01:52.700> controlling<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.600> have<00:01:53.720> to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
again I'm controlling it you have to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.050 
again I'm controlling it you have to
understand<00:01:54.350> what<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.860> used<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.460> be<00:01:55.700> with<00:01:55.940> these

give<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.710> shot<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.260> high-tech

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
give it a shot so this is high-tech

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.620 
give it a shot so this is high-tech
stuff<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.520> also<00:02:57.700> expensive<00:02:58.300> stuff<00:02:58.450> this

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
stuff and it's also expensive stuff this

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.620 
stuff and it's also expensive stuff this
is<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:58.960> for<00:02:59.170> everybody<00:02:59.380> so<00:02:59.770> 100,000<00:03:00.520> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
is not for everybody so 100,000 to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.900 
is not for everybody so 100,000 to
150,000<00:03:01.630> depending<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.440> configuration<00:03:02.910> but
