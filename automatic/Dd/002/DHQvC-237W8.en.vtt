project<00:00:19.050> i<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.220> quick<00:00:20.400> calculation<00:00:20.810> earlier

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
project i do a quick calculation earlier

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.800 
project i do a quick calculation earlier
on<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.380> i'm<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.830> about<00:00:23.420> forty<00:00:24.420> six

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
on that i'm up to about forty six

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.210 
on that i'm up to about forty six
percent<00:00:24.990> complete<00:00:25.769> that's<00:00:26.699> based<00:00:26.939> on

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
percent complete that's based on

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
percent complete that's based on
calculate<00:00:29.220> percentages<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.090> what<00:00:30.840> I've<00:00:31.019> done

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
calculate percentages of what I've done

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.889 
calculate percentages of what I've done
so<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.309> calculating<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.210> I've<00:00:33.329> about<00:00:33.660> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
so like calculating that I've about this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
so like calculating that I've about this
far<00:00:34.170> done<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.950> part<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.550> ninety

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
far done with one part so like ninety

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
far done with one part so like ninety
percent<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.300> part<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> whatever<00:00:37.200> another

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
percent in one part and whatever another

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.819 
percent in one part and whatever another
and<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.879> yeah<00:00:39.030> ran<00:00:39.239> about<00:00:39.390> forty<00:00:40.110> six<00:00:40.620> percent

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and so yeah ran about forty six percent

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.840 
and so yeah ran about forty six percent
that's<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.750> taken<00:00:43.110> forever<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.469> load<00:00:43.710> duh<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that's just taken forever to load duh I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.420 
that's just taken forever to load duh I
can<00:00:45.090> understand<00:00:45.510> why<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> lot<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
can understand why it's a lot to it and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
can understand why it's a lot to it and
I've<00:00:47.730> done<00:00:47.940> quite<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.360> bit<00:00:48.480> since<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.930> last<00:00:49.110> made

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
I've done quite a bit since i last made

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.750 
I've done quite a bit since i last made
a<00:00:49.379> video<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:50.629> my<00:00:51.629> thing<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> here<00:00:53.280> it's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
a video on my thing so this here it's

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.069 
a video on my thing so this here it's
probably<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> latest<00:00:54.510> edition<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
probably the latest edition and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
probably the latest edition and
obviously<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.949> back<00:00:56.190> section<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.760> which

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
obviously this back section here which

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.540 
obviously this back section here which
are<00:00:57.000> talk<00:00:57.180> about<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> well<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
are talk about it well this here is a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.680 
are talk about it well this here is a
binary<00:01:00.170> decoder<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> i've<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.730> i've<00:01:03.180> decided

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
binary decoder so i've got i've decided

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.890 
binary decoder so i've got i've decided
or<00:01:04.229> i've<00:01:04.860> converted<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.760> system<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> binary

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
or i've converted my system to a binary

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
or i've converted my system to a binary
decoder<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:08.850> binary<00:01:09.860> storage<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.400> binary

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
decoder a binary storage and then binary

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
decoder a binary storage and then binary
decoder<00:01:12.290> because<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.560> lot<00:01:13.740> more

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
decoder because it's a lot more

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.480 
decoder because it's a lot more
efficient<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.930> example<00:01:16.040> that<00:01:17.040> there

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
efficient and so for example that there

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.120 
efficient and so for example that there
is<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.820> character<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> letter<00:01:21.210> M

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
is one character so there is a letter M

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
is one character so there is a letter M
so<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> comes<00:01:23.490> through<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
so when it comes through it because it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.090 
so when it comes through it because it
goes<00:01:24.840> backwards<00:01:25.229> through<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.590> comes<00:01:25.890> back

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
goes backwards through there comes back

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.580 
goes backwards through there comes back
through<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:28.430> will<00:01:29.430> code<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.590> fully

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
through here and will code for fully

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.020 
through here and will code for fully
roundabout<00:01:32.070> hereish<00:01:32.520> M<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.970> was

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
roundabout hereish M which I think I was

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.920 
roundabout hereish M which I think I was
right<00:01:36.270> right<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> money<00:01:37.140> almost<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:38.930> was

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
right right on the money almost I was

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.819 
right right on the money almost I was
how<00:01:40.890> about<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.450> exactly<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:43.079> M<00:01:43.350> what

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
how about that that is exactly a M what

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.429 
how about that that is exactly a M what
do<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.790> yeah<00:01:44.970> that's<00:01:45.479> my<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:46.170> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
do you know so yeah that's my there so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.160 
do you know so yeah that's my there so
it<00:01:46.590> comes<00:01:46.799> through<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:48.479> would<00:01:48.600> code<00:01:48.869> M

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it comes through here it would code M

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.139 
it comes through here it would code M
which<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> M<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.310> currently<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.700> five-by-five

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
which is M is currently a five-by-five

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.289 
which is M is currently a five-by-five
array<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.049> numbers<00:01:52.640> by<00:01:53.640> her<00:01:53.790> trust<00:01:54.000> me<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> did

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
array of numbers by her trust me I did

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.280 
array of numbers by her trust me I did
not<00:01:54.390> scoop<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:54.990> lucky<00:01:55.700> um<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
not scoop that I was just lucky um and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
not scoop that I was just lucky um and
so<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.619> M<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:59.250> come<00:01:59.460> through<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.939> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
so that M will come through on this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.300 
so that M will come through on this
screen<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.590> screen<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.070> these

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
screen here and the screen now these

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.179 
screen here and the screen now these
this<00:02:02.880> bus<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.530> then<00:02:04.530> display<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.100> screen

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this bus and then display on the screen

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
this bus and then display on the screen
now<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.750> looks<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.170> more

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
now you this looks a lot more

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.710 
now you this looks a lot more
complicated<00:02:07.680> than<00:02:08.160> my<00:02:08.940> normal<00:02:09.000> scrolling

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
complicated than my normal scrolling

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.570 
complicated than my normal scrolling
texting<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:10.679> I've<00:02:11.009> added

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
texting and that's because I've added

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.470 
texting and that's because I've added
Shin<00:02:12.730> ality<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.560> three<00:02:14.560> possible<00:02:15.130> speeds<00:02:15.520> on

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
Shin ality for three possible speeds on

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.350 
Shin ality for three possible speeds on
the<00:02:16.540> other<00:02:17.140> thing<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.220> let<00:02:18.730> me<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.970> reset

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
the other thing so let me just reset

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.790 
the other thing so let me just reset
these<00:02:19.480> two<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:21.100> lag<00:02:22.080> I'm<00:02:23.080> going<00:02:23.710> to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
these two that lag I'm going to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.710 
these two that lag I'm going to
eventually<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.220> them<00:02:24.460> connected<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.210> but

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
eventually have them connected in it but

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.500 
eventually have them connected in it but
that's<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.310> just<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.580> manual<00:02:28.000> function<00:02:28.360> so

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
that's this is just a manual function so

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.720 
that's this is just a manual function so
I<00:02:28.570> can<00:02:28.720> play<00:02:28.930> with<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.260> bit<00:02:29.290> more<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.520> like

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
I can play with it a bit more so like

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.020 
I can play with it a bit more so like
for<00:02:31.540> example<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.140> wanted<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.980> be<00:02:33.190> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
for example if I wanted it to be the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.450 
for example if I wanted it to be the
middle<00:02:34.510> speed<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:35.500> two<00:02:35.740> would<00:02:35.860> go<00:02:36.010> down<00:02:36.190> so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
middle speed these two would go down so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.360 
middle speed these two would go down so
that<00:02:36.490> one<00:02:36.820> would<00:02:37.000> go<00:02:37.150> down<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:39.070> won't<00:02:39.220> we

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
that one would go down and that won't we

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.710 
that one would go down and that won't we
go<00:02:39.520> down<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.040> yeah<00:02:42.220> that's<00:02:42.720> that's

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
go down and so yeah that's that's

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.030 
go down and so yeah that's that's
essentially<00:02:44.200> how<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.410> going<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.590> work<00:02:44.650> so

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
essentially how it's going to work so

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.540 
essentially how it's going to work so
i'll<00:02:45.130> probably<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:47.440> another<00:02:47.680> binary<00:02:48.010> system

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
i'll probably have another binary system

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.660 
i'll probably have another binary system
for<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> two-bit<00:02:50.170> system<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
for that so have a two-bit system and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.440 
for that so have a two-bit system and
that<00:02:52.330> would<00:02:52.450> work<00:02:52.480> out<00:02:52.870> perfectly<00:02:52.930> for

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
that would work out perfectly for

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.360 
that would work out perfectly for
functioning<00:02:55.450> which<00:02:55.630> speed<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:57.190> and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
functioning which speed is is on and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.400 
functioning which speed is is on and
which<00:02:57.520> ones<00:02:57.730> are<00:02:57.880> off<00:02:58.110> but<00:02:59.110> I'll<00:02:59.200> worry<00:02:59.350> about

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
which ones are off but I'll worry about

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.480 
which ones are off but I'll worry about
that<00:02:59.560> later<00:02:59.740> so<00:03:01.680> yeah<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:02.980> essentially<00:03:03.280> how

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
that later so yeah so essentially how

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.550 
that later so yeah so essentially how
this<00:03:03.670> back<00:03:03.910> section<00:03:04.120> work<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.110> just

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
this back section work this is just

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.990 
this back section work this is just
basically<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.980> scrolling<00:03:06.400> text<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:06.850> is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
basically the scrolling text this is

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.790 
basically the scrolling text this is
where<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.920> restored<00:03:08.920> why<00:03:09.760> isn't<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.090> on<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
where the restored why isn't that on the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.120 
where the restored why isn't that on the
stored<00:03:12.100> questions<00:03:13.440> why<00:03:14.440> isn't<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:14.950> I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
stored questions why isn't that on I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.630 
stored questions why isn't that on I
worry<00:03:15.459> about<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.760> later<00:03:15.880> but<00:03:17.760> that's<00:03:18.760> not<00:03:18.940> on

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
worry about that later but that's not on

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.670 
worry about that later but that's not on
odd<00:03:21.640> ah<00:03:23.310> i<00:03:24.310> see<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:25.600> line<00:03:25.840> there<00:03:26.170> is<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.530> down

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
odd ah i see that line there is is down

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.860 
odd ah i see that line there is is down
interesting

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.130 

on<00:03:35.470> two<00:03:35.920> seconds<00:03:37.440> that's<00:03:38.440> weird<00:03:40.019> should<00:03:41.019> be

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
on two seconds that's weird should be

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.820 
on two seconds that's weird should be
fixed<00:03:41.590> now<00:03:42.090> yep<00:03:43.110> that's<00:03:44.110> weird<00:03:44.319> I<00:03:44.500> don't<00:03:44.769> know

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
fixed now yep that's weird I don't know

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.830 
fixed now yep that's weird I don't know
why<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.010> did<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.220> all<00:03:46.150> right<00:03:46.299> anyway<00:03:46.720> it's

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
why I did that all right anyway it's

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.070 
why I did that all right anyway it's
fixed<00:03:47.080> now<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:48.010> these<00:03:48.519> here<00:03:48.730> after<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> user

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
fixed now so these here after the user

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.119 
fixed now so these here after the user
inputted<00:03:51.750> responses<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.349> bottom<00:03:53.709> one<00:03:53.860> being

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
inputted responses the bottom one being

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.759 
inputted responses the bottom one being
the<00:03:54.250> first<00:03:54.579> one<00:03:54.819> stored<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:56.200> will<00:03:56.379> go<00:03:56.709> to

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
the first one stored and that will go to

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.509 
the first one stored and that will go to
here<00:03:57.810> since<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.930> read<00:03:59.170> from<00:03:59.440> left<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.400> right

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
here since you read from left to right

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.940 
here since you read from left to right
this<00:04:01.269> will<00:04:01.450> be<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.720> first<00:04:01.959> user<00:04:02.470> inputted

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
this will be the first user inputted

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.100 
this will be the first user inputted
letter<00:04:03.250> which<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.329> come<00:04:04.510> from<00:04:04.659> that<00:04:04.720> bottom

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
letter which you come from that bottom

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.259 
letter which you come from that bottom
row<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:05.620> each<00:04:05.739> row<00:04:06.129> each<00:04:06.519> corresponding<00:04:07.060> row

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
row and each row each corresponding row

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.550 
row and each row each corresponding row
is<00:04:07.540> an<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.489> digit<00:04:09.489> from<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:10.000> here<00:04:10.359> so<00:04:11.109> let's<00:04:11.500> have

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
is an a digit from on here so let's have

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.110 
is an a digit from on here so let's have
a<00:04:11.620> look<00:04:11.680> at<00:04:11.859> the<00:04:11.950> inside<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:12.519> can<00:04:12.609> kind<00:04:13.090> of

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
a look at the inside so you can kind of

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.400 
a look at the inside so you can kind of
see<00:04:13.180> what<00:04:13.390> I'm<00:04:13.450> talking<00:04:13.510> about<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.049> what<00:04:14.290> this

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
see what I'm talking about and what this

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.289 
see what I'm talking about and what this
is<00:04:14.470> all<00:04:14.709> about<00:04:14.739> especially<00:04:15.700> if<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.000> are<00:04:16.090> new

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
is all about especially if you are new

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.670 
is all about especially if you are new
to<00:04:16.329> my<00:04:16.570> system<00:04:17.169> or<00:04:17.410> my<00:04:18.250> project<00:04:19.560> you'll<00:04:20.560> be

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
to my system or my project you'll be

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.960 
to my system or my project you'll be
able<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.859> understand<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.310> better<00:04:21.370> now<00:04:21.669> I<00:04:21.880> don't

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
able to understand it better now I don't

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.730 
able to understand it better now I don't
know<00:04:22.120> why<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.330> lighting<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.050> messed<00:04:23.320> up<00:04:23.470> it's

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
know why the lighting so messed up it's

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.060 
know why the lighting so messed up it's
uh<00:04:23.830> it's<00:04:24.780> something<00:04:25.780> I<00:04:26.139> have<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.380> fix<00:04:26.650> up<00:04:26.830> later

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
uh it's something I have to fix up later

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.689 
uh it's something I have to fix up later
though<00:04:28.229> but<00:04:29.229> yeah<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.800> wasn't<00:04:30.220> like<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.550> in

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
though but yeah it wasn't like this in

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.460 
though but yeah it wasn't like this in
minute<00:04:30.910> ago<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.360> essentially<00:04:32.260> what's

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
minute ago so essentially what's

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.830 
minute ago so essentially what's
happening<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.010> these<00:04:33.940> sections<00:04:34.330> below<00:04:34.570> the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
happening is these sections below the

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.080 
happening is these sections below the
red<00:04:35.020> wall<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:37.150> my<00:04:37.449> user<00:04:37.810> inputted<00:04:38.350> answers

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
red wall for my user inputted answers

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.430

this up the top here is where the
question<00:04:41.830> scroll<00:04:42.190> across<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:44.400> see<00:04:45.400> be<00:04:45.520> able

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
question scroll across and see be able

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.100 
question scroll across and see be able
to<00:04:45.760> see<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.000> question<00:04:46.360> scroll<00:04:46.630> across<00:04:46.750> and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
to see the question scroll across and

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.830 
to see the question scroll across and
then<00:04:47.169> you'll<00:04:47.289> be<00:04:47.320> able<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.710> input<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:49.270> answer

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
then you'll be able to input and answer

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.409 
then you'll be able to input and answer
so<00:04:50.410> it's<00:04:50.800> very<00:04:51.190> different<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.669> anything<00:04:52.060> else

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
so it's very different to anything else

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.270 
so it's very different to anything else
you've<00:04:52.599> probably<00:04:53.229> ever<00:04:53.349> played<00:04:53.800> before<00:04:53.950> and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
you've probably ever played before and

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.730 
you've probably ever played before and
that<00:04:55.150> redstone<00:04:55.450> is<00:04:55.599> known<00:04:56.080> for<00:04:56.260> its<00:04:56.470> own<00:04:56.620> the

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
that redstone is known for its own the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.400 
that redstone is known for its own the
lighting<00:04:57.130> it's<00:04:57.250> really<00:04:57.760> messed<00:04:58.030> up<00:04:58.380> but<00:04:59.380> I

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
lighting it's really messed up but I

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.330 
lighting it's really messed up but I
will<00:04:59.979> fix<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.520> up<00:05:00.610> later<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:03.010> yeah<00:05:03.190> that's

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
will fix it up later and so yeah that's

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.550 
will fix it up later and so yeah that's
the<00:05:03.910> basis<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:04.720> here<00:05:05.020> is<00:05:05.110> my<00:05:05.289> input

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
the basis of it this here is my input

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.700 
the basis of it this here is my input
selection<00:05:06.039> for<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:07.320> for<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.349> different

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
selection for the for the different

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.629 
selection for the for the different
buttons<00:05:09.039> so<00:05:09.370> like<00:05:09.610> here's<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.660> my<00:05:11.639> buttons

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
buttons so like here's a my buttons

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.129 
buttons so like here's a my buttons
they're<00:05:13.000> eventually<00:05:13.180> going<00:05:13.539> to<00:05:13.599> connect<00:05:13.930> to

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
they're eventually going to connect to

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.070 
they're eventually going to connect to
this<00:05:14.530> thing<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:16.120> then<00:05:16.300> from<00:05:16.599> there<00:05:16.870> to

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
this thing and then from there to

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.900 
this thing and then from there to
wherever<00:05:17.320> they<00:05:17.530> go<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.250> for<00:05:19.199> those

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
wherever they go this is for those

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.790 
wherever they go this is for those
letters<00:05:21.910> of<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.150> alphabet<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.750> eventually<00:05:23.650> go

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
letters of the alphabet to eventually go

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.310 
letters of the alphabet to eventually go
and<00:05:23.979> imprint<00:05:24.340> on<00:05:24.550> this<00:05:24.849> memory<00:05:25.410> for<00:05:27.030> display

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
and imprint on this memory for display

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.750 
and imprint on this memory for display
so<00:05:29.320> there's<00:05:29.500> a<00:05:29.530> lot<00:05:29.650> of<00:05:29.710> different<00:05:30.099> things<00:05:30.520> to

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
so there's a lot of different things to

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.089 
so there's a lot of different things to
take<00:05:30.880> into<00:05:30.940> account<00:05:31.330> this<00:05:31.840> here<00:05:32.199> this<00:05:32.229> stack

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
take into account this here this stack

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.860 
take into account this here this stack
which<00:05:33.310> is<00:05:33.460> currently<00:05:33.669> too<00:05:33.970> high<00:05:34.180> will<00:05:34.720> be<00:05:34.840> a

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
which is currently too high will be a

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.350 
which is currently too high will be a
lot<00:05:35.110> higher<00:05:35.289> when<00:05:35.530> it's<00:05:35.680> done<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:37.000> this<00:05:37.180> is

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
lot higher when it's done and this is

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.020 
lot higher when it's done and this is
where<00:05:37.570> all<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.900> text<00:05:38.320> is<00:05:38.440> stored<00:05:39.030> currently

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
where all the text is stored currently

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.770 
where all the text is stored currently
I've<00:05:40.180> stored<00:05:40.389> about<00:05:40.770> half<00:05:41.770> a<00:05:41.919> sentence<00:05:42.370> I

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
I've stored about half a sentence I

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.360 
I've stored about half a sentence I
recently<00:05:43.780> obviously<00:05:44.590> restarted<00:05:45.099> all<00:05:45.190> that

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
recently obviously restarted all that

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.270 
recently obviously restarted all that
but<00:05:46.000> this<00:05:46.210> whole<00:05:46.570> line

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
but this whole line

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.790 
but this whole line
this<00:05:48.490> whole<00:05:48.730> line<00:05:49.030> from<00:05:49.360> the<00:05:50.020> very<00:05:50.500> back<00:05:50.770> of

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
this whole line from the very back of

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.300 
this whole line from the very back of
the<00:05:50.980> screen<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:52.030> hear<00:05:52.330> stores<00:05:53.230> 70<00:05:54.130> characters

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
the screen to hear stores 70 characters

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.420 
the screen to hear stores 70 characters
or<00:05:54.820> 71<00:05:55.750> at<00:05:55.870> maximum<00:05:56.350> so<00:05:57.010> I'm<00:05:57.130> pretty<00:05:57.310> happy

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
or 71 at maximum so I'm pretty happy

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.770 
or 71 at maximum so I'm pretty happy
about<00:05:57.700> that<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:59.500> I'm<00:06:00.100> going<00:06:00.160> to<00:06:00.780> haven't

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
about that so I'm going to haven't

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.150 
about that so I'm going to haven't
started<00:06:01.990> storing<00:06:02.230> my<00:06:02.380> questions<00:06:02.800> yet<00:06:03.040> or

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
started storing my questions yet or

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.250 
started storing my questions yet or
anything<00:06:03.190> like<00:06:03.430> that<00:06:03.610> but<00:06:04.600> they're<00:06:04.960> coming

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
anything like that but they're coming

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.090 
anything like that but they're coming
and<00:06:05.440> I'm<00:06:06.400> working<00:06:06.580> on<00:06:06.820> it<00:06:06.970> so<00:06:07.690> yeah<00:06:08.500> still<00:06:08.950> come

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
and I'm working on it so yeah still come

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.470 
and I'm working on it so yeah still come
to<00:06:09.130> i<00:06:09.220> picked<00:06:09.520> up<00:06:09.610> the<00:06:09.790> em<00:06:09.940> straight<00:06:10.270> away<00:06:10.450> that

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
to i picked up the em straight away that

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.990 
to i picked up the em straight away that
with<00:06:10.720> that<00:06:11.260> was<00:06:11.350> awesome<00:06:11.650> i've<00:06:12.490> been<00:06:12.610> working

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
with that was awesome i've been working

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.400 
with that was awesome i've been working
with<00:06:13.030> this<00:06:13.210> too<00:06:13.360> much<00:06:13.510> i<00:06:13.660> think<00:06:13.690> so

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
with this too much i think so

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.840 
with this too much i think so
essentially<00:06:14.800> what<00:06:14.889> happens<00:06:15.220> is<00:06:15.370> as<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.730> can

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
essentially what happens is as you can

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.129 
essentially what happens is as you can
see<00:06:15.940> it's<00:06:16.030> a<00:06:16.060> whole<00:06:16.210> bunch<00:06:16.419> of<00:06:16.510> torches<00:06:16.930> and

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
see it's a whole bunch of torches and

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.570 
see it's a whole bunch of torches and
what<00:06:17.320> that<00:06:17.500> basically<00:06:17.710> how<00:06:18.220> that<00:06:18.400> works<00:06:18.610> is<00:06:18.990> a

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
what that basically how that works is a

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.340 
what that basically how that works is a
binary<00:06:21.580> number<00:06:22.030> will<00:06:22.150> come<00:06:22.330> through<00:06:22.810> down

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
binary number will come through down

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.490 
binary number will come through down
down<00:06:24.160> this<00:06:24.370> thing<00:06:24.990> and<00:06:25.990> then<00:06:26.230> what<00:06:26.410> will

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
down this thing and then what will

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.230 
down this thing and then what will
happen<00:06:26.770> is<00:06:26.890> it<00:06:26.919> will<00:06:27.100> come<00:06:27.340> down<00:06:27.370> through<00:06:27.850> here

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
happen is it will come down through here

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.520 
happen is it will come down through here
and<00:06:29.280> for<00:06:30.280> every<00:06:30.400> low<00:06:31.000> if<00:06:31.240> there's<00:06:31.810> some<00:06:32.080> these

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
and for every low if there's some these

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.620 
and for every low if there's some these
will<00:06:32.710> correspond<00:06:33.280> to<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:33.940> different<00:06:33.970> values

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
will correspond to the different values

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.760 
will correspond to the different values
so<00:06:34.900> this<00:06:35.650> only<00:06:35.800> has<00:06:36.010> one<00:06:36.280> to<00:06:36.460> watch<00:06:36.550> on<00:06:36.790> now

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
so this only has one to watch on now

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.810 
so this only has one to watch on now
this<00:06:41.010> actually<00:06:42.010> I<00:06:42.220> probably<00:06:42.370> shouldn't<00:06:42.700> want

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
this actually I probably shouldn't want

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.320 
this actually I probably shouldn't want
to<00:06:42.880> fight<00:06:43.060> a<00:06:43.090> little<00:06:43.270> bit<00:06:44.430> yeah<00:06:45.430> I'm<00:06:46.060> still

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
to fight a little bit yeah I'm still

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.580 
to fight a little bit yeah I'm still
working<00:06:46.690> on<00:06:46.810> how<00:06:46.990> I'm<00:06:47.110> going<00:06:47.260> to<00:06:47.350> have<00:06:47.560> it

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
working on how I'm going to have it

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.370 
working on how I'm going to have it
display<00:06:48.040> but<00:06:48.310> it's<00:06:48.880> um<00:06:49.360> essentially<00:06:50.050> for<00:06:50.290> each

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
display but it's um essentially for each

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.380 
display but it's um essentially for each
one<00:06:50.590> of<00:06:50.620> these<00:06:50.740> that's<00:06:51.010> coded<00:06:51.250> it<00:06:51.580> will<00:06:51.729> print

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
one of these that's coded it will print

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.270 
one of these that's coded it will print
you<00:06:52.540> out<00:06:52.570> a<00:06:52.660> different<00:06:53.080> letter<00:06:53.260> of<00:06:53.590> the

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
you out a different letter of the

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.330 
you out a different letter of the
alphabet<00:06:54.310> and<00:06:54.880> then<00:06:55.740> it'll<00:06:56.740> display<00:06:57.070> on<00:06:57.310> the

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
alphabet and then it'll display on the

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.930 
alphabet and then it'll display on the
screen<00:06:57.430> that's<00:06:58.120> how<00:06:58.360> I'm<00:06:58.600> going<00:06:58.810> to<00:06:59.940> do

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
screen that's how I'm going to do

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.940 
screen that's how I'm going to do
everything<00:07:01.090> basically<00:07:01.840> it's<00:07:02.530> going<00:07:02.800> to<00:07:02.830> be

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
everything basically it's going to be

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.620 
everything basically it's going to be
the<00:07:03.070> it's<00:07:03.280> probably<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.700> easiest<00:07:04.090> way<00:07:04.300> to<00:07:04.360> do

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
the it's probably the easiest way to do

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.290 
the it's probably the easiest way to do
it<00:07:04.750> and<00:07:05.970> in<00:07:06.970> yeah<00:07:08.070> I<00:07:09.070> don't<00:07:09.850> know<00:07:10.000> what<00:07:10.120> else<00:07:10.180> to

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
it and in yeah I don't know what else to

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.480 
it and in yeah I don't know what else to
say<00:07:10.539> i<00:07:10.750> think<00:07:11.260> i've<00:07:11.410> i've<00:07:11.950> covered<00:07:12.160> what<00:07:12.430> i

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
say i think i've i've covered what i

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.990 
say i think i've i've covered what i
wanted<00:07:12.700> to<00:07:12.789> cover<00:07:13.110> and<00:07:14.520> actually<00:07:15.520> I<00:07:15.550> really

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
wanted to cover and actually I really

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.730 
wanted to cover and actually I really
you<00:07:16.210> can<00:07:16.360> see<00:07:16.539> a<00:07:16.570> problem<00:07:16.840> with<00:07:16.930> this<00:07:17.200> system<00:07:17.440> I

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
you can see a problem with this system I

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.380 
you can see a problem with this system I
need<00:07:17.890> to<00:07:18.010> work<00:07:18.160> on<00:07:18.310> that<00:07:18.370> so<00:07:18.970> probably<00:07:19.270> be

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
need to work on that so probably be

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.510 
need to work on that so probably be
different<00:07:19.720> next<00:07:19.780> time<00:07:19.960> you<00:07:20.140> see<00:07:20.320> it<00:07:20.400> and<00:07:21.400> I

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
different next time you see it and I

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.400 
different next time you see it and I
still<00:07:21.729> need<00:07:21.850> to<00:07:21.940> hook<00:07:22.060> up<00:07:22.210> my<00:07:22.270> reset<00:07:22.840> line<00:07:23.050> for

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410 
still need to hook up my reset line for

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.870 
still need to hook up my reset line for
every<00:07:23.560> time<00:07:23.740> a<00:07:23.770> new<00:07:23.860> character<00:07:24.250> comes<00:07:24.580> through

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
every time a new character comes through

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.480 
every time a new character comes through
but<00:07:25.810> um<00:07:25.990> that's<00:07:26.440> still<00:07:26.800> a<00:07:26.830> work<00:07:27.070> in<00:07:27.100> progress

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
but um that's still a work in progress

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.900 
but um that's still a work in progress
and<00:07:27.940> I'll<00:07:28.060> figure<00:07:28.870> that<00:07:29.140> out<00:07:29.169> soon<00:07:29.740> like<00:07:30.580> for<00:07:30.880> a

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
and I'll figure that out soon like for a

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.930 
and I'll figure that out soon like for a
synergy<00:07:31.300> press<00:07:31.510> store<00:07:32.160> and<00:07:33.160> this<00:07:33.400> will<00:07:33.580> reset

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
synergy press store and this will reset

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.940 
synergy press store and this will reset
the<00:07:34.000> previous<00:07:34.419> function<00:07:34.960> and<00:07:35.940> yeah<00:07:36.940> I<00:07:37.950> don't

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950 
the previous function and yeah I don't

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.980 
the previous function and yeah I don't
know<00:07:39.039> I'll<00:07:39.310> figure<00:07:40.030> it<00:07:40.150> out<00:07:40.270> a<00:07:40.330> bit<00:07:40.419> more<00:07:40.690> as<00:07:40.840> I

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
know I'll figure it out a bit more as I

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.440 
know I'll figure it out a bit more as I
go<00:07:41.490> but<00:07:42.490> yeah<00:07:42.610> this<00:07:42.729> is<00:07:42.789> where<00:07:43.060> it's<00:07:43.180> at<00:07:43.300> at<00:07:43.419> the

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.450
