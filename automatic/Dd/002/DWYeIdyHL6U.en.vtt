reason why absolutely no doubt about it

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.539 
reason why absolutely no doubt about it
now<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> course<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.860> talk<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:08.130> North

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
now of course when we talk about North

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.310 
now of course when we talk about North
Carolina<00:01:09.000> perhaps<00:01:09.330> why<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.930> didn't<00:01:10.170> fare<00:01:10.290> as

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
Carolina perhaps why they didn't fare as

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.750 
Carolina perhaps why they didn't fare as
well<00:01:10.409> last<00:01:10.799> year<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.549> might<00:01:11.700> have

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
well last year as you might have

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
well last year as you might have
expected<00:01:12.110> defensively<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.290> gave<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.650> almost

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
expected defensively they gave up almost

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.060 
expected defensively they gave up almost
500<00:01:14.580> yards<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.030> game<00:01:15.060> Gene<00:01:15.900> Chizik<00:01:16.170> comes<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.860> as

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
500 yards a game Gene Chizik comes in as

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.710 
500 yards a game Gene Chizik comes in as
the<00:01:17.220> defensive<00:01:17.670> coordinator<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.420> did<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the defensive coordinator what did you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
the defensive coordinator what did you
see<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> spring<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.009> ways<00:01:20.159> he's<00:01:20.400> trying

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
see this spring in the ways he's trying

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
see this spring in the ways he's trying
to<00:01:20.670> change<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.060> defense<00:01:21.650> well<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> think

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to change that defense well I think

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.789 
to change that defense well I think
first<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.060> foremost<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.960> fact<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.590> they

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
first and foremost is the fact that they

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.980 
first and foremost is the fact that they
cut<00:01:26.040> everything<00:01:26.340> down<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> basics<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.630> mean

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
cut everything down to the basics I mean

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.120 
cut everything down to the basics I mean
that<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.200> were<00:01:28.259> teaching<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.710> guys<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that they were teaching the guys how to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580 
that they were teaching the guys how to
tackle<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:30.450> want<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> make<00:01:30.869> sure<00:01:30.900> every

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
tackle they want to make sure every

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.410 
tackle they want to make sure every
single<00:01:31.799> player<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.759> defense<00:01:33.090> side<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
single player on the defense side of the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.359 
single player on the defense side of the
ball<00:01:33.570> knows<00:01:34.110> exactly<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.920> they're<00:01:34.950> doing

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
ball knows exactly what they're doing

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
ball knows exactly what they're doing
they're<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.240> concerned<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.900> scheme

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
they're not so concerned with scheme

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.020 
they're not so concerned with scheme
right<00:01:37.470> now<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> run<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> 4-3

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
right now they are going to run a 4-3

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
right now they are going to run a 4-3
they<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.350> want<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
they will really want to get the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.039 
they will really want to get the
fundamentals<00:01:41.369> down<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.600> more<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
fundamentals down and so it's more of a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
fundamentals down and so it's more of a
mental<00:01:43.350> thing<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> gene<00:01:44.670> chizik

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
mental thing I think for a gene chizik

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
mental thing I think for a gene chizik
in<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.390> first<00:01:45.659> year<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.710> these<00:01:46.890> guys

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
in this first year is to get these guys

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.609 
in this first year is to get these guys
built<00:01:47.579> back<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.049> really

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
built back up and then you can really

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.800 
built back up and then you can really
worried<00:01:49.950> about<00:01:50.030> schematics<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> getting

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
worried about schematics and getting

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
worried about schematics and getting
them<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> play<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> higher<00:01:52.590> level<00:01:52.619> cuz<00:01:53.430> it's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
them to play at a higher level cuz it's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.639 
them to play at a higher level cuz it's
hard<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> play<00:01:54.090> much<00:01:54.420> worse<00:01:54.750> than<00:01:55.020> last<00:01:55.350> year

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
hard to play much worse than last year

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.440 
hard to play much worse than last year

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
kind of step to this program need to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
kind of step to this program need to
take<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.680> him<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.829> say<00:02:02.070> hey<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.460> am<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.939> man<00:02:03.119> I'm

making<00:02:03.659> progress<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:04.110> chapel<00:02:04.530> hill<00:02:05.149> well

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
making progress in chapel hill well

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.419 
making progress in chapel hill well
where<00:02:06.750> he<00:02:06.840> will<00:02:06.990> tell<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.129> he<00:02:08.220> came

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429

in<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.239> sanctions<00:02:09.720> came<00:02:09.989> down<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.739> guess

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
in and the sanctions came down I guess

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
in and the sanctions came down I guess
three<00:02:11.550> months<00:02:11.879> after<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.270> arrive<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.540> Chapel

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
three months after you arrive in Chapel

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.900 
three months after you arrive in Chapel
they<00:02:13.830> knew<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.070> there<00:02:14.370> wasn't<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.820> be

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
they knew that there wasn't going to be

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.730 
they knew that there wasn't going to be
a<00:02:14.970> setback<00:02:15.330> initially<00:02:16.200> because<00:02:16.530> there's

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
a setback initially because there's

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.500 
a setback initially because there's
still<00:02:16.950> plenty<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.400> talent<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.030> program

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
still plenty of talent in the program

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.140 
still plenty of talent in the program
but<00:02:19.080> with<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> insula<00:02:20.010> sanctions<00:02:20.640> they

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
but with the insula sanctions they

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.510 
but with the insula sanctions they
thought<00:02:21.390> years<00:02:21.750> 3<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.350> four<00:02:22.590> would<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
thought years 3 and four would be the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.760 
thought years 3 and four would be the
most<00:02:23.700> difficult<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.510> traverse<00:02:24.870> there's<00:02:25.590> still

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
most difficult to traverse there's still

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.110 
most difficult to traverse there's still
going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.010> some<00:02:26.220> struggles<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.850> year

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
going to be some struggles this year

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.090 
going to be some struggles this year
although<00:02:27.690> they<00:02:27.780> do<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.110> lot<00:02:28.410> better<00:02:28.680> depth

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
although they do have a lot better depth

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.890 
although they do have a lot better depth
on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> offensive<00:02:29.700> line<00:02:29.850> which<00:02:30.570> will<00:02:30.750> really

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
on the offensive line which will really

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.050 
on the offensive line which will really
help<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:31.890> think<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> new<00:02:32.400> scheme<00:02:32.790> that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
help and I think the new scheme that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.300 
help and I think the new scheme that
Chizik<00:02:33.450> bringing<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.020> will<00:02:34.560> help<00:02:34.710> defensively

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
Chizik bringing in will help defensively

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
Chizik bringing in will help defensively

Heels<00:02:39.600> have<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> shot<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.170> year<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.940> think<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.060> i

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
Heels have a shot this year I think so i

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.550 
Heels have a shot this year I think so i
think<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> way<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> schedule<00:02:43.290> is

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
think with the way that the schedule is

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.790 
think with the way that the schedule is
set<00:02:43.800> up<00:02:44.010> they<00:02:44.790> must<00:02:45.060> definitely<00:02:45.330> do<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.590> North

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
set up they must definitely do so North

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.440 
set up they must definitely do so North
Carolina<00:02:47.160> should<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.520> able<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.760> work<00:02:48.000> into<00:02:48.360> the
