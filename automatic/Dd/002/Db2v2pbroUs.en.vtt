00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 to keep up with rasta vechta 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.370
 the telekom baskets bonn get the upper hand 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.349
 with 96 to 83 sounds clearly so clear 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.450
 on the Wednesday evening but not and stuff 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.299
 around 70 raster fans celebrated their team 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.699
 despite the defeat 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.490
 we can do something with raised main 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.810
 go out this game but unfortunately 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.250
 Having lost is annoying 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.099
 because I think we have more 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.320
 but hopes for the good on the whole 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
 especially from them dirk Badrich 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880
 the two meters and twelve big centers 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.899
 The fencer feels in the telecom dome 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.430
 really well and throws herself 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.960
 bonn's trainer mathias fischer is astonished 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 about this accuracy of the long 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 guys as well as his player badrich 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.969
 meets at half past one four times 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.739
 from across the three-dot line during 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.780
 so raster out of the distance danger 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.140
 radiates the bonner theirs 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 highlights first in the zone jared 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.329
 Jordan with the very fine little hands and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.940
 sugarcane on Cuba easy -looking 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.530
 She does not like the patrick points 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 looks 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.729
 and again it crashes into fekters corp 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.040
 This time , Ryan Brooks serves the high 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 Upset Kurt Looby Bonn vs. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.580
 vechta at half past one a whole 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.580
 spectacular pleasant 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 he patrick her dissatisfied with the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.890
 defensive performance of his mannen 4830 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 spectators in the telekom dome, on the other hand 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.810
 are happy about the offensive spectacle 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 that also bonn can meet from the outside 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.959
 proves benas veikalas eight meters 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.119
 fifty no problem and sniper 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.219
 with the very long threesome for a break 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:52.829
 but lead the rhinelander only 51 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:54.630
 to 48 against the league rookie rasta 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.310
 Vechta is a good team 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.869
 I warned my team that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 They are very good at rebound, we are 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.890
 have eight offensively against us 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.049
 first half brought many second 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 chances and that hurt us a lot 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.099
 we woke up right now in 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.259
 the second half because over us 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.700
 defensive suddenly a lot of pressure 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.709
 ausraster out of the following turnover opfers 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 easily scored points by jared jordan 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.569
 an action the patrick l her hair 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.819
 could be on hold 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.709
 but shake off in almost 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.750
 all areas equivalent to newcomers 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.450
 not bad that fans dream of 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.269
 second away win then but turns 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.340
 benas veikalas right out of the lithuanian 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.560
 makes 13 alone in the fourth quarter 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.000
 points for his team to one 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.980
 decisive advantage 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 the raster fans can only watch 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.000
 like the telekom baskets bonn for the second 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.250
 we have the victory of the season 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.780
 polite defensive rebounds delivered where 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.549
 I think we have to have that 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.250
 free throw rate is not below 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.920
 bonn has a really strong 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.910
 quarter played 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.810
 I think we still have one 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.530
 have to gain a bit of experience 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.819
 know that a game is 40 minutes 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.769
 have simple mistakes to the end 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.049
 admitted where bonn then directly 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.450
 we had outgrown and disturbed 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.989
 something in the defense couple stuff 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.760
 changed 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.200
 we were more stable during the rebound 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.090
 have the rebound tapped and 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.440
 so our faÃŸberg could run and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.299
 that's why we have the second half 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.900
 won because we only got 35 points 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.970
 authorized 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.160
 as the game in favor of the landlords 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.470
 decided is playing bond for the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.989
 gallery jared jordan lays a few more 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.230
 On top of that it serves his colleagues 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.769
 More than exemplary vechta subject 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.280
 with 83 96 and is now in a victory 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.280
 and two defeats 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.670
 but I think is a good start to the season 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.780
 for us we have short games 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.360
 Of course, such are possible 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.590
 defeat annoying because if you know 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.060
 you can keep up with the teams 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.530
 and lies out there 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.910
 We have to learn from that 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.830
 now the tight games we have to 40 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.940
 minutes play through good performance 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.310
 show and then we can do it like that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.000
 A victory with home draw last 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.410
 year we won such games 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.739
 difficult difficult away games 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.209
 I think that lies and good but how 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.800
 Now we have to swallow it down 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.380
 and luckily play on sunday in 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.540
 hagen and we can then continue to look 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.669
 bonn goes on saturday 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.590
 matthias fischer travels with his profi 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.590
