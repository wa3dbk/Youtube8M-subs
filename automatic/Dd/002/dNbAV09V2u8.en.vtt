00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
to first make a loop because that's

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.110 
to first make a loop because that's
where<00:00:59.860> it's<00:01:00.159> going<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.430> connect<00:01:00.820> on<00:01:00.969> the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
keep making a continuous line for your

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.260

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
did this on love

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.600 
did this on love
I<00:01:19.750> used<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.140> heart<00:01:20.440> for<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.860> O<00:01:20.950> which<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.460> may

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
I used a heart for the O which you may

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.669 
I used a heart for the O which you may
want<00:01:21.640> to<00:01:21.850> do<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.149> and<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.960> looks<00:01:23.110> really<00:01:23.320> cool

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
want to do that and it looks really cool

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.999 
want to do that and it looks really cool
too<00:01:24.149> that's<00:01:25.149> what<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.450> one<00:01:25.569> looks<00:01:25.720> like<00:01:26.009> now

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
too that's what that one looks like now

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.410 
too that's what that one looks like now
you're<00:01:27.159> going<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.340> take<00:01:27.520> your<00:01:27.700> wire<00:01:28.119> and

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
you're going to take your wire and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.749 
you're going to take your wire and
you're<00:01:28.869> going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.050> cut<00:01:29.200> about<00:01:29.409> I'd<00:01:30.220> say<00:01:30.280> six

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
you're going to cut about I'd say six

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.240 
you're going to cut about I'd say six
inches<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.360> probably<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:31.990> perfect<00:01:32.259> link<00:01:32.950> and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
inches is probably the perfect link and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.609 
inches is probably the perfect link and
you<00:01:34.060> want<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.330> start<00:01:34.659> at<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> end<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.380> need<00:01:35.560> to

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
you want to start at the end you need to

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:36.840 
you want to start at the end you need to
make<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.800> loop<00:01:36.039> because<00:01:36.340> that's<00:01:36.640> where<00:01:36.759> you're

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
make a loop because that's where you're

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.340 
make a loop because that's where you're
going<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.060> connect<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.600> your<00:01:37.690> chain<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.289> I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
going to connect it to your chain so I

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.460 
going to connect it to your chain so I
made<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> loop<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.640> then<00:01:40.289> what<00:01:41.289> you're<00:01:41.380> going

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
made a loop and then what you're going

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.340 
made a loop and then what you're going
to<00:01:41.530> use<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.789> as<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.119> template<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.140> one

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
to use is this as a template the one

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.559 
to use is this as a template the one
that<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.590> want<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:44.979> like<00:01:45.159> this<00:01:45.369> one<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.880> you're

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
that you want I like this one and you're

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.580 
that you want I like this one and you're
just<00:01:46.600> going<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:46.929> go<00:01:47.110> all<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.649> way<00:01:47.679> around<00:01:47.890> this

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.820 

to<00:01:53.090> make<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.299> work

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.150 

there's<00:01:58.400> that<00:01:58.640> part<00:01:58.940> right<00:01:59.150> there<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:00.980> go

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
there's that part right there and I go

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.390 
there's that part right there and I go
here<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.790> sideboard<00:02:02.600> that's<00:02:02.780> going<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.080> go

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
here to sideboard that's going to go
