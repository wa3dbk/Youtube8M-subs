I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.149> preposterous<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> same

you<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.630> humans<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.810> God

you know there is one humans that God
created<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.310> come<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
created you know would come up to the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
created you know would come up to the
Bible<00:01:56.909> he<00:01:57.090> didn't<00:01:57.270> create<00:01:57.450> Adam<00:01:57.780> Eve<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.049> et

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
Bible he didn't create Adam Eve and et

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
didn't eat was Adam and Eve and so you

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.090 
didn't eat was Adam and Eve and so you
know<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.200> goes<00:02:01.290> against<00:02:01.710> what<00:02:02.009> we
