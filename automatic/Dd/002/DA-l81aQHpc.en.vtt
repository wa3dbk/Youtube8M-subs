00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
involved it could evolve we just don't

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.780 
involved it could evolve we just don't
know<00:01:12.060> maybe<00:01:12.630> involves<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> level<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.860> 51

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
know maybe involves a level you know 51

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550 
know maybe involves a level you know 51
some<00:01:15.150> haven't<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.659> high<00:01:15.810> who<00:01:15.869> knows

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
some haven't got it at high who knows

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.109 
some haven't got it at high who knows
but<00:01:17.150> we<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.270> hawlucha<00:01:18.780> no<00:01:19.970> prediction<00:01:20.970> wise

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
but we have hawlucha no prediction wise

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.140 
but we have hawlucha no prediction wise
like<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.450> said<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.840> got<00:01:22.140> me<00:01:22.350> fighting<00:01:23.310> flying

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.609 
like I said it's got me fighting flying
unless<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:26.520> somehow<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.229> don't

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
unless it's somehow just is like a don't

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
unless it's somehow just is like a don't
and<00:01:29.009> well<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.520> even<00:01:30.030> fly<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.659> still

specially<00:03:19.920> offensive<00:03:20.490> but<00:03:20.640> he<00:03:20.760> could<00:03:20.970> be

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
specially offensive but he could be

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.770 
specially offensive but he could be
physically<00:03:21.480> offensive<00:03:21.690> now<00:03:23.780> common

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
physically offensive now common

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.770 
physically offensive now common
knowledge<00:03:25.440> would<00:03:25.950> say<00:03:26.220> or<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.700> know<00:03:26.820> history

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

knowledge would say or you know history
would<00:03:27.990> say<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.410> he's<00:03:28.530> probably<00:03:28.800> gonna<00:03:29.130> be
