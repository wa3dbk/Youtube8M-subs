00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:10.139
 dru line dating stories or it was 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.360
 2011 then my ambitions are so 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.259
 rolls over like a joy counter when 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 gta 5 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.170
 announced but so far once when I'm 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.880
 once again captured with those play 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 some notable gomez 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.150
 I stumbled upon one great game 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.070
 judging by the cover of the game you can immediately understand 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.500
 what is it you fucking not jurmala 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.440
 where oleg gazmanov do 3 saltuhi 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 back and singing the squadron is serious 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.930
 the game in the foreground is a man 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 with very serious facial expression 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.149
 I usually have that face when I try 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.000
 squeeze ferrero rosh in the toilet 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.250
 pyramid- shaped alina me for some reason 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
 earlier fun and tobago in the picture 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.410
 such a feeling as if she knew all 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.989
 the essence of being having played this masterpiece from 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.840
 star calla aida I forgot 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.899
 say the name of the game alyona r blyat yes 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.720
 not this number in common well you understood on that 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.030
 the moment it was the first of November to me 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.580
 for one moment it seemed that my mother 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.189
 called old rock and blamed them for 1 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.280
 inaction as usual she does it with 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.030
 me and asked for time to drown their game on 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.540
 PC 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 however , I certainly didn't have any 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.380
 a penny in my kiwi purse wallet 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.180
 that's why according to the good old tradition 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.270
 I turned to the rescuer 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.790
 the gaming industry and just the father of the pirate 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.820
 penalty for me this man was his 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.640
 kind of superman and of course he had 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.369
 pirate but as usual it happens 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.890
 just do not get a pirate because 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.590
 if you gave a class drive then he somehow 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 Irish prostitute by everyone 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.390
 away and the queue scada went to that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.689
 moment before my friend whose name was 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 Dima Dima has a fucking trait 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.090
 of character 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 pick up discs like a car on 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.430
 shtrafstoyanke if you got it 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.619
 for a long time or forever even if he 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.959
 returned deestone was all beaten 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.290
 a box of crumbs like crumbled like bread 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 just bought 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.569
 so the day came when the store 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.120
 I'm going to visit Dimon and naturally 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.849
 pumping up stealth skills 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.519
 pizdil disk benka from Dima's house someone 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.939
 call it theft i will call it dima 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.000
 okhuel quite as a result after the fierce 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:34.209
 match in the pit time duty dima went to do 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.480
 candy in the king's room on the royal three 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.329
 and then I successfully took the disk myself and he 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.239
 noticed the theft of attention later only 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.389
 mother his year this disc is actually up 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.790
 so far I have therefore how am I 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:51.790
 worse than the others I forgot of course 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.579
 tell me how I ran this 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.010
 masterpiece first times you guessed it already 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.919
 she did not run and from my surprise 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.530
 right testicle decreased by 2 millimeters 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.989
 learning that Leonor turns out to be this for you 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.389
 Mashka who will give you for the chupa chups with 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.090
 pineapple needed to apply its 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.030
 superpowers that I learned more 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.489
 since gta wai city and gta sandra 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.159
 it was necessary to prescribe the khaman team 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.379
 so strange that we give not 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.840
 it turned out that from the system unit by 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.750
 rocket flies to new york when i click 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.440
 enter and this gateway still earned 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.549
 Hooray 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.370
 but there was one but the screen was twitching so 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.829
 epileptic and appear calm and peaceful 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.440
 humans compared to this fps 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.870
 disco however the game is very strong for me 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.510
 Liked I always wanted to be sherlock 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.489
 holmes face animation so far 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.310
 makes me roll on the floor 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.829
 let them drool because it's still 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.479
 next-gene grafon a little soapy was like 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.359
 and the first true story release 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.919
 but it is tolerable as well as the gameplay of the pelvis 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.349
 and beat the opportunity 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.739
 I would like a hat like a post 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:06.629
 call of wells and got to know 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.629
