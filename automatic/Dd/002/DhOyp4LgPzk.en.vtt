they might they might clinch this week I

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.300 
they might they might clinch this week I
don't<00:05:26.960> know<00:05:27.020> how<00:05:27.140> what<00:05:27.410> their<00:05:27.590> situation<00:05:27.740> is

don't know how what their situation is
but<00:05:28.520> I<00:05:29.390> think<00:05:30.380> they<00:05:30.470> did<00:05:30.620> playing<00:05:30.890> great<00:05:31.670> all

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
but I think they did playing great all

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.400 
but I think they did playing great all
around<00:05:31.940> football<00:05:32.720> not<00:05:32.960> just<00:05:33.170> on<00:05:33.320> the

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
around football not just on the

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.110 
around football not just on the
defensive<00:05:33.860> side<00:05:33.920> but<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.370> offensive<00:05:34.760> sides

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
defensive side but the offensive sides

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.540 
defensive side but the offensive sides
who<00:05:35.360> had<00:05:36.080> Joe<00:05:36.380> Flacco<00:05:36.680> he's<00:05:37.070> going<00:05:37.340> to<00:05:37.430> be<00:05:37.520> a
