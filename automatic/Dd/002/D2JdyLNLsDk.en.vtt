one Russian at this one and one American
i<00:00:28.170> believe<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.740> they're<00:00:28.859> kind<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.130> different

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
i believe and they're kind of different

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.900 
i believe and they're kind of different
this<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.119> kind<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.539> weirdly<00:00:30.960> shaped<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910

bubble<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.430> gotta<00:00:36.000> say<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.210> preferred<00:00:36.780> America

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
bubble I gotta say I preferred America

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
bubble I gotta say I preferred America
since<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> kind<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> feels<00:00:38.550> lighter<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:41.070> yeah

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
since it kind of feels lighter but yeah

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.320 
a bit better than than average actually
the<00:02:16.560> shopper<00:02:16.980> right<00:02:17.550> there<00:02:17.760> I'd<00:02:17.970> shot<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
the shopper right there I'd shot a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.580 
the shopper right there I'd shot a
little<00:02:18.570> bit<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.080> devrim<00:02:19.620> PK<00:02:20.690> helipad<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
little bit that devrim PK helipad and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.440 
little bit that devrim PK helipad and
right<00:02:22.770> there<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> noticed<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.520> I'm<00:02:24.090> way<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
right there I noticed that I'm way to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.270 
right there I noticed that I'm way to
hide<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.050> they<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.350> lock<00:02:25.530> onto<00:02:25.710> me<00:02:26.040> way

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
hide it they can lock onto me way

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.980 
hide it they can lock onto me way
earlier<00:02:26.850> than<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.150> actually<00:02:27.270> can<00:02:27.570> shoot<00:02:27.840> on

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
earlier than I actually can shoot on

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.050 
earlier than I actually can shoot on
them<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.560> basically<00:02:29.340> make<00:02:29.490> sure<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.820> dodge

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
them so basically make sure to dodge

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.600 
them so basically make sure to dodge
between<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.960> rocks<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.430> my

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
between the rocks and this is my

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.810 
between the rocks and this is my
favorite<00:02:33.570> favorite<00:02:34.020> map<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.890> play<00:02:35.130> with<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.320 
favorite favorite map to play with a
little<00:02:36.180> bird<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.570> especially<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.890> part

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
little bird on especially this part

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.360 
little bird on especially this part
because<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.600> dive<00:02:40.080> down<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.680> sides<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
because you can dive down the sides and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.120 
because you can dive down the sides and
get<00:02:41.670> protection<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.570> few<00:02:42.780> seconds<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.980> it's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
get protection in a few seconds so it's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.760 
get protection in a few seconds so it's
it's<00:02:44.400> almost<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.600> hard<00:02:45.870> for<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.320> enemy<00:02:46.350> to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
it's almost to the hard for the enemy to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.880 
it's almost to the hard for the enemy to
actually<00:02:47.160> shoot<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.670> down<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.860> only

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
actually shoot you down it's the only

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.199 
actually shoot you down it's the only
real<00:02:50.400> chance<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.970> enemy<00:02:51.360> gap<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.900> said<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
real chance the enemy gap is said is to

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.110 
real chance the enemy gap is said is to
use<00:02:54.360> their<00:02:54.630> sniper<00:02:54.930> I'd<00:02:55.230> shoot<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:56.550> pilot

my camera take a rocket but I basically
flared<00:03:01.260> too<00:03:01.530> late<00:03:01.769> because<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.310> didn't<00:03:02.610> see<00:03:02.880> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
flared too late because I didn't see the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.690 
flared too late because I didn't see the
missed<00:03:03.300> island<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:04.320> time<00:03:04.620> sometimes<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.400> can

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
I miss it when it's when every site is

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.670 
I miss it when it's when every site is
coming<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:09.120> add<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.630> me<00:03:09.720> from<00:03:09.959> behind<00:03:10.140> I
