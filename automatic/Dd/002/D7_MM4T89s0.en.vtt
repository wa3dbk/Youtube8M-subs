00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
it

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.610 
it
so<00:03:20.790> because<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:22.000> Auto<00:03:22.540> folding<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.380> auto

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
so because it's Auto folding and auto

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.229 
so because it's Auto folding and auto
locking<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.730> after<00:03:25.420> unfolding<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.530> no

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
locking so after unfolding it is no

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.009 
locking so after unfolding it is no
handwork<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:29.760> by<00:03:30.760> pressing<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.329> button<00:03:31.360> it'll

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
handwork just by pressing a button it'll

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.050 
handwork just by pressing a button it'll
be<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.170> lock<00:03:32.410> by<00:03:32.620> yourself

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.780 

it's<00:03:37.060> very<00:03:37.299> rated<00:03:37.780> on<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.410> rigid<00:03:38.799> frame<00:03:39.489> where

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
it's very rated on a rigid frame where

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.310 
it's very rated on a rigid frame where
is<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.239> don't<00:03:40.480> worry<00:03:40.690> about<00:03:40.720> it

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
is it don't worry about it

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.800 
is it don't worry about it
so<00:03:41.530> after<00:03:42.010> coming<00:03:42.250> down<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.850> can<00:03:43.030> see<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.510> blue

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
so after coming down you can see a blue

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.199 
so after coming down you can see a blue
LED<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.650> red<00:03:44.829> LED<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.459> side<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:45.820> it<00:03:45.970> also

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
LED and a red LED on the side of it also

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.050 
LED and a red LED on the side of it also
you<00:03:46.359> can<00:03:46.660> see<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.140> LED<00:03:47.980> changing<00:03:48.430> color<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.940> the

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
you can see a LED changing color on the

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.840 
you can see a LED changing color on the
bottom<00:03:49.209> plate<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.140> it's<00:03:50.440> very<00:03:50.799> a<00:03:51.160> good<00:03:51.579> sign

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
bottom plate so it's very a good sign

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.449 
bottom plate so it's very a good sign
when<00:03:51.880> your<00:03:52.390> flight<00:03:52.660> also<00:03:53.350> it's<00:03:53.890> possible<00:03:54.100> to

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
when your flight also it's possible to

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.490 
when your flight also it's possible to
fly<00:03:54.579> at<00:03:55.000> night<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.660> evening<00:03:55.690> no<00:03:56.440> problem

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
fly at night in the evening no problem

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.740 
fly at night in the evening no problem
so<00:03:59.500> about<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.100> camera<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:01.299> are<00:04:01.390> going<00:04:01.570> to

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
so about the camera you are going to

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.190 
so about the camera you are going to
load<00:04:01.959> on<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.320> frame<00:04:02.680> here<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.340> an<00:04:03.519> example

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
load on this frame here is an example

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.830 
load on this frame here is an example
here<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.829> loading<00:04:06.489> bar<00:04:06.850> of<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.480> eb-5

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
here is the loading bar of the eb-5

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.210 
here is the loading bar of the eb-5
handed<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.799> what<00:04:09.280> we<00:04:09.489> mounted<00:04:09.880> is<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.420> scam<00:04:11.410> new

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
handed and what we mounted is a scam new

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.370 
handed and what we mounted is a scam new
a<00:04:12.519> 10<00:04:13.140> is<00:04:14.140> 3<00:04:14.290> H<00:04:14.560> 3<00:04:14.920> axis<00:04:15.700> gopro<00:04:16.479> gimbal<00:04:16.959> right

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
a 10 is 3 H 3 axis gopro gimbal right

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.460 
a 10 is 3 H 3 axis gopro gimbal right
there<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.850> can<00:04:19.299> mount<00:04:19.450> a<00:04:19.600> gimp<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.049> what

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
there so you can mount a gimp and what

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.300 
there so you can mount a gimp and what
they<00:04:20.590> go<00:04:20.769> for<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.549> like<00:04:21.789> this<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.330> also<00:04:23.310> if

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
they go for just like this and also if

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.390 
they go for just like this and also if
the<00:04:24.700> battery<00:04:25.539> should<00:04:25.750> be<00:04:25.930> mount<00:04:26.740> right

that maybe 80 80 km/h in the air so

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.350 
that maybe 80 80 km/h in the air so
thanks<00:05:09.789> for<00:05:09.880> watching<00:05:10.000> have<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.660> nice<00:05:10.810> day<00:05:10.870> bye
