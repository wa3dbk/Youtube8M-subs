sounds so far my impressions with this
is<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.449> had<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> CPE<00:00:26.180> Nano<00:00:27.199> that<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> had<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.680> here

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
is I had a CPE Nano that I had on here

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.189 
is I had a CPE Nano that I had on here
actually<00:00:29.640> before<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.210> sold<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.929> put<00:00:31.080> this

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
actually before that I sold to put this

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually before that I sold to put this
on<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.850> actually<00:00:32.850> thought<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.630> banano<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
on I actually thought the banano and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
on I actually thought the banano and
that's<00:00:35.010> excluding<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> stock

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that's excluding I that was the stock

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.330 
that's excluding I that was the stock
turbo<00:00:37.140> when<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.590> thought<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.129> Nano

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
turbo when I actually thought the Nano

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.100 
turbo when I actually thought the Nano
had<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> louder<00:00:39.710> turbo<00:00:40.710> suction<00:00:41.640> sound<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
had a louder turbo suction sound so I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.470 
had a louder turbo suction sound so I
don't<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.430> just<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> AEM<00:00:45.149> Drive

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
don't know if it's just the AEM Drive

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
don't know if it's just the AEM Drive
flow<00:00:45.719> filter<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.610> actually

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
flow filter if it's just I'm actually

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
flow filter if it's just I'm actually
mulling<00:00:48.360> some<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> sound<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.410> but

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

I'm<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> could<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.480> can

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
I'm I don't know if you could if you can

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.400 
I'm I don't know if you could if you can
see<00:00:51.809> down<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:53.960> buried<00:00:54.960> within<00:00:55.140> all

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
see down in there buried within all

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.650 
see down in there buried within all
these<00:00:55.559> mess<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.100> wires<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.520> whatever<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.180> got

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
these mess of wires or whatever I got

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.750 
these mess of wires or whatever I got
the<00:00:57.780> full<00:00:58.050> corkboard<00:00:58.739> SOI<00:00:58.980> turbo<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.579> let

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the full corkboard SOI turbo and let

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.500 
the full corkboard SOI turbo and let
everything<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.850> do<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> start-up<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> then

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
everything so I do a start-up and then

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
everything so I do a start-up and then
some<00:01:06.510> revs<00:01:07.040> usually<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> best<00:01:08.790> sound

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
some revs usually you get the best sound

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
some revs usually you get the best sound
you<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> rev<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> up<00:01:10.680> actually<00:01:10.860> pretty

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you do have to rev it up actually pretty

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:22.350 
you do have to rev it up actually pretty
high<00:01:12.830> so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:37.050 

[Music]

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.260 

[Music]

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.340 

so<00:01:47.270> I'm<00:01:47.450> not<00:01:47.600> even<00:01:47.810> sure<00:01:47.930> if<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:48.110> going<00:01:48.260> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
so I'm not even sure if it's going to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.140 
so I'm not even sure if it's going to
come<00:01:48.470> out<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.860> or<00:01:49.610> if<00:01:49.760> you'll<00:01:49.880> hear<00:01:50.060> it

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
come out on this or if you'll hear it

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.760 
come out on this or if you'll hear it
over<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.980> loud<00:01:51.980> ass<00:01:52.220> ticking<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.880> the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
over the loud ass ticking of the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.750 
over the loud ass ticking of the
direct-injection<00:01:54.770> but

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
direct-injection but

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:24.400 
direct-injection but
