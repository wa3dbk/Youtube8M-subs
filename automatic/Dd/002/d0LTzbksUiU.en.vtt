00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
there pretty good I can zoom in then get

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.789 
there pretty good I can zoom in then get

designers<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.710> met<00:04:23.950> really<00:04:24.789> love<00:04:25.120> this<00:04:25.360> because

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
designers I met really love this because

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.559 
designers I met really love this because
you<00:04:25.930> can't<00:04:26.260> draw<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.469> car<00:04:26.770> unless<00:04:27.039> you<00:04:27.130> have<00:04:27.280> one

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:27.569 
you can't draw a car unless you have one

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:29.640 
you can't draw a car unless you have one
they<00:04:28.569> can<00:04:28.720> cycle<00:04:29.050> through<00:04:29.080> different<00:04:29.440> shapes

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
they can cycle through different shapes

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.420 
they can cycle through different shapes
we<00:04:30.460> also<00:04:30.610> use<00:04:30.910> this<00:04:31.090> then<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.830> access<00:04:32.830> that

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
we also use this then to access that

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.700 
we also use this then to access that
same<00:04:33.759> math<00:04:34.300> shape<00:04:34.599> or<00:04:34.810> maybe<00:04:34.960> your<00:04:35.500> glasses

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
same math shape or maybe your glasses

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.100 
same math shape or maybe your glasses
they're<00:04:36.099> just<00:04:36.639> capturing<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.210> so<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.020> you

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
they're just capturing and so what you

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.450 
they're just capturing and so what you
do<00:04:38.199> with<00:04:38.319> a<00:04:38.380> shape<00:04:38.620> like<00:04:38.830> this<00:04:39.009> is<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.310> you

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
do with a shape like this is that you

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.189 
do with a shape like this is that you
double<00:04:39.789> tap<00:04:39.940> you<00:04:40.210> can<00:04:40.300> kind<00:04:40.599> of<00:04:40.630> stamp<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.050> in

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
double tap you can kind of stamp it in

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.010 
double tap you can kind of stamp it in
scale<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.889> down<00:04:41.919> position<00:04:42.789> a<00:04:43.090> new<00:04:43.120> one<00:04:43.479> they

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
scale it down position a new one they

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.860 
scale it down position a new one they

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
file that my man again Rob Zilla made

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.469 
file that my man again Rob Zilla made
you<00:05:03.490> can<00:05:03.639> see<00:05:03.759> here<00:05:03.880> it's<00:05:04.000> got<00:05:04.060> a<00:05:04.150> lot<00:05:04.449> of

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
you can see here it's got a lot of

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.600 
you can see here it's got a lot of
layers<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:05.259> know<00:05:05.409> it's<00:05:05.530> got<00:05:05.650> ten<00:05:06.039> layers<00:05:06.250> and

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
layers you know it's got ten layers and

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.999 
layers you know it's got ten layers and
an<00:05:06.699> 11th<00:05:07.060> layer<00:05:07.240> that's<00:05:07.449> a<00:05:07.509> photo<00:05:07.720> layer<00:05:08.009> now

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
an 11th layer that's a photo layer now

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.360 
an 11th layer that's a photo layer now
this<00:05:09.159> is<00:05:09.310> real<00:05:10.240> fidelity<00:05:10.900> 100%<00:05:11.680> vector<00:05:12.190> art

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
this is real fidelity 100% vector art

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.129 
this is real fidelity 100% vector art
and<00:05:13.000> what<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:13.120> can<00:05:13.270> do<00:05:13.360> directly<00:05:13.720> from<00:05:13.900> canvas

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
and what I can do directly from canvas

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.390 
and what I can do directly from canvas
now<00:05:14.409> is<00:05:14.590> go<00:05:14.710> ahead<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:14.949> send<00:05:15.099> it<00:05:15.190> right<00:05:15.340> over

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
now is go ahead and send it right over

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.730 
now is go ahead and send it right over
to<00:05:15.940> illustrator<00:05:16.539> so<00:05:17.110> let's<00:05:17.259> take<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.470> look<00:05:17.590> and

to illustrator so let's take a look and
see<00:05:17.830> if<00:05:17.889> it's<00:05:17.979> coming<00:05:18.190> over<00:05:18.750> happens<00:05:19.750> pretty

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
see if it's coming over happens pretty

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.010 
see if it's coming over happens pretty
quickly<00:05:20.310> there<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.400> is<00:05:21.690> alright<00:05:22.690> that's<00:05:22.930> that

quickly there it is alright that's that

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.430 
quickly there it is alright that's that
same<00:05:23.259> drawing<00:05:23.849> from<00:05:24.849> there<00:05:25.030> there<00:05:25.289> all<00:05:26.289> right

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
same drawing from there there all right

same drawing from there there all right
with<00:05:26.590> all<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.740> layers<00:05:27.030> intact<00:05:28.470> what<00:05:29.470> that

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
with all the layers intact what that

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.469 
with all the layers intact what that
means<00:05:29.800> for<00:05:30.069> us<00:05:30.099> is<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.849> there's<00:05:31.000> no<00:05:31.120> wasted

work that's a really big deal like why I
put<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.150> lot<00:05:34.270> of<00:05:34.330> effort<00:05:34.509> in<00:05:34.599> here<00:05:34.840> if<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:35.380> not

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
put a lot of effort in here if it's not

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.230 
put a lot of effort in here if it's not
going<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.710> come<00:05:35.830> out<00:05:35.919> over<00:05:36.099> there<00:05:36.250> and<00:05:36.430> now
