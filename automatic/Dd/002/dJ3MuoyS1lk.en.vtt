00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.740
 good in this tutorial 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.740
 let's see something of the closure 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.149
 what we are going to their fellow citizens 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.149
 this afternoon that a ball has movement 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.829
 more human 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.829
 we can do something like that 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 many see like a ball 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 has a boat animation 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.250
 and it is continuous 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.990
 let's see how we are 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.840
 what I'm going to do is 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
 create a new document 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.060
 in what we are going to do is that in this event 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.880
 Let's draw 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.680
 a small ball circle 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 now I will be part 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.010
 of the size that is tasted 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.240
 an atp contest 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.240
 what I'm going to do is line up the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.410
 you have to see your time scale 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.720
 your 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.490
 can vary the time in which this is who 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.090
 that the ball goes to rebound 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.390
 I want to make dissimilar 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 on the front this we insert um 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 a keyframe 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.490
 what I'm going to do is move the ball 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.940
 move it 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.940
 there without you wanting 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.110
 in the future to more 20 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.020
 we put a keyframe 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.020
 the capes do is move tab 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 in the temptation frame moss the same 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 in 41 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.399
 he had it doubled back to his place of origin for step sent a kiss 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.030
 like our pc 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.110
 good what continues now 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.110
 cited to be the first frame 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.049
 secondary click 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.539
 and put 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.959
 motion check 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.399
 we place ourselves in the next frame 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.059
 in the music 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.779
 notice that the ball changes 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.259
 what position each time 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.249
 every time we click on it key fotorama 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.249
 good now what we have 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.449
 it's a series of no winds that the ball goes 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.539
 as it passes 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.539
 from frame 1 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.749
 up to frame 35 40 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.120
 now the thing gives a little makeup to the program 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.799
 then let's put in the background 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.679
 bursaspor in a black color 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:04.379
 and now yes 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.379
 let's try more or less how it looks like 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.879
 there they have 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.509
 there they have the ball comes and goes 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.139
 with two boats that you want 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.849
 propose 10 20 30 40 routes as you want 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.919
 but it has served them well 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.089
 You bid farewell to your full friend well please subscribe 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.389
 persists 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.469
 in any comment or suggestion something 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.680
 something we could talk about
