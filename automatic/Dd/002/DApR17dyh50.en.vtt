of young architects who've been
established<00:00:04.910> practitioners<00:00:05.910> who<00:00:06.060> were<00:00:06.150> very

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
established practitioners who were very

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.500 
established practitioners who were very
interested<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.170> see<00:00:07.319> if<00:00:08.130> they<00:00:08.400> can<00:00:08.610> take<00:00:08.820> the

people design buildings to the next step

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.769 
people design buildings to the next step
so<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.750> computer<00:00:16.049> could<00:00:16.320> actually

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
so that the computer could actually

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.029 
so that the computer could actually
generate<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.260> way<00:00:19.410> buildings<00:00:19.830> are

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
as a smallest unit of a big system so I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440 
as a smallest unit of a big system so I
I<00:01:44.280> constructed<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.909> digitally<00:01:45.329> fabricated

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I constructed a digitally fabricated

this<00:02:01.440> group<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> Architects<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.330> exploring

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
this group of Architects are exploring

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.950 
this group of Architects are exploring
the<00:02:05.010> ways<00:02:05.160> in<00:02:05.370> which<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.880> computer<00:02:06.420> allows

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the ways in which the computer allows

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.140 
the ways in which the computer allows
for<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> often<00:02:08.670> called<00:02:08.850> mass

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
for what is often called mass

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.750 
for what is often called mass
customization<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.740> gives<00:02:11.100> architects

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
customization so this gives architects

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.420 
customization so this gives architects
the<00:02:12.030> hope<00:02:12.240> that<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.750> digital<00:02:13.140> manufacturing

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the hope that the digital manufacturing

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.870 
the hope that the digital manufacturing
will<00:02:14.430> allow<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.330> generation<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.610> houses<00:02:17.610> in

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
will allow a generation of houses in

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.120 
will allow a generation of houses in
which<00:02:18.060> both<00:02:18.300> their<00:02:18.570> own<00:02:18.750> creativity<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.800> the

houses<00:02:23.310> can<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.210> met<00:02:24.450> through<00:02:25.050> computer

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
houses can be met through computer

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.950 
houses can be met through computer
programs<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.490> can<00:02:26.760> adapt<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.630> desire

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
programs that can adapt to the desire

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.720 
programs that can adapt to the desire
for<00:02:27.990> variety<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.520> change<00:02:29.970> ultimately<00:02:31.730> this

to<00:02:39.870> sort<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.830> market<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.400> quantity<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:42.210> know

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
to sort of market and quantity you know

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.000 
to sort of market and quantity you know
there's<00:02:42.510> probably<00:02:42.660> an<00:02:43.320> eight<00:02:43.830> week

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
there's probably an eight week

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.520 
there's probably an eight week
turnaround<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.120> house<00:02:45.240> like<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.690> if

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
turnaround for a house like this if

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.470 
turnaround for a house like this if
you're<00:02:46.710> doing<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:47.040> one-off<00:02:47.250> then<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.060> time<00:02:48.330> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you're doing a one-off then that time is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.330 
you're doing a one-off then that time is
probably<00:02:48.750> considerably<00:02:49.230> more<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.100> with<00:02:50.250> this

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
probably considerably more so with this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.380 
probably considerably more so with this
we<00:02:50.520> try<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:51.540> industrialize<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.530> whole

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
we try to really industrialize the whole

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.030 
we try to really industrialize the whole
process<00:02:54.390> mine<00:02:55.110> does<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.530> come<00:02:55.770> from<00:02:55.950> a

factory<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.580> comes<00:02:56.820> from<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.300> machine<00:02:57.740> and<00:02:58.740> it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
factory it comes from one machine and it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.310 
factory it comes from one machine and it
set<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.400> Machine<00:02:59.790> up<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.210> site<00:03:00.420> it's

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
set the Machine up on the site it's

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.900 
set the Machine up on the site it's
delivered<00:03:01.830> through<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.040> internet<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
delivered through the internet so the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.479 
delivered through the internet so the
energy<00:03:03.180> that's<00:03:03.630> saved<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.830> energy<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
energy that's saved is the energy and

energy that's saved is the energy and
delivery<00:03:05.880> not<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:07.440> not<00:03:07.620> about<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.950> energy

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
delivery not it's not about the energy

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.270 
delivery not it's not about the energy
that<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.910> say<00:03:09.120> during<00:03:09.690> living<00:03:10.050> many<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.160> the

that you say during living many of the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550 
that you say during living many of the
ideas<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.820> aviation<00:03:12.390> are<00:03:12.540> compressing<00:03:13.380> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
ideas in aviation are compressing the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.030

food and the cutlery and crockery and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.860 
food and the cutlery and crockery and
the<00:03:17.100> product<00:03:17.459> design<00:03:17.850> down<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.330> small<00:03:18.570> scale

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the product design down to a small scale

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.070 
the product design down to a small scale
so<00:03:19.650> we're<00:03:19.830> learning<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.540> house<00:03:21.750> you

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
so we're learning that to the house you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.830 
so we're learning that to the house you
use<00:03:22.290> less<00:03:22.560> food

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
use less food

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.350 
use less food
you<00:03:24.500> use<00:03:24.650> much<00:03:24.920> less<00:03:24.950> energy<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:26.180> house

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
you use much less energy the house

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.990 
you use much less energy the house
largely<00:03:26.989> generates<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.220> power<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.610> needs<00:03:28.640> to
