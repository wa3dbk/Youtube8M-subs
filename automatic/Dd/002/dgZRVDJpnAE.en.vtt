 baked apple stuffed with chocolate 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:24.000
 Everlasting I chose to make stuffed dough 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.849
 because I think it's a dish spaces 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.740
 make fast and at the same time the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.250

 oven for 30 minutes 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.800
 One tip is to pack using the side 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.820
 shiny aluminum foil inside 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.820

 Coffee spoons of coconut oil on it 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:52.119
