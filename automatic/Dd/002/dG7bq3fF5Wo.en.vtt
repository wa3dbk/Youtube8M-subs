 It's been a while since I've been here. 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.640
 there is a tutorial video and today it is 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.790
 bringing here a video of how to do 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.509
 lamp that would be the one is this item here 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.560
 O 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.060
 is a bulb lights up with form you turn on 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.650
 it's antonino 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.340
 is the leverage it button lights as well and gives 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.450
 to brighten at night 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.000
 she is very used in your house is well 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.470
 simple way to make your way back is 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.300
 very simple to do the guys I'm going 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.010
 be teaching here how to put 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.990
 more day 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.130
 the first one will need stone powder 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.010
 luminous 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.680
 You get on the level you get four 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.210
 here and makes a gostosona that would be the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.689
 luminous stone 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.030
 There you will need redstone 4 edson 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.120
 Wedge light stone and publisher around 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.870
 here so here 's your lamp is well 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.840
 simple 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 and there you only put her here you 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.970
 catches Tony claiming that so if you go 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.409
 call from afar 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.320
 So one thing I want to say is that she 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.890
 passes energy to a block of distance 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.229
 I just know she's passing from here. 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.990
 she passes the others to a block of 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.600
 distance, not even down here. 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.280
 think the energy or behind it 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.940
 I think it's very cool. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:54.159
 so that's all I hope you have 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.350
 liked it there was not a very short video 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.610
 but that's it, I'm back and consultancies 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.610
 This is it people said it
