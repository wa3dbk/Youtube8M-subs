00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.600
 today we try to persuade ourselves 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 that our social security system 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 no longer viable in the state lack of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.200
 contribution expense of excessive 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 aging of the population there 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.960
 should give up guaranteeing a place for 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 all in society 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 passed by private insurances for 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.800
 to be protected and forget about living 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800
 together 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.340
 after liberation the national council 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.790
 of resistance created 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.080
 social security it is the guarantee 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.000
 given to everyone than in all 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.620
 circumstances he will have the means 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.750
 necessary for his livelihood 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.880
 and that of his family in 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.160
 decent conditions by funding 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.559
 solidarity based on work or 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.330
 wealth produced by work in 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.190
 an increasingly uncertain context 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.840
 we need more than ever the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.809
 social security why she is in 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.940
 danger worse she would hole and finally 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.199
 finally two holes to indicate a lack 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.660
 of recipes versus defenses 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.079
 it's a picture good ah but who dig 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.850
 the hole 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.860
 those who claim and obtain 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.509
 exemptions from social security contributions 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.190
 refuses to recognize certain diseases 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.750
 and obliges the social security system to 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.460
 pay in their place what we 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.500
 feel guilty about wanting to age well 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.140
 health but he refuses to retire at 60 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.820
 years old but this mad at the billion rider 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.940
 euros are stolen each year 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.080
 to social security 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.789
 since 1945 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.289
 the economy has become globalized and 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.820
 shareholder dividends continue 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.930
 to progress while escaping the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.550
 national solidarity 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.200
 these dividends are paid to the detriment 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.000
 wages from the job of 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.039
 investment and therefore penalizes our 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.140
 ability to finance social security 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.850
 but the first social security is 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.660
 to have work and work better 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.759
 paid 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.349
 the liability pact signed between 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.690
 the government and the medef will enlarge 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.880
 still the hole of the sec let's stop the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.860
 mess make the choice of the future the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.500
 social security is vital 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.039
 the security is you it's all the 16 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.690
 October 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.009
 let's mobilize everywhere in France for 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.360
 regain social security 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.360
 meeting the needs of today
