different models of the Benedetto and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.170 
different models of the Benedetto and
the<00:01:04.320> gretsch<00:01:04.559> custom<00:01:05.070> shop<00:01:05.280> started<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.000> two

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the gretsch custom shop started with two

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.109 
the gretsch custom shop started with two
models<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.970> 5561<00:01:08.970> 2255<00:01:09.930> White<00:01:10.229> Falcon<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
models of a 5561 2255 White Falcon and

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.460 
models of a 5561 2255 White Falcon and
then<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.240> moved<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:12.930> into<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.260> ear

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
then they moved at up into my ear

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.750 
then they moved at up into my ear
because<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.740> was<00:01:13.830> doing<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> arch<00:01:14.280> top<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
because I was doing the arch top so it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.340 
because I was doing the arch top so it
makes<00:01:14.880> sense<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.299> incorporate<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.110> together

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
makes sense to incorporate that together

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
makes sense to incorporate that together
so<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.430> started<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.390> 06

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so those that started back in like 06

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.210 
so those that started back in like 06
and<00:01:20.780> around<00:01:21.780> oh<00:01:21.990> aight<00:01:22.409> i<00:01:22.680> started

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and around oh aight i started

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.179 
and around oh aight i started
experimenting<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.880> some<00:01:24.090> other<00:01:24.240> models<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
experimenting with some other models of

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.210 
experimenting with some other models of
