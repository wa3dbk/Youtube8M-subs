00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.889 
want a big disc kind of stuck underneath
it<00:01:25.439> when<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.740> hardened<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:27.029> I<00:01:27.149> also<00:01:27.270> noticed

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
it when they hardened and I also noticed

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.959 
it when they hardened and I also noticed
that<00:01:28.109> the<00:01:28.590> strawberry<00:01:28.889> color<00:01:29.399> was<00:01:29.609> coming

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
that the strawberry color was coming

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.899 
that the strawberry color was coming
through<00:01:30.179> so<00:01:30.569> I<00:01:30.810> double<00:01:31.289> dipped<00:01:31.439> these<00:01:31.909> just

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
through so I double dipped these just

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.370 
through so I double dipped these just
get<00:01:33.149> a<00:01:33.209> nice<00:01:33.539> white<00:01:34.079> color<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.499> them<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:36.380> then

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
get a nice white color on them and then

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.529 
get a nice white color on them and then
I<00:01:37.409> pop<00:01:37.679> them<00:01:37.889> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.099> refrigerator<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.969> to

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
I pop them in the refrigerator just to

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.139 
I pop them in the refrigerator just to
let<00:01:39.689> allow<00:01:39.959> them<00:01:40.169> to<00:01:40.259> solidify<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:41.069> I<00:01:41.909> found

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
let allow them to solidify and I found

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.870 
let allow them to solidify and I found
it<00:01:42.450> helps<00:01:42.779> if<00:01:42.959> you<00:01:42.989> just<00:01:43.109> scrape<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.639> bottom

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
it helps if you just scrape the bottom

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
it helps if you just scrape the bottom
of<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.209> strawberry<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.749> the<00:01:45.899> edge<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.259> your

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
of the strawberry on the edge of your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.249 
of the strawberry on the edge of your
bowl<00:01:47.090> just<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.179> get<00:01:48.329> rid<00:01:48.419> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.599> excess<00:01:48.989> as

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
bowl just to get rid of the excess as

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.839 
bowl just to get rid of the excess as
well<00:01:51.529> once<00:01:52.529> that's<00:01:52.799> hardened<00:01:53.249> you're<00:01:53.579> going

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
well once that's hardened you're going

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.120 
well once that's hardened you're going
to<00:01:53.969> add<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.239> tuxedo<00:01:54.659> jacket<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.349> that's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
to add the tuxedo jacket and that's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.309 
to add the tuxedo jacket and that's
simply<00:01:56.459> dunking<00:01:56.999> the<00:01:57.090> strawberry<00:01:57.569> on<00:01:57.840> both

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
simply dunking the strawberry on both

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.260 
simply dunking the strawberry on both
sides<00:01:58.649> leaving<00:01:59.039> a<00:01:59.340> v-shape<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.029> front

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
sides leaving a v-shape in the front

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:15.370 
sides leaving a v-shape in the front
just<00:02:02.630> like<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.669> let<00:02:05.669> the<00:02:05.819> excess<00:02:06.119> drip<00:02:06.179> off

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.380 

and<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:16.100> place<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.490> on<00:02:16.580> some<00:02:16.610> wax<00:02:16.940> paper<00:02:17.090> to

for<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.780> actual<00:03:14.900> tuxedos<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.740> simply<00:03:16.100> draw

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
for the actual tuxedos you simply draw

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.670

on<00:03:16.490> a<00:03:16.520> bowtie<00:03:17.000> with<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.140> little<00:03:18.410> bit<00:03:18.500> more

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
on a bowtie with a little bit more

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.710 
on a bowtie with a little bit more
chocolate<00:03:18.890> in<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:19.610> case<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.940> put<00:03:19.970> in<00:03:20.210> a<00:03:20.300> ziploc

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
chocolate in this case I put in a ziploc

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.630 
chocolate in this case I put in a ziploc
bag<00:03:20.960> with<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.380> corner<00:03:21.680> cut<00:03:21.830> off<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.250> then

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
bag with the corner cut off and then

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.260 
bag with the corner cut off and then
draw<00:03:22.880> on<00:03:22.910> some<00:03:23.030> buttons<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.490> find<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:26.000> if

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
draw on some buttons and I find that if

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.030 
draw on some buttons and I find that if
the<00:03:26.540> chocolate<00:03:26.750> has<00:03:27.110> cooled<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.680> little<00:03:27.860> bit

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
the chocolate has cooled it a little bit

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.950 
the chocolate has cooled it a little bit
it's<00:03:28.370> easier<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.030> draw<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.300> bow<00:03:29.510> tie<00:03:29.720> with

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
it's easier to draw the bow tie with

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.140 
it's easier to draw the bow tie with
because<00:03:30.440> it's<00:03:30.680> had<00:03:30.800> a<00:03:30.830> chance<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.850> be<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> little

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
because it's had a chance to be a little

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.490 
because it's had a chance to be a little
to<00:03:32.330> thicken<00:03:32.510> up<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.780> bit<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.110> it's<00:03:33.260> not<00:03:33.320> as

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
to thicken up a bit and it's not as

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.650 
to thicken up a bit and it's not as
runny<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.580> may<00:03:34.730> be<00:03:34.790> able<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.090> get<00:03:35.210> two<00:03:35.480> or

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
runny and you may be able to get two or

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.780 
runny and you may be able to get two or
three<00:03:35.690> or<00:03:35.900> four<00:03:36.200> buttons<00:03:36.560> depending<00:03:37.100> on<00:03:37.310> how
