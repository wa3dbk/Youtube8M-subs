the other figures in the wave as you can

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.450 
the other figures in the wave as you can
see<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.540> had<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> price<00:00:58.140> tag<00:00:58.409> here<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.979> ripped

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
see I had a price tag here so I ripped

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.719 
see I had a price tag here so I ripped
off<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.650> can't<00:01:01.650> even<00:01:01.769> make<00:01:01.979> out<00:01:02.159> what<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.430> says

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
off I can't even make out what that says

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.340 
off I can't even make out what that says
but<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.180> clearly<00:01:03.600> looks<00:01:03.900> like<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> piece<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
but it clearly looks like a piece of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.090 
but it clearly looks like a piece of
crap<00:01:04.559> Batman<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:06.360> doesn't<00:01:06.659> matter<00:01:07.100> there's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
crap Batman so it doesn't matter there's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.969 
crap Batman so it doesn't matter there's
this<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.729> temblor<00:01:09.619> which<00:01:10.619> I've<00:01:10.799> done<00:01:10.950> a

this also temblor which I've done a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.249 
this also temblor which I've done a
review<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:12.540> surprised<00:01:13.049> he

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
review of and I'm really surprised he

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.810 
review of and I'm really surprised he
didn't<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.950> didn't<00:01:14.189> call<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> character

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

the<00:02:26.010> tail<00:02:26.250> there<00:02:26.549> really<00:02:26.670> wasn't<00:02:26.939> much

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the tail there really wasn't much

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.000 
the tail there really wasn't much
involved<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> tail<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.319> know<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.890> can

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
involved to the tail I know if I can

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.010 
involved to the tail I know if I can
take<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.159> back<00:02:29.400> off<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:29.909> this<00:02:30.239> way<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.690> peg

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
take it back off but this way just peg

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020 
take it back off but this way just peg
the<00:02:31.170> tail<00:02:31.380> into<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.770> back<00:02:31.950> end<00:02:32.250> portion<00:02:32.880> of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
the tail into the back end portion of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.570 
the tail into the back end portion of
his<00:02:33.810> keister

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
his keister

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.160 
his keister
is<00:02:35.670> also<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.180> switch<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.660> back<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
is also a little switch on the back and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.490 
is also a little switch on the back and
the<00:02:37.740> idea<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.870> rotate<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.080> switch

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the idea is when you rotate that switch

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.760 
the idea is when you rotate that switch
he's<00:02:41.340> supposed<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.850> flick<00:02:42.120> his<00:02:42.300> tail<00:02:42.770> he

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
he's supposed to flick his tail he

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.700 
he's supposed to flick his tail he
doesn't<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.160> all<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.550> well<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.120> mean<00:02:45.210> it's

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
doesn't do it all that well I mean it's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.430 
doesn't do it all that well I mean it's
for<00:02:46.710> what<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.480> man<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.720> mean<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.320> could

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
for what it is it's man I mean it could

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.010 
for what it is it's man I mean it could
at<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:50.070> least<00:02:50.370> at<00:02:50.640> least<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.690> one

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
at that at least at least it's not one

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.810 
at that at least at least it's not one
of<00:02:52.050> those<00:02:52.200> waste<00:02:52.620> things<00:02:52.980> where<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.340> rotate

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
of those waste things where you rotate

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.640 
of those waste things where you rotate
the<00:02:54.000> waste<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.230> think<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.470> would

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
the waste and because I think that would

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.450 
the waste and because I think that would
have<00:02:55.770> ruined<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> figure<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:57.660> figure<00:02:57.840> though

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
have ruined the figure the figure though

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.820 
have ruined the figure the figure though
sculpt<00:02:59.460> wise<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.880> think<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.120> really<00:03:00.390> decent<00:03:00.830> as

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
sculpt wise I think is really decent as

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.610 
sculpt wise I think is really decent as
I<00:03:02.010> mentioned<00:03:02.460> I<00:03:03.320> really<00:03:04.320> like<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960

that you're going to get loads of
articulation<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.530> think<00:04:04.920> if<00:04:05.010> anything<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.550> buy

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
articulation I think if anything you buy

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.310 
articulation I think if anything you buy
the<00:04:05.730> figures<00:04:06.150> because<00:04:06.480> they<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:06.810> look<00:04:07.080> nice

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
the figures because they just look nice

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.900 
the figures because they just look nice
on<00:04:07.620> display<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.400> mean<00:04:09.000> if<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.209> ask<00:04:09.330> me<00:04:09.540> that

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
on display I mean if you ask me that

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
on display I mean if you ask me that
articulation<00:04:11.910> aside<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.420> think<00:04:12.660> that

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
articulation aside I think that

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.060 
articulation aside I think that
definitely<00:04:13.200> looks<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> cool<00:04:13.800> looking

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
definitely looks like a cool looking

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.900 
definitely looks like a cool looking
figure<00:04:14.280> though<00:04:14.989> now<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.739> Killer<00:04:17.370> Croc<00:04:17.549> was

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
figure though now a Killer Croc was

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.560 
figure though now a Killer Croc was
repainted<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:20.250> use<00:04:20.430> repainted<00:04:21.060> I<00:04:21.239> used<00:04:21.479> the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
repainted and I use repainted I used the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.270 
repainted and I use repainted I used the
term<00:04:21.720> repainted<00:04:22.260> very<00:04:22.440> loosely<00:04:22.800> because<00:04:23.160> he

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
term repainted very loosely because he

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.460 
term repainted very loosely because he
was<00:04:23.490> actually<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.940> exact<00:04:24.270> same<00:04:24.510> figure<00:04:24.750> same
