here<00:00:11.309> we<00:00:11.400> our<00:00:11.550> Flashman<00:00:12.059> stage<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
here we our Flashman stage and this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
here we our Flashman stage and this
level<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.530> pretty<00:00:13.679> straightforward<00:00:14.009> -<00:00:14.519> now

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
level is pretty straightforward - now

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.300 
level is pretty straightforward - now
the<00:00:15.210> floors<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:15.929> are<00:00:16.139> icy<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:17.100> will

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the floors here are icy and you will

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
the floors here are icy and you will
slip<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.760> bit<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.810> doesn't<00:00:19.050> cause

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
slip a little bit but it doesn't cause

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.929 
slip a little bit but it doesn't cause
much<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.590> problem<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:22.609> just<00:00:23.609> follow<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
much of a problem now just follow the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.519 
much of a problem now just follow the
path<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.269> I'm<00:00:24.390> taking<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.019> you'll<00:00:25.410> see

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
path that I'm taking here you'll see

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.550 
path that I'm taking here you'll see
these<00:00:25.619> blocks<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.460> those<00:00:26.730> red<00:00:26.939> blocks<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
these blocks here those red blocks and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.019 
these blocks here those red blocks and
you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.800> actually<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.429> through<00:00:29.670> those<00:00:29.849> if

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you can actually get through those if

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.670 
you can actually get through those if
you<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.539> crash<00:00:30.779> bombs<00:00:31.140> already<00:00:36.680> kill

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you have the crash bombs already kill

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
you have the crash bombs already kill
this<00:00:37.739> enemy<00:00:37.890> right<00:00:38.790> through<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.149> there's<00:00:39.360> no

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
this enemy right through here there's no

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.670 
this enemy right through here there's no
need<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> go<00:00:40.170> right<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.379> front<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.559> his

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
need to go right in front of his

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.670 
need to go right in front of his
projectiles<00:00:41.570> again<00:00:42.570> crash<00:00:43.140> bombs<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.649> be

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
projectiles again crash bombs can be

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.110 
projectiles again crash bombs can be
used<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.100> those<00:00:44.219> things<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.760> there<00:00:46.910> now<00:00:47.910> make

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
used for those things up there now make

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.029 
used for those things up there now make
sure<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.140> down<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.890> down

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
sure when you go down you're going down

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.119 
sure when you go down you're going down
this<00:00:50.370> hole<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> other<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> I'll

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
this hole and not the other one and I'll

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.439 
this hole and not the other one and I'll
show<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.340> why<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.760> sec

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.790 

again<00:00:58.449> crash<00:00:58.750> bombs<00:00:58.989> can<00:00:59.199> get<00:00:59.350> through<00:00:59.530> there

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
again crash bombs can get through there

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.720 
again crash bombs can get through there
and<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.559> pretty<00:01:02.769> straightforward

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
and this is pretty straightforward

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.880 
and this is pretty straightforward
you<00:01:03.820> may<00:01:03.969> take<00:01:04.119> some<00:01:04.330> damage<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:05.080> don't<00:01:05.799> know<00:01:05.860> I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
you may take some damage I don't know I

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.420 
you may take some damage I don't know I
have<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.070> hard<00:01:06.250> time<00:01:06.460> avoiding<00:01:07.180> those<00:01:08.430> enemies

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
have a hard time avoiding those enemies

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.840 
have a hard time avoiding those enemies
there<00:01:09.729> but<00:01:09.970> whatever<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.979> jump<00:01:15.250> across<00:01:15.399> here

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
there but whatever now jump across here

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.030 
there but whatever now jump across here
and<00:01:16.060> wait<00:01:16.240> for<00:01:16.479> this<00:01:16.960> enemy<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.590> fall<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:17.950> the

hole<00:01:18.250> right<00:01:18.729> below<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.119> so<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:19.930> can<00:01:20.229> get<00:01:20.380> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
hole right below you so you can get the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.840 
hole right below you so you can get the
powerup<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.250> refill<00:01:22.030> your<00:01:22.210> energy<00:01:23.100> now<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.430> say

platforms up here pretty simple simply
and<00:01:42.240> energy<00:01:43.240> tank<00:01:43.770> becomes<00:01:44.770> very<00:01:45.250> handy<00:01:45.429> now

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
and energy tank becomes very handy now

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.550 
and energy tank becomes very handy now
go<00:01:46.330> below<00:01:46.630> here<00:01:46.929> so<00:01:46.960> you<00:01:47.200> have<00:01:47.229> to<00:01:47.409> deal<00:01:47.530> with

destroy<00:02:00.069> Flash<00:02:00.550> man<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.990> problem<00:02:02.409> with<00:02:02.590> this

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
destroy Flash man the problem with this

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.639 
destroy Flash man the problem with this
area<00:02:03.549> here<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.060> way<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.899> ground<00:02:05.229> is<00:02:05.469> set

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
area here is the way the ground is set

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.370 
area here is the way the ground is set
up<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:07.180> way<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.600> set<00:02:07.780> up<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.079> was<00:02:08.320> like

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
up and the way it's set up is was like

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.400 
up and the way it's set up is was like
kind<00:02:08.679> of<00:02:08.709> like<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:09.340> three<00:02:09.759> step<00:02:10.060> area<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.780> he

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
kind of like a three step area and he

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
kind of like a three step area and he
just<00:02:11.620> kind<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:11.920> runs<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.760> jumps<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.299> if<00:02:13.420> you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
just kind of runs and jumps so if you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.319 
just kind of runs and jumps so if you
try<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.660> jump<00:02:13.810> over<00:02:13.930> him<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.230> may<00:02:14.410> get<00:02:14.620> hit

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
try to jump over him you may get hit

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.640 
try to jump over him you may get hit
I'll<00:02:16.329> stupa<00:02:16.780> don't<00:02:16.930> know<00:02:16.989> why<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.140> did<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.440> but

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
I'll stupa don't know why I did that but
