actually named after an Italian glass
which<00:00:19.230> was<00:00:19.470> actually<00:00:20.099> a<00:00:20.520> Murano<00:00:21.060> style<00:00:21.390> glass

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
which was actually a Murano style glass

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.240 
which was actually a Murano style glass
that<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> mistake<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.560> made<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.770> woman<00:00:23.070> threw

that a mistake was made a woman threw

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.060 
that a mistake was made a woman threw
copper<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.970> that's<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.710> oven

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
copper in and that's how the oven

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.740 
copper in and that's how the oven
trained<00:00:26.369> glass<00:00:26.730> got<00:00:26.970> its<00:00:27.090> name<00:00:27.270> is<00:00:27.509> in<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
trained glass got its name is in the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.960 
trained glass got its name is in the
stone<00:00:27.960> was<00:00:28.140> named<00:00:28.349> after<00:00:28.559> that<00:00:28.860> as<00:00:29.040> well<00:00:29.369> so

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
stone was named after that as well so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.269 
stone was named after that as well so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
is going to come in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.300 
is going to come in
some<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.690> our<00:00:42.750> men<00:00:43.050> train<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.530> natural<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 
some of our men train is natural and

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.360 
some of our men train is natural and
some<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.970> dyed<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:46.590> green<00:00:46.800> Aven<00:00:47.070> train<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
some is dyed the green Aven train is the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
some is dyed the green Aven train is the
most<00:00:47.610> desirable<00:00:47.930> but<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.079> also<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> most

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
most desirable but it's also the most

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
most desirable but it's also the most
widespread<00:00:50.010> color<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:51.090> strengthens<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
widespread color it strengthens the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
widespread color it strengthens the
blood<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:52.560> muscle<00:00:53.070> tissue<00:00:53.220> we<00:00:53.880> have<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
blood and muscle tissue we have it in a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.850 
blood and muscle tissue we have it in a
ton<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> different<00:00:54.690> shapes<00:00:55.020> tons<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.829> tons

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
ton of different shapes tons and tons

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.650 
ton of different shapes tons and tons
and<00:00:56.220> tons<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.460> different<00:00:56.550> shapes<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:56.970> also<00:00:57.570> in

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and tons of different shapes and also in

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
and tons of different shapes and also in
different<00:00:57.960> hues<00:00:58.290> so<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.950> things<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.340> are

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
different hues so the things that are

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.670 
different hues so the things that are
undyed<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.150> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> softer<00:01:01.110> hue<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
undyed are going to be a softer hue the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.960 
undyed are going to be a softer hue the
things<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.040> are<00:01:02.130> dyed<00:01:02.340> are<00:01:02.489> definitely<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
things that are dyed are definitely a

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.200 
things that are dyed are definitely a
brighter<00:01:03.480> color<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.500> blue<00:01:04.739> dyes<00:01:05.009> are<00:01:05.460> going

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
brighter color the blue dyes are going

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.899 
brighter color the blue dyes are going
to<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:07.280> definitely<00:01:08.280> died<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:08.790> you're

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to be definitely died so when you're

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
to be definitely died so when you're
looking<00:01:08.970> at<00:01:09.149> blue<00:01:09.329> the<00:01:09.540> blue<00:01:09.689> venturina<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
looking at blue the blue venturina is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.010 
looking at blue the blue venturina is
going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.590> dyed<00:01:10.829> it<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> Cal<00:01:12.630> Sydney

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
going to be dyed it is in the Cal Sydney

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.669 
going to be dyed it is in the Cal Sydney

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
rather than blue Aven train it removes

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.609 
rather than blue Aven train it removes
toxins<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.329> stimulates<00:01:21.899> creativity<00:01:22.079> even

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
toxins and stimulates creativity even

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.590
