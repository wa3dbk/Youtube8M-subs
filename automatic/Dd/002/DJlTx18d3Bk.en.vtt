00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.089
 speaks personal beauty who speaks goals that 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.429
 marked once again of dogmatic games of the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.099
 arc rise the good was that another video 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.580
 That's good for you, and it 's one thing. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.820
 that a lot of people ask me here and it's 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.830
 how does the exchange of items there in the game does not 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.699
 It's who you do not know you can be sending 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.029
 Right? 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.269
 a piece of armor a weapon for some 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 friend of yours and psn in case you are 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.740
 need an item the case requires a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 item just passing know that only 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.690
 it's possible you can yes 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 and here I will explain how was the first 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.770
 thing you have to do is you have 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 What do you have in your world here? 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.170
 the man can his friend for example has 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 who suffers from my unhappy galadriel and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.890
 But here are the two poles those 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.190
 that in the boxes of the psn and I be them 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 are middle class do not class them 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.180
 I remember I think a statue of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.399
 software shirt and the other galadriel 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.240
 There is also the sorcerer so lets say 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.850
 which is one of them there are those who want to know one 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 stick only to be a part of owners 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 we make people take our 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.080
 inventory and remembering personal item given 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.189
 expansion and the island are not 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.830
 transferable 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.740
 This only reinforcing for the people who do not 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.560
 knows the items can not be passed and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.560
 belong to the expansion of the game only the items 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 Who had a game in the past? 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 before leaving 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.680
 this expansion is good so let 's go here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.990
 Now I'll show you. We present. 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.290
 here my stock of weapons we will have here 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.180
 a case here of software we will only see 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.660
 teaching works 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.620
 from anyone here to show case 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:57.540
 do not run around here then 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:00.300
 a better outfit is to move then see that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.030
 a piece of armor 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.420
 Here for example anything 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.310
 let's go to her that maisa 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.680
 I think that this twist of the serenade part 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.980
 a look and it is not and pumps or is the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.380
 next to the equipment you want 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.570
 pass your comrade you will do the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.150
 next 'you go here an inventory already 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.360
 item is together with him, right? 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.070
 You go on the team and when you go to 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.730
 This message appears on the team. 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.680
 on here 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.880
 the equipment will be delivered as a 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.980
 gift for the pole owner no and no 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.959
 can be picked up again by you if 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.600
 you equip you can not take away from 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.959
 back then do this you were sure 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.570
 who wants to give the item for his comrade and is 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:54.450
 when is the person pulling the people again 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.640
 for her world the item will be in the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.180
 your inventory or you can at a hostel 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.030
 or speaking that the little woman and the lc 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.640
 avoiding your inventory for example is in my 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.070
 case here will have that part right of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.310
 clothes that I then passed so my 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.570
 buddy get over there and think about the money 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.250
 his inventory 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.810
 I mistake once the piece here 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.299
 for along with the powder 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.730
 I'm sure it does remember people. 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.549
 it is another thing also do not forget that 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.700
 after you pass the item you and your friend 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.140
 have to sleep do not sleep you have 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.480
 that updating the servers is the way 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.170
 The more practical you come here to sleep or 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.730
 then in an inn with the online game and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.590
 access the server and update it 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.450
 will probably be all right 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.739
 Well, that's what counts on the adhesion of 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.000

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.310
