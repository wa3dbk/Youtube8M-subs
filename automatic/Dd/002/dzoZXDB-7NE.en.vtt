00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
when you turn the switch back on then ya

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.490 
when you turn the switch back on then ya
turn<00:01:51.450> back<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.810> again<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.290> gonna<00:01:52.380> have

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
turn back on again so we're gonna have

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.899 
turn back on again so we're gonna have
to<00:01:52.560> make<00:01:52.799> sure<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.040> turn<00:01:53.220> them<00:01:53.399> off<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
to make sure you turn them off for this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
to make sure you turn them off for this
next<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.110> we're<00:01:55.200> gonna<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.470> is

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
next bit because what we're gonna do is

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.789 
next bit because what we're gonna do is
plant<00:01:56.040> TNT<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.770> different

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
plant TNT in all of these at different

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.830 
plant TNT in all of these at different
corners<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.759> soon<00:02:00.030> as<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.360> switch<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
corners so as soon as that switch is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.039 
corners so as soon as that switch is
turned<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.189> switch<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.729> broken<00:02:03.049> it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
turned on or that switch is broken it

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.190 
turned on or that switch is broken it
means<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.740> rare<00:02:05.100> TNT<00:02:05.939> will<00:02:06.509> ignite<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
means that this rare TNT will ignite so

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199 
means that this rare TNT will ignite so
that's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:08.099> pretty<00:02:08.340> damn<00:02:08.520> cool<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that's a that's pretty damn cool so

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.490 
that's a that's pretty damn cool so
basically<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:09.750> literally<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> entire

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
basically that's literally the entire

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.790 
basically that's literally the entire
trub<00:02:11.039> it's<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.459> easy

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
trub it's really easy

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.250 
trub it's really easy
do<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.460> I'm<00:02:12.550> over<00:02:12.790> my<00:02:12.970> SMP<00:02:13.570> server<00:02:13.810> right<00:02:14.110> now

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
do so I'm over my SMP server right now

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.300 
do so I'm over my SMP server right now
and<00:02:14.500> then<00:02:14.620> basically<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.010> need<00:02:15.130> to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and then basically you just need to

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.840 
and then basically you just need to
cover<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.640> up

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
cover it up

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.250 
cover it up
and<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.240> as<00:02:16.360> soon<00:02:16.540> as<00:02:16.600> someone<00:02:16.840> comes<00:02:16.960> to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and then as soon as someone comes to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.710 
and then as soon as someone comes to
break<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.650> block<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.640> explode<00:02:19.480> so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
break that block it will explode so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.500 
break that block it will explode so
geyser<00:02:19.980> let's<00:02:20.980> let's<00:02:21.430> test<00:02:21.760> test<00:02:22.180> this<00:02:22.330> out

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510
