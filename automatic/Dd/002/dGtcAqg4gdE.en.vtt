no reason to stop doing that at the

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.270 
no reason to stop doing that at the
moment<00:05:31.060> okay<00:05:31.450> if<00:05:31.660> we<00:05:32.080> break<00:05:32.320> down<00:05:32.380> below<00:05:32.950> this

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
moment okay if we break down below this

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.330 
moment okay if we break down below this
low<00:05:33.580> point<00:05:33.940> here<00:05:34.180> of<00:05:34.300> 10<00:05:34.510> 9<00:05:34.780> 28<00:05:35.350> break<00:05:36.160> below

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.330 
low point here of 10 9 28 break below
that<00:05:36.670> stop<00:05:37.030> then<00:05:37.720> all<00:05:38.080> of<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.230> sudden<00:05:38.560> that<00:05:38.710> that

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
that stop then all of a sudden that that

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.910 
that stop then all of a sudden that that
trades<00:05:39.820> no<00:05:40.030> longer<00:05:40.510> viable<00:05:41.290> there's<00:05:41.800> no

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
trades no longer viable there's no

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.920 
trades no longer viable there's no
longer<00:05:42.190> up<00:05:42.370> stranded<00:05:42.670> in<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.970> moment<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.450> so

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
longer up stranded in the moment and so

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.390 
longer up stranded in the moment and so
then<00:05:44.080> we<00:05:44.200> would<00:05:44.380> actually<00:05:44.620> step<00:05:45.070> away<00:05:45.190> from

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
then we would actually step away from

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.350 
then we would actually step away from
that<00:05:45.550> that's<00:05:45.790> why<00:05:45.880> we're<00:05:46.030> keeping<00:05:46.090> really

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
that that's why we're keeping really

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.610 
that that's why we're keeping really
tight<00:05:46.510> stops<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.050> all<00:05:47.170> of<00:05:47.260> our<00:05:47.350> long

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
tight stops and all of our long

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.860 
tight stops and all of our long
positions<00:05:48.070> right<00:05:48.220> now<00:05:48.400> at<00:05:48.520> long<00:05:48.670> trades<00:05:49.060> but

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
positions right now at long trades but

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.350 
positions right now at long trades but
until<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.380> happens<00:05:50.650> we<00:05:51.640> can<00:05:51.820> still<00:05:52.060> go

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
until that happens we can still go

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360 
until that happens we can still go
higher<00:05:52.600> and<00:05:52.630> therefore<00:05:53.050> i'm<00:05:53.620> going<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.190> make
