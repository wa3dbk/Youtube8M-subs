00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.570
 What are they 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.739
 The first thing I will do is place in a 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.230
 Fry the oil and when it is well 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.500
 hot and I'll add the pork rind 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.870
 cut into small pieces this kit to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.269
 rum was previously fed and it 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.550
 add bicarbonate to make more 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.559
 crispy when the crackling is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.009
 golden I take it out of the pan and I take the 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.610
 excess fat then finely chop the 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:14.119
 Onion and garlic continued the preparation 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.149
 mixing the pork rind with the onion and 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.390
 the scallion what I will do now will be 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.940
 book this preparation when I have 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.580
 list the first part of the plate 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.840
 I will continue removing the shell from 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.119
 bananas and splitting them in half 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.509
 and in the same oil where fried 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.600
 chicharrÃ³n I'm going to put shaving or worship 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.939
 the bananas 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.619
 this will take me about 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.009
 five minutes remember that they should 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.530
 flip them while the bananas are 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.470
 ready what I will do is place half 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.439
 cup of water and in it a spoonful of 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.830
 salt I'm also going to prepare a cloth and 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.890
 I'll put a plastic over it 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.009
 will help not to burn me to shape 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 the ma ranita and that the banana is not 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.979
 hit at the time of crushing 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.170
 I will also use a hammer 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.800
 kitchen that will help me lower the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.800
 bananas 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.570
 when the banana is golden, what 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.390
 I will do it will be to place it inside the fabric and 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.370
 of the plastic to start kneading what 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.720
 It should be as I am 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.000
 showing thick 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.760
 with a kitchen brush I'm going to 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.380
 place on the surface a bit of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.170
 salt water that I had previously done 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.510
 then a spoonful of pork rind with 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.030
 long onion and garlic 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.020
 we are the fabric by the ends and I start 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.580
 round shape give the ma ranita 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.100
 how can you tell to have the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.340
 fabric is a benefit because that way we avoid 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.700
 burn our hands and we can give it a 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.070
 perfect shape and the plastic prevents 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.490
 it stays stuck to the little hand on the fabric and 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.280
 lose its shape look how beautiful it was 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.500
 the little frog at this moment I already have 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.050
 ready every morning and what I'll do 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.610
 will be to put a little more water with 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.980
 Salt 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.170
 then I'll fry them again in the same 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.380
 oil that we use initially 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.800
 this will take us approximately between 3 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.530
 and 5 minutes it is important that the 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.470
 turn so that they are golden brown of all 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.440
 the sides at this time and the most 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.190
 twigs are ready look how beautiful 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.330
 and perfect were also the taste is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.330
 delicious 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.450

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.730
