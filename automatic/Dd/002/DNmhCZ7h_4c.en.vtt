00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
because we're not going to make a box

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.239 
because we're not going to make a box
that's<00:01:27.049> close<00:01:27.289> we're<00:01:27.619> going<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.829> make<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.979> box

that's close we're going to make a box

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:29.800 
that's close we're going to make a box
that<00:01:28.429> you<00:01:28.460> can<00:01:28.700> open<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.359> put<00:01:29.509> other<00:01:29.689> things

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.539 
that you can open and put other things
in<00:01:30.170> I've<00:01:31.100> started<00:01:31.990> by<00:01:32.990> putting<00:01:33.890> double-sided

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
in I've started by putting double-sided

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.469 
in I've started by putting double-sided
tape<00:01:35.509> on<00:01:35.840> both<00:01:36.350> ends<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.249> a<00:01:37.880> piece<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.119> ribbon

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
tape on both ends of a piece of ribbon

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.739 
tape on both ends of a piece of ribbon
that<00:01:39.439> when<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.549> goes<00:01:40.759> around<00:01:40.999> the<00:01:41.179> box<00:01:41.420> will

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
that when it goes around the box will

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:46.050 
that when it goes around the box will
fit<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:42.079> inside<00:01:42.859> the<00:01:43.789> box<00:01:43.999> like<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:44.799> okay

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
fit just inside the box like that okay

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.300 
fit just inside the box like that okay
so<00:01:47.060> if<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:47.509> take<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.109> double-sided<00:01:48.530> tape<00:01:48.770> off

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
so if I take the double-sided tape off

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.219 
so if I take the double-sided tape off
there<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:51.619> one<00:01:51.829> side<00:01:53.079> of<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.380> other<00:01:54.499> side<00:01:56.229> put

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
there the one side of the other side put

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.519 
there the one side of the other side put
it<00:01:57.380> down<00:01:57.560> in<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.979> center<00:02:02.109> so<00:02:03.109> if<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.350> look

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529

you<00:02:19.640> don't<00:02:19.819> particularly<00:02:20.810> tight<00:02:21.349> but<00:02:21.680> you

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
you don't particularly tight but you

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.550 
you don't particularly tight but you
certainly<00:02:22.099> don't<00:02:22.400> want<00:02:22.609> it<00:02:22.700> loose<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:24.079> do

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
certainly don't want it loose and do

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.520 
certainly don't want it loose and do
exactly<00:02:24.829> the<00:02:25.129> same<00:02:25.159> with<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:25.609> one<00:02:26.530> again

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
exactly the same with this one again

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:40.679 
exactly the same with this one again
crossing<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.370> center

okay port
push<00:02:44.659> down<00:02:45.370> there<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:46.489> are<00:02:46.519> quite<00:02:46.879> quickly

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
push down there we are quite quickly

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.929 
push down there we are quite quickly
you've<00:02:47.420> got<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.780> turn<00:02:48.019> right<00:02:48.650> now<00:02:49.010> then<00:02:49.250> in

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
you've got that turn right now then in

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.390 
you've got that turn right now then in
order<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.329> do<00:02:50.659> the<00:02:51.139> bow<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.180> one<00:02:54.400> I've

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
order to do the bow like this one I've

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.520 
order to do the bow like this one I've
got<00:02:55.639> my<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.510> rest<00:02:56.689> of<00:02:56.840> my<00:02:56.959> piece<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.349> ribbon

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
got my the rest of my piece of ribbon

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.740 
got my the rest of my piece of ribbon
and<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:57.980> time<00:02:58.189> I'm<00:02:58.370> not<00:02:58.400> actually<00:02:58.819> going<00:02:59.389> to

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
and this time I'm not actually going to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.339 
and this time I'm not actually going to
cut<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.470> at<00:03:00.739> all<00:03:01.010> I'm<00:03:01.340> left<00:03:01.939> left<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.900> as<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.200> was

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
cut it at all I'm left left it as it was

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.890 
cut it at all I'm left left it as it was
in<00:03:03.950> one<00:03:04.250> length<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.879> I'm<00:03:05.090> threading<00:03:05.750> it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
in one length and I'm threading it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.830 
in one length and I'm threading it
underneath<00:03:06.379> there<00:03:07.129> now<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.269> don't<00:03:08.389> actually

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
underneath there now I don't actually

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.659 
underneath there now I don't actually
want<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.889> use<00:03:10.900> ribbon<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.109> don't<00:03:12.769> make<00:03:12.950> loops

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669 
want to use ribbon I don't make loops

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:14.589 
want to use ribbon I don't make loops
that<00:03:13.819> are<00:03:13.879> too<00:03:14.120> long

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
that are too long

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.170 
that are too long
so<00:03:15.319> if<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.739> because<00:03:16.250> I'm<00:03:16.340> right-handed<00:03:16.519> I<00:03:16.939> like

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
so if I because I'm right-handed I like

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.530 
so if I because I'm right-handed I like
to<00:03:17.419> have<00:03:17.599> this<00:03:18.109> in<00:03:18.379> my<00:03:18.439> right<00:03:19.159> hand<00:03:19.459> I'm<00:03:20.359> going

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
to have this in my right hand I'm going

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.939 
to have this in my right hand I'm going
to<00:03:20.629> make<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.989> loop<00:03:21.939> there<00:03:22.939> and<00:03:23.709> then<00:03:24.709> on<00:03:24.829> the

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
to make a loop there and then on the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.559 
to make a loop there and then on the
other<00:03:24.979> side<00:03:25.370> I'm<00:03:25.669> also<00:03:25.879> going<00:03:26.329> to<00:03:26.449> make

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
other side I'm also going to make

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:38.080 
other side I'm also going to make
another<00:03:27.470> loop<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.040> then<00:03:28.970> I'll<00:03:29.269> tie<00:03:29.659> them<00:03:37.090> so

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
another loop and then I'll tie them so

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.189 
another loop and then I'll tie them so
then<00:03:38.900> pull<00:03:39.229> it<00:03:39.319> tight<00:03:40.090> not<00:03:41.090> greasy<00:03:41.599> because<00:03:41.930> I

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
then pull it tight not greasy because I

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.319 
then pull it tight not greasy because I
actually<00:03:42.680> made<00:03:43.040> quite<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.519> small<00:03:43.849> loop<00:03:44.150> I

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
actually made quite a small loop I

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.729 
actually made quite a small loop I
haven't<00:03:44.659> got<00:03:44.750> them<00:03:44.840> too<00:03:45.049> big<00:03:45.199> if<00:03:45.409> I've<00:03:45.560> made

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
haven't got them too big if I've made

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.259 
haven't got them too big if I've made
big<00:03:46.010> loops<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.430> have<00:03:46.549> been<00:03:46.669> off<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.939> side<00:03:47.120> of

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
big loops that have been off the side of

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.770 
big loops that have been off the side of
the<00:03:47.329> box<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:48.769> once<00:03:49.370> you've<00:03:49.489> done<00:03:49.669> that<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
the box so once you've done that you

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.520 
the box so once you've done that you
then<00:03:50.810> take<00:03:51.290> your<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:53.209> fold<00:03:53.509> the<00:03:53.989> ribbon<00:03:54.319> in

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
then take your you fold the ribbon in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.439 
then take your you fold the ribbon in
half<00:03:55.099> like<00:03:55.729> that

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
half like that

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:01.360 
half like that
take<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.319> sharp<00:03:57.650> scissors<00:03:59.799> if<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:00.979> had<00:04:01.159> one<00:04:01.340> of

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
take a sharp scissors if I had one of

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.270 
take a sharp scissors if I had one of
those<00:04:01.519> be<00:04:01.819> wonderful<00:04:02.509> and<00:04:02.750> cut<00:04:03.709> there<00:04:04.009> like

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
those be wonderful and cut there like

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.619 
those be wonderful and cut there like
that<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.729> you've<00:04:04.879> made<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.329> sort<00:04:05.540> of

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
that so you've made that sort of

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.869 
that so you've made that sort of
dovetail<00:04:06.139> and<00:04:06.439> then<00:04:06.979> you<00:04:07.099> do<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.400> same<00:04:07.639> on<00:04:07.790> the

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
dovetail and then you do the same on the

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.839 
dovetail and then you do the same on the
other<00:04:07.909> side<00:04:08.919> actually<00:04:09.919> it's<00:04:10.340> probably<00:04:10.489> easy

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
other side actually it's probably easy

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.699 
other side actually it's probably easy
on<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.150> other<00:04:11.239> side<00:04:11.419> if<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.629> just<00:04:11.810> cut<00:04:12.319> it<00:04:12.530> about

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
on the other side if I just cut it about

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.960 
on the other side if I just cut it about
the<00:04:12.979> right<00:04:13.250> length<00:04:13.519> first

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.760 

so<00:04:18.600> we're<00:04:18.750> on<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.989> same<00:04:19.230> place<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:21.200> then<00:04:22.200> fold

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
so we're on the same place and then fold

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.800 
so we're on the same place and then fold
it<00:04:22.950> again<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.610> do<00:04:24.030> another<00:04:24.060> dev<00:04:24.660> tale<00:04:26.780> okay

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
it again and do another dev tale okay

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.260 
it again and do another dev tale okay
whoops<00:04:28.400> into<00:04:29.400> brilliant<00:04:29.790> but<00:04:29.970> don't<00:04:30.150> worry

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
whoops into brilliant but don't worry

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.480 
whoops into brilliant but don't worry
it's<00:04:30.720> almost<00:04:30.960> better<00:04:31.200> when<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.980> so-called

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
it's almost better when the so-called

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.120 
it's almost better when the so-called
expert<00:04:33.000> makes<00:04:33.270> mistakes<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:34.770> can<00:04:34.920> do<00:04:35.010> it

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
expert makes mistakes you can do it

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.780 
expert makes mistakes you can do it
again<00:04:35.370> okay<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.000> that's<00:04:36.330> out<00:04:36.540> of<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.780> way<00:04:36.900> now

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
again okay so that's out of the way now

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.100 
again okay so that's out of the way now
all<00:04:38.790> right<00:04:38.850> now<00:04:38.940> then<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.450> get<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.750> flow<00:04:39.930> in

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
all right now then to get the flow in

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.460 
all right now then to get the flow in
the<00:04:40.230> center<00:04:40.740> what<00:04:41.220> I'm<00:04:41.310> actually<00:04:41.460> going<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.940> do

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
the center what I'm actually going to do

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.420 
the center what I'm actually going to do
is<00:04:43.470> thread<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.130> flower<00:04:44.400> through<00:04:45.300> there<00:04:46.430> like

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
is thread the flower through there like

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.010 
is thread the flower through there like
that<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:48.410> then<00:04:49.410> go<00:04:49.860> over<00:04:50.100> there

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
that and then go over there

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.530 
that and then go over there
like<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.230> so<00:04:52.740> that's<00:04:52.920> now<00:04:53.310> secure<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.390> the

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
like that so that's now secure in the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.250 
like that so that's now secure in the
center<00:04:56.060> then<00:04:57.060> I'm<00:04:57.420> going<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.660> take<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:57.870> little

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
center then I'm going to take a little

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.740 
center then I'm going to take a little
needle<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:59.640> with<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.970> knitting<00:05:00.330> needle

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
needle and with the knitting needle

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.380 
needle and with the knitting needle
pointed<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.680> way<00:05:02.030> I'm<00:05:03.030> going<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.630> wrap<00:05:04.200> the

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
pointed that way I'm going to wrap the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.530 
pointed that way I'm going to wrap the
wire<00:05:06.390> around<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:07.440> needle<00:05:08.300> four<00:05:09.300> or<00:05:09.390> five

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
wire around the needle four or five

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.160 
wire around the needle four or five
times

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
times

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.080 
times
Polly<00:05:10.710> sides<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.430> just<00:05:11.670> gives<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.030> a

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
Polly sides and that just gives you a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.150 
Polly sides and that just gives you a
little<00:05:12.210> sort<00:05:12.600> of<00:05:12.660> tendril<00:05:13.380> from<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.740> rose<00:05:13.920> and

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
little sort of tendril from the rose and

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.820 
little sort of tendril from the rose and
it's<00:05:14.310> better<00:05:14.640> than<00:05:14.940> actually<00:05:15.650> removing<00:05:16.650> it

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
it's better than actually removing it

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.810 
it's better than actually removing it
because<00:05:18.560> it's<00:05:19.560> harder<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.100> hold<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.580> flower

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
because it's harder to hold the flower

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.420 
because it's harder to hold the flower
in<00:05:21.030> place<00:05:21.270> so<00:05:21.870> we<00:05:22.410> are<00:05:22.560> very<00:05:22.770> quickly<00:05:23.160> and

in place so we are very quickly and

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.000 
in place so we are very quickly and
easily<00:05:23.610> you've<00:05:24.240> got<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.780> nicely<00:05:25.020> decorated<00:05:25.320> box

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010
