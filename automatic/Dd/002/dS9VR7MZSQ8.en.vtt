00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
running on the tray I recently learned

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.510 
running on the tray I recently learned
that<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.320> don't<00:00:28.440> actually<00:00:28.770> have<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> worry

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
that we don't actually have to worry

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.030 
that we don't actually have to worry
about<00:00:29.730> closing<00:00:30.210> those<00:00:30.570> apps<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.440> can<00:00:31.650> let<00:00:31.800> them

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
about closing those apps we can let them

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.460 
about closing those apps we can let them
close<00:00:32.279> independently<00:00:32.970> but<00:00:33.570> Apple<00:00:33.960> does<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
close independently but Apple does is

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.100 
close independently but Apple does is
automatically<00:00:35.070> close<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:36.450> apps<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.989> are

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
automatically close the apps that are

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.799 
automatically close the apps that are
that<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.790> consuming<00:00:38.790> any<00:00:38.940> memory<00:00:39.330> which

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that are consuming any memory which

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.979 
that are consuming any memory which
would<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.489> things<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.550> Pandora<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.360> iTunes

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
would be things like Pandora or iTunes

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.930 
would be things like Pandora or iTunes
that<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.200> actually<00:00:43.440> running<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.340> playing

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that are actually running and playing

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.630 
that are actually running and playing
music<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.600> other<00:00:46.020> apps<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:46.500> running<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.040> it's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
music as other apps are running and it's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
music as other apps are running and it's
going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> close<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.480> down<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.260> needs

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
going to close them down as it needs

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
going to close them down as it needs
resources<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.400> don't<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.909> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
resources so you don't actually have to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.060 
resources so you don't actually have to
worry<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.480> closing<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:52.140> down<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
worry about closing them down like I

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.100 
worry about closing them down like I
mentioned<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.610> previous<00:00:53.850> episode<00:00:54.330> well
