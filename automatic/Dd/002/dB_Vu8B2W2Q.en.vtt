so I think just avoid it yeah I mean I

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.100 
so I think just avoid it yeah I mean I
give<00:06:32.940> it<00:06:33.060> like<00:06:33.150> a<00:06:33.180> one-and-a-half<00:06:33.600> that's

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
give it like a one-and-a-half that's

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.890 
give it like a one-and-a-half that's
really<00:06:34.410> for<00:06:34.590> fashion<00:06:35.040> and<00:06:35.250> for<00:06:35.730> UI<00:06:35.970> and<00:06:36.330> like<00:06:36.810> I

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
really for fashion and for UI and like I
