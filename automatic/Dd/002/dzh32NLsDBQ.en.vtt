 A German sports car manufacturer today driving to the German factory in Te 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.930

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.730
 Germany

 It is actually the already the factory 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.810

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.149
 currently set 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.360

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.310
 and the 50 of the new GPS that we will see later 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.820
 and sadness and too small they have grown a little out of their jacket 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 and the new factory that will also see later on the other side 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.210
 so that there is no p 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.220
 so actually a new eurotop with a heavier v8 yes and what is not this 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.960
 actually and if deployable in italy 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 and a little bit of weird bit weird throw it in a blender and we put that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.940
 for length 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.560
 because touch 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 lazio state 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.150
 you're walking 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.870
 the number 35 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.360
 the group is already ready 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.550

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.490

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.550
 all different types of reading 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.310
 if she agrees with the car the guests in seoul always takes place 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 worse 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.430
 my legs 9 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.220
 this involves an amount 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.409
 bring the leg 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:16.209
 I say that nonsense yes yes the difference with the red sea and a design of 25,000 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.279
 euros 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:21.219
 true that norms and values ​​but I think very important with it 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 to listen 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.819
 the new factory 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.399
 on the other side of the town 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.819
 be here now every year 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.409
 wiesmann boots is built 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.360
 then go 650 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.049
 one may point 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.189
 it is very doubtful 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.749
 The great thing about his fallen cars is that you actually 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.259
 put everything together yourself 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.569
 so also the color 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.339
 and whether you 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.669
 Harry de Wit wants or wants something darker in that black 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:10.189
 does not matter 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.939
 both the outside and we color leather 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.639
 can be put together completely 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.699

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.589
 I missed the engine and in doing so she said she was already experimenting in May in 2005 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.769
 and he may soon come to the minister 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.329
 the price of this 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.389
 this man no me nobody 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.389
 this one in the Netherlands 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.899
 germany hand 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.119
 9 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.949
 to be a farmer for that money 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:48.389
 and this is faster 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.709
 again 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.709
 cor swanenberg year almost 100,000 old cars 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.509
 two in three years 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.959
 are not excluded 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:00.939
 minister 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.959
 local residents and block of bmw 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.229
 343 hp 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.479
 mj is specific to someone 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.929
 except now to this man 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.929
 eleven 100 kilos and 343 hp 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.859
 0 to 100 km less than 5 seconds 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:17.969
 not limited 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.969
 more than 20 17 meters per hour 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.270
 it was about 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.270
 imports from the Netherlands 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:43.289
 utrecht and I am completely burnt out I often have the twenty-fold reports 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.900
 director about this weather in the Netherlands 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.120
 it is the car that makes me incredibly surprising because it drives 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.800
 incredibly tasty, this is mainly due to the m3 engine 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.199
 so actually you have the best of both worlds delicious meal 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.219
 and you are actually taken seriously with this car from Amsterdam West 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.240
 and that is nice too, I no longer have it safely inside
