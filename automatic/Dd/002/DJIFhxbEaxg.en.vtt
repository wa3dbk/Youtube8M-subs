and greening pin and then press it in

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.199 
and greening pin and then press it in
and<00:03:14.200> you'll<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.409> this<00:03:15.769> right<00:03:16.250> around<00:03:16.459> this

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
and you'll do this right around this

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.699 
and you'll do this right around this
anemone<00:03:18.049> part<00:03:18.379> and<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.790> next<00:03:20.540> type<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:20.930> wrap

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
anemone part and the next type of wrap

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.490 
anemone part and the next type of wrap
that<00:03:22.010> we're<00:03:22.190> going<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.400> do<00:03:22.610> again<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:23.299> just

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
that we're going to do again it's just

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.250 
that we're going to do again it's just
we're<00:03:24.500> giving<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:24.950> kind<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.310> an<00:03:25.430> ocean<00:03:25.790> feel<00:03:26.450> to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
we're giving it kind of an ocean feel to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.440 
we're giving it kind of an ocean feel to
it<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:28.220> wanted<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.760> create<00:03:29.120> some<00:03:29.420> really

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
it so I wanted to create some really

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.110 
it so I wanted to create some really
distinct<00:03:31.329> different<00:03:32.329> loops<00:03:33.670> take<00:03:34.670> your<00:03:34.849> deco

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
distinct different loops take your deco

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.229 
distinct different loops take your deco
mesh<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.870> want<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.950> hide<00:03:37.159> that<00:03:37.190> first<00:03:37.670> part<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.209> I

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
mesh I want to hide that first part so I

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.430 
mesh I want to hide that first part so I
just<00:03:38.480> bend<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.379> right<00:03:39.440> in<00:03:41.170> set<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.410> your

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
just bend it right in set it on your

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.119 
just bend it right in set it on your
wreath<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.609> use<00:03:44.150> greening<00:03:44.629> pen<00:03:44.870> again<00:03:45.200> push

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
wreath and use greening pen again push

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.330 
wreath and use greening pen again push
it<00:03:46.310> in<00:03:47.200> then<00:03:48.200> we're<00:03:48.379> going<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.530> create<00:03:48.799> kind<00:03:49.250> of

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
it in then we're going to create kind of

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.890 
it in then we're going to create kind of
a<00:03:49.430> wave<00:03:49.700> maybe<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.629> handful<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.500> size<00:03:51.739> and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
a wave maybe a handful of a size and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.990 
a wave maybe a handful of a size and
loop<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.140> great<00:03:54.650> thing<00:03:54.859> about<00:03:55.040> deco<00:03:55.459> mesh<00:03:55.760> it

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
loop it great thing about deco mesh it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.369 
loop it great thing about deco mesh it
has<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.239> mind<00:03:56.629> of<00:03:56.750> its<00:03:56.870> own<00:03:58.720> but<00:03:59.720> because<00:04:00.200> it

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
has a mind of its own but because it

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.470 
has a mind of its own but because it
does<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:01.489> forms<00:04:02.200> perfect<00:04:03.200> loops<00:04:03.530> for<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.480> now

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
does it forms perfect loops for you now

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.640 
does it forms perfect loops for you now
we're<00:04:05.750> going<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.930> go<00:04:06.370> turn<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.579> back<00:04:08.180> in

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
we're going to go turn it back in

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.680 
we're going to go turn it back in
covering<00:04:09.650> as<00:04:09.799> much<00:04:10.069> space<00:04:10.400> as<00:04:10.459> we<00:04:10.849> can<00:04:11.180> over

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
covering as much space as we can over

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.190 
covering as much space as we can over
the<00:04:12.500> wreath<00:04:12.799> if<00:04:13.130> you<00:04:13.940> still<00:04:14.269> see<00:04:14.510> parts<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:15.049> the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the wreath if you still see parts of the

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.900 
the wreath if you still see parts of the
wreath<00:04:15.440> we<00:04:15.709> can<00:04:15.859> hide<00:04:16.099> that<00:04:16.280> later<00:04:16.579> with<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
wreath we can hide that later with a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.560 
wreath we can hide that later with a
shell<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.760> I'm<00:04:19.760> just<00:04:20.090> going<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.269> continue

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
shell and I'm just going to continue

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.680 
shell and I'm just going to continue
this<00:04:21.729> around<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:24.010> also<00:04:25.010> not<00:04:25.550> forgetting<00:04:26.030> the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
this around and also not forgetting the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.150 
this around and also not forgetting the
sides

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.150 

you<00:04:29.910> can<00:04:30.120> open<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.720> up<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.290> spread<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.800> little

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
you can open it up to spread a little

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.590 
you can open it up to spread a little
bit<00:04:32.310> more<00:04:32.550> space<00:04:33.680> but<00:04:34.680> just<00:04:34.980> watch<00:04:35.330> step<00:04:36.330> back

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
bit more space but just watch step back

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.870 
bit more space but just watch step back
from<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:36.960> as<00:04:37.290> you're<00:04:37.500> forming<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.700> can

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
from it as you're forming it so you can

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.570 
from it as you're forming it so you can
make<00:04:39.060> sure<00:04:39.270> you're<00:04:39.860> filling<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.220> all<00:04:41.520> the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
make sure you're filling in all the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.090 
make sure you're filling in all the
sides<00:04:42.090> just<00:04:43.730> like<00:04:44.730> this<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.710> again<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.920> can

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
sides just like this and again you can

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.540 
sides just like this and again you can
see<00:04:47.340> one<00:04:47.520> of<00:04:47.550> our<00:04:47.760> Finnish<00:04:48.180> wreaths<00:04:49.550> right

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
see one of our Finnish wreaths right

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.050 
see one of our Finnish wreaths right
here<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.210> what<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.200> looks<00:04:52.440> like<00:04:52.650> this<00:04:53.310> one<00:04:53.580> we

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
here and what it looks like this one we

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.050 
here and what it looks like this one we
used<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.570> different<00:04:54.810> color<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:56.430> create<00:04:56.850> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
used a different color to create the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.260 
used a different color to create the
anemone<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.780> our<00:04:58.590> seal<00:04:59.160> I've<00:04:59.460> kind<00:04:59.880> of<00:04:59.970> feel

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
anemone and our seal I've kind of feel

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.960 
anemone and our seal I've kind of feel
and<00:05:00.570> then<00:05:00.900> glue<00:05:01.380> our<00:05:01.590> shells<00:05:01.890> in<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.550> can<00:05:02.730> also

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
and then glue our shells in you can also

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
and then glue our shells in you can also
use<00:05:03.450> this<00:05:04.410> is<00:05:04.710> some<00:05:05.000> sparkly<00:05:06.000> shreds<00:05:06.540> that

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
use this is some sparkly shreds that

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
use this is some sparkly shreds that
kind<00:05:07.980> of<00:05:08.040> access<00:05:08.520> sea<00:05:08.760> foam<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.210> well<00:05:10.010> then

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
kind of access sea foam as well then

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.900 
kind of access sea foam as well then
embellish<00:05:11.820> with<00:05:12.180> your<00:05:12.390> seashells<00:05:13.910> another

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
embellish with your seashells another

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.680 
embellish with your seashells another
fun<00:05:15.210> way<00:05:15.420> to<00:05:15.480> create<00:05:16.140> a<00:05:16.170> summary
