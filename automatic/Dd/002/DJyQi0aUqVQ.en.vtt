00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.320 

I<00:00:00.319> like<00:00:01.319> installing<00:00:01.800> ABR's<00:00:02.460> on<00:00:02.850> things<00:00:03.210> that

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
I like installing ABR's on things that

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.240 
I like installing ABR's on things that
probably<00:00:03.570> shouldn't<00:00:03.929> have<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.170> VRS<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.770> making

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
probably shouldn't have a VRS and making

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.220 
probably shouldn't have a VRS and making
a<00:00:05.370> VRS<00:00:05.670> do<00:00:05.940> things<00:00:06.210> they<00:00:06.450> probably<00:00:06.600> shouldn't

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
a VRS do things they probably shouldn't

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.379 
a VRS do things they probably shouldn't
do<00:00:07.440> their<00:00:08.160> tiny<00:00:08.400> little<00:00:08.490> microcontrollers

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
do their tiny little microcontrollers

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.419 
do their tiny little microcontrollers
really<00:00:10.139> small<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.590> points<00:00:10.889> about<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> size

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
really small this points about the size

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.610 
really small this points about the size
of<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> pencil<00:00:11.910> eraser<00:00:12.139> one<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.290> things<00:00:13.469> I

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
of a pencil eraser one of the things I

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.900 
of a pencil eraser one of the things I
have<00:00:13.710> done<00:00:13.740> historically<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.610> get<00:00:14.759> these

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
have done historically was get these

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.689 
have done historically was get these
little<00:00:15.150> guys<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.630> go<00:00:15.780> make<00:00:15.960> NTSC<00:00:16.740> video<00:00:16.920> that

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
little guys to go make NTSC video that

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.250 
little guys to go make NTSC video that
means<00:00:17.789> outputting<00:00:18.330> video<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.869> these<00:00:19.020> old

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
means outputting video to these old

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
means outputting video to these old
analog<00:00:19.710> sets<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.400> even<00:00:20.670> newer<00:00:20.789> sets<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.930> it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
analog sets or even newer sets so it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
analog sets or even newer sets so it's
working<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.740> fine<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.939> actually

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
working just fine this one actually

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.810 
working just fine this one actually
doesn't<00:00:24.420> need<00:00:24.630> any<00:00:24.869> external<00:00:25.410> components<00:00:26.130> all

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
doesn't need any external components all

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.210 
doesn't need any external components all
it<00:00:27.000> has<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.449> two<00:00:27.689> double<00:00:27.810> bypass<00:00:28.050> caps<00:00:28.560> as

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it has is the two double bypass caps as

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.070 
it has is the two double bypass caps as
little<00:00:29.580> ABC<00:00:30.090> running<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.779> see<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
little ABC running so I can see the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 
little ABC running so I can see the
voltage<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.640> slider<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
voltage of this little slider here and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.940 
voltage of this little slider here and
the<00:00:33.690> little<00:00:33.899> graph<00:00:34.079> almost<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.829> an

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the little graph almost like an

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.580 
the little graph almost like an
oscilloscope<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.790> very<00:00:36.000> slow<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
oscilloscope just very slow of what the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.389 
oscilloscope just very slow of what the
voltages<00:00:38.070> work<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:40.530> overclocked<00:00:41.040> about

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
voltages work and it's overclocked about

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.450 
voltages work and it's overclocked about
thirty<00:00:41.730> megahertz<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> just

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
thirty megahertz and it's just

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
thirty megahertz and it's just
generating<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:44.969> NTSC<00:00:45.510> video<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.410> might<00:00:46.530> be

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
generating this NTSC video you might be

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.110 
generating this NTSC video you might be
wondering<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.309> what's<00:00:47.489> different<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:47.879> this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
wondering so what's different about this

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.160 
wondering so what's different about this
video<00:00:48.420> than<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.629> previous<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:50.960> it's<00:00:51.960> not

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
video than the previous one it's not

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.840 
video than the previous one it's not
plugged<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.800> television

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.160 

so<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.270> actually<00:00:57.420> doing<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
so what we're actually doing here is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.340 
so what we're actually doing here is
this<00:00:58.469> little<00:00:58.590> eighty<00:00:58.890> tiny<00:00:59.309> 85<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.750> using<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this little eighty tiny 85 as using the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.340 
this little eighty tiny 85 as using the
internal<00:01:01.739> PLL<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> 60<00:01:03.719> megahertz<00:01:03.989> clock

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
internal PLL with the 60 megahertz clock

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.429 
internal PLL with the 60 megahertz clock
as<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> primary<00:01:04.949> frequency<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.990> taking

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
as the primary frequency and it's taking

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
as the primary frequency and it's taking
that<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.369> using<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.000> timer<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.780> output

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that and it's using the timer one output

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
that and it's using the timer one output
with<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.650> timer<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.250> output<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
with the timer one output and the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
with the timer one output and the
inverting<00:01:12.330> output<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.170> dead<00:01:13.320> time

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
inverting output and the dead time

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.070 
inverting output and the dead time
generator<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.580> order<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> create<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.509> roughly

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
generator in order to create a roughly

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320 
generator in order to create a roughly
60<00:01:16.560> megahertz<00:01:16.830> signal<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> be

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
60 megahertz signal that's going to be

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
60 megahertz signal that's going to be
on<00:01:18.450> channel<00:01:18.960> three<00:01:19.229> that's<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.100> really

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
on channel three that's all I can really

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.480 
on channel three that's all I can really
to<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.670> TV<00:01:20.880> too<00:01:21.210> because<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.689> lost<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> remote

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
to my TV too because I lost the remote

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.719 
to my TV too because I lost the remote
so<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:24.030> order<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> encode<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.860> am<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.430> too<00:01:26.490> late

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
so in order to encode or am I too late

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.679 
so in order to encode or am I too late
two<00:01:26.939> different<00:01:27.240> things

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
two different things

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.410 
two different things
we<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> either<00:01:28.380> use<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:29.130> pin<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.909> other<00:01:30.090> pin

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
we can either use one pin the other pin

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.230 
we can either use one pin the other pin
both<00:01:30.869> pins<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.530> neither<00:01:31.979> pin<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.150> I'm

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
both pins or neither pin so what I'm

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
both pins or neither pin so what I'm
actually<00:01:33.390> doing<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.500> two<00:01:34.710> antennas

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
actually doing here is the two antennas

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
actually doing here is the two antennas
are<00:01:35.310> slightly<00:01:35.820> different<00:01:36.180> lengths<00:01:36.509> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
are slightly different lengths and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.319 
are slightly different lengths and
that's<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.430> amount<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> brightness

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
that's because the amount of brightness

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.330 
that's because the amount of brightness
that<00:01:39.930> would<00:01:40.110> come<00:01:40.350> from<00:01:40.380> them<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:41.189> be

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that would come from them would be

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.789 
that would come from them would be
different<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.659> difference<00:01:42.990> between<00:01:43.049> sink

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
different so the difference between sink

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
different so the difference between sink
tip<00:01:44.040> which<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.399> when<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.570> inverted<00:01:46.079> space

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
tip which is when in an inverted space

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380 
tip which is when in an inverted space
for<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> ham<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.119> full

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
for a ham you have to have the full

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.080 
for a ham you have to have the full
signal<00:01:48.869> both<00:01:49.259> pins<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.549> black<00:01:51.210> lovely

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
signal both pins on and black lovely

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.310 
signal both pins on and black lovely
which<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:52.329> where<00:01:52.479> one<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:52.810> pins<00:01:53.020> would<00:01:53.200> be
