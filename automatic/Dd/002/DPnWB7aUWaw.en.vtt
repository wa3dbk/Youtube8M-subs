vehicle batteries you usually run a

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.999 
vehicle batteries you usually run a
little<00:00:26.300> higher<00:00:26.450> amperage<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:27.020> charge<00:00:27.860> a

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
little higher amperage to charge a

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.400 
little higher amperage to charge a
faster<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.790> more<00:00:29.300> efficiently<00:00:29.809> when<00:00:30.259> these

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
small batteries like this you don't ever

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.990 
small batteries like this you don't ever
want<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.480> exceed<00:00:32.809> 6<00:00:33.290> amps<00:00:33.739> eight<00:00:34.610> would<00:00:34.940> be

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
want to exceed 6 amps eight would be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.150 
want to exceed 6 amps eight would be
okay<00:00:35.570> but<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.170> wouldn't<00:00:36.500> take<00:00:36.590> it<00:00:36.649> no<00:00:36.860> more<00:00:37.040> than

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
okay but I wouldn't take it no more than

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.569 
okay but I wouldn't take it no more than
that

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
that

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.840 
that
I<00:00:37.610> usually<00:00:38.360> run<00:00:38.690> but<00:00:39.050> six<00:00:39.440> amps<00:00:39.860> or<00:00:40.040> if<00:00:40.730> I'm

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
I usually run but six amps or if I'm

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.640 
I usually run but six amps or if I'm
going<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:41.059> leave<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:41.329> on<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.480> trickle<00:00:42.080> charge<00:00:42.110> or

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
going to leave it on a trickle charge or

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.890 
going to leave it on a trickle charge or
just<00:00:42.800> running<00:00:43.010> on<00:00:43.160> two<00:00:43.340> amps<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.480> sometimes

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
just running on two amps and sometimes

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.230 
just running on two amps and sometimes
they<00:00:45.020> don't<00:00:45.080> help<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.590> D<00:00:46.250> sulfate<00:00:46.790> of<00:00:46.910> battery

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
they don't help the D sulfate of battery

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.540 
they don't help the D sulfate of battery
which<00:00:47.840> is<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.140> what<00:00:48.710> causes<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:49.100> bear<00:00:49.310> to<00:00:49.430> go

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
which is the what causes a bear to go

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.069 
which is the what causes a bear to go
bad<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:49.940> cruising<00:00:50.450> on<00:00:50.540> all<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.840> plates

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
bad is cruising on all the plates

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.080 
bad is cruising on all the plates
basically<00:00:51.980> all<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:52.220> need<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.430> do<00:00:52.579> to<00:00:52.820> charge

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
basically all you need to do to charge

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.170 
basically all you need to do to charge
the<00:00:53.210> batteries<00:00:53.800> first<00:00:54.800> thing<00:00:55.010> do<00:00:55.280> is<00:00:55.340> pick<00:00:56.030> up

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
the batteries first thing do is pick up

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.540 
the batteries first thing do is pick up
your<00:00:56.390> two<00:00:56.590> clamps<00:00:57.590> here<00:00:57.770> real<00:00:58.010> building<00:00:58.400> or

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
your two clamps here real building or

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.620 
your two clamps here real building or
wires<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.040> also<00:01:01.040> when<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.000> battery<00:01:02.300> like<00:01:02.420> is

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
wires and also when a battery like is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.569 
wires and also when a battery like is
where<00:01:02.810> it's<00:01:02.899> underneath<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.290> seat<00:01:03.560> might<00:01:04.430> be

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
where it's underneath the seat might be

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.969 
where it's underneath the seat might be
best<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:05.030> figure<00:01:05.479> out<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.689> way<00:01:05.869> to<00:01:05.930> kind<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.799> turn

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
best to figure out a way to kind of turn

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.590 
best to figure out a way to kind of turn
that<00:01:07.009> outside<00:01:07.490> like<00:01:07.759> this<00:01:07.970> case<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.360> seat

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
that outside like this case the seat

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.719 
that outside like this case the seat
comes<00:01:08.899> down<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:10.310> want<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:10.579> worry<00:01:10.700> about

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
comes down you want to worry about

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.749 
comes down you want to worry about
nothing<00:01:10.970> shorting<00:01:11.450> out<00:01:11.540> you<00:01:11.750> know<00:01:12.670> but<00:01:13.670> you

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
nothing shorting out you know but you

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.819 
nothing shorting out you know but you
always<00:01:13.880> want<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.240> hook<00:01:14.329> it<00:01:14.509> up<00:01:14.600> first<00:01:14.899> then

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
always want to hook it up first then

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.980 
always want to hook it up first then
plug<00:01:16.219> the<00:01:16.369> charger<00:01:16.549> in<00:01:16.909> because<00:01:17.659> if<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.869> hook

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
plug the charger in because if you hook

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.690 
plug the charger in because if you hook
it<00:01:18.170> up<00:01:18.319> with<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.799> charger<00:01:19.159> ones<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.429> can<00:01:19.579> get

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
it up with the charger ones you can get

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.669 
it up with the charger ones you can get
sparks<00:01:20.149> here<00:01:20.359> most<00:01:21.049> of<00:01:21.139> the<00:01:21.200> time<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:21.649> be

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
sparks here most of the time to be

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.109 
sparks here most of the time to be
honest<00:01:22.069> with<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.280> guys<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.639> don't<00:01:22.700> do<00:01:22.969> this

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
honest with you guys I don't do this

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.969 
honest with you guys I don't do this
myself<00:01:23.329> but<00:01:23.810> I'm<00:01:23.929> just<00:01:24.079> telling<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
myself but I'm just telling you the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.419 
myself but I'm just telling you the
proper<00:01:25.310> way<00:01:25.459> of<00:01:25.490> doing<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.740> reason

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
proper way of doing it and the reason

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.029 
proper way of doing it and the reason
behind<00:01:28.579> that<00:01:29.319> prevents<00:01:30.319> parking<00:01:30.770> here<00:01:30.920> when

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
behind that prevents parking here when

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.069 
behind that prevents parking here when
you<00:01:31.130> hook<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.399> up<00:01:31.670> because<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.719> batteries

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
you hook this up because the batteries

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.660 
you hook this up because the batteries
release<00:01:33.259> hydrogen<00:01:33.649> gas<00:01:34.159> when<00:01:34.549> they're

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
release hydrogen gas when they're

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.649 
release hydrogen gas when they're
charging<00:01:34.999> and<00:01:35.420> electrolysis<00:01:36.079> of<00:01:36.409> water<00:01:36.770> and

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
charging and electrolysis of water and

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.239 
charging and electrolysis of water and
if<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:38.810> have<00:01:38.929> a<00:01:38.959> spark<00:01:39.380> right<00:01:39.560> here<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.920> think

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
if you have a spark right here I think

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.129 
if you have a spark right here I think
it's<00:01:40.670> more<00:01:40.819> of<00:01:40.880> more<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.359> a<00:01:41.479> big<00:01:41.659> deal<00:01:41.689> when

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:42.139 
it's more of more of a big deal when

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.260 
it's more of more of a big deal when
after<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.219> get<00:01:43.340> your<00:01:43.459> battery<00:01:43.759> charged<00:01:44.029> when

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
after you get your battery charged when

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.389 
after you get your battery charged when
you<00:01:44.389> hook<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.840> if<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.499> have<00:01:45.679> like<00:01:45.859> a<00:01:45.889> pocket<00:01:46.310> of

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
you hook it if you have like a pocket of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.029 
you hook it if you have like a pocket of
gas<00:01:46.549> right<00:01:46.609> here<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:48.409> would<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.709> no<00:01:48.829> good

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
gas right here and that would be no good

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.190 
gas right here and that would be no good
to<00:01:49.100> hook<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.549> up<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.909> all<00:01:50.179> explode<00:01:50.689> right<00:01:50.929> there

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
to hook it up it all explode right there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.429 
to hook it up it all explode right there
so<00:01:51.889> always<00:01:52.069> a<00:01:52.389> hook<00:01:53.389> the<00:01:53.539> battery<00:01:53.899> up<00:01:54.049> plug<00:01:54.409> a

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
so always a hook the battery up plug a

so always a hook the battery up plug a
charger<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.099> then<00:01:55.909> when<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.179> get<00:01:56.270> done

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
charger in then when you get done

the<00:01:58.759> battery<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.479> way<00:01:59.599> there<00:01:59.749> ain't<00:01:59.899> no

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the battery the way there ain't no

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.410 
the battery the way there ain't no
sparks<00:02:00.499> here<00:02:00.789> okay<00:02:01.789> so<00:02:01.819> now<00:02:02.090> we'll<00:02:02.240> go<00:02:02.389> ahead

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
sparks here okay so now we'll go ahead

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.599 
sparks here okay so now we'll go ahead
and<00:02:02.569> plug<00:02:02.779> it<00:02:02.929> in<00:02:03.079> see<00:02:03.950> what<00:02:04.099> the<00:02:04.219> baby's

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
and plug it in see what the baby's

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.699 
and plug it in see what the baby's
reading<00:02:04.969> it<00:02:05.060> should<00:02:05.299> be<00:02:05.479> pretty<00:02:06.169> well<00:02:06.319> charged

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
reading it should be pretty well charged

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.210 
reading it should be pretty well charged
we<00:02:07.069> will<00:02:07.819> take<00:02:07.999> a<00:02:08.030> look<00:02:08.300> at<00:02:08.450> it

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
we will take a look at it

and the battery always goes up like that

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.649 
and the battery always goes up like that

most of time with these long motivators

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.860

they'll never get past two or one to
Mike<00:02:39.019> they<00:02:39.140> always<00:02:39.409> have<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> weak<00:02:39.829> cell<00:02:40.099> in

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
Mike they always have a weak cell in

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.819 
Mike they always have a weak cell in
them<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.450> if<00:02:41.510> your<00:02:41.629> battery<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.019> dead<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.680> will

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
them so if your battery is dead it will

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.770 
them so if your battery is dead it will
probably<00:02:42.980> go<00:02:43.190> up<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.459> six<00:02:43.700> or<00:02:43.849> eight<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.629> it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
probably go up to six or eight and it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.449 
probably go up to six or eight and it
will<00:02:44.900> start<00:02:45.170> climbing<00:02:45.470> down<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.129> that's

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
will start climbing down and that's

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.940 
will start climbing down and that's
perfectly<00:02:46.909> normal<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:48.200> if<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.440> get<00:02:48.590> one<00:02:48.620> that

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
perfectly normal but if you get one that

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.940 
perfectly normal but if you get one that
stays<00:02:49.190> on<00:02:49.489> like<00:02:49.640> four<00:02:50.030> or<00:02:50.359> three<00:02:50.390> for<00:02:51.019> forever

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
stays on like four or three for forever

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.680 
stays on like four or three for forever
and<00:02:52.280> don't<00:02:52.430> want<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.670> move<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.269> you<00:02:53.420> probably

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
and don't want to move and you probably

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.960 
and don't want to move and you probably
get<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> bad<00:02:54.109> battery<00:02:54.409> with<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.859> dead<00:02:55.549> or<00:02:55.760> weak

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
get a bad battery with the dead or weak

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.899 
get a bad battery with the dead or weak
cell<00:02:56.269> in<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.629> and<00:02:57.340> if<00:02:58.340> you're<00:02:58.519> using<00:02:58.700> an

cell in it and if you're using an

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.930 
cell in it and if you're using an
automatic<00:02:59.269> charger<00:02:59.870> just<00:03:00.829> keep<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.159> on<00:03:01.310> 2<00:03:01.489> or<00:03:01.700> 4

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
automatic charger just keep it on 2 or 4

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.190 
automatic charger just keep it on 2 or 4
2<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.989> 6<00:03:03.260> amps<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.540> most<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.690> them<00:03:05.840> will<00:03:05.989> kick

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
2 to 6 amps and most of them will kick

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.569 
2 to 6 amps and most of them will kick
one<00:03:06.379> of<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.560> trickle<00:03:06.859> charge<00:03:07.129> that's<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:07.459> the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
one of the trickle charge that's for the

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.539 
one of the trickle charge that's for the
shelf<00:03:07.989> so<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.019> a<00:03:09.500> workout<00:03:09.920> pretty<00:03:10.190> good<00:03:10.430> I

shelf so that a workout pretty good I

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.910 
shelf so that a workout pretty good I
like<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.909> old<00:03:11.090> style<00:03:11.359> better<00:03:11.659> myself<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
like the old style better myself the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.199 
like the old style better myself the
newer<00:03:13.159> ones<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.459> will<00:03:13.609> charge<00:03:13.909> faster

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
newer ones that will charge faster

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.789 
newer ones that will charge faster
because<00:03:14.569> they<00:03:14.659> keep<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.959> constant<00:03:15.230> amperage

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
because they keep a constant amperage

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.860 
because they keep a constant amperage
going<00:03:16.129> whereas<00:03:16.909> these<00:03:17.090> old<00:03:17.299> ones<00:03:17.510> like<00:03:17.569> this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
going whereas these old ones like this

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.970 
going whereas these old ones like this
or<00:03:18.370> they<00:03:19.370> get<00:03:19.609> that<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.269> chargeable<00:03:20.900> like<00:03:21.889> I

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
or they get that is chargeable like I

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.410 
or they get that is chargeable like I
said<00:03:22.190> it'll<00:03:22.340> start<00:03:22.579> off<00:03:22.700> with<00:03:22.849> like<00:03:22.970> six<00:03:23.269> or

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
said it'll start off with like six or

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.809 
said it'll start off with like six or
eight<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.750> slowly<00:03:24.049> climb<00:03:24.409> down<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:25.549> can<00:03:25.699> see

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
eight and slowly climb down you can see

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.189 
eight and slowly climb down you can see
this<00:03:25.910> one<00:03:26.120> stuck<00:03:26.329> on<00:03:26.449> about<00:03:26.660> two<00:03:26.870> right<00:03:27.169> now

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
this one stuck on about two right now

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.629 
this one stuck on about two right now
and<00:03:27.319> that's<00:03:27.530> probably<00:03:27.889> as<00:03:28.069> far<00:03:28.310> as<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.489> will<00:03:28.549> go

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
and that's probably as far as it will go

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.430 
and that's probably as far as it will go
down<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.510> barrier<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.989> starting<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.349> get

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
down this barrier is starting to get

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.710 
down this barrier is starting to get
weak<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.949> playing<00:03:31.699> can<00:03:31.970> last<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.419> whole<00:03:32.540> lot

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
weak and playing can last a whole lot

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.080 
weak and playing can last a whole lot
longer<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.340> he<00:03:34.340> said<00:03:34.579> it's<00:03:34.669> going<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.879> little

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
longer but he said it's going a little

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.050 
longer but he said it's going a little
past<00:03:35.269> two<00:03:35.540> now<00:03:35.750> but<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:37.639> got<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.910> watch

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
past two now but you just got to watch

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.580 
past two now but you just got to watch
the<00:03:38.269> amperage<00:03:38.599> on<00:03:38.750> small<00:03:39.049> batteries<00:03:39.440> like

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
the amperage on small batteries like

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.080 
the amperage on small batteries like
this<00:03:39.799> if<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.069> get<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.340> if<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.849> get<00:03:40.970> the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
this if you get it if you get the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.759 
this if you get it if you get the
amperage<00:03:41.359> too<00:03:41.629> high<00:03:41.840> you're<00:03:42.530> going<00:03:42.620> to<00:03:42.709> be

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
amperage too high you're going to be

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.470 
amperage too high you're going to be
over<00:03:43.040> charging<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.549> battery<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.180> don't<00:03:44.359> have

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
over charging the battery you don't have

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.050 
over charging the battery you don't have
the<00:03:44.720> acid<00:03:45.340> bubbling<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:46.459> crazy<00:03:46.849> from

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the acid bubbling like crazy from

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.539 
the acid bubbling like crazy from
electrolysis<00:03:47.690> going<00:03:48.139> on<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.799> if<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.459> ever

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
electrolysis going on and if you ever

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.400 
electrolysis going on and if you ever
smell<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:49.970> rotten<00:03:50.269> egg<00:03:50.629> smell<00:03:50.690> around<00:03:51.290> the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
smell a rotten egg smell around the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.879 
smell a rotten egg smell around the
battery<00:03:51.680> shut<00:03:52.489> off<00:03:52.609> your<00:03:52.819> charger<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.889> get

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
battery shut off your charger and get

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.409 
battery shut off your charger and get
the<00:03:54.980> battery<00:03:55.340> outside<00:03:55.790> or<00:03:56.060> as<00:03:56.120> soon<00:03:56.299> as

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
the battery outside or as soon as

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.119 
the battery outside or as soon as
possible<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.019> don't<00:03:57.109> use<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.560> battery<00:03:57.859> after

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
possible and don't use the battery after

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:59.949 
possible and don't use the battery after
that<00:03:58.280> because<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.699> when<00:03:59.329> you<00:03:59.449> smell<00:03:59.720> rotten

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
that because the when you smell rotten

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.650 
that because the when you smell rotten
egg<00:04:00.319> smell<00:04:00.349> that's<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.699> acid<00:04:02.180> born<00:04:02.389> out

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
egg smell that's the the acid born out

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.020 
egg smell that's the the acid born out
the<00:04:02.780> battery<00:04:03.139> it's<00:04:03.500> very<00:04:03.889> flammable<00:04:04.340> you

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
the battery it's very flammable you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.270 
the battery it's very flammable you
don't<00:04:05.209> want<00:04:05.359> that<00:04:05.510> happening<00:04:06.010> just<00:04:07.010> try<00:04:07.220> to

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
don't want that happening just try to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.550 
don't want that happening just try to
watch<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.239> if<00:04:08.750> your<00:04:08.900> battery's<00:04:09.230> dead

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
watch that and if your battery's dead

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.619 
watch that and if your battery's dead
it's<00:04:10.159> usually<00:04:10.310> best<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:10.699> pop<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.150> caps<00:04:11.359> off

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
it's usually best to pop the caps off

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.599 
it's usually best to pop the caps off
and<00:04:11.840> charge<00:04:12.049> it<00:04:12.199> so<00:04:12.349> that<00:04:12.530> there's<00:04:13.190> no<00:04:13.370> chance

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
and charge it so that there's no chance

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.699 
and charge it so that there's no chance
of<00:04:13.730> pressure<00:04:14.030> building<00:04:14.389> up<00:04:14.599> if<00:04:15.319> you're<00:04:15.530> just

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
of pressure building up if you're just

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.129 
of pressure building up if you're just
topping<00:04:16.159> one<00:04:16.310> office<00:04:16.760> what<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:16.970> call<00:04:17.299> it's<00:04:17.479> or

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
topping one office what I call it's or

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.050 
topping one office what I call it's or
it's<00:04:18.289> down<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.530> little<00:04:18.799> bit<00:04:18.979> you<00:04:19.760> don't<00:04:19.940> really

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
it's down a little bit you don't really

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.570 
it's down a little bit you don't really
have<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.449> do<00:04:20.599> that<00:04:20.780> because<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:22.010> caps<00:04:22.280> have

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
have to do that because the caps have

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.890 
have to do that because the caps have
invented<00:04:23.120> them<00:04:23.270> himself

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
invented them himself

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.360 
invented them himself
that's<00:04:24.260> about<00:04:24.470> entering<00:04:24.860> these<00:04:24.949> lawnmower

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
that's about entering these lawnmower

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.000 
that's about entering these lawnmower
batteries<00:04:25.880> but<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.360> sum<00:04:26.599> it<00:04:26.630> up<00:04:26.870> let's<00:04:27.199> see<00:04:27.409> you

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
batteries but to sum it up let's see you

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.129 
batteries but to sum it up let's see you
got<00:04:28.159> to<00:04:28.220> watch<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.729> amperage<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.450> length<00:04:29.960> of

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
got to watch the amperage and length of

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.839 
got to watch the amperage and length of
charge<00:04:30.440> like<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.190> don't<00:04:31.340> want<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.580> have<00:04:31.700> one

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
charge like you don't want to have one

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.310 
charge like you don't want to have one
of<00:04:31.880> these<00:04:32.000> hooked<00:04:32.270> up<00:04:32.419> for<00:04:32.659> more<00:04:32.810> than<00:04:32.870> five<00:04:33.289> or

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
of these hooked up for more than five or

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.100 
of these hooked up for more than five or
six<00:04:33.680> hours

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
six hours

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.500 
six hours
the<00:04:34.380> most<00:04:34.620> if<00:04:35.370> you're<00:04:35.550> trying<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.820> dissolve<00:04:36.270> a

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
the most if you're trying to dissolve a

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.090 
the most if you're trying to dissolve a
the<00:04:36.570> battery<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.230> can<00:04:37.320> put<00:04:37.530> them<00:04:37.650> down<00:04:37.770> like

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
the battery you can put them down like

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.840 
the battery you can put them down like
to<00:04:38.430> app<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:39.260> just<00:04:40.260> set<00:04:40.920> it<00:04:41.040> outside<00:04:41.220> then

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
to app and just set it outside then

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.580 
to app and just set it outside then
whether<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.390> don't<00:04:42.540> have<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.810> gas<00:04:43.080> buildup

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
whether you don't have that gas buildup

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.970 
whether you don't have that gas buildup
inside<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:45.180> don't<00:04:45.870> recommend<00:04:46.320> charge<00:04:46.770> the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
inside and I don't recommend charge the

battery inside a closed room always have
the<00:04:49.800> door<00:04:50.730> or<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.000> window<00:04:51.180> opens<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.720> way<00:04:51.840> you

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the door or a window opens the way you

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.960 
the door or a window opens the way you
get<00:04:52.140> in<00:04:52.260> fresh<00:04:52.530> air<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:52.980> air<00:04:53.130> equals<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.520> you

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
get in fresh air and air equals that you

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.550 
get in fresh air and air equals that you
don't<00:04:54.150> want<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.390> gas<00:04:54.660> building<00:04:55.140> up<00:04:55.260> in<00:04:55.410> your

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
don't want that gas building up in your

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.710 
don't want that gas building up in your
house<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:56.520> it's<00:04:56.850> highly<00:04:57.060> recommended<00:04:57.690> to

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
house so it's highly recommended to

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.210 
house so it's highly recommended to
charge<00:04:57.990> your<00:04:58.080> battery<00:04:58.140> outside<00:04:58.890> in<00:04:59.070> other
