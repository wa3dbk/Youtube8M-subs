that i don't use out of focus first i
have<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.540> estimate<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:48.920> light<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.380> cool

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
have to estimate the light so that cool

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
have to estimate the light so that cool
what<00:01:54.210> does<00:01:54.360> field<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.720> light<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.890> right<00:01:56.130> way

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
what does field a light in the right way

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.200 
what does field a light in the right way
i<00:01:57.140> estimated<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.630> f<00:02:01.070> 7.1<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> time

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
i estimated that the f 7.1 and time

about<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:06.030> sun<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:06.930> right<00:02:07.350> side

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
about the sun is here on my right side

about the sun is here on my right side
is<00:02:08.060> on<00:02:11.810> 500

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
is on 500

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.520 
is on 500
of<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.410> second<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.150> let's<00:02:16.480> start<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.050> have

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
of the second so let's start I have

of the second so let's start I have
exactly<00:02:18.069> one<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.000> half<00:02:19.030> hour<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.720> time<00:02:20.010> but

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
exactly one and a half hour of time but

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.430 
exactly one and a half hour of time but
I'll<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.640> reality<00:02:22.180> I've<00:02:22.360> used<00:02:22.660> only<00:02:22.870> one<00:02:23.230> hour

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
I'll in reality I've used only one hour

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.670 
I'll in reality I've used only one hour
and<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:24.760> one<00:02:24.940> hour<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.390> will<00:02:25.660> make<00:02:25.810> 100

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
and in one hour I will make 100

00:02:26.680 --> 00:04:59.420 
and in one hour I will make 100
panoramas<00:02:27.099> as<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.790> aim<00:02:27.970> ok<00:02:28.720> let's<00:02:29.349> start
