00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello everyone here we are like every first one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.300
 of the month ready to talk about the releases 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.280
 most important of the next 30 days or 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.880
 better than the next 28 since we are a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.860
 February 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.150
 last month we told you that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.520
 February wouldn't have been much 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.279
 interesting because there were few games 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.619
 instead we were wrong because sifting through 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.119
 the releases of the next days 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.960
 actually there is something very much 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.449
 Interesting 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
 we open with the 13th of February day in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.250
 which will come to playstation life 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.860
 dan garron pack trigger happy hubble yes 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.030
 This is an investigative title 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.500
 set inside a school 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.500
 in which the students come 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 locked up and put at the mercy of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.129
 a crazy bear that makes me do it 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 terrible things 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.910
 a strange concept that has been successful 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.000
 in japan so we'll see how it goes 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.070
 also in these parts we continue with 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.020
 park rai wilde expedition this is one 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.059
 collection a collection of course 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
 to let cry that contains the first the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.219
 according to the third episode of the saga more 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 the dragon the last dlc came out 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.820
 sold for the price of a game, it only comes out 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 on pc 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.090
 so this is certainly a very good one 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.520
 deal for lovers of this saga ys 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.710
 memories of sales also age this in 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 release on February 13th is an action rpg 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.330
 developed by nikon falcon that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 at the debut on this series, which installment is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.960
 a series that is already present on the market 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.330
 for several years in the united states has 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 got some great successes from the point 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.170
 from the viewpoint of the critics therefore we await 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.130
 European exit to see if it will come 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.680
 equally well received on Saint's Day 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.720
 valentino arrives inazuma eleven 3 ogre 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.540
 the attack is the third chapter 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.490
 of the third episode a bit complicated by 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.829
 say however let's remember that last year 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.990
 the fire had flashed out 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.640
 the first and the second chapter are explosive 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.390
 of the third episode 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.759
 this third chapter sees the center 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.280
 canon evans great-grandson of mark evans 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.049
 from the future there will be some 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.090
 exclusively the characters moved 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.619
 exclusive included in the first two 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.479
 versions therefore a game that 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.240
 certainly will interest fans of 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.040
 this saga 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.410
 always February 14 is the turn of 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.170
 lighting returns final fantasy xiii 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.110
 this is also a third chapter of the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.480
 thirteenth episode this time 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.610
 naturally the protagonist is lightning 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.800
 and the mechanics remind a little 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.200
 far from those of most asthma schepp 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.240
 that we must continually go on 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.860
 and back in time to try to 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.920
 save the world from an imminent end 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.010
 there is a timer that runs towards zero e 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.850
 you have to do the actions often 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.610
 making a lot of decisions 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.580
 difficult the concept is interesting 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.620
 therefore to keep an eye on the 20 of 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.340
 February comes hegemonies ronde rise of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.680
 caesar 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.510
 it is a title that in the logo 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.090
 on the cover probably vi 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.110
 will remember another game developed by 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.660
 creative assembly 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.090
 actually the budget available to 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.620
 this title is much lower though 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.790
 certainly could interest the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.580
 strategy lovers 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.010
 we had already talked about it very well in 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.250
 past in any case today ray man is released 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.590
 legends on playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.060
 we meant to come out on the consoles next but 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.880
 we must remember that the game is already 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.100
 released on nintendo wii u is just the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.560
 nintendo wii u version was outstanding 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.910
 who knows if these two new versions of 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.400
 new generation 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.050
 they will be able to keep up with the version 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.790
 for nintendo wii u so we're in 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.709
 waiting 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.280
 always on February 20th it arrives on xbox 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.600
 one and xbox 360 plants versus zombies 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.760
 garden warfare 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.190
 it is a big parody of the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.800
 garner warfare shooter titles 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.720
 should remind you of something else 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.720
 in any case the concept is very simple 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.790
 a competitive team shooter one 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.980
 team does the zombies the other does le 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.270
 plants need to kill each other 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.790
 we tried it turned out to be a 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.880
 very funny on February 20th 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.370
 arrives in the cinema delegate movie 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.180
 obviously together with the pin it also arrives 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.760
 the videogame 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.620
 we are a little confident because the title is 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.080
 developed by tt games that historically 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.970
 have always done a great job with 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.560
 the lego bricks we remember the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.960
 their star wars parodies 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.820
 rather than by harry potter and others 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.470
 movies have always really made gods 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.989
 very very beautiful games so there 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.180
 we also expect February 21st 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.610
 arrives at donkey kong country tropical 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.680
 Freeze sequels of camps returns game 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.570
 originally released on nintendo wii e 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.650
 then with a port he even came up 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.510
 nintendo 3ds 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.030
 this is an exclusive we repeat for 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.890
 nintendo wii u has been improved 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.170
 graphics and of course the gameplay is 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.150
 been magnified thanks to the presence 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.300
 of new characters that somehow 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.740
 the difficulty has as power up 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.750
 through the ato all elements that 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.780
 they certainly give us hope, therefore 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.520
 we look forward to this title 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.560
 today it is also the turn of the game more 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.080
 awaited by our forces rule we talk 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.210
 of rambo of the videogames title that 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.970
 introduces a really absurd mechanism 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.850
 because you have to take to the bat 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.830
 people on tracks in short we beat ourselves up 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.350
 binary really an absurd thing yes 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.280
 provides a hyper hyper tamarro game 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.710
 raw so it could become a cult 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.690
 on February 27th comes the career doors of 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.340
 shadow 2 title made by 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.290
 Spanish mercury steam they had 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.390
 already done a great job with the first one 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.040
 episode therefore we are also confident 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.500
 for this second chapter 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.990
 unfortunately it will not arrive on consoles 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.850
 next gen and a little something is noted 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.970
 because when we play the game a 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.250
 comparison with the next gen graphic a little 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.660
 we are in any case ill 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.550
 therefore, the premises are more than good 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.290
 we are waiting 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.600
 today the symphonia text also arrives 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.520
 chronicles exclusive title for 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.430
 playstation 3 and remakes in high 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.840
 definition of tense syntonia and third 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.030
 symphonia dawn of the new world that 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.400
 they were respectively released on nintendo 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.500
 gamecube and suite to us a great one 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.560
 opportunity to rediscover two great ones 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.930
 classic Japanese role-playing games 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.300
 if what you love in racing 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.130
 automakers is overtaking and turning 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.370
 only left on February 28th 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.500
 comes hidden from these 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.080
 parties is not a very popular sport 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.660
 so it is certainly a niche title 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.760
 in any case we do not report the exit 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.060
 the month ends with the highly anticipated tiff 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.389
 re-launch of the popular stealth series ad 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.710
 a work of eidos monreale has passed a little 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.010
 of time since the last time we have 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.050
 seen team so we are very happy 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.630
 that the series is broken down and we are 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.400
 lukewarm confident we will see how 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.169
 developers have succeeded in 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.150
 interpret a concept that had remained 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.919
 therefore in the drawer for many years 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.919
 we await the final version for 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.930
 a good review we concluded the 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.320
 next month as we have already said 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.900
 it will be very very intense then 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.419
 keep tight of the wallet you are looking for 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.970
 to spend your money well because a 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:59.900
 March could come out very many 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.970
 from your pockets 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.970
 so see you in 28 days
