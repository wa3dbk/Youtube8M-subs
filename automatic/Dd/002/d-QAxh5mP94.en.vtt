00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the guy the second place guy is just

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.960

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
absolutely amazing and its really

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
absolutely amazing and its really
shame<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.360> he<00:01:58.480> didn't<00:01:58.780> win<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.110> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.840> that

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
shame that he didn't win it I think that

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.810 
shame that he didn't win it I think that
they<00:02:02.110> should<00:02:02.140> have<00:02:02.380> given<00:02:03.310> him<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.580> trophy

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
they should have given him the trophy

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.330 
they should have given him the trophy
anyway<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.480> mean<00:02:05.080> he<00:02:05.380> obviously<00:02:05.410> stole<00:02:06.220> the

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
anyway I mean he obviously stole the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.520 
anyway I mean he obviously stole the
show<00:02:06.520> tonight<00:02:06.850> even<00:02:07.450> Justin<00:02:07.930> Morneau<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.259> guy

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.280 
even went on and said you know this was
josh<00:02:12.790> hamilton<00:02:13.330> side<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.110> got

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
josh hamilton side just because I got

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.990 
josh hamilton side just because I got
lucky<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.680> won<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:14.950> trophy<00:02:15.310> because<00:02:15.580> he<00:02:15.820> ran

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
lucky and won this trophy because he ran

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.780 
lucky and won this trophy because he ran
out<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.210> steam<00:02:16.890> Josh<00:02:17.890> Hamilton<00:02:18.340> probably

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
out of steam Josh Hamilton probably

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.890 
out of steam Josh Hamilton probably
shouldn't<00:02:19.090> have<00:02:19.120> hit<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.450> second<00:02:19.810> round

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
shouldn't have hit in the second round

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.050 
shouldn't have hit in the second round
he<00:02:20.050> probably<00:02:20.350> should<00:02:20.710> have<00:02:20.800> taken<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.790> van

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
he probably should have taken that van

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.460 
he probably should have taken that van
off<00:02:22.270> because<00:02:22.480> he<00:02:22.510> could<00:02:22.750> have<00:02:22.840> easily<00:02:23.080> he

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
off because he could have easily he

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.200

still<00:02:23.800> could<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.160> add<00:02:24.340> 15<00:02:24.820> more<00:02:25.030> home

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
still could have it add 15 more home

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.390 
still could have it add 15 more home
runs<00:02:25.240> in<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> second<00:02:26.440> place<00:02:26.530> guy<00:02:26.770> taking<00:02:27.220> off

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
runs in the second place guy taking off

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.340 
runs in the second place guy taking off
the<00:02:27.580> second<00:02:27.940> round<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.810> they<00:02:28.900> do<00:02:28.960> combine

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
the second round because they do combine

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.640 
the second round because they do combine
the<00:02:29.500> first<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.860> second<00:02:30.190> round<00:02:30.450> but<00:02:31.650> there's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
the first to second round but there's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.290 
the first to second round but there's
just<00:02:32.920> an<00:02:33.070> amazing<00:02:33.310> performance<00:02:33.970> when<00:02:34.180> they

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
just an amazing performance when they

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.180 
just an amazing performance when they
double<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.750> off<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.110> fat<00:02:35.320> of<00:02:35.830> what<00:02:36.160> a
