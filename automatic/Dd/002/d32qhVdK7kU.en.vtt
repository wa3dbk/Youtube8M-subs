going to talk about the docks of sub 800
time<00:00:06.569> as<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.350> can<00:00:07.410> see<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.400> 800<00:00:08.820> tie<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
time as you can see the 800 tie is a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.020 
time as you can see the 800 tie is a
hardcore<00:00:09.900> diving<00:00:10.200> watch<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:11.610> watch<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
hardcore diving watch this watch is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.180 
hardcore diving watch this watch is
water-resistant<00:00:12.870> down<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.200> 800<00:00:13.740> meters<00:00:13.860> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
water-resistant down to 800 meters and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.210 
water-resistant down to 800 meters and
that's<00:00:14.250> over<00:00:14.549> 2,600<00:00:15.420> feet<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.170> you're<00:00:16.350> set<00:00:16.619> but

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
that's over 2,600 feet so you're set but

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.370 
that's over 2,600 feet so you're set but
this<00:00:17.460> watch<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.850> really<00:00:18.029> about<00:00:18.270> diving<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
this watch is really about diving in the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.790 
this watch is really about diving in the
shallower<00:00:20.070> depths<00:00:20.550> where<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> visible<00:00:21.330> light

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
shallower depths where a visible light

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.290 
shallower depths where a visible light
permits<00:00:22.800> visibility<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.640> high<00:00:23.880> visibility

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
permits visibility on high visibility

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.179 
permits visibility on high visibility
colors<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> signature<00:00:25.590> docks<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
colors like the signature docks the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
colors like the signature docks the
orange<00:00:26.519> dye<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> docks<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> first

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
orange dye on the docks it was the first

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
orange dye on the docks it was the first
watchmaker<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.189> introduce<00:00:29.670> bright<00:00:30.060> colored

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
watchmaker to introduce bright colored

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.930 
watchmaker to introduce bright colored
dials<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:31.410> their<00:00:31.619> original<00:00:32.099> orange<00:00:32.430> dial<00:00:32.759> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
dials with their original orange dial of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000 
dials with their original orange dial of
the<00:00:33.059> 60s<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.719> today<00:00:34.260> they've<00:00:34.500> added<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:34.980> more

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the 60s and today they've added one more

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.190 
the 60s and today they've added one more
wrinkle<00:00:35.520> because<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> sub<00:00:36.390> 800<00:00:36.989> tie

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
wrinkle because in the sub 800 tie

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.369 
wrinkle because in the sub 800 tie
they've<00:00:38.010> added<00:00:38.399> tritium<00:00:39.180> tracer<00:00:39.570> technology

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
they've added tritium tracer technology

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.290 
they've added tritium tracer technology
so<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:40.980> little<00:00:41.219> white<00:00:41.579> dots<00:00:41.940> on

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so you see these little white dots on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
so you see these little white dots on
the<00:00:42.840> hands<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> indexes<00:00:43.890> they're

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the hands and the indexes they're

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
the hands and the indexes they're
designed<00:00:44.820> specifically<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.780> hold<00:00:45.930> tritium

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
designed specifically to hold tritium

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
designed specifically to hold tritium
gas<00:00:46.559> their<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.399> glass<00:00:47.670> capsules<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
gas their little glass capsules that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.569 
gas their little glass capsules that
hold<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.230> luminescent<00:00:49.890> material<00:00:50.370> that's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
hold this luminescent material that's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.060 
hold this luminescent material that's
self-sustaining<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.469> go<00:00:52.649> down<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
self-sustaining so if you do go down to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.279 
self-sustaining so if you do go down to
depth<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.610> you're<00:00:54.210> pulling<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.600> watch<00:00:54.870> out

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
depth and you're pulling this watch out

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
depth and you're pulling this watch out
at<00:00:55.710> night<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.250> been<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> dive<00:00:56.850> chest<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
at night it's been in a dive chest it

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
at night it's been in a dive chest it
hasn't<00:00:57.809> been<00:00:57.899> exposed<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> light<00:00:58.680> whereas<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
hasn't been exposed to light whereas a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
hasn't been exposed to light whereas a
super-luminova<00:01:00.660> coated<00:01:01.320> watch<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
super-luminova coated watch which is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
super-luminova coated watch which is
most<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.609> them<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.910> days<00:01:02.969> would<00:01:03.870> need<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> be

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
most of them these days would need to be

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
most of them these days would need to be
energized<00:01:04.739> first<00:01:05.129> doxa<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.119> sit<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
energized first doxa can sit in a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
energized first doxa can sit in a
pitch-black<00:01:07.020> box<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> year<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.670> pull<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
pitch-black box for a year you pull it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
pitch-black box for a year you pull it
out<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.450> still<00:01:09.689> glowing<00:01:09.930> brilliantly<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
out it's still glowing brilliantly and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
out it's still glowing brilliantly and
that's<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> great<00:01:11.580> thing<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:11.880> tritium<00:01:12.600> as

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that's the great thing about tritium as

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
that's the great thing about tritium as
a<00:01:12.750> self-sustaining<00:01:13.590> whoom<00:01:13.830> DOCSIS<00:01:14.700> still

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
a self-sustaining whoom DOCSIS still

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.950 
a self-sustaining whoom DOCSIS still
uses<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> no

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
uses it and there really is no

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
uses it and there really is no
replacement<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.100> must<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> watch

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
replacement if you must have a watch

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
replacement if you must have a watch
that<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.330> always<00:01:18.570> ready<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> dive<00:01:19.409> now<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

through this arc to 30 minutes once you
reach<00:02:58.950> 90<00:02:59.310> feet<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.670> start<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.120> timing<00:03:00.390> and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
reach 90 feet you start the timing and

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.400 
reach 90 feet you start the timing and
