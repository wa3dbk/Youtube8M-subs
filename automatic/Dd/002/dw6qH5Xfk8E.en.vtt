00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello guys many of you have me 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.240
 asked how to eliminate the problem of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 water retention and to improve the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.820
 definition also trying to use 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 those techniques that are used 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.029
 bodybuilder before one of a race 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.310
 then the charge and discharge of sodium e 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 potassium increase as an effect 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.420
 draining 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.560
 I want to clarify first of all that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.280
 these techniques are enough 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.879
 dangerous wherever they are not to be done 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.040
 by all I understand maybe a natural body 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.140
 builder that goes on stage so it must 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.030
 be and have that dry attitude 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.399
 that effect j 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.660
 with the massive rocky effect 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.910
 granite 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.329
 but these techniques are really 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.449
 not recommended for those who must go 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.840
 simply on the beach or improve 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.809
 precisely the visual effect very often 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.030
 in fact it happens that in what one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.530
 believes both water retention and the other 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.049
 fat so we think the technique of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.960
 load sodium discharge and increase of 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.180
 potassium can serve yes but when you are 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.210
 got there by percentages 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.650
 particularly low and therefore I recommend 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.700
 of for anyone 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.970
 we say he chose not to compete with 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.250
 avoid this kind of technique 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.280
 because they are practically also a lot 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.229
 very dangerous if done so 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.270
 wrong can lead to damage 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.570
 even death is an increase 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.909
 Excessive listing has happened 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.740
 several times also in body competitions 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.460
 building 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.479
 so said the least from the problem 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.710
 of water retention 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:02.090
 in practice it is in the effect of the body of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.530
 retain or not retain liquids e 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.590
 let's say the problem can be solved 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.640
 simply trying to be 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.750
 consisting of salting the gods 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.380
 meals 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.960
 so there is not too little or too little 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.560
 a regular way consisting of wages and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.330
 I myself for example up to a few 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.480
 weeks from the race 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.970
 I put salt everywhere everyone in age 60 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.940
 no problem I noticed for example 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.800
 that if I do instead periods in which 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.170
 I reduce the salt or uncovered in mine 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.390
 body tends to retain more liquids e 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.100
 therefore the best solution and more 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.400
 effective simpler or salty everything can 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.930
 don't salt anything but this is more 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.300
 difficult because it was obviously if for 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.390
 eat out the salt they put it 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.340
 then try to maintain a contribution 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.830
 constant salemi of money without 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.630
 thus avoiding peaks or periods in which 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.810
 you know more will be less 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.890
 then here's to a natural bodybuilding 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.580
 no reasons in the last week 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.040
 when the discharge is made 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.459
 carbohydrates to then have a super 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.180
 glycogen compensation before 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.720
 to go up 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.010
 the stage can also follow this 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.850
 sort of reduction of the sodium first 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.860
 days 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.239
 in the last week and an increase of 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.640
 potassium for precisely facilitating the 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.370
 effect of the born and therefore eliminate 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.320
 excess water from the tissues or 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.360
 subcutaneous water for then 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.260
 sincerely personally what 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.970
 I do 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.760
 reintroduce in the same day sodium 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.600
 of the race then the main meal 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.370
 before going up for the project for the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.010
 pre-race 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.480
 mine always contains two to three 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.310
 grams of energy proper sodium 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.560
 however it also helps with contraction 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.090
 muscle so this is my point 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.829
 of view as usual based on 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.410
 experiences but also on readings I have 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.660
 done in this period 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.580
 obviously they are more experienced channels and 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.280
 other people other research can 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.220
 give more complete explanations 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.910
 scientific what this is 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:40.320
 I want to clarify yet I did is if 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:43.260
 you are not a regal competitive bodybuilder 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.110
 I strongly advise against trying this 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.220
 potassium reduction dates because it is the 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.190
 moment of potassium because extremely 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:56.340
 it simply has negative effects then 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:05:00.700
 leads to greater fluid traction 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.880
 rather than giving that effect then 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.450
 this is my point of view on the 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.820
 topic 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.370
 on the subject of course there are 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.610
 research has been thorough and studies 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.060
 empirical trials on the subject that one 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:20.350
 that in short I wanted to specify in this 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.260
 video is absolutely not necessary 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.060
 therefore useless for those who do not practice 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.200
 competitive bodybuilding and therefore not 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.230
 pay to do this cargo technique e 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.560
 sodium discharge and potassium increase 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.150
 the consistency then try to 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.390
 maintain a regular intake of sodium 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.020
 during the extremely important diet 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:48.280
 to avoid water tempering and therefore 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:52.419
 if you are not competing continue to 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.250
 climb your own foods or say reduce 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.500
 sodium intake but keep it 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.120
 constant during all weeks 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.480
 extremely important just for 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:06.550
 avoid the problem of metric times 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:11.230
 so this is my point of view is 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:14.970
 then postpone the ball is yours 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:18.010
 field if you have feedback 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.260
 go and write below and if you have 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.370
 other topics you want me to deal with 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.130
 these videos 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.850
 tell me well write less and do in 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.530
 way of 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.950
 talk about it in the next ones 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.460
 bets 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.460
 Hello
