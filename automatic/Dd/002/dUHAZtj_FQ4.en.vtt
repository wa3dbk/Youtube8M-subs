figured you know he I don't think he's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.459 
figured you know he I don't think he's
going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.630> Mach<00:01:57.810> punch<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.320> just

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
going to be have the Mach punch I just

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.810 
going to be have the Mach punch I just
don't<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:59.070> he<00:01:59.130> did<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.490> wasn't<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
don't think he did because it wasn't a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.609 
don't think he did because it wasn't a
lead<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:00.930> ice<00:02:01.079> beam<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.560> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
lead and I go out an ice beam and I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
lead and I go out an ice beam and I
guess<00:02:01.770> he<00:02:01.890> predicted<00:02:02.280> me<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:03.060> switch<00:02:03.360> but

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
guess he predicted me to just switch but

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.690 
guess he predicted me to just switch but
there's<00:02:04.439> no<00:02:04.530> reason<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.070> me<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.369> knew<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
there's no reason for me to I knew I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.130 
there's no reason for me to I knew I
figure<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.299> gonna<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:06.840> he<00:02:06.930> went<00:02:07.020> back

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
figure it's gonna but then he went back

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
figure it's gonna but then he went back
into<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.250> figured<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.759> point<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
into it and I figured at this point you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
into it and I figured at this point you
he<00:02:09.270> might<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:10.170> scarf<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.099> don't

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
he might actually be scarf I don't

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.790 
he might actually be scarf I don't
really<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.209> let's<00:02:12.629> go
