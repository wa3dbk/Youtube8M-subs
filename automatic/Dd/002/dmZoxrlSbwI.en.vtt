00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
work on here at Kawasaki you know the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.260 
work on here at Kawasaki you know the
two<00:00:43.980> strokes<00:00:44.250> they<00:00:44.430> ran<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> lot<00:00:44.880> cooler<00:00:45.120> now

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
two strokes they ran a lot cooler now

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.819 
two strokes they ran a lot cooler now
that<00:00:45.570> we've<00:00:45.690> gone<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> four<00:00:46.290> strokes<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that we've gone to the four strokes and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.620 
that we've gone to the four strokes and
the<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.399> horsepower<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.000> make<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.450> hotter

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
the more horsepower you make the hotter

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.479 
the more horsepower you make the hotter
they<00:00:48.809> want<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> run<00:00:49.290> so<00:00:49.620> keeping<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.130> engine

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

temp<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.720> big<00:00:51.960> help<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.530> increasing

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
temp down is a big help for increasing

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
temp down is a big help for increasing
horsepower<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.090> longevity<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.380> four

strokes<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.130> days<00:00:56.370> making<00:00:56.910> too<00:00:57.180> much<00:00:57.360> power

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
strokes these days making too much power

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.299 
strokes these days making too much power
and<00:00:57.960> getting<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> temperature<00:00:58.440> too<00:00:59.070> hot

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and getting the temperature too hot

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
and getting the temperature too hot
you'll<00:00:59.880> tend<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> lose<00:01:00.450> power<00:01:00.719> maybe<00:01:01.020> at<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
you'll tend to lose power maybe at the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.840 
you'll tend to lose power maybe at the
end<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> Moto<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:02.040> during<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> race<00:01:02.550> and

end of the Moto or during the race and
you<00:01:03.000> never<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.450> that<00:01:03.629> back<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> pre-season

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you never get that back and pre-season

you never get that back and pre-season
testing<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.430> spent<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> lot<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.300> working

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
testing we spent a lot of time working

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.749 
testing we spent a lot of time working
with<00:01:07.320> poison<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.040> trying<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> keep<00:01:08.610> the
