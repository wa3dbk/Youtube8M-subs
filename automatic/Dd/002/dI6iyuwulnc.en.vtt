the<00:02:25.150> smaller<00:02:25.660> couple<00:02:26.080> tees<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:26.950> is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the smaller couple tees so this is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.760 
the smaller couple tees so this is
discord<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.150> he<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.750> super<00:02:29.020> cool<00:02:29.290> like<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.680> know

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
of your pops out of the package and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.940 
of your pops out of the package and
display<00:02:52.810> them<00:02:53.050> like<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.500> know<00:02:53.560> some<00:02:53.920> people

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
display them like I know some people

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.250 
display them like I know some people
have<00:02:54.250> shelves<00:02:54.670> full<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.000> them<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.360> wish<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.110> had

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
have shelves full of them I wish I had

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.810 
have shelves full of them I wish I had
shelves<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.680> do<00:02:56.770> that<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.190> they're<00:02:57.520> just<00:02:57.730> so

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
shelves to do that but they're just so

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.310 
shelves to do that but they're just so
much<00:02:57.910> easier<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.300> stack<00:02:58.570> inside<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.930> boxes

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
much easier to stack inside the boxes

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.930 
much easier to stack inside the boxes
actually<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.100> don't<00:03:00.370> know<00:03:00.490> where<00:03:00.700> I'm<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:00.850> to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
actually I don't know where I'm going to

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.680 
actually I don't know where I'm going to
put<00:03:01.060> him<00:03:01.209> cuz<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:01.930> cuz<00:03:02.110> he's<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.470> big<00:03:03.690> but

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
put him cuz just cuz he's so big but

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.740 
put him cuz just cuz he's so big but
look<00:03:04.930> at<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.430> he<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.520> really<00:03:06.760> cool<00:03:07.950> too<00:03:09.750> so

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
look at that he is really cool too so

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.840 
look at that he is really cool too so
this<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.320> supposed<00:03:11.770> to<00:03:11.800> be<00:03:11.890> six<00:03:12.220> inches<00:03:12.400> tall

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
this is supposed to be six inches tall

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.750 
this is supposed to be six inches tall
so<00:03:13.090> as<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.300> can<00:03:13.390> see<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:14.400> actually<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.520> it<00:03:15.640> as

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
so as you can see it's actually is it as

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.490 
so as you can see it's actually is it as
tall<00:03:15.970> as<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:16.239> head<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:16.780> kind<00:03:16.989> of<00:03:17.110> his<00:03:17.260> tall<00:03:17.410> as

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
tall as my head it's kind of his tall as

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.830 
tall as my head it's kind of his tall as
my<00:03:17.590> head<00:03:17.769> but<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:19.150> have<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.390> size<00:03:19.690> comparison

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
my head but and I have a size comparison

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.000 
my head but and I have a size comparison
of<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.380> photo<00:03:20.620> shot<00:03:20.860> here<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.640> as<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:23.530> can<00:03:23.650> see

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
of a photo shot here so as you can see

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.270 
of a photo shot here so as you can see
there<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> big<00:03:25.030> difference<00:03:25.239> there<00:03:25.870> is

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
there is a big difference there is

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.620 
there is a big difference there is
Fluttershy<00:03:27.280> which<00:03:27.550> is<00:03:27.670> about<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:28.030> tall<00:03:28.300> and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
Fluttershy which is about this tall and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.020 
Fluttershy which is about this tall and
then<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.590> have<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.950> score<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.489> huge<00:03:30.790> Oh

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
then we have the score that is huge Oh

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.509 
then we have the score that is huge Oh
see<00:03:31.959> if<00:03:32.050> Fluttershy<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.620> not<00:03:32.890> as<00:03:33.010> big<00:03:33.160> as<00:03:33.340> my

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
see if Fluttershy is not as big as my

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.640 
see if Fluttershy is not as big as my
hat<00:03:33.760> BOTS<00:03:34.180> discord<00:03:34.870> as<00:03:35.019> big<00:03:35.170> as<00:03:35.290> my<00:03:35.380> head<00:03:35.500> I
