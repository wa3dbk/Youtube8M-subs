00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.170
 good 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.259
 to the people 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.259
 this measure of acceptance 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.570
 but not 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 and I'm tired of being here or the fucking 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.420
 seated 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.120
 ah 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.180
 a sum of a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.180
 ah 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:27.690
 good friends as they are here again 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.110
 as you check-in and good 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:35.590
 no more I wanted to make a video 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.580
 to a different, more or less as they end 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.340
 to see from the beginning of this video that 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.790
 I was just like this and doing sneaky 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.510
 more because I wanted to talk about a topic that 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.940
 I really liked this one 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:55.780
 of this nintendo wii as you just saw 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.840
 what 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.610
 can be playing you can be your 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.670
 playstation as you are playing your 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.330
 nintendo wii and you can turn off your TV and 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.330
 keep playing here in the gamer and it's what 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.420
 Same as I do, as if 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.260
 you were playing in your everything in your 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.379
 TV 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.629
 and that's why I made the video that good 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.189
 if one gets tired of sitting and 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.829
 watching TV sometimes just before 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.720
 that is before you already want 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.030
 sleep wants to play a little longer before 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.489
 that you do not want then I like 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 play the last 15 minutes before 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.750
 let me go to sleep and start playing 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 I turn it off and turn it off here this me 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.900
 clean I put it on the floor and I'm going to 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.209
 sleep 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.230
 that's why I wanted to make a video like this 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.319
 I wish you liked it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.720
 but good you have to talk a little more 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.230
 of this gamer can not only be 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.080
 Playing 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.239
 not only can you be playing the game of 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.370
 Dury call or any other game 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.799
 Mario or any other game you have 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.440
 of the wii can also be can be 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.440
 watching netflix youtube the application 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.700
 I do not like YouTube but it's also 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.480
 something that I'm going to talk about this video 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.280
 in this video about I'm going to love you 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.739
 demonstrate this option that you can do 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.599
 that you can play anything on your TV that 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.480
 game is changing but the other thing 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.670
 I wanted to talk was the YouTube option 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.090
 the application I do not like the application 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.180
 for nothing is an application that almost 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.840
 like playstation vita you can not 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.790

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:52.380
 browsing the internet 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.850

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.060
