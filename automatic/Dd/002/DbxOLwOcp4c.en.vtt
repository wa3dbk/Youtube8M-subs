00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.160
 that cream along with oil table that I 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.239
 I already fucking used it 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.220
 รณ the oil of the pomegranate is 10 it has filter 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.480
 see so it's great to use before 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.260
 make the little board and give it a 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.050
 protected base and the novety 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.239
 oil of orion people are all good 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.440
 now let the process resembles that 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.780
 hydrates we used to do 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.180
 I used to feel particularly 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.060
 lack of hydration to make a day of 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.549
 beauty wash with shampoo I tell you the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.530
 use a shampoo also from the novex line 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.519
 because it makes complete treatment was so 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.670
 that I did 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.380
 so you use that shampoo used two 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.019
 times were girls 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.519
 he has a poor performance and looks at himself 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.709
 so I had with you to use a 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.670
 which is well understood 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.920
 cream 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.650
 depending on the size of the hair or more 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.630
 use as much as you want but without 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.000
 in remembrance of what you are going to put 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.190
 a few drops of snoring oil if you 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 have oily hair do not put too much 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.940
 just put a few drops 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.480
 and if you have more dry hair 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.430
 more damaged oil can only affect the 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.980
 Like I say, you use it later. 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.660
 before drying does not abuse much in the hour 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.840
 to make hydration because it will stay 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.940
 there about 15 minutes in the hair then 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.450
 coming back used double grandfather shampoo 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.310
 mixed cream with oil leaves there in the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.160
 hair and that will make this move 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.410
 as you pass cream to the cream 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.079
 enough to enter the cuticle of the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.920
 hair and make it wonderful done 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.709
 this did made for botou laminated paper 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.750
 autoclave nothing and left 15 minutes 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.790
 It's important to go back to the nominee for 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.120
 give that warmed and a cream enter 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.220
 but in hair people, that's what I hope 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.019
