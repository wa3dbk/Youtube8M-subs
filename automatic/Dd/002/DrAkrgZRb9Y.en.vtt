00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
center of the Sun but that's really

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.410

difficult<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.340> do<00:03:05.459> with<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> sextant<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.300> what

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
difficult to do with the sextant so what

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.000 
difficult to do with the sextant so what
we<00:03:06.510> do<00:03:06.630> instead<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.050> we<00:03:07.200> shoot<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.680> lower

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
we do instead is we shoot to the lower

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.490 
we do instead is we shoot to the lower
limb<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.640> Sun<00:03:08.970> let's<00:03:09.420> use<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:09.810> orange<00:03:10.170> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
limb of the Sun let's use this orange to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.009 
limb of the Sun let's use this orange to
represent<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.040> Sun<00:03:11.600> theoretically<00:03:12.600> we<00:03:12.840> want

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
represent the Sun theoretically we want

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.170 
represent the Sun theoretically we want
to<00:03:13.110> shoot<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.620> center<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.250> Sun<00:03:14.489> that's

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
to shoot to the center of the Sun that's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.150 
to shoot to the center of the Sun that's
imprecise<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.050> do<00:03:16.200> because<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.739> tough<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
imprecise to do because it's tough to

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.910 
imprecise to do because it's tough to
measure<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:18.239> instead<00:03:18.660> we<00:03:19.200> shoot<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.620> lower

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
measure so instead we shoot to the lower

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.100 
measure so instead we shoot to the lower
limb<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.430> Sun<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:21.420> picture<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:21.870> want<00:03:22.050> to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
with the Sexton the first thing that I

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.190 
with the Sexton the first thing that I
do<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.850> set<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.209> sextant<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.690> zero

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
do is I set the sextant to zero

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.780 
do is I set the sextant to zero
I<00:03:52.230> read<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.739> instrument<00:03:53.190> carefully<00:03:53.579> to<00:03:53.670> make

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
situation figured out I look through the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.319 
situation figured out I look through the

once I'm satisfied that everything is
good<00:04:24.860> with<00:04:24.890> sexing<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.640> first<00:04:25.820> thing<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.120> do<00:04:26.180> is

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
good with sexing the first thing I do is

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.480 
good with sexing the first thing I do is
I<00:04:26.540> adjust<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.410> micrometer<00:04:27.740> drum<00:04:28.100> by<00:04:28.250> about

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
I adjust the micrometer drum by about

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.340 
I adjust the micrometer drum by about
thirty<00:04:28.790> minutes<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.300> Arc<00:04:29.510> while<00:04:30.050> I'm<00:04:30.230> looking

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
thirty minutes of Arc while I'm looking

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.710 
thirty minutes of Arc while I'm looking
at<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.710> Sun<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.760> allows<00:04:32.030> me<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.270> separate

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
at the Sun this allows me to separate

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.230 
at the Sun this allows me to separate
the<00:04:32.870> Sun<00:04:33.050> into<00:04:33.200> two<00:04:33.470> distinct<00:04:33.950> images<00:04:34.340> in<00:04:35.090> this

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
the Sun into two distinct images in this

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.000 
the Sun into two distinct images in this
case<00:04:35.510> we've<00:04:35.750> exaggerated<00:04:36.410> a<00:04:36.560> little<00:04:36.590> bit

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
case we've exaggerated a little bit

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.470 
case we've exaggerated a little bit
it's<00:04:37.280> about<00:04:37.550> four<00:04:37.880> or<00:04:38.060> five<00:04:38.240> degrees

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
it's about four or five degrees

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.600 
it's about four or five degrees
difference<00:04:39.140> so<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.710> can<00:04:39.980> see<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.400> there<00:04:40.580> are

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
difference so you can see that there are

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.650 
difference so you can see that there are
two<00:04:40.850> distinct<00:04:41.300> images<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.960> Sun<00:04:43.510> once<00:04:44.510> I've

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
two distinct images of the Sun once I've

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.200 
two distinct images of the Sun once I've
separated<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.290> Sun<00:04:45.470> into<00:04:45.710> two<00:04:45.890> images<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.490> take

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
separated the Sun into two images I take

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.270 
separated the Sun into two images I take
the<00:04:47.570> lower<00:04:47.780> image<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.410> follow<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.950> down<00:04:49.130> to

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
the lower image and I follow it down to

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.340 
the lower image and I follow it down to
the<00:04:49.370> horizon<00:04:49.520> using<00:04:50.210> two<00:04:50.390> distinct<00:04:50.870> images<00:04:51.200> in

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
the horizon using two distinct images in

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.590 
the horizon using two distinct images in
the<00:04:51.440> sexy<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:52.340> first<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.820> that<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.060> index<00:04:53.360> arm

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
the sexy the first is that the index arm

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.260 
the sexy the first is that the index arm
moves<00:04:53.840> forward<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:55.370> second<00:04:55.790> is<00:04:55.910> that<00:04:56.090> the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
moves forward the second is that the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.500 
moves forward the second is that the
Sexton<00:04:56.690> itself<00:04:57.020> comes<00:04:57.620> down<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.220> horizon

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
Sexton itself comes down to the horizon

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.360 
Sexton itself comes down to the horizon
together<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.840> looks<00:04:59.870> like<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.230> so<00:05:03.340> when<00:05:04.340> I

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
together it looks like this so when I

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.430 
together it looks like this so when I
take<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.790> sight<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.240> do<00:05:05.450> those<00:05:05.780> two<00:05:06.020> distinct

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
take the sight I do those two distinct

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.010 
take the sight I do those two distinct
motions<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.070> bring<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.820> Sun<00:05:08.060> down<00:05:08.600> until

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
motions and bring the Sun down until

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.770 
motions and bring the Sun down until
it's<00:05:09.170> just<00:05:09.260> about<00:05:09.740> at<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:09.950> horizon

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
it's just about at the horizon

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.690 
it's just about at the horizon
once<00:05:11.780> it's<00:05:11.960> close<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.470> horizon<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:13.070> use<00:05:13.550> the

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
once it's close to the horizon I use the

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.280 
once it's close to the horizon I use the
micrometer<00:05:14.060> jump<00:05:14.480> to<00:05:14.600> fine-tune<00:05:15.080> the

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
micrometer jump to fine-tune the

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.420 
micrometer jump to fine-tune the
adjustment<00:05:17.530> keeping<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.620> Sun<00:05:18.860> in<00:05:18.980> sight<00:05:19.250> the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
adjustment keeping the Sun in sight the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.820 
adjustment keeping the Sun in sight the
entire<00:05:19.730> time<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.570> index<00:05:20.840> arm<00:05:21.110> moves<00:05:21.410> forward

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
entire time the index arm moves forward

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.430 
entire time the index arm moves forward
as<00:05:21.980> the<00:05:22.130> sextant<00:05:22.550> comes<00:05:22.820> down<00:05:23.090> we<00:05:23.930> get<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.230> Sun

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
as the sextant comes down we get the Sun

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.880 
as the sextant comes down we get the Sun
as<00:05:24.560> close<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.130> horizon<00:05:25.280> as<00:05:25.730> possible<00:05:29.890> once

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
as close to the horizon as possible once

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.200 
as close to the horizon as possible once
I've<00:05:31.040> got<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.310> Sun<00:05:31.490> pretty<00:05:31.760> much<00:05:31.940> there<00:05:32.180> and

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
I've got the Sun pretty much there and

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.400 
I've got the Sun pretty much there and
I've<00:05:32.390> adjusted<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:32.870> with<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.080> micrometer

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
I've adjusted it with the micrometer

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.380 
I've adjusted it with the micrometer
drill<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.250> last<00:05:34.460> step<00:05:34.700> is<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.910> swing<00:05:35.270> the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
drill the last step is to swing the

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.750 
drill the last step is to swing the
Sexton<00:05:35.810> in<00:05:35.960> an<00:05:36.080> arc<00:05:36.320> while<00:05:37.190> adjusting<00:05:37.370> the

Sexton in an arc while adjusting the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.720 
Sexton in an arc while adjusting the
micrometer<00:05:38.180> drum<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:39.260> that<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.590> Sun<00:05:39.860> pitches

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
micrometer drum so that the Sun pitches

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.760 
micrometer drum so that the Sun pitches
an<00:05:40.880> arc<00:05:41.090> through<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.630> image<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.140> touches<00:05:42.650> the

way<00:06:35.819> to<00:06:35.879> do<00:06:36.060> it<00:06:36.090> is<00:06:36.360> to<00:06:37.139> invert<00:06:37.800> the<00:06:37.949> sextant<00:06:38.400> by

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
way to do it is to invert the sextant by

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.290 
way to do it is to invert the sextant by
turning<00:06:38.909> it<00:06:39.000> upside<00:06:39.120> down<00:06:40.789> what<00:06:41.789> that<00:06:41.819> enables

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
turning it upside down what that enables

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.300 
turning it upside down what that enables
me<00:06:42.360> to<00:06:42.449> do<00:06:42.689> is<00:06:42.900> instead<00:06:43.529> of<00:06:43.590> bringing<00:06:43.979> the<00:06:44.099> Sun

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
me to do is instead of bringing the Sun

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.309 
me to do is instead of bringing the Sun
down<00:06:44.490> to<00:06:44.729> the<00:06:44.819> horizon<00:06:45.330> I<00:06:45.419> bring<00:06:45.659> the<00:06:45.779> horizon

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
down to the horizon I bring the horizon

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.549 
down to the horizon I bring the horizon
up<00:06:46.469> to<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.919> Sun

00:06:51.549 --> 00:06:51.559 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.169 

that<00:06:52.159> way<00:06:52.279> it<00:06:52.369> tends<00:06:52.549> to<00:06:52.669> be<00:06:52.789> a<00:06:52.819> little<00:06:53.029> bit

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:53.179 
that way it tends to be a little bit

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:54.819 
that way it tends to be a little bit
more<00:06:53.329> complicated<00:06:53.659> for<00:06:53.959> beginners<00:06:54.469> but<00:06:54.679> it's

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:54.829 
more complicated for beginners but it's

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:57.609 
more complicated for beginners but it's
out<00:06:54.949> there<00:06:55.129> if<00:06:55.249> you<00:06:55.399> need<00:06:55.549> it<00:06:56.139> either<00:06:57.139> way<00:06:57.439> the
