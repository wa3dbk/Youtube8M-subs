00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 This video is for fans for those 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.480
 who wanted to make a two-level 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.750
 ceiling 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 Here is a design right now show 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.289
 about what goes what can be done 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.269
 again the ceiling what have to do from 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:34.620
 Gyprok, that is, we have a room 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:37.410
 here we are this kind of design here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.200
 it is immediately apparent that we avoided everywhere on 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.350
 designs ran everywhere right angles 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.010
 that is, we are specially from right angles 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.760
 did others say such an oval and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.699
 because with a stretch ceiling 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 right angles don't make it you don't 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.280
 go around that is, the outer corner is still possible 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.650
 try on the inside can not be 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:07.619
 Well, just here again the lamps 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.229
 what is not told in the past video 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.860
 there is money here and diode bulbs 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.590
 but just in case we specifically bought 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.570
 today light bulb 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.409
 ordinary galogenki show how it shines 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.080
 here we are here 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.729
 outer corner of the construction is assembled and not with 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:35.090
 wood metal and not on top sheathed 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.090
 plastic we will soon pull 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.930
 here is the part under 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 for karnism and light that is, we were asked 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.650
 here, well, not by the color here, it will just be 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.620
 the cornice is already installed under it 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:24.970
 fixings that is here de windows sol 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:26.200
 will stand from the ceiling here as you see 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.440
 here 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 bending amounts at these outer corners 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.280
 here's how i need gold 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.860
 here the bend is somewhere in radius 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.970
 880-a-half centimeters and that is when 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.130
 aver somewhere 12 centimeters that is 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.820
 Such training can not any stitches not 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.430
 do not do anything everything looks 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.680
 nice and neat well so here we say u 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.209
 We exterior angle too all is normal and 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.209
 bent without seams 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.489
 pulled my ceiling 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 give me the bottom and put the lights in there 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.970
 just want to show just what 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.860
 fixtures better not to fix lights 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.890
 these ones are altogether normal in them we 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.780
 set the diode bulbs beautiful all 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.720
 except for one that is, we 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.040
 especially today when we went to buy 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.320
 here one halogen bulb 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.540
 that is, I do not know on camera it is not very 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.200
 can be seen but basically that is around 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.850
 the lamp can be seen for its 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.000
 the rest of the lamps fall over 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:47.940
 at an angle of 120 degrees it dissipates 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.940
 that is, it becomes beautiful and light 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.390
 difference let's say from this lamp 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.500
 that is, this halogen lamp 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.500
 ordinary bulb halogen price and 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.920
 40 rubles store well, in principle, it is on 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.290
 This money and light that is visible if 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.730
 bend the lamp that much light 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.520
 goes to the ceiling 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.299
 for the ceiling and as a result of this 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.549
 inner light 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.850
 here you see how it shines that is it 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.640
 shines and down as a result of this 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.880
 the inner light shines through 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:32.440
 platform which is installed here and in 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.460
 In general, the whole view of the ceiling is lost that is not 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.260
 there will be diode bulbs 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.260
 black light shines 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.669
 the diode bulb shines strictly down from 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:51.199
 here you can see and everything is improving 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:56.240
 beautiful mortgages around the world no and 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.240
 the end in general is not translucent 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.250
 thousands 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.789
 so like this 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.789
 finished form
