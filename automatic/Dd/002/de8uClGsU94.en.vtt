but his alt mode is that of a I guess a

side armored security services with a
little<00:00:31.990> Decepticon<00:00:32.590> symbol<00:00:33.040> don't<00:00:33.820> know<00:00:33.910> how

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
little Decepticon symbol don't know how

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.500 
little Decepticon symbol don't know how
well<00:00:34.270> you<00:00:34.420> can<00:00:34.540> see<00:00:34.600> that<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:36.250> uh<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:37.360> looks

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
well you can see that but uh it looks

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.180 
well you can see that but uh it looks
more<00:00:37.660> like<00:00:37.810> a<00:00:37.900> paddy<00:00:38.170> wagon<00:00:38.320> as<00:00:38.739> opposed<00:00:39.010> to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
more like a paddy wagon as opposed to

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.840 
more like a paddy wagon as opposed to
just<00:00:39.400> an<00:00:39.610> armored<00:00:40.060> car<00:00:40.120> but<00:00:40.690> that's<00:00:40.960> just<00:00:41.290> me

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
mode other than he's a truck so why

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.560

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
want everybody to be aware of this front

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.050 
want everybody to be aware of this front
is<00:00:55.960> not<00:00:56.230> on<00:00:56.530> very<00:00:56.830> tight<00:00:57.100> I've<00:00:57.400> had<00:00:57.580> to<00:00:57.700> glue<00:00:57.850> it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
is not on very tight I've had to glue it

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.090 
is not on very tight I've had to glue it
multiple<00:00:58.510> times<00:00:58.750> so<00:00:59.110> I<00:00:59.290> just<00:00:59.530> wiggle<00:00:59.950> it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
multiple times so I just wiggle it

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.420 
multiple times so I just wiggle it
gently<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.820> it<00:01:01.300> pops<00:01:01.540> off<00:01:01.780> which<00:01:02.220> there<00:01:03.220> are<00:01:03.400> a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
gently and it pops off which there are a

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.609 
gently and it pops off which there are a
couple<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:04.000> pieces<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:04.869> that<00:01:05.110> on<00:01:05.409> this

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
couple of pieces like that on this

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.530 
couple of pieces like that on this
figure<00:01:05.860> that's<00:01:06.220> it's<00:01:06.640> just<00:01:06.939> really<00:01:07.210> annoying

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
figure that's it's just really annoying

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.700 
figure that's it's just really annoying
but<00:01:08.049> I<00:01:08.350> digress<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.689> we're<00:01:10.990> gonna<00:01:11.110> start<00:01:11.439> with

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
but I digress so we're gonna start with

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.640 
but I digress so we're gonna start with
just<00:01:12.299> cracking<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.930> top<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.470> figure

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
just cracking the top of the figure

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.990 
just cracking the top of the figure
apart<00:01:15.280> thusly<00:01:15.610> and<00:01:16.090> that<00:01:16.780> will<00:01:16.930> enable<00:01:17.200> us<00:01:17.470> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
apart thusly and that will enable us to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.380 
apart thusly and that will enable us to
swing<00:01:19.000> this<00:01:19.420> section<00:01:19.930> out<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:21.430> pegs<00:01:21.909> on

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
swing this section out and these pegs on

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.510 
swing this section out and these pegs on
the<00:01:22.600> side<00:01:22.810> will<00:01:23.200> attach<00:01:23.650> into<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.040> back

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
the side will attach into the back

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.550 
the side will attach into the back
wheels<00:01:24.880> they<00:01:25.300> will<00:01:25.420> actually<00:01:25.540> attach<00:01:25.930> inside

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
wheels they will actually attach inside

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.370 
wheels they will actually attach inside
the<00:01:26.740> back<00:01:26.890> wheels<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.570> then<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.780> next<00:01:29.200> thing

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
the back wheels and then the next thing

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.399 
the back wheels and then the next thing
we're<00:01:29.500> gonna<00:01:29.590> do<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:30.070> just<00:01:30.729> take<00:01:30.970> see<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.200> just

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
we're gonna do is just take see it just

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.350 
we're gonna do is just take see it just
fell<00:01:32.560> off<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.950> didn't<00:01:33.190> even<00:01:33.280> touch<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.300> just

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
fell off I didn't even touch it I just

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.600 
fell off I didn't even touch it I just
kind<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.810> brushed<00:01:35.110> up<00:01:35.290> against<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.830> Thanks

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
kind of brushed up against it Thanks

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.910 
kind of brushed up against it Thanks
we're<00:01:36.729> gonna<00:01:37.380> crack<00:01:38.380> open<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.650> whole

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
we're gonna crack open this whole

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.789 
we're gonna crack open this whole
section<00:01:42.460> here<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.840> then<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.350> will<00:01:44.560> enable

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
section here and then that will enable

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.890 
section here and then that will enable
this<00:01:45.159> whole<00:01:45.400> section<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.000> flip<00:01:46.270> out<00:01:46.630> and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
this whole section to flip out and

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.370 
this whole section to flip out and
rotate<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.860> sling<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.450> when<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.659> take<00:01:49.930> this

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
rotate the sling and when you take this

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.730 
rotate the sling and when you take this
part<00:01:50.710> flip<00:01:51.370> it<00:01:51.490> up<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:52.690> form<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.049> legs<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.620> we

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
part flip it up to form the legs and we

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.520 
part flip it up to form the legs and we
twist<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.159> around<00:01:55.260> like<00:01:56.260> that

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
twist it around like that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.720 
twist it around like that
and<00:01:58.250> then<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:59.210> collapse<00:01:59.660> part<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:01.190> front<00:02:01.610> of

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
and then we collapse part the front of

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.260 
and then we collapse part the front of
the<00:02:01.790> vehicle<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.160> rotate<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:05.090> we

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
the vehicle and and rotate and then we

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.600 
the vehicle and and rotate and then we
change<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:06.770> then<00:02:06.830> we<00:02:07.010> rotate<00:02:07.400> it<00:02:07.580> down

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
change that and then we rotate it down

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.490 
change that and then we rotate it down
this<00:02:08.000> will<00:02:08.149> form<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.539> feet<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:14.320> getting<00:02:15.320> a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
this will form the feet so getting a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.560 
this will form the feet so getting a
look<00:02:15.920> at<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.160> figure<00:02:16.430> now<00:02:16.459> if<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.240> these

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
look at the figure now if this is these

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.310 
look at the figure now if this is these
are<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.810> feet<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:20.360> part<00:02:20.660> that's<00:02:20.959> inside

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
are the feet and that part that's inside

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.170 
are the feet and that part that's inside
just<00:02:21.620> fell<00:02:21.770> off<00:02:22.130> I'll<00:02:22.490> show<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
just fell off I'll show you that in a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.800 
just fell off I'll show you that in a
second

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
second

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.660 
second
makes<00:02:24.140> let<00:02:24.320> me<00:02:24.410> do<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.680> slide<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.280> entire

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
makes let me do is slide this entire

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.180 
makes let me do is slide this entire
section<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.270> like<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.490> then<00:02:30.190> collapse

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
section in like that and then collapse

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.080 
section in like that and then collapse
it<00:02:31.810> rotate<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.840> down<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.640> doesn't<00:02:34.790> really

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
it rotate it down and it doesn't really

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.850 
it rotate it down and it doesn't really
snap<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.690> begin<00:02:35.930> with<00:02:36.110> until<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.590> move

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
snap in to begin with until you move

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.770 
snap in to begin with until you move
these<00:02:37.400> bits<00:02:38.170> which<00:02:39.170> then<00:02:39.880> get<00:02:40.880> rotated<00:02:41.060> around

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
these bits which then get rotated around

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:51.450 
these bits which then get rotated around
like<00:02:42.200> that

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.460 

you<00:02:52.060> actually<00:02:52.420> need<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:52.840> them<00:02:52.990> out<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
you actually need to get them out of the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.760 
you actually need to get them out of the
way<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.220> hinge<00:02:54.610> right<00:02:55.000> here<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:56.590> order

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
way on this hinge right here in order

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.890 
way on this hinge right here in order
for<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.070> top<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.460> connect<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.600> fold

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
for the top to connect and you just fold

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.750 
for the top to connect and you just fold
it<00:02:59.020> in<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.120> go<00:03:01.300> in<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:02.580> open<00:03:03.580> up<00:03:03.640> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
it in and we go in here open up the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.120 
it in and we go in here open up the
sides<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.510> fold<00:03:04.720> out<00:03:04.870> his<00:03:04.990> hands

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.870 

and<00:03:12.610> we<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:12.850> pose<00:03:13.210> the<00:03:13.540> arms

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.930 

and<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:21.000> we<00:03:21.090> go<00:03:21.500> now<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:23.280> piece<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.790> fell

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
and there we go now the piece that fell

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.090 
and there we go now the piece that fell
off<00:03:23.970> before<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.930> piece<00:03:25.230> are<00:03:25.470> here<00:03:25.920> is

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
off before this piece are here is

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.820 
off before this piece are here is
actually<00:03:26.490> kind<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:26.880> important<00:03:27.620> because<00:03:28.620> it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
actually kind of important because it

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.350 
actually kind of important because it
holds<00:03:29.010> everything<00:03:29.280> together<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:32.180> won't<00:03:33.180> go

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
holds everything together so it won't go

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.920 
holds everything together so it won't go
in<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:34.260> like<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:35.030> or<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.450> never<00:03:36.570> get<00:03:36.780> it

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
in just like that or I can never get it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.420 
in just like that or I can never get it
back<00:03:36.959> okay<00:03:37.290> there<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:37.830> was<00:03:38.010> able<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.340> it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
back okay there I was able to get it

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.490 
back okay there I was able to get it
back<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.580> was<00:03:38.760> putting<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.060> upside<00:03:39.390> down<00:03:39.420> but<00:03:39.870> he

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
back I was putting it upside down but he

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.750 
back I was putting it upside down but he
does<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:40.950> gimmick<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.520> mode<00:03:41.730> and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
does have a gimmick in this mode and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.360 
does have a gimmick in this mode and
this<00:03:42.060> big-ass<00:03:42.360> rod<00:03:42.930> back<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:44.220> actually

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
this big-ass rod back here you actually

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.340 
this big-ass rod back here you actually
push<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.410> now<00:03:46.410> will<00:03:46.620> deploy<00:03:47.480> some<00:03:48.480> claws<00:03:48.870> and

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
push in now will deploy some claws and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.470 
push in now will deploy some claws and
you<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.739> do<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:49.980> kind<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.250> quickly<00:03:50.580> or<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
you have to do it kind of quickly or the

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.990 
you have to do it kind of quickly or the
claws<00:03:51.720> won't<00:03:52.020> deploy<00:03:52.440> now<00:03:53.130> when<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.430> bring<00:03:53.850> it

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
claws won't deploy now when you bring it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.040 
claws won't deploy now when you bring it
back<00:03:54.150> you'd<00:03:54.630> have<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:55.050> do<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.320> very<00:03:55.489> slowly<00:03:56.489> or

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
back you'd have to do it very slowly or

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.910 
back you'd have to do it very slowly or
it'll<00:03:58.050> get<00:03:58.230> stuck<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.959> call<00:04:01.230> parts<00:04:01.650> won't

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
it'll get stuck and the call parts won't

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.009 
it'll get stuck and the call parts won't
retract<00:04:02.640> all<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.090> way<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.630> just<00:04:03.660> turns

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
retract all the way and it just turns

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.040 
retract all the way and it just turns
into<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.290> mess<00:04:04.470> but<00:04:05.209> I've<00:04:06.209> noticed<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.780> mind

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
into a mess but I've noticed on mind

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.920 
into a mess but I've noticed on mind
spring<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:08.190> actually<00:04:08.670> kind<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:08.970> breaking<00:04:09.570> I've

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
spring is actually kind of breaking I've

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.530 
spring is actually kind of breaking I've
noticed<00:04:10.380> so<00:04:11.250> if<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.550> see<00:04:11.790> another<00:04:11.820> one<00:04:12.180> I'll

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
noticed so if I see another one I'll

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.030 
noticed so if I see another one I'll
have<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.900> get<00:04:13.050> another<00:04:13.350> one<00:04:14.930> but<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.709> part

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
have to get another one but this part

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.009 
have to get another one but this part
keeps<00:04:17.430> falling<00:04:17.669> off<00:04:17.940> I've<00:04:18.209> tried<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.690> glue<00:04:18.900> it

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
keeps falling off I've tried to glue it

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.199 
keeps falling off I've tried to glue it
with<00:04:19.230> some<00:04:19.950> modeling<00:04:20.459> cement<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.060> that

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
with some modeling cement but that

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.840 
with some modeling cement but that
doesn't<00:04:21.540> work<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.710> part<00:04:23.040> actually<00:04:23.460> goes

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
doesn't work and this part actually goes

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.460 
doesn't work and this part actually goes
back<00:04:24.120> here<00:04:26.180> that<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.660> see<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:28.080> just

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
back here that and you see it I just

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.230 
back here that and you see it I just
tapped<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.040> with<00:04:29.070> my<00:04:29.310> finger<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:29.850> fell<00:04:30.060> off

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
tapped it with my finger and it fell off

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.040 
tapped it with my finger and it fell off
and<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.290> one<00:04:31.530> just<00:04:32.220> pops<00:04:32.550> off<00:04:32.880> I've<00:04:33.690> tried<00:04:33.960> to

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
and that one just pops off I've tried to

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.260 
and that one just pops off I've tried to
glue<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.680> about<00:04:34.979> staling<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.820> another

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
glue it and about staling the another

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.409 
glue it and about staling the another
thing<00:04:36.720> is<00:04:37.020> that<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.830> whole<00:04:37.860> head<00:04:38.340> section<00:04:38.729> the

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
thing is that the whole head section the

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.600 
thing is that the whole head section the
head<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.260> part<00:04:40.560> right<00:04:40.740> here<00:04:40.800> are

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
head and the this part right here are

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.960 
head and the this part right here are
actually<00:04:42.030> just<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.570> there<00:04:43.560> they're<00:04:43.919> not<00:04:44.100> glued

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
actually just on there they're not glued

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.570 
actually just on there they're not glued
in<00:04:45.210> they<00:04:45.390> just<00:04:45.600> pop<00:04:45.870> right<00:04:45.900> off<00:04:46.200> normally<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:47.310> I

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
in they just pop right off normally so I

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.340 
in they just pop right off normally so I
was<00:04:47.760> able<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.030> use<00:04:48.180> some<00:04:48.360> month<00:04:48.600> map<00:04:48.780> modeling

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
was able to use some month map modeling

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.640 
was able to use some month map modeling
some<00:04:49.590> cement<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.970> actually<00:04:51.360> adhere<00:04:52.050> it<00:04:52.200> to

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
some cement and actually adhere it to

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.210 
some cement and actually adhere it to
this<00:04:53.490> whole<00:04:53.820> section<00:04:54.360> here<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.890> has<00:04:56.070> not

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
this whole section here so this has not

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.650 
this whole section here so this has not
fallen<00:04:56.520> off<00:04:56.729> since<00:04:57.000> I've<00:04:57.120> done<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.330> but

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
fallen off since I've done that but

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.409 
fallen off since I've done that but
those<00:04:57.960> two<00:04:58.229> great<00:04:58.470> parts<00:04:58.919> these<00:04:59.790> two<00:05:00.090> buret

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
those two great parts these two buret

external great parts falling off other
than<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.470> he<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.860> pretty<00:05:05.160> good<00:05:05.340> figure<00:05:05.700> he

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
than that he is a pretty good figure he

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.810 
than that he is a pretty good figure he
has<00:05:06.120> some<00:05:06.360> nice<00:05:06.510> poses<00:05:07.140> it's<00:05:07.800> got<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.010> full

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
has some nice poses it's got a full

has some nice poses it's got a full
range<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.390> articulation<00:05:10.320> which<00:05:10.500> is<00:05:10.620> nice<00:05:10.860> the

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
range of articulation which is nice the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.029 
range of articulation which is nice the
feet<00:05:11.970> are<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.270> little<00:05:12.510> bit<00:05:12.750> thick<00:05:13.140> but<00:05:13.590> they're

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
feet are a little bit thick but they're

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.170 
feet are a little bit thick but they're
workable<00:05:14.880> the<00:05:15.750> arms<00:05:16.550> are<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.610> little<00:05:17.789> floppy

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
workable the arms are a little floppy

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.900 
workable the arms are a little floppy
and<00:05:18.660> if<00:05:19.020> they<00:05:19.200> do<00:05:19.260> pop<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.280> parts<00:05:20.550> pop<00:05:20.760> off

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
and if they do pop if the parts pop off

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.909 
and if they do pop if the parts pop off
the<00:05:21.090> hands<00:05:21.570> pop<00:05:21.870> off<00:05:22.110> they're<00:05:22.320> ball<00:05:22.530> joints

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
the hands pop off they're ball joints

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:23.900 
the hands pop off they're ball joints
all<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.490> time

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
all the time

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.820 
all the time
so<00:05:24.780> that's<00:05:24.960> another<00:05:25.230> thing<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.500> have<00:05:25.680> to<00:05:25.740> be

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
so that's another thing you have to be

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.220 
so that's another thing you have to be
worried<00:05:26.040> about<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.910> head<00:05:27.090> really<00:05:27.540> can't<00:05:27.810> turn

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
worried about the head really can't turn

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.400 
worried about the head really can't turn
all<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.740> much<00:05:28.980> as<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.490> can<00:05:29.670> see<00:05:30.020> but<00:05:31.020> still

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
all that much as you can see but still

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.440 
all that much as you can see but still
it's<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:31.890> pretty<00:05:31.920> good<00:05:32.100> figure<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:33.000> needs<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.300> lot

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
it's a pretty good figure it needs a lot

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.510 
it's a pretty good figure it needs a lot
of<00:05:33.480> shelf<00:05:33.810> space<00:05:33.870> given<00:05:34.410> this<00:05:34.500> huge<00:05:34.830> thing<00:05:35.340> out

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
you won't like this figure that's the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.890 
you won't like this figure that's the
only<00:06:17.100> thing<00:06:17.310> if<00:06:17.580> you<00:06:17.910> are<00:06:18.090> a<00:06:18.210> fan<00:06:18.660> of<00:06:18.690> the

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
drones then you'll like this figure he's

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.380 
drones then you'll like this figure he's
the<00:06:21.150> best<00:06:21.480> out<00:06:21.810> of<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.290> lens<00:06:22.620> faced<00:06:23.520> drones<00:06:24.090> I

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
the best out of the lens faced drones I

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.200 
the best out of the lens faced drones I
think<00:06:24.890> compared<00:06:25.890> to<00:06:25.920> swindle<00:06:26.400> and<00:06:26.640> dreadwing

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
think compared to swindle and dreadwing

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.470 
think compared to swindle and dreadwing
he's<00:06:27.660> definitely<00:06:28.320> a<00:06:28.560> step<00:06:28.920> up<00:06:28.980> but<00:06:29.670> there<00:06:30.270> are

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
he's definitely a step up but there are

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.460 
he's definitely a step up but there are
some<00:06:30.810> major<00:06:31.580> quality<00:06:32.580> control<00:06:33.120> concerns<00:06:33.630> he

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
some major quality control concerns he

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.830 
some major quality control concerns he
on<00:06:34.800> this<00:06:34.980> figure<00:06:35.370> I<00:06:35.520> mean<00:06:35.670> just<00:06:35.850> parts<00:06:36.510> falling

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
on this figure I mean just parts falling

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.740 
on this figure I mean just parts falling
off<00:06:36.990> is<00:06:37.170> unacceptable<00:06:38.010> unacceptable<00:06:38.700> so<00:06:39.690> if

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
off is unacceptable unacceptable so if

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.880 
off is unacceptable unacceptable so if
you're<00:06:39.870> willing<00:06:40.110> to<00:06:40.200> put<00:06:40.350> up<00:06:40.380> with<00:06:40.470> that

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:40.890 
you're willing to put up with that

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.300 
you're willing to put up with that
he's<00:06:40.980> definite<00:06:41.610> buy<00:06:41.960> otherwise<00:06:42.960> I'd<00:06:43.860> hold<00:06:44.160> off

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
he's definite buy otherwise I'd hold off

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.420 
he's definite buy otherwise I'd hold off
a<00:06:44.370> little<00:06:44.490> bit<00:06:45.230> it's<00:06:46.230> getting<00:06:46.470> Spada<00:06:46.860> from<00:06:47.130> TF
