00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
can see that it is much bigger now this

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.760 
can see that it is much bigger now this
is<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> 2560<00:00:35.340> by<00:00:35.460> 1440<00:00:35.940> display<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> also

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
a quantum IPS panel this is only an IPS

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.770 
a quantum IPS panel this is only an IPS
LCD<00:00:41.550> now<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.809> displays<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> think<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.280> just

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
LCD now the displays I think are just

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.119 
LCD now the displays I think are just
LG's<00:00:45.780> knocked<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> park

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
LG's knocked it right out of the park

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.680 
LG's knocked it right out of the park
now<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> brightness<00:00:48.090> turned<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.510> on

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
now I have the brightness turned down on

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.660 
now I have the brightness turned down on
this<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:49.140> way<00:00:49.410> down<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.309> was<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
this way way down so there was the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.910 
this way way down so there was the
display<00:00:51.030> will<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.329> blow<00:00:51.629> out<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.289> camera<00:00:52.739> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
display will just blow out the camera so

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
display will just blow out the camera so
you<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.879> mean<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.539> at

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
you can just see that I mean that's at

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.560 
you can just see that I mean that's at
such<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> such<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> low<00:00:56.219> brightness<00:00:56.579> now<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:57.449> we

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
such a such a low brightness now if we

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.260 
such a such a low brightness now if we
check<00:00:57.750> out<00:00:57.960> LG<00:01:01.309> it's<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.460> auto<00:01:02.670> brightness<00:01:02.969> let

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
check out LG it's on auto brightness let

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.469 
check out LG it's on auto brightness let
me<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.480> take<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> off

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.200 

right<00:01:09.079> still<00:01:09.469> samanas<00:01:10.130> bright<00:01:10.399> what<00:01:10.640> LG<00:01:11.060> has

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
right still samanas bright what LG has

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.539 
right still samanas bright what LG has
going<00:01:11.360> on<00:01:11.570> with<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.780> g4<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.619> completely<00:01:13.369> out

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
going on with the g4 is completely out

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.789 
going on with the g4 is completely out
of<00:01:13.579> control<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.539> easily<00:01:14.990> one<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:15.530> top

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
of control this is easily one of the top

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.350 
of control this is easily one of the top
five<00:01:16.009> displays<00:01:16.399> currently<00:01:16.939> on<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.329> market

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
five displays currently on the market

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.749 
five displays currently on the market
now<00:01:18.259> if<00:01:18.439> we<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:18.740> keep<00:01:18.890> on<00:01:19.100> going<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.610> is

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
now if we just keep on going this is

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.219 
now if we just keep on going this is
this<00:01:20.030> actually<00:01:20.210> has<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> different<00:01:20.840> processor

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
this actually has a different processor

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.469 
this actually has a different processor
under<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.560> hood<00:01:21.710> this<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.219> a<00:01:22.250> Snapdragon<00:01:22.880> 808

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
under the hood this is a Snapdragon 808

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.270 
under the hood this is a Snapdragon 808
this<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.899> hexa<00:01:24.259> core<00:01:24.470> processor<00:01:24.979> running<00:01:25.130> at

this is a hexa core processor running at

this is a hexa core processor running at
1.8<00:01:26.030> gigahertz<00:01:26.110> also<00:01:27.110> comes<00:01:27.319> with<00:01:27.470> three

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
1.8 gigahertz also comes with three

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.859 
1.8 gigahertz also comes with three
gigabytes<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:28.130> RAM<00:01:28.399> now<00:01:28.939> one<00:01:29.390> thing<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.689> is

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
gigabytes of RAM now one thing that is

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.679 
gigabytes of RAM now one thing that is
uh<00:01:30.159> sorely<00:01:31.159> lacking<00:01:31.460> or<00:01:32.149> actually<00:01:32.569> it's

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
uh sorely lacking or actually it's

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.120 
uh sorely lacking or actually it's
really<00:01:32.869> lacking<00:01:33.049> on<00:01:33.229> most<00:01:33.409> other<00:01:33.530> devices<00:01:33.950> but

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
really lacking on most other devices but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.309 
really lacking on most other devices but
it's<00:01:34.759> available<00:01:34.969> on<00:01:35.390> both<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.869> these<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.289> a

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
it's available on both of these is a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.429 
it's available on both of these is a
micro<00:01:36.890> SD<00:01:37.340> card<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.750> is<00:01:38.899> good<00:01:39.049> up<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.229> 2

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
micro SD card so this is good up to 2

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.969 
micro SD card so this is good up to 2
terabytes<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:40.219> believe<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.439> HTC<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.619> also

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
terabytes and I believe the HTC is also

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:43.899 
terabytes and I believe the HTC is also
gonna<00:01:43.159> probably<00:01:43.340> up<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.640> one<00:01:43.789> or<00:01:43.880> two

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
gonna probably up to one or two

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.520 
gonna probably up to one or two
terabytes<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:44.689> seems<00:01:44.840> pretty<00:01:45.020> common<00:01:45.409> these

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
terabytes it seems pretty common these

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.279 
terabytes it seems pretty common these
days<00:01:45.560> for<00:01:45.920> future<00:01:46.250> proofing<00:01:46.700> your<00:01:47.630> devices

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
days for future proofing your devices

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.139 
days for future proofing your devices
now<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.709> is<00:01:48.770> running<00:01:48.979> Android<00:01:49.310> 5.0<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.060> is

now this is running Android 5.0 this is
when<00:01:50.240> he<00:01:50.299> entered<00:01:50.599> 5.1<00:01:51.970> LG<00:01:52.970> is<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.179> only<00:01:53.329> one

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
when he entered 5.1 LG is the only one

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.999 
when he entered 5.1 LG is the only one
on<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.780> market<00:01:53.899> right<00:01:54.229> now<00:01:54.289> to<00:01:54.439> come<00:01:54.739> up<00:01:54.860> with

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
on the market right now to come up with

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.859 
on the market right now to come up with
something<00:01:55.310> with<00:01:55.429> an<00:01:55.549> android<00:01:55.880> 5.1<00:01:56.479> because

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
something with an android 5.1 because

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.929 
something with an android 5.1 because
it's<00:01:57.049> one<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.380> latest<00:01:57.649> handsets<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:58.789> when

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
it's one of the latest handsets now when

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.929 
it's one of the latest handsets now when
it<00:01:59.060> comes<00:01:59.179> to<00:01:59.450> thickness<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:01.429> can<00:02:01.459> see<00:02:01.759> that

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
it comes to thickness you can see that

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.679 
it comes to thickness you can see that
the<00:02:02.060> LG<00:02:02.599> is<00:02:03.700> slightly<00:02:04.700> longer<00:02:04.970> than<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.270> m9

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
the LG is slightly longer than the m9

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.899 
the LG is slightly longer than the m9
which<00:02:05.929> is<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.079> bit<00:02:06.289> shocking<00:02:06.560> because<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> m9

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
which is a bit shocking because the m9

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.880 
which is a bit shocking because the m9
is<00:02:08.030> already<00:02:08.360> very<00:02:08.599> long<00:02:08.840> but<00:02:09.110> don't<00:02:09.140> forget

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
is already very long but don't forget

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.670 
is already very long but don't forget
that<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.849> LG<00:02:11.209> actually<00:02:11.630> has<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> 5.5<00:02:12.349> inch

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that the LG actually has a 5.5 inch

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.009 
that the LG actually has a 5.5 inch
display<00:02:12.970> versus<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.120> 5<00:02:14.389> inch<00:02:14.569> display<00:02:14.720> so

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
display versus a 5 inch display so

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.460 
display versus a 5 inch display so
that's<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.410> reason<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.920> extra<00:02:16.250> length

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that's the reason for the extra length

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.650 
that's the reason for the extra length
HTC<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:18.769> has<00:02:18.920> no<00:02:19.100> reason<00:02:19.639> putting<00:02:20.510> out

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
HTC really has no reason putting out

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.520 
HTC really has no reason putting out
such<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.350> long<00:02:21.709> phone<00:02:22.190> with<00:02:22.850> such<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.530> small

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
such a long phone with such a small

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.349 
such a long phone with such a small
display<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.549> if<00:02:25.609> you<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.819> check<00:02:26.060> out<00:02:26.209> that

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
display so if you just check out that

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.720 
display so if you just check out that
the<00:02:26.840> bezels<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> one<00:02:28.489> are

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
the bezels on the on the on the one are

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.180 
the bezels on the on the on the one are
just<00:02:28.910> completely<00:02:29.420> out<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:29.900> control

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
just completely out of control

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.900 
just completely out of control
now<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.239> things<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:33.790> we're<00:02:34.790> gonna

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
now one of the things that we're gonna

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.789 
now one of the things that we're gonna
see<00:02:35.239> that's<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.930> huge<00:02:36.170> difference<00:02:36.620> that's

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
see that's a huge difference that's

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.160 
see that's a huge difference that's
actually<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.220> deal-breaker<00:02:37.569> between<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.930> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
actually a deal-breaker between the the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.650 
actually a deal-breaker between the the
One<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.709> LG<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.819> going<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.180> be<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.420> camera

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
One and the LG is going to be the camera

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.210 
One and the LG is going to be the camera
so<00:02:41.989> on<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.200> front<00:02:42.350> here<00:02:42.709> we<00:02:42.859> have<00:02:42.980> an<00:02:43.100> 8

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so on the front here we have an 8

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.600 
so on the front here we have an 8
megapixel<00:02:43.489> camera<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.299> then<00:02:45.079> on

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
megapixel camera and then on

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.180 
megapixel camera and then on
the<00:02:45.750> HTC<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.140> 4<00:02:47.320> megapixel<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the HTC it's a 4 megapixel but it's the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.010 
the HTC it's a 4 megapixel but it's the
ultrapixel<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.420> now<00:02:49.510> let's<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.750> actually

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
ultrapixel so now let's just actually

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.890 
ultrapixel so now let's just actually
turn<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.530> camera<00:02:50.860> on<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.220> both<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.580> these

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
turn the camera on on both of these

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.360 
turn the camera on on both of these
because<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.080> HTC<00:02:53.620> will<00:02:53.830> actually<00:02:54.190> have

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
because the HTC will actually have

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.460 
because the HTC will actually have
better<00:02:54.670> low-light<00:02:54.940> performance<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.380> you

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
better low-light performance and so you

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.380 
better low-light performance and so you
can<00:02:56.620> see<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.070> because<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.700> ultra<00:02:57.970> pixel<00:02:58.150> is

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
can see that because the ultra pixel is

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.120 
can see that because the ultra pixel is
actually<00:02:58.780> one<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.650> better<00:02:59.830> low-light

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
actually one of the better low-light

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.090 
actually one of the better low-light
cameras<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> market<00:03:01.650> what<00:03:02.650> they<00:03:02.770> have<00:03:02.950> on

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
cameras on the market what they have on

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.010 
cameras on the market what they have on
the<00:03:03.190> front<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.450> going<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.690> compare

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
the front here is not going to compare

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.590 
the front here is not going to compare
to<00:03:05.140> what<00:03:05.290> HTC<00:03:05.650> has<00:03:05.920> on<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> front<00:03:06.610> here<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.210> if

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
to what HTC has on the front here so if

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.940 
to what HTC has on the front here so if
you're<00:03:07.750> looking<00:03:07.840> at<00:03:08.110> front-facing<00:03:08.560> camera

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
you're looking at front-facing camera

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.010 
you're looking at front-facing camera
capabilities<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.640> would<00:03:09.850> be<00:03:10.030> probably<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
capabilities this would be probably the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.650 
capabilities this would be probably the
one<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.890> only<00:03:12.040> big<00:03:12.340> advantages<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.120> going

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
one of the only big advantages of going

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.960 
one of the only big advantages of going
with<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.320> HTC<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.459> it's<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.700> great

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
with the HTC that and it's a great

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.810 
with the HTC that and it's a great
industrial<00:03:16.690> design<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:17.709> two-tone<00:03:18.190> metal<00:03:18.610> is

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
industrial design this two-tone metal is

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.150 
industrial design this two-tone metal is
quite<00:03:19.120> striking<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.590> can<00:03:20.680> see<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:20.920> gold

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
quite striking so you can see the gold

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.100 
quite striking so you can see the gold
there<00:03:21.370> on<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.640> side<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.090> then<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.330> unibody

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
there on the side and then the unibody

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.710 
there on the side and then the unibody
back<00:03:23.830> now<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.190> HTC<00:03:24.700> does<00:03:24.880> feel<00:03:25.090> great<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.450> hand

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
back now the HTC does feel great in hand

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.390 
back now the HTC does feel great in hand
but<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.230> have<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.590> give<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.070> leather<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
but you have to give it to the leather I

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.580 
but you have to give it to the leather I
mean<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.000> feels<00:03:28.180> soft<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.660> supple<00:03:28.900> one

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
mean it just feels soft and supple one

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.750 
mean it just feels soft and supple one
of<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.770> things<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.190> am<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> little<00:03:30.520> bit

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
of the things that I am a little bit

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.430 
of the things that I am a little bit
concerned<00:03:31.150> about<00:03:31.390> with<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.690> edge<00:03:31.810> territory

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
concerned about with the edge territory

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.320 
concerned about with the edge territory
with<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> LG<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> very

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
with the LG is that this is a very

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.390 
with the LG is that this is a very
difficult<00:03:34.570> tanning<00:03:35.200> process<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.980> it's<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.250> call

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
difficult tanning process so it's a call

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.250 
difficult tanning process so it's a call
it's<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.610> vegetable<00:03:36.790> tanning<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.959> is<00:03:38.110> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
it's a vegetable tanning so this is the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's a vegetable tanning so this is the
same<00:03:38.500> finish<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.220> get<00:03:39.459> from<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.970> luxury

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
same finish that you get from a luxury

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.170 
same finish that you get from a luxury
handbag<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> takes<00:03:41.830> three<00:03:42.160> months<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.580> put

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
handbag so it takes three months to put

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.150 
handbag so it takes three months to put
this<00:03:43.330> die<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.080> they<00:03:44.230> put<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.590> in<00:03:44.770> with<00:03:44.920> like

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
this die in so they put it in with like

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.100 
this die in so they put it in with like
plan<00:03:45.670> materials<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.270> extra<00:03:46.510> materials<00:03:46.989> like

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
plan materials of extra materials like

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.510 
plan materials of extra materials like
bark<00:03:47.410> or<00:03:47.590> something<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.130> with<00:03:48.340> high

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
bark or something that is with high

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.820 
bark or something that is with high
tannins<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.120> then<00:03:49.720> they<00:03:50.140> let<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.380> cure<00:03:50.590> for

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
tannins and then they let it cure for

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.320 
tannins and then they let it cure for
three<00:03:51.040> months<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.519> that's<00:03:51.880> what<00:03:52.030> allows<00:03:52.299> it

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
three months and that's what allows it

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.449 
three months and that's what allows it
to<00:03:52.660> age<00:03:52.810> more<00:03:53.170> naturally<00:03:53.739> with<00:03:53.890> your<00:03:54.100> hand<00:03:54.310> is

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
to age more naturally with your hand is

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.860 
to age more naturally with your hand is
this<00:03:54.580> vegetable<00:03:55.060> curing<00:03:55.360> process<00:03:55.690> if<00:03:55.810> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
this vegetable curing process if the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.840 
this vegetable curing process if the
oils<00:03:56.230> in<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.470> UV<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:56.980> light<00:03:57.220> will

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
oils in the UV and the light will

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.850 
oils in the UV and the light will
actually<00:03:58.209> age<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.600> smartphone<00:03:59.080> in<00:03:59.320> quite

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
actually age the smartphone in quite

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.710 
actually age the smartphone in quite
quite<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.130> nice<00:04:00.340> way<00:04:00.549> so<00:04:01.410> whereas<00:04:02.410> with<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.100> HTC

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
quite a nice way so whereas with the HTC

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.600 
quite a nice way so whereas with the HTC
you<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.930> almost<00:04:05.170> see<00:04:05.650> where<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.070> it

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.730 

I<00:04:09.700> kind<00:04:10.210> of<00:04:10.330> feel<00:04:10.570> like<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:11.110> Teutons<00:04:11.530> not

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
I kind of feel like the Teutons not

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.890 
I kind of feel like the Teutons not
doing<00:04:12.070> that<00:04:12.190> well<00:04:12.400> right<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:13.510> they're<00:04:13.690> there

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
doing that well right so they're there

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.330 
doing that well right so they're there
on<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.140> corner<00:04:14.470> knife<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:14.980> have<00:04:15.160> been

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
on the corner knife and I have been

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.490 
on the corner knife and I have been
using<00:04:15.490> this<00:04:15.760> HTC<00:04:16.299> as<00:04:16.390> my<00:04:16.570> dedicated<00:04:17.049> handset

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
using this HTC as my dedicated handset

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.640 
using this HTC as my dedicated handset
for<00:04:18.130> several<00:04:19.090> weeks<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.930> fact<00:04:20.170> that<00:04:20.260> we

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
for several weeks so the fact that we

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.800 
for several weeks so the fact that we
know<00:04:20.799> with<00:04:20.950> no<00:04:21.100> case<00:04:21.370> we<00:04:21.670> have<00:04:21.820> some<00:04:22.120> chipping

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
know with no case we have some chipping

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.270 
know with no case we have some chipping
and<00:04:22.900> scuffing<00:04:23.350> on<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.560> corner<00:04:23.890> there<00:04:24.040> just

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
and scuffing on the corner there just

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.150 
and scuffing on the corner there just
isn't<00:04:24.430> cool<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:25.090> me<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:26.260> terms<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.800> build

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
isn't cool to me so in terms of build

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.630 
isn't cool to me so in terms of build
quality<00:04:27.960> right<00:04:28.960> now<00:04:29.110> I'm<00:04:29.320> not<00:04:29.530> overly<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.100> am<00:04:30.610> I

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
quality right now I'm not overly I am I

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.020 
quality right now I'm not overly I am I
loved<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.390> love<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.840> overall<00:04:32.140> design<00:04:32.890> but<00:04:33.700> I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
loved I love the overall design but I

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.150 
loved I love the overall design but I
think<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.930> two-tone<00:04:35.350> finishes<00:04:35.920> and<00:04:36.040> all

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
think that the two-tone finishes and all

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.290 
think that the two-tone finishes and all
that<00:04:36.310> it's<00:04:36.430> cracked<00:04:36.670> up<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:36.970> be

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
that it's cracked up to be

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.450 
that it's cracked up to be
exactly<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.410> same<00:04:38.590> problem<00:04:39.070> that<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.250> have

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
exactly the same problem that I have

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.730 
exactly the same problem that I have
with<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.760> LG<00:04:40.060> not<00:04:40.390> exactly<00:04:40.810> sure<00:04:41.110> what<00:04:41.350> it's

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
with the LG not exactly sure what it's

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.740 
with the LG not exactly sure what it's
going<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.919> be<00:04:42.040> cracked<00:04:42.370> up<00:04:42.640> to<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.540> long

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
going to be cracked up to in the long

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.480 
going to be cracked up to in the long
term<00:04:44.140> because<00:04:44.680> this<00:04:44.950> is<00:04:45.130> such<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.310> difficult

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
term because this is such a difficult

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.070 
term because this is such a difficult
process<00:04:45.940> I'm<00:04:46.270> gonna<00:04:46.450> I'm<00:04:46.750> gonna<00:04:46.840> be

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
process I'm gonna I'm gonna be

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.760 
process I'm gonna I'm gonna be
interested<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.740> see<00:04:47.770> how<00:04:48.460> LG<00:04:49.140> has<00:04:50.140> managed<00:04:50.650> to

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
interested to see how LG has managed to

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.260 
interested to see how LG has managed to
do<00:04:50.980> this<00:04:51.100> especially<00:04:51.340> with<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.910> removable

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
do this especially with the removable

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.720 
do this especially with the removable
back<00:04:52.600> cover<00:04:52.919> makes<00:04:53.919> it<00:04:54.040> even<00:04:54.160> more<00:04:54.550> difficult

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
back cover makes it even more difficult

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.780 
back cover makes it even more difficult
to<00:04:55.240> secure<00:04:55.540> leather<00:04:55.780> onto<00:04:56.350> polycarbonate<00:04:57.340> so

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
to secure leather onto polycarbonate so

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.070 
to secure leather onto polycarbonate so
just<00:04:58.000> taking<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.270> look<00:04:58.300> at<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.570> killer<00:04:58.810> feature

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
just taking a look at the killer feature

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.740 
just taking a look at the killer feature
of<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.650> g4<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:00.760> is<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.180> camera<00:05:01.600> so

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
of the g4 and is it to the camera so

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.230 
of the g4 and is it to the camera so
this<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:01.990> a<00:05:02.050> 16<00:05:02.380> megapixel<00:05:02.500> shooter<00:05:02.919> but<00:05:03.669> LG<00:05:03.940> it

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
this is a 16 megapixel shooter but LG it

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.940 
this is a 16 megapixel shooter but LG it
actually<00:05:04.510> has<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.660> laser<00:05:04.960> autofocus<00:05:05.320> right<00:05:05.830> in

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
actually has a laser autofocus right in

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.320 
actually has a laser autofocus right in
here<00:05:06.190> and<00:05:06.340> then<00:05:06.669> they<00:05:06.790> have<00:05:07.000> something<00:05:07.210> called

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
here and then they have something called

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.080 
here and then they have something called
a<00:05:07.750> color<00:05:08.260> spectrum<00:05:09.010> sensor<00:05:09.040> so<00:05:09.880> this<00:05:10.000> is

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
a color spectrum sensor so this is

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.490 
a color spectrum sensor so this is
actually<00:05:10.330> going<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.540> be<00:05:10.630> directly<00:05:11.080> really

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
actually going to be directly really

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.400 
actually going to be directly really
quite<00:05:11.980> violent<00:05:12.460> video<00:05:13.030> screen<00:05:13.419> oh<00:05:13.720> no<00:05:14.110> they're

flash<00:05:48.010> but<00:05:48.640> the<00:05:48.730> LG<00:05:49.000> just<00:05:49.150> has<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:49.540> many

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
flash but the LG just has so many

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.810 
flash but the LG just has so many
advantages<00:05:49.840> as<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.470> laser<00:05:50.650> autofocus<00:05:51.070> so

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
advantages as the laser autofocus so

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.400 
advantages as the laser autofocus so
it's<00:05:51.970> gonna<00:05:52.120> focus<00:05:52.510> more<00:05:52.780> quickly<00:05:53.169> in<00:05:53.290> the

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
it's gonna focus more quickly in the

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.300 
it's gonna focus more quickly in the
dark<00:05:53.850> as<00:05:54.850> well<00:05:55.120> as<00:05:55.270> just<00:05:55.930> take<00:05:56.200> overall<00:05:56.860> faster

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
dark as well as just take overall faster

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.860 
dark as well as just take overall faster
photos<00:05:57.669> and<00:05:58.000> then<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.150> have<00:05:58.360> something<00:05:58.540> called

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
photos and then I have something called

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.230 
photos and then I have something called
a<00:05:59.200> color<00:05:59.800> spectrum<00:06:00.340> sensor<00:06:00.370> which<00:06:01.210> is

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
a color spectrum sensor which is

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.700 
a color spectrum sensor which is
actually<00:06:01.690> dedicated<00:06:01.840> for<00:06:02.260> the<00:06:02.290> white<00:06:02.500> balance

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
actually dedicated for the white balance

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.170 
actually dedicated for the white balance
so<00:06:02.980> it's<00:06:03.100> gonna<00:06:03.220> take<00:06:03.430> photos<00:06:03.760> that<00:06:03.850> are<00:06:03.970> more

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
so it's gonna take photos that are more

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.570 
so it's gonna take photos that are more
