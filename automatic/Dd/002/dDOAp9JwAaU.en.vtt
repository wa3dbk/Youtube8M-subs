00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.350
 you know friends that i have the most 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.690
 his support 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.200
 so this is what so when you walked games 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.120
 with schwarzenegger composition but 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.350
 one game eesu idol of my childhood 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.060
 Jean Claude van damme was not 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.740
 I remember as a child I never saw 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.010
 cartridges here pandalabs colors buckwheat money 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.840
 joy bought it 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.530
 but n there is always the same some kind of Japanese 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.740
 crap a van damme 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.360
 there was no trace 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.510
 Well, I remembered from my children 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.260
 resentment for the reason that peppy 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.540
 old man van damme 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.620
 announced the release of the film universal 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.500
 soldier 3 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.340
 if which will be held as in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.380
 Chernobyl 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.350
 hope that there will be a game so now 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.770
 may not even been born 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 not remembering a budget of 14 million dollars 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.680
 but what do you really van damme not 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.480
 no computer game is dedicated 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.000
 could not surely blurt out 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.770
 for warmth 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.710
 universal rained at night points 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.030
 here it is and telephone 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.920
 can't remind van damme 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.470
 public food so what fns talk about her 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.240
 we are not even Putin 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.040
 but having rummaged in 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.020
 Internet and here I found 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.130
 a couple of leadership he houses 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.659
 let's start close on the film 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.049
 game based 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.920
 so street fighter 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.049
 I think many of you remember street peeling 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:55.730
 fighter 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.000
 I think it was a good one. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.170
 jean claude van damme 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.260
 This chemistry testing 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.500
 I enjoyed watching it more 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.620
 riot Novgorod 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.080
 Well, what do we have for the game therefore the film 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.919
 let's see 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.689
 so we expect the same two-dimensional 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.299
 fighting game street fighter 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.659
 Here we just save the world by us figures 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.669
 from the movie 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.019
 and since the morgue regiment under 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.739
 at this end then we can 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.359
 feel with belgian skin and 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.759
 break a pair of slurped 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.760
 Well, let's start with the fact that this game was held 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.010
 the influx of trishin 1 series Saturn and gaming 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.369
 arcade machines 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.749
 moreover frames which participants on their 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.939
 straight snow screens 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.729
 friend's friend versions are different 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.089
 so in the arcade version there are some 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.649
 characters that are hidden in the new version 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.819
 for playstation eye fi sega saturn 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.269
 but there are not a few fighters who are all 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.460
 2010 which let decide 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.869
 1 but such porridge is full 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.989
 even different from in the game melon 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.959
 new version for playstation they are more 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.669
 animated quality them 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.710
 more of course playstation version 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.400
 it was better in appearance there 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.289
 even have 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.519
 lowered rates from the movie 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.730
 total 3 4 year contract film mode 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.860
 where can only play for van damme 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.999
 and pass like his movie storyline 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.829
 there is also a normal mode 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.010
 as usual strip Babel defeat each 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.149
 with a friend and training where do without it 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:31.969
 playing it is very funny only the first 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:33.999
 time is no shit super 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.069
 reception 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.449
 Of course the game is not a classic speed 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.789
 so whom we used to 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.519
 just down for a very good 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.560
 import 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.979
 and there is almost no music 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.269
 and it is very critic then she plays who is not 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:48.899
 plays 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.440
 and hear the solution 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.440
 sounds like 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.439
 counters 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.189
 actually very April 10 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.010
 generally 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.409
 thanks to the search for port of was many 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.730
 can now enjoy it and 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.539
 caviar 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.329
 the city's teachings of not getting what you need 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.299
 effect and most importantly 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.069
 jean claude van damme do this player 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.349
 a very rewarding purchase and not 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.090
 bad gimp and make it quite 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.010
 tolerable 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.150
 entertainment in the subway 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.349
 this game 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.649
 we are the best and van dale which 

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:23.400
 came in 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.490
 Now let's talk and the second game 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.729
 which was released on the tpu platform 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.240
 perm cents 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.880
 and so the pirate left time a cop or with us 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.759
 better known as the time patrol 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.430
 the film was opened a new one about the game 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.860
 On super never such at all 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.620
 you say 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.129
 Well, let's order 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.619
 First of all, we are extremely complex. 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:49.559
 platform like engine on the right 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.809
 left and left to right championship 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:53.199
 the like 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.550
 not only is he the biggest piece of shit 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.259
 wrestling greek so-called tiger 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.400
 making up banks to avoid all the time 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.690
 before others refused 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.990
 countries are ubiquitous 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.850
 give 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.259
 so-called account 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.460
 life context here is heat 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.759
 two continents 2 life is just 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.639
 but it is unrealistically difficult because in 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.529
 every city will show max passport times 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:16.949
 Kokoity play 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.210
 hard to say 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.620
 but using a simulator 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.490
 it can not even pass 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.490
 Jean Claude van Damme here can 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.159
 like a horse already 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.759
 environmentalist on their shulik than anyone even meet 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.219
 his trunk 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.770
 gun habitat 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.229
 found nothing interesting on the game itself 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.400
 waiting we can only swimming on which dvd 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.300
 submarine hockey game solid 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.949
 disappointment 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.279
 it's time to learn English by itself 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.580
 cheat cop 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.430
 wolf full-time g 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.029
 english singing 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.550
 repeat continue 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.310
 Borodin Opera this start has become so 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.479
 arriving vacuums 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.339
 group management 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:03.219
 guns and piles of trash that dies 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.759
 bounces have you ever seen to 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.089
 enemies were dying to bounce 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:10.430
 you have three parts and poses by type 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.729
 giant media a lot well this is a general request 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.719
 it's better not to tell him 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.360
 but there were those very nasty 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.529
 that krasovsky i follow the plot of the film 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:22.179
 and grace part of throwing blunt 

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:23.129
 varnish 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.240
 what about music 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.030
 so it was closed there is just 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.289
 defense navy sharks 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.369
 now hear yourself 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:33.270
 Group 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.270
 it 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.150
 but this is real music 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.070
 but in general it can be said therefore 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.690
 absolutely good luck 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.759
 and careless project 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.710
 very sorry situation another game Saban 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.720
 ladies turned letters 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.369
 Bad quality 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:58.839
 but I know who is even more unlucky in 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:00.159
 this plan 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.050
 stephen sigal is another idol of my childhood 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.349
 no one was dedicated to him 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.110
 games besides him the seeker 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.740
 action clumsy unsuccessful in this 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.219
 versions that are not just terrible she 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.610
 just tele mojo name allowed 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.539
 steven 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:18.259
 books terribly all on the issue of type not 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:20.389
 saw on a walk level design 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.949
 yakunin battle artist 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:22.939
 plots 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:24.759
 in general there is no in general 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.710
 I am disappointed but I hope someday 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.889
 and supposedly worthy of the game 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:30.479
 and hope for good 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.099
 thank you would be a lie 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:33.499
 meeting
