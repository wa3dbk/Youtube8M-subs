00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.200
 hello this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:09.559
 work a stitch 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.980
 and we're going to make it crochet 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.970
 make for this sample the fabric 22 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.970
 3 more chains with which it goes up and we're going to 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:25.240
 do the following let's jump 1 2 3 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.230
 and in the fourth chain we are going to make a 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:35.100
 fan of four that is to say we make a 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:39.600
 solid two separated with two chains 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:44.699
 and we are going to make two massifs inside 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.519
 from the same hole without separation let's go 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:50.760
 to load our hook and we make one 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.539
 two three and in number four we return 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.890
 to do the same until we finish our 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.890
 our chain that we elaborate 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.220
 here we are finished if we count 1 2 3 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.750
 and 4 here another fan would go but here 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.790
 nothing else we are going to make a solid 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.580
 because we will be finishing 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.980
 our our sample is to say let's 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.120
 work this stitch with multiple of 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.230
 four now here I will show you how 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.480
 let's work we 're going to come up with three 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.580
 chains this nothing else is because it is 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.160
 our sample we have to 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.510
 work this without this bank we are going to 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.840
 do the following let's embrace this 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.990
 solid below and let's work it 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 this way now we are going to load 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.450
 our hook and make the other massif 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.270
 within the space that were left where 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:58.360
 they were our three chains separated 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:01.990
 1 2 3 we make the other massif inside the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.940
 anterior space and the fourth solid what 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.110
 we already know how to put the hook 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.200
 under 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 pulling here and going 1 2 and 3 we go back 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.930
 to repeat the same without separation here 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.210
 no chains or anything we're going to work from 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.640
 the four clumps are taking the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.400
 second group below to 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.060
 work it out in the other 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.000
 we work inside separated with three 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.380
 chains we go back to work the massif 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.240
 inside 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.240
 the other in highlight 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.709
 and we finished our return from it 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.709
 way 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.210
 we have finished we are going to rotate our 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.570
 work 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.720
 let's go up with our voice our 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.980
 three chains that are 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.240
 the shore mass and from here 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.790
 we work like we did in the round 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.490
 earlier this is here you already see these 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.400
 backwards if you already see them here 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.980
 that are in relief because that is going to 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.700
 indicate that we are going to work like this in 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:21.190
 relief and the other normal 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.090
 we separate with three chains and we make 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.500
 normal 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.890
 and in relief 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.790
 and basically these are going to be our 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.720
 three points our three laps since 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:40.590
 the first one was basic and from the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.370
 second we start raising in relief 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.650
 our massif and from the third 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.780
 back we have to go working all 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.000
 everything as it is shown to us is to say if 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.430
 it is in relief we work it in relief 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.489
 and next to the relief we will work 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.690
 inside I'm doing it in a way 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:07.200
 a little quick for us to turn around and 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.980
 show them how it is from the other side 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.620
 and finally show them how it is 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.810
 finished in this case I am targeted 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.260
 I'm using you to make a 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.260
 bullfight 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.010
 and here you know that the last one nothing else 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.620
 we resume the massif 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.260
 this is to make the shore and that's how it is 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.020
 how we are left at the moment you 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.330
 they turn this one that stays here again 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.280
 they will perform in the solid in 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.190
 relief already know that here they have to 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.460
 make the 3 of shore and separate them and 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.640
 then this is going to be like me 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.220
 I'm going to show you a garment in which 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.540
 I'm doing and that's how the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.140
 stitch at the end we have one and another 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.140
 Another another 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.090
 in the stitch we just made 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.680
 you know how I always invite you to 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.900
 subscribe to my channel and I send them a 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.510
 cordial greeting to the group of facebook 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.350
 solÃ­s weaving with him and we are in the 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.350
 next thanks
