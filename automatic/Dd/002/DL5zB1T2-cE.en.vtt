00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hi guys back with a good 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.690
 brand new episode of the series on 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.540
 minecraft then this this will be one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.420
 bet a little different than usual 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 then before I started I saw that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.310
 there is no video on the map 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 loved it so I decided to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.369
 continue more episodes where I am at 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.740
 build the world and then now though 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.380
 there is a gap finally cites the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.880
 update for iphone where there is a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.620
 casino of stuff more and now in this 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.040
 episode indeed there were all 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.750
 the main changes are the main ones 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 let's create a new world in mode 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 creative just to see some of these 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.469
 differences 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.289
 then the thing that will immediately miss us 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.410
 surely the eye is that in practice 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.559
 the world is infinite if you now come out of 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.660
 this cabbage forest that then 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.189
 here we are the practice 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.159
 now the world is infinite and we could 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:11.450
 wander where we want and we also have 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.890
 a lot of extra stuff like for example 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 dungeon or even the villages then 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 we say that almost at the levels of the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 PC version in practice the game is 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.820
 changed another the only problem 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.100
 now let's go to my world for a moment 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.909
 I was doing the previous series in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 practice 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.400
 unfortunately here he remained at the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.369
 previous version of minecraft then 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.520
 the world is limited and there are many 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.329
 things less and so I wanted to ask you 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.329
 you prefer it to continue the series of 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:53.060
 minecraft here on this world where though 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.369
 really limited or prefer that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.340
 continue creates a second season of 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.619
 minecraft let's start everything from here where it is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.549
 a lot much more stuff 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.450
 I would sincerely prefer to create a 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.819
 world here because 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.800
 that is, the differences are abysmal between 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.150
 that version and this provides that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.319
 show 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.050
 this fantastic thing and then do me 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.790
 know you in the comments if you prefer one 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 second season or if they continue 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.010
 on the previous map is type all 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.930
 these structures could not have these 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.760
 natural mountains made like this with i 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.220
 Half ponds could not be there 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.739
 in the version of before while now there 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.459
 they are and especially now they are there too 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.470
 these rivers but also caves 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.750
 just then go exploring 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.630
 while in the previous version in 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.110
 these caves were not there ie we had to 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.440
 be us maybe to create them like that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.569
 fourth here how dark it is here 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.880
 would like to create us a little house 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.790
 however we say that this world is one 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.360
 version created just for you to see a 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.030
 what are these little novelty then there 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.620
 they are also these materials that if not 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.889
 mistake still do not come out in the version 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.530
 current of minecraft for pc and should 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:21.670
 going out should actually be there already 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.680
 now with the snap shot and then between a 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.609
 they should go out even for this 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.090
 should be then this is the 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:34.959
 slush then this should be the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.650
 the site a stuff like that where ande 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:43.150
 site arcade site here it is no it is not 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:48.850
 this thing cabbage 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.130
 this is not even this hand 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.230
 it is this ok perfect mystery solved 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.950
 we descend on this rule and see a 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.700
 what we hope is a little more 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.060
 long 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.299
 look at the lava as much as cabbage and red 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.389
 there is in the series for pc and orange type 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.680
 here is really red blood ultra or that 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.819
 we're on fire 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.040
 well then let's get out of here 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.139
 let's go see other new dances 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.609
 maybe we find 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:28.889
 a village would be fantastic 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:33.090
 we try then we go out perfect a 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:36.779
 little dark below then let's settle in 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.930
 flight is said so I think so we try 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:42.719
 then this village added 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.139
 even wolves that can be used type 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:48.479
 as fellow animal friends which I do not 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.349
 I am sorry at all always wanted a 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:56.699
 wolf as a perfect friend 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:59.250
 let's see if there is something the 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:04.439
 nice to there is the beautiful tnt at that 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:09.389
 I'm kind of the eggs we still expose a 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:12.029
 wolf hopefully some new on the ground a 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.770
 fuck now there's a luck I'm not 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.900
 this was going towards creative if not 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.189
 I would have made a bad end we see 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.550
 some other man what else is there then 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:32.159
 hand also silverfish so i guess that 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:37.789
 there is also the leder or land 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:41.009
 would be great then we come then 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:47.310
 what else is here there should be 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:49.830
 Actually Land Zombie Pixels Approve It 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.669
 then let's see if there are any blocks 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:58.020
 never of obsidian what i am saying 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:01.319
 let's put it down here it should be 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.289
 we also hope for a flint 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:08.099
 I have no idea how to turn it on like this 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:11.069
 It should be fine 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.830
 now let's take a flint hoping that 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:17.159
 yes, here it is, and here we are 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.759
 if it works I swear I don't know is one 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.430
 show 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.680
 ok without setting fire to the stuff I know that 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.740
 apparently we don't do the last one 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.340
 attempt if it does not go now I know that not 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.919
 nothing works i know that the never 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.729
 oh well maybe even add nothing 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:38.580
 future will be perfect let's see if there is 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:44.250
 some other man to test what 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:49.190
 we have slam spiders also good slime 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:51.720
 throwing someone then what else there is 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.400

00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:00.240
 have added these odious ones 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:04.080
 perfect creatures ok let's say these 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:06.389
 were the main changes 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.720

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:12.590

 guess precisely the logos 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:49.889
