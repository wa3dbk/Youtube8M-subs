a nice little buck with my reefer

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.610 
a nice little buck with my reefer
he<00:04:41.310> was<00:04:41.400> quartering<00:04:41.820> away<00:04:41.910> real<00:04:42.240> hard<00:04:42.560> not<00:04:43.560> a

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
he was quartering away real hard not a

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.810 
he was quartering away real hard not a
real<00:04:43.860> good<00:04:44.010> blood<00:04:44.250> trail<00:04:44.490> because<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:44.730> was

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
real good blood trail because it was

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.810 
real good blood trail because it was
real<00:04:45.090> steep<00:04:45.360> angle<00:04:45.750> but<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:47.400> rained<00:04:47.640> last

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
real steep angle but it rained last

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.520 
real steep angle but it rained last
night<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.360> it's<00:04:48.450> gonna<00:04:48.570> be<00:04:48.690> tricky<00:04:48.870> but<00:04:49.230> I

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
night so it's gonna be tricky but I

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.230 
night so it's gonna be tricky but I
think<00:04:49.890> we're<00:04:50.220> just<00:04:50.340> kind<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.520> working<00:04:51.000> our<00:04:51.210> way

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
think we're just kind of working our way

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.610 
think we're just kind of working our way
around<00:04:51.420> where<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:51.840> heard<00:04:52.020> him<00:04:52.140> snore<00:04:52.380> trees

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
around where I heard him snore trees

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.780 
around where I heard him snore trees
it's<00:04:52.890> almost<00:04:53.040> sound<00:04:53.220> like<00:04:53.310> it's<00:04:53.460> coughing<00:04:53.730> up

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
it's almost sound like it's coughing up

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.940 
it's almost sound like it's coughing up
bubbles<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.360> definitely<00:04:55.350> think<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.590> got<00:04:55.740> both

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
bubbles so definitely think I got both

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.090 
bubbles so definitely think I got both
lungs<00:04:56.250> but<00:04:56.760> he<00:04:57.120> shouldn't<00:04:57.360> be<00:04:57.420> too<00:04:57.570> far<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:58.100> we

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
lungs but he shouldn't be too far so we

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.250 
lungs but he shouldn't be too far so we
go<00:04:59.220> look<00:04:59.400> one<00:04:59.610> I<00:04:59.880> shot<00:05:00.480> him<00:05:00.660> from<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.930> stand

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
go look one I shot him from that stand

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.590 
go look one I shot him from that stand
right<00:05:01.380> up<00:05:01.590> here<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:03.000> he<00:05:03.120> was<00:05:03.210> sitting<00:05:03.510> right

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
right up here and he was sitting right

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:28.220 
right up here and he was sitting right
here

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.750 

yeah<00:05:31.830> trail<00:05:32.830> right<00:05:33.040> here<00:05:33.250> that<00:05:33.370> he<00:05:33.430> was<00:05:33.520> trying

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
yeah trail right here that he was trying

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.940

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
infos taking off so I think who's

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.020

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
tracking and the last bit of blood I

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:56.370 
tracking and the last bit of blood I
found<00:05:43.180> I<00:05:43.810> marked<00:05:44.530> through<00:05:44.710> the<00:05:44.830> stick

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380
