position the way it is right now I would

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.619 
position the way it is right now I would

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
also has a ring at the top so if you had

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.670 
also has a ring at the top so if you had
a<00:06:02.639> cabin<00:06:02.910> near<00:06:03.060> ring<00:06:03.389> or<00:06:03.660> something<00:06:04.169> else<00:06:04.500> on

a cabin near ring or something else on

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.439 
a cabin near ring or something else on
your<00:06:04.710> gear<00:06:05.070> you<00:06:05.610> wanted<00:06:05.880> to<00:06:05.910> carry<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.300> light

your gear you wanted to carry the light

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.820 
your gear you wanted to carry the light
within<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:06.870> didn't<00:06:07.259> want<00:06:07.410> to<00:06:07.500> have<00:06:07.620> it<00:06:07.740> on

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
within you didn't want to have it on

within you didn't want to have it on
your<00:06:07.949> side<00:06:08.389> you<00:06:09.389> can<00:06:09.570> easily<00:06:09.810> do<00:06:10.169> that<00:06:10.199> with

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
your side you can easily do that with

your side you can easily do that with
this<00:06:10.680> ring

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.719 

so

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.860 

really<00:06:28.479> nice<00:06:28.629> holster

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
the light itself weighs about just under

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.449 
the light itself weighs about just under
25<00:06:37.650> ounces

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:41.459 

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:49.429 

each<00:06:42.459> is<00:06:42.669> the<00:06:42.819> SST<00:06:43.389> 90<00:06:44.489> led<00:06:47.129> smooth<00:06:48.129> reflector

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
each is the SST 90 led smooth reflector

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:53.459 
each is the SST 90 led smooth reflector
wish<00:06:50.439> it<00:06:50.619> had<00:06:50.769> an<00:06:50.889> optional<00:06:52.259> orange<00:06:53.259> peel

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:53.469 
wish it had an optional orange peel

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:57.449 
wish it had an optional orange peel
reflector<00:06:53.979> perhaps<00:06:54.729> maybe<00:06:54.999> someday<00:06:56.309> so<00:06:57.309> let's

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:57.459 
reflector perhaps maybe someday so let's

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:07.050 
reflector perhaps maybe someday so let's
take<00:06:57.610> a<00:06:57.669> look<00:06:57.879> at<00:06:57.909> the<00:06:58.059> beam<00:06:58.239> shots

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060
