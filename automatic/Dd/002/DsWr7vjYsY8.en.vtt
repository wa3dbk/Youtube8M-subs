first impression when the trailer

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.690 
first impression when the trailer
dropped<00:02:34.380> when<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:34.980> black<00:02:35.220> ops<00:02:35.460> 3<00:02:35.670> trailer

dropped when the black ops 3 trailer

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.560 
dropped when the black ops 3 trailer
came<00:02:36.330> out<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.810> was<00:02:37.170> very<00:02:37.680> very<00:02:37.830> scared<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:39.210> what

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
came out I was very very scared of what

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.990 
came out I was very very scared of what
the<00:02:39.690> game<00:02:39.870> had<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.350> store<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.710> was<00:02:41.100> not<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.760> fan<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the game had in store I was not a fan of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.460 
the game had in store I was not a fan of
the<00:02:42.180> trailer<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.570> thought<00:02:42.870> everything<00:02:43.260> looked

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the trailer I thought everything looked

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.460 
the trailer I thought everything looked
Opie<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.520> thought<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.180> little<00:02:45.450> specialist<00:02:46.230> uh

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
Opie I thought the little specialist uh

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.560 
Opie I thought the little specialist uh
I<00:02:46.800> don't<00:02:47.220> know<00:02:47.430> what<00:02:47.550> they<00:02:47.670> call<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.330> haven't

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I don't know what they call it I haven't

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.780 
I don't know what they call it I haven't
really<00:02:48.750> kept<00:02:48.960> super<00:02:49.380> up<00:02:49.500> today<00:02:49.740> with<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
really kept super up today with it but I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.340 
really kept super up today with it but I
guess<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.330> like<00:02:51.420> destiny<00:02:52.050> where

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
guess it's kind of like destiny where

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.140 
guess it's kind of like destiny where
you're<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.770> Warlock<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.400> got<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.640> Nova<00:02:53.970> bomb

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you're the Warlock you got the Nova bomb

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.600 
you're the Warlock you got the Nova bomb
if<00:02:54.960> you're<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> hunter<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.860> got<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.130> gold<00:02:56.370> gun

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
if you're a hunter you got the gold gun

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.340 
if you're a hunter you got the gold gun
there's<00:02:56.820> like<00:02:56.940> stuff<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.780> black

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
there's like stuff like that in black

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.260

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
a black ops 2 vibe I say that because it

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.180 
a black ops 2 vibe I say that because it
looks<00:03:48.870> like<00:03:49.050> people<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:49.860> when<00:03:50.010> you're<00:03:50.130> on

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
the ground it looked like it kind of

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.570

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.699 
acted like black ops 2 the movement
mechanics<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.360> not<00:03:54.720> only<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.320> colors

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.830 
mechanics and not only that the colors
really<00:03:55.950> reminded<00:03:56.490> me<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.910> tray<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.330> game<00:03:57.600> and

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
pretty cool the wall running isn't super

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.670 
pretty cool the wall running isn't super
Opie<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.330> looks<00:04:03.510> like<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.690> titanfall<00:04:04.080> wall<00:04:04.440> run

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
and if anybody play titanfall you really

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.410

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
didn't use wall running to get out of a

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.630 
didn't use wall running to get out of a
situation<00:04:09.590> where<00:04:10.590> you're<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> gunfight<00:04:11.220> you

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
situation where you're in a gunfight you

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.100 
situation where you're in a gunfight you
use<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.150> get<00:04:12.270> from<00:04:12.450> one<00:04:12.480> side<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> map

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
use it to get from one side of the map

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.990 
use it to get from one side of the map
to<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.380> other<00:04:13.530> quicker<00:04:14.370> than<00:04:14.610> being<00:04:14.850> on<00:04:14.940> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
to the other quicker than being on the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.400 
to the other quicker than being on the
ground<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.390> while<00:04:15.570> running<00:04:15.750> really<00:04:16.049> doesn't

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
ground so while running really doesn't

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.110 
ground so while running really doesn't
scare<00:04:16.709> me<00:04:16.770> it's<00:04:17.040> not<00:04:17.160> like<00:04:17.310> advanced<00:04:17.700> warfare

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
scare me it's not like advanced warfare

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.940

where<00:04:18.359> it's<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.510> clusterfuck<00:04:18.989> at<00:04:19.650> least<00:04:19.830> it

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
where it's a clusterfuck at least it

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.320 
where it's a clusterfuck at least it
doesn't<00:04:20.100> look<00:04:20.370> like<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.820> mean<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:21.000> guess<00:04:21.180> only

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
doesn't look like it I mean I guess only

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.030
