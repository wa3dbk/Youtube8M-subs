00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
we were over the six I had the quarters

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.110 
we were over the six I had the quarters
acted<00:02:59.460> as<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.790> was<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> one<00:03:00.270> chord<00:03:01.730> but<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> lose

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
acted as it was a one chord but I lose

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.240 
acted as it was a one chord but I lose

as you can see it isn't what I've shown

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.879 
as you can see it isn't what I've shown
you<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.669> can<00:05:19.850> put<00:05:20.090> together<00:05:20.240> all<00:05:21.080> kinds<00:05:21.139> of

you you can put together all kinds of

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.189 
you you can put together all kinds of
grooves<00:05:22.160> often<00:05:23.030> if<00:05:23.150> you<00:05:23.270> know<00:05:23.300> your<00:05:23.930> basic

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
grooves often if you know your basic

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.770

chord on what chord and play with each
bass<00:05:27.050> note<00:05:27.320> you<00:05:27.860> can<00:05:28.040> put<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.340> constraint

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
bass note you can put the constraint

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.800 
bass note you can put the constraint
together<00:05:29.030> your<00:05:29.240> own<00:05:29.389> grooves<00:05:31.180> let<00:05:32.180> me<00:05:32.300> show

the major chord for that note in this

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.140 
the major chord for that note in this
