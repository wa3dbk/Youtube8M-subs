00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
I guess um but she made a valid point

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.299 
I guess um but she made a valid point
that<00:00:41.390> they<00:00:42.390> they<00:00:42.780> made<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> school<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that they they made the school so that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029 
that they they made the school so that
all<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> SAO<00:00:45.420> kids<00:00:45.809> would<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.860> place

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
all the SAO kids would be in one place

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
all the SAO kids would be in one place
so<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.610> monitor<00:00:48.059> them<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.840> which

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.170 
so they can monitor them which which
that's<00:00:50.010> that's<00:00:50.960> reasonable<00:00:51.960> yeah<00:00:52.199> because

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
that's that's reasonable yeah because

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.750 
that's that's reasonable yeah because
after<00:00:54.180> being<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.539> something<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.320> Sao<00:00:55.770> these

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
