out of the ground through the heat pump
and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.410> returned<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.369> ground<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.269> key

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and then returned to the ground the key

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.150 
and then returned to the ground the key
for<00:00:30.869> any<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.170> these<00:00:31.289> loops<00:00:31.590> those<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:32.070> were

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
for any of these loops those they were

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.370 
for any of these loops those they were
always<00:00:32.309> gonna<00:00:32.550> find<00:00:32.940> 50<00:00:33.600> degree<00:00:33.870> temperature

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
always gonna find 50 degree temperature

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
always gonna find 50 degree temperature
both<00:00:34.680> winter<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.160> summer<00:00:35.460> under<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> ground

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
both winter and summer under the ground

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.549 
both winter and summer under the ground
yeah<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> don't<00:00:36.840> know<00:00:36.930> many<00:00:37.050> people<00:00:37.469> who

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
yeah but I don't know many people who

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.500 
yeah but I don't know many people who
think<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.920> 50<00:00:38.370> degrees<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> comfortable

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
think that 50 degrees is a comfortable

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.580 
think that 50 degrees is a comfortable
temperature<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.960> keep<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> house<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.379> the

temperature to keep the house in the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.900 
temperature to keep the house in the
winter<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:41.460> where<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> heat

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
winter right but that's where the heat

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.389 
winter right but that's where the heat
pump<00:00:42.180> comes<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:43.260> gonna<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.920> basic

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
pump comes in we're gonna use the basic

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.979 
pump comes in we're gonna use the basic
refrigeration<00:00:44.610> cycle<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.809> every

into a liquid and the process repeats
the<00:01:25.830> same<00:01:26.009> equipment<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.640> used<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> cool

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the same equipment can be used to cool

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
the same equipment can be used to cool
the<00:01:27.210> house<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> summer<00:01:27.930> simply<00:01:28.409> by

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the house in the summer simply by

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.380 
the house in the summer simply by
pumping<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.070> refrigerant<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.030> opposite

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
pumping the refrigerant in the opposite

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
pumping the refrigerant in the opposite
direction<00:01:30.530> alright<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> theory<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
direction alright so I get the theory of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.710 
direction alright so I get the theory of
how<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.850> work<00:01:33.000> well<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> systems

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
how they work well what are the systems

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
how they work well what are the systems
look<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.170> well<00:01:34.500> recently<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.009> took<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
look like well recently I took a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
look like well recently I took a
homeowner<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.970> see<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.329> these<00:01:36.420> geothermal

so<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.690> an<00:01:39.840> email<00:01:40.020> from<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> curious

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so we got an email from you curious

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.440 
so we got an email from you curious
about<00:01:40.980> geothermal<00:01:41.460> heat<00:01:41.820> pumps<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.270> you're

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
about geothermal heat pumps and you're

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
about geothermal heat pumps and you're
building<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> new<00:01:42.870> house<00:01:43.050> that's<00:01:43.470> right<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
building a new house that's right I just

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.980 
building a new house that's right I just
recently<00:01:44.250> bought<00:01:44.730> some<00:01:45.360> property<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.900> her

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
recently bought some property on her

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.930 
recently bought some property on her
lake<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.890> planning<00:01:47.280> stage<00:01:47.550> of<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
lake in the planning stage of the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.520 
lake in the planning stage of the
heating<00:01:48.210> system<00:01:48.660> well<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> thought<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.410> would

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
heating system well I thought I would

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.890 
heating system well I thought I would
bring<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.490> homeowner<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.420> six

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
bring you here this homeowner about six

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.810 
bring you here this homeowner about six
years<00:01:52.080> ago<00:01:52.200> decided<00:01:52.980> to<00:01:53.130> put<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.550> geothermal

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
years ago decided to put in a geothermal

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
years ago decided to put in a geothermal
heat<00:01:54.180> pump<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.080> ground<00:01:55.350> source<00:01:55.620> heat

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
heat pump that's a ground source heat

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.470 
heat pump that's a ground source heat
pump<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.520> most<00:01:56.760> people<00:01:57.000> might<00:01:57.120> know<00:01:57.240> heat

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
pump now most people might know heat

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.730 
pump now most people might know heat
pump<00:01:57.720> because<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.050> might<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.320> equipment

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
pump because it might have equipment

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.230 
pump because it might have equipment
like<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.370> outside<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.030> called

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
like this on the outside this is called

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.000 
like this on the outside this is called
a<00:02:00.330> condenser<00:02:00.900> now<00:02:01.650> when<00:02:01.830> it's<00:02:01.920> in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
a condenser now when it's in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.280 
a condenser now when it's in
air-conditioning<00:02:02.820> mode<00:02:03.060> heat<00:02:03.900> is<00:02:04.110> absorbed

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
air-conditioning mode heat is absorbed

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.650 
air-conditioning mode heat is absorbed
from<00:02:04.800> inside<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.460> building<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.330> these

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
from inside the building into these

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.359 
from inside the building into these
refrigerant<00:02:07.200> lines<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> dumps<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
refrigerant lines and it dumps to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.090 
refrigerant lines and it dumps to
outside<00:02:08.850> when<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> heat<00:02:10.050> pump<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.920> also

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
outside when it's a heat pump it also

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.770 
outside when it's a heat pump it also
can<00:02:11.460> reverse<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.150> actually<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.660> be

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
can reverse and that actually can be

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.260 
can reverse and that actually can be
looking<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.440> heat<00:02:13.680> from<00:02:13.920> outside<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:15.150> be

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
looking for heat from outside to be

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.060 
looking for heat from outside to be
absorbed<00:02:15.660> into<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.930> refrigerant<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.740> go<00:02:16.830> into

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
absorbed into the refrigerant to go into

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.920 
absorbed into the refrigerant to go into
the<00:02:17.160> building<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.580> problem<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.720> gets

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the building the problem is it gets

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.180 
the building the problem is it gets
really<00:02:19.200> cold<00:02:19.380> here<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.680> there's<00:02:19.800> not<00:02:19.920> much

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
really cold here and there's not much

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.949 
really cold here and there's not much
heat<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.150> had<00:02:21.300> how<00:02:21.450> close<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.720> get<00:02:21.840> around

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
heat to be had how close you get around

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.780 
heat to be had how close you get around
here<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.470> freezing<00:02:23.010> most<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.550> that's

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
here it's freezing most of it that's

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.240 
here it's freezing most of it that's
right<00:02:24.000> winter<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.410> geothermal<00:02:25.680> we

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
right winter so now with geothermal we

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.500 
right winter so now with geothermal we
actually<00:02:26.580> could<00:02:26.700> use<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.090> heat<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.390> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
actually could use the heat that is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.090 
actually could use the heat that is
below<00:02:27.840> our<00:02:27.870> feet<00:02:28.290> down<00:02:28.530> under<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> ground

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
below our feet down under the ground

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.770 
below our feet down under the ground
once<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.670> get<00:02:29.790> down<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> four<00:02:30.270> or<00:02:30.360> five<00:02:30.420> feet

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
once you get down to four or five feet

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.410 
once you get down to four or five feet
down<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.620> about<00:02:31.800> 45<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.610> 50<00:02:32.730> degrees<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
down it's about 45 to 50 degrees that

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.510 
down it's about 45 to 50 degrees that
down<00:02:33.600> there<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:34.709> now<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.130> got<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.400> figure

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
down there so now now I got to figure

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.740 
down there so now now I got to figure
out<00:02:35.640> how<00:02:35.730> you're<00:02:35.850> gonna<00:02:35.970> collect<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.450> energy

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
out how you're gonna collect that energy

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.690 
out how you're gonna collect that energy
so<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.959> could<00:02:37.140> put<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.560> bunch<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.250> pipes<00:02:38.490> down

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
so you could put a bunch of pipes down

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.300 
so you could put a bunch of pipes down
five<00:02:39.090> feet<00:02:39.420> down<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.990> collect<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> energy<00:02:40.740> you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
five feet down to collect the energy you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.070 
five feet down to collect the energy you
could<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.580> closed<00:02:41.970> loop<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.870> home

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
could do a closed loop but this home

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.920 
could do a closed loop but this home
want<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.380> chose<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.830> put<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> well<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:44.519> this

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
want to chose to put a well like this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.720 
want to chose to put a well like this
this<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.080> actually<00:02:46.410> about<00:02:46.500> 400<00:02:47.220> feet<00:02:47.400> down<00:02:47.610> at

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
this is actually about 400 feet down at

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.940 
this is actually about 400 feet down at
the<00:02:47.790> very<00:02:48.000> bottom<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.630> there's<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> pump<00:02:49.170> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the very bottom of it there's a pump and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.560 
the very bottom of it there's a pump and
it's<00:02:50.130> gonna<00:02:50.220> take<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.730> water<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.180> pump<00:02:51.390> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
it's gonna take that water and pump it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.390 
it's gonna take that water and pump it
up<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.959> go<00:02:52.230> into<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.560> house<00:02:52.709> we<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.040> use<00:02:53.220> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
up and go into the house we can use it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.370 
up and go into the house we can use it
to<00:02:53.489> heat<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.820> building<00:02:53.850> let<00:02:54.360> me<00:02:54.420> show<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.630> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
to heat the building let me show you the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.080 
to heat the building let me show you the
pipe<00:02:55.620> actually<00:02:56.040> comes<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:56.400> two<00:02:56.519> right<00:02:56.700> here<00:02:56.880> so

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
pipe actually comes in two right here so

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.640 
pipe actually comes in two right here so
here's<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.420> 50<00:02:57.780> degree<00:02:58.019> water<00:02:58.200> that's<00:02:58.470> going

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
here's that 50 degree water that's going

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.210 
here's that 50 degree water that's going
to<00:02:58.709> come<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.190> comes<00:03:00.150> across<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.720> ceiling<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
to come in comes across the ceiling and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.120 
to come in comes across the ceiling and
now<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.640> goes<00:03:02.850> right<00:03:03.120> over<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.350> it

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
now it goes right over to here and it

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.460 
now it goes right over to here and it
comes<00:03:05.340> down<00:03:05.670> into<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.690> heat<00:03:06.989> pump<00:03:07.260> right

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
comes down into this heat pump right

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.560 
comes down into this heat pump right
here<00:03:07.530> now<00:03:07.860> inside<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.370> heat<00:03:08.580> pump<00:03:08.820> there's<00:03:09.480> a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
here now inside this heat pump there's a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.870 
here now inside this heat pump there's a
heat<00:03:09.810> exchanger<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.709> there's<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.459> basic

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
heat exchanger and there's the basic

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.490 
heat exchanger and there's the basic
refrigeration<00:03:12.540> equipment<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:13.200> see<00:03:13.410> in

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
refrigeration equipment that we see in

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.100 
refrigeration equipment that we see in
every<00:03:13.709> refrigerator<00:03:14.489> or<00:03:14.760> air-conditioner<00:03:15.510> so

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
every refrigerator or air-conditioner so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.150 
every refrigerator or air-conditioner so
what<00:03:16.200> happens<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.890> heat<00:03:17.040> exchanger

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
what happens is that heat exchanger

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.340 
what happens is that heat exchanger
picks<00:03:17.700> up<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.000> 50<00:03:18.330> degree<00:03:18.570> temperature<00:03:19.050> and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
picks up that 50 degree temperature and

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.750 
picks up that 50 degree temperature and
now<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.010> gets<00:03:20.130> absorbed<00:03:20.310> into<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
now it gets absorbed into the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.070 
now it gets absorbed into the
refrigerant<00:03:21.180> now<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.570> refrigerant

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
refrigerant now and that refrigerant

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.780 
refrigerant now and that refrigerant
gets<00:03:22.140> compressed<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.950> get<00:03:23.100> really<00:03:23.459> hot<00:03:23.610> that

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
gets compressed and get really hot that

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.320 
gets compressed and get really hot that
50<00:03:24.150> can<00:03:24.360> be<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.810> 120<00:03:25.620> or<00:03:25.769> 130<00:03:26.220> degrees<00:03:26.670> so

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
50 can be a the 120 or 130 degrees so

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.120 
50 can be a the 120 or 130 degrees so
now<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.570> hotter<00:03:28.110> refrigerant<00:03:28.709> comes<00:03:28.860> over

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
now that hotter refrigerant comes over

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.540 
now that hotter refrigerant comes over
here<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.930> now<00:03:31.170> when<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.470> air<00:03:31.739> blows<00:03:32.040> across

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
here and now when that air blows across

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.910 
here and now when that air blows across
it<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.600> actually<00:03:33.780> heat<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.260> air<00:03:34.560> enough

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
it it can actually heat the air enough

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.430 
it it can actually heat the air enough
to<00:03:35.790> heat<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.120> building<00:03:36.290> refrigerant<00:03:37.290> gets

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
to heat the building refrigerant gets

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.530 
to heat the building refrigerant gets
cooler<00:03:37.860> goes<00:03:38.250> back<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.880> 50<00:03:39.180> degree<00:03:39.360> water

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
cooler goes back to that 50 degree water

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.330 
cooler goes back to that 50 degree water
picks<00:03:40.140> up<00:03:40.290> more<00:03:40.440> temperature<00:03:40.860> in<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.010> cycle

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
picks up more temperature in the cycle

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.100 
picks up more temperature in the cycle
continues<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.510> summer<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
continues in the summer just the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.080 
continues in the summer just the
opposite<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:44.070> picks<00:03:44.430> up<00:03:44.610> heat<00:03:44.820> from<00:03:44.970> inside

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
opposite it picks up heat from inside

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.360 
opposite it picks up heat from inside
the<00:03:45.450> building<00:03:45.600> now<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.470> takes<00:03:46.740> it<00:03:46.920> back<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.250> and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
the building now it takes it back in and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.070 
the building now it takes it back in and
dumps<00:03:47.580> all<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.060> heat<00:03:48.270> down<00:03:48.569> under<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
dumps all that heat down under the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.870 
dumps all that heat down under the
ground<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.620> back<00:03:50.130> into<00:03:50.370> another<00:03:50.640> well
