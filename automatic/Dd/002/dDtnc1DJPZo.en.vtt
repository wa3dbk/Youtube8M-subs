00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
about transferring files between ps3 say

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.539 
about transferring files between ps3 say
like<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.240> an<00:00:12.450> older<00:00:12.809> fat<00:00:13.559> ps3<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.429> it

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
like you have an older fat ps3 and it

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.910 
like you have an older fat ps3 and it
dies<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.780> get<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> new<00:00:16.260> slim<00:00:16.590> ps3

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
dies on you and you get a new slim ps3

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.160 
dies on you and you get a new slim ps3
and<00:00:17.900> you<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.230> take<00:00:19.500> all<00:00:19.680> your<00:00:19.859> data<00:00:21.170> from

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
one ps3 to the other this this is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
one ps3 to the other this this is
probably<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> good<00:00:29.400> reason

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
probably going going to be a good reason

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.860 
probably going going to be a good reason
to<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> backup<00:00:31.460> because<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.540> do

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to have a backup because the way you do

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.400 
to have a backup because the way you do
it<00:00:34.160> now<00:00:35.160> remember<00:00:37.760> when<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.899> hard<00:00:40.140> drive

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
it now remember when you the hard drive

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.490 
it now remember when you the hard drive
when<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> stick<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.149> save<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
when you stick a save like the one I

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.889 
when you stick a save like the one I
have<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.010> 80<00:00:44.250> gig<00:00:44.489> ps3<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:46.129> I<00:00:47.129> upgrade<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
have is an 80 gig ps3 and I upgrade to a

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
have is an 80 gig ps3 and I upgrade to a
320<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:50.309> big<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> hard<00:00:50.730> drive

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
320 which is how big the hard drive

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.810 
320 which is how big the hard drive
having<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.539> ps3<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> works<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
having this ps3 the way it works is that

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.220 
having this ps3 the way it works is that
whatever<00:00:56.820> hard<00:00:57.239> drive<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> put<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
whatever hard drive you put in there and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.250 
whatever hard drive you put in there and
you<00:00:58.620> use<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> ps3<00:00:59.520> they<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.690> only<00:01:00.870> work

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
you use in the ps3 they will only work

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
you use in the ps3 they will only work
in<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.680> particular<00:01:02.039> ps3<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.000> can't<00:01:06.689> take

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
in that particular ps3 so I can't take

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.020 
in that particular ps3 so I can't take
the<00:01:07.140> hard<00:01:07.350> drive<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.619> stick<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.369> another<00:01:08.670> ps3

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the hard drive out stick in another ps3

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
the hard drive out stick in another ps3
and<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.530> expect<00:01:10.950> everything<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> work

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and it's just expect everything to work

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
and it's just expect everything to work
what<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.540> happen<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> when<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> boot<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
what will happen is when you boot up the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.230 
what will happen is when you boot up the
ps3<00:01:14.810> what<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> does<00:01:16.220> remember<00:01:17.220> each<00:01:17.909> hard

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
ps3 what it does remember each hard

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.719 
ps3 what it does remember each hard
drive<00:01:18.509> has<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> unique<00:01:19.320> number<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.930> ps3

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
drive has a unique number so the ps3

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
drive has a unique number so the ps3
will<00:01:23.729> look<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> hard<00:01:24.570> drive<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
will look at the hard drive and if it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.960 
will look at the hard drive and if it
matches<00:01:26.150> it'll<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.299> start<00:01:27.420> loading<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
matches it'll just start loading up the

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.719 
matches it'll just start loading up the
files<00:01:29.970> that's<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.229> hard<00:01:31.409> drive<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
files that's on the hard drive if it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050 
files that's on the hard drive if it
doesn't<00:01:32.970> match<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> stop<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.130> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
doesn't match is going to stop and is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510 
doesn't match is going to stop and is
going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> ask<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.320> reformat<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> hard
