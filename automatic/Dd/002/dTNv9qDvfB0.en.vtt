00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.090
 basic active water is a functional water around the body 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.230
 to supply calorie-free bases and antioxidants in large quantities 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.279
 Since that should be bases balance in the body with increasing Malta anyway 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.609
 A compensation by this Perpetuum Mobile of deacidification is possible 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.289
 all the more recommendable the older man the 8 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.610
 in our experience round estimation is that 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 active bath water 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.550
 Indispensable as a therapy for the titles are the us rocker old it has 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.060
 a high priority also in prevention more with a prevention 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.480
 basic active water is not just a tool of the curator 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.670
 Supporting intensive deacidification Smart names like oxygen have cure there 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.900
 Renovation or fasting 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.760
 In Japan, for example, ten percent of all households are already home 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.390
 Use of untreated water strayed and have become home 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.299
 Electrolyser device purchased with which one can put here 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.330
 Such so-called water Leoni they are also available in models these days 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.910
 suitable for central European water conditions 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.380
 and can easily be connected to an existing water pipe 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.910
 But now from the first marriage with someone for a universal prescription over the 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.830
 Health is my answer very easy 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 sda they gained deep water at the BarÃŸeler they themselves are 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.320
 putting clean things is the most important thing is to start with the electrons as 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.100
 Nearly too much liquid to drink with it should be on district 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.800
 Bettany "Inkheart" thinks that it can also be neutralized 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.700
 special interests Germany possesses with the save now one gets 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.600
 quickly have a look what are 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.030
 Come on 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.600
 the saliva march safest 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.169
 and the youth wants 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.829
 tell us what's between blood and silk 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.829
 on road 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.009
 actually sits over 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.449
 with dapd 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.779
 now as with the kg 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.559
 Percent of July tickets 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.429
 not with the load-ekg AG 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.929
 One can of course also use the saliva test to process by adding two 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.129
 crap 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.439
 before and after a special charge 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.479
 In this case, I like doing that 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.809
 I have normal here at the beginning with an initial value 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.649
 Green blue and enriched 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:42.539
 Nice was the table so the saliva should show Claire and the PH 7 would then 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.349
 he ended my own Anna Haag not that it should not be natural 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.599
 The way everyone understands that it really is teen books 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.929
 Now here we see how the coffee a cash register 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.609
 GH value about five sorrows 5 No I measured it exactly 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.779
 dominated 5 4 5 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.059
 just like the capital 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.059
 Look, there is very sharp the clock 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.989
 of course, since Chambery immediately after the war went no impact 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:12.879
 the saliva 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.149
 In the graphic he needs to be first aid why should 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.619
 be resorbed pinched not-op 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.059
 Leech in the movie then is on the way and promised Â«They can tear themselves 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:23.939
 Indeed 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.759
 two hours later 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.779
 of course, the coffee does its effect to a very significant hurdles 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:30.209
 us great 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.219
 Imagine that was my pace 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.579
 the ph value falls into the acidic area 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.760
 and besides, the bandage in the case was me 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.839
 Percent feels limp 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:46.399
 that is now thrusts and then it makes you tired that is the effect of 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.749
 professional teams and that coffee is 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:52.749
 always with an overacidification 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.829
 Percent a good try to demonstrate how fast that actually works 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.799
 go with the alkaline water 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.339
 to restore the original state give the light because the alkaline water 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.409
 so fast 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.159
 through the digestive organs through 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.569
 also leads finds 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.909
 I get a clear passport here 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.909
 classic water ph value new comma 5 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.150
 five minutes later then on the measurement 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.559
 the saliva is giving it back 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.289
 and thus reached the ground for 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.689
 and I want to go back where 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:34.359
 Kidd left 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.690
 this shows the bags test test test book the Lebanese then serves 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.770
 No, they were still doing a Diessenhofen 500 minutes 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.600
 Earliest honking their mischief
