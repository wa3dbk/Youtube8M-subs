players this is on the pc team
deathmatch<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.920> assume<00:02:35.580> there's<00:02:35.940> got<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> team

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
deathmatch I assume there's got a team

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.420 
deathmatch I assume there's got a team
deathmatch<00:02:38.630> mission<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:40.110> time<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.220> get

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
deathmatch mission is it go time to get

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.070 
deathmatch mission is it go time to get
this<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.000> stand<00:02:42.270> stand<00:02:42.630> still<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.050> a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
this so you just stand stand still for a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.660 
this so you just stand stand still for a
while<00:02:43.140> that's<00:02:43.500> probably<00:02:43.800> him<00:02:43.980> enabling<00:02:44.490> his

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
while that's probably him enabling his

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.480 
while that's probably him enabling his
hacks

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:17.320 
I'm gonna speed us up now let's look at
this<00:03:15.340> let's<00:03:16.340> be<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.580> up<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.940> part<00:03:17.150> where<00:03:17.210> he

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
this let's be it up to the part where he

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.560 
this let's be it up to the part where he
gets<00:03:17.480> an<00:03:17.600> aesthetic<00:03:17.780> ill<00:03:18.260> sir<00:03:23.230> watch<00:03:24.230> this

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
gets an aesthetic ill sir watch this

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.480 
gets an aesthetic ill sir watch this
look<00:03:26.570> at<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.810> do<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.500> see<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:30.370> let's<00:03:31.370> take

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
look at that do you see that let's take

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.290 
look at that do you see that let's take
this<00:03:31.640> next<00:03:31.790> part<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.150> motion<00:03:33.160> all<00:03:34.160> right<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.760> he

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
this next part of motion all right so he

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.600 
this next part of motion all right so he
walks<00:03:35.510> in

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:51.620
